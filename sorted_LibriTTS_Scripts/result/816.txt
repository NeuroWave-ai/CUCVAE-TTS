GUTENBERG EBOOK DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA Vtwo Produced by David Reed and David Widger DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA By Alexis De Tocqueville Translated by Henry Reeve Book Two Influence Of Democracy On Progress Of Opinion In the United States De Tocqueville s Preface To The Second Part The Americans live in a democratic state of society which has naturally suggested to them certain laws and a certain political character This same state of society has moreover engendered amongst them a multitude of feelings and opinions which were unknown amongst the elder aristocratic communities of Europe it has destroyed or modified all the relations which before existed and established others of a novel kind The aspect of civil society has been no less affected by these changes than that of the political world The former subject has been treated of in the work on the Democracy of America which I published five years ago to examine the latter is the object of the present book but these two parts complete each other and form one and the same work I must at once warn the reader against an error which would be extremely prejudicial to me When he finds that I attribute so many different consequences to the principle of equality he may thence infer that I consider that principle to be the sole cause of all that takes place in the present age but this would be to impute to me a very narrow view A multitude of opinions feelings and propensities are now in existence which owe their origin to circumstances unconnected with or even contrary to the principle of equality Thus if I were to select the United States as an example I could easily prove that the nature of the country the origin of its inhabitants the religion of its founders their acquired knowledge and their former habits have exercised and still exercise independently of democracy a vast influence upon the thoughts and feelings of that people Different causes but no less distinct from the circumstance of the equality of conditions might be traced in Europe and would explain a great portion of the occurrences taking place amongst us I acknowledge the existence of all these different causes and their power but my subject does not lead me to treat of them I have not undertaken to unfold the reason of all our inclinations and all our notions my only object is to show in what respects the principle of equality has modified both the former and the latter Some readers may perhaps be astonished that firmly persuaded as I am that the democratic revolution which we are witnessing is an irresistible fact against which it would be neither desirable nor wise to struggle I should often have had occasion in this book to address language of such severity to those democratic communities which this revolution has brought into being My answer is simply that it is because I am not an adversary of democracy that I have sought to speak of democracy in all sincerity Men will not accept truth at the hands of their enemies and truth is seldom offered to them by their friends for this reason I have spoken it I was persuaded that many would take upon themselves to announce the new blessings which the principle of equality promises to mankind but that few would dare to point out from afar the dangers with which it threatens them To those perils therefore I have turned my chief attention and believing that I had discovered them clearly I have not had the cowardice to leave them untold I trust that my readers will find in this Second Part that impartiality which seems to have been remarked in the former work Placed as I am in the midst of the conflicting opinions between which we are divided I have endeavored to suppress within me for a time the favorable sympathies or the adverse emotions with which each of them inspires me If those who read this book can find a single sentence intended to flatter any of the great parties which have agitated my country or any of those petty factions which now harass and weaken it let such readers raise their voices to accuse me The subject I have sought to embrace is immense for it includes the greater part of the feelings and opinions to which the new state of society has given birth Such a subject is doubtless above my strength and in treating it I have not succeeded in satisfying myself But if I have not been able to reach the goal which I had in view my readers will at least do me the justice to acknowledge that I have conceived and followed up my undertaking in a spirit not unworthy of success A De T March eighteen forty Section I Influence of Democracy on the Action of Intellect in The United States Chapter I Philosophical Method Among the Americans I think that in no country in the civilized world is less attention paid to philosophy than in the United States The Americans have no philosophical school of their own and they care but little for all the schools into which Europe is divided the very names of which are scarcely known to them Nevertheless it is easy to perceive that almost all the inhabitants of the United States conduct their understanding in the same manner and govern it by the same rules that is to say that without ever having taken the trouble to define the rules of a philosophical method they are in possession of one common to the whole people To evade the bondage of system and habit of family maxims class opinions and in some degree of national prejudices to accept tradition only as a means of information and existing facts only as a lesson used in doing otherwise and doing better to seek the reason of things for one s self and in one s self alone to tend to results without being bound to means and to aim at the substance through the form such are the principal characteristics of what I shall call the philosophical method of the Americans But if I go further and if I seek amongst these characteristics that which predominates over and includes almost all the rest I discover that in most of the operations of the mind each American appeals to the individual exercise of his own understanding alone America is therefore one of the countries in the world where philosophy is least studied and where the precepts of Descartes are best applied Nor is this surprising The Americans do not read the works of Descartes because their social condition deters them from speculative studies but they follow his maxims because this very social condition naturally disposes their understanding to adopt them In the midst of the continual movement which agitates a democratic community the tie which unites one generation to another is relaxed or broken every man readily loses the trace of the ideas of his forefathers or takes no care about them Nor can men living in this state of society derive their belief from the opinions of the class to which they belong for so to speak there are no longer any classes or those which still exist are composed of such mobile elements that their body can never exercise a real control over its members As to the influence which the intelligence of one man has on that of another it must necessarily be very limited in a country where the citizens placed on the footing of a general similitude are all closely seen by each other and where as no signs of incontestable greatness or superiority are perceived in any one of them they are constantly brought back to their own reason as the most obvious and proximate source of truth It is not only confidence in this or that man which is then destroyed but the taste for trusting the ipse dixit of any man whatsoever Everyone shuts himself up in his own breast and affects from that point to judge the world The practice which obtains amongst the Americans of fixing the standard of their judgment in themselves alone leads them to other habits of mind As they perceive that they succeed in resolving without assistance all the little difficulties which their practical life presents they readily conclude that everything in the world may be explained and that nothing in it transcends the limits of the understanding Thus they fall to denying what they cannot comprehend which leaves them but little faith for whatever is extraordinary and an almost insurmountable distaste for whatever is supernatural As it is on their own testimony that they are accustomed to rely they like to discern the object which engages their attention with extreme clearness they therefore strip off as much as possible all that covers it they rid themselves of whatever separates them from it they remove whatever conceals it from sight in order to view it more closely and in the broad light of day This disposition of the mind soon leads them to contemn forms which they regard as useless and inconvenient veils placed between them and the truth The Americans then have not required to extract their philosophical method from books they have found it in themselves The same thing may be remarked in what has taken place in Europe This same method has only been established and made popular in Europe in proportion as the condition of society has become more equal and men have grown more like each other Let us consider for a moment the connection of the periods in which this change may be traced In the sixteenth century the Reformers subjected some of the dogmas of the ancient faith to the scrutiny of private judgment but they still withheld from it the judgment of all the rest In the seventeenth century Bacon in the natural sciences and Descartes in the study of philosophy in the strict sense of the term abolished recognized formulas destroyed the empire of tradition and overthrew the authority of the schools The philosophers of the eighteenth century generalizing at length the same principle undertook to submit to the private judgment of each man all the objects of his belief Who does not perceive that Luther Descartes and Voltaire employed the same method and that they differed only in the greater or less use which they professed should be made of it Why did the Reformers confine themselves so closely within the circle of religious ideas Why did Descartes choosing only to apply his method to certain matters though he had made it fit to be applied to all declare that men might judge for themselves in matters philosophical but not in matters political How happened it that in the eighteenth century those general applications were all at once drawn from this same method which Descartes and his predecessors had either not perceived or had rejected To what lastly is the fact to be attributed that at this period the method we are speaking of suddenly emerged from the schools to penetrate into society and become the common standard of intelligence and that after it had become popular among the French it has been ostensibly adopted or secretly followed by all the nations of Europe The philosophical method here designated may have been engendered in the sixteenth century it may have been more accurately defined and more extensively applied in the seventeenth but neither in the one nor in the other could it be commonly adopted Political laws the condition of society and the habits of mind which are derived from these causes were as yet opposed to it It was discovered at a time when men were beginning to equalize and assimilate their conditions It could only be generally followed in ages when those conditions had at length become nearly equal and men nearly alike The philosophical method of the eighteenth century is then not only French but it is democratic and this explains why it was so readily admitted throughout Europe where it has contributed so powerfully to change the face of society It is not because the French have changed their former opinions and altered their former manners that they have convulsed the world but because they were the first to generalize and bring to light a philosophical method by the assistance of which it became easy to attack all that was old and to open a path to all that was new If it be asked why at the present day this same method is more rigorously followed and more frequently applied by the French than by the Americans although the principle of equality be no less complete and of more ancient date amongst the latter people the fact may be attributed to two circumstances which it is essential to have clearly understood in the first instance It must never be forgotten that religion gave birth to Anglo American society In the United States religion is therefore commingled with all the habits of the nation and all the feelings of patriotism whence it derives a peculiar force To this powerful reason another of no less intensity may be added in American religion has as it were laid down its own limits Religious institutions have remained wholly distinct from political institutions so that former laws have been easily changed whilst former belief has remained unshaken Christianity has therefore retained a strong hold on the public mind in America and I would more particularly remark that its sway is not only that of a philosophical doctrine which has been adopted upon inquiry but of a religion which is believed without discussion In the United States Christian sects are infinitely diversified and perpetually modified but Christianity itself is a fact so irresistibly established that no one undertakes either to attack or to defend it The Americans having admitted the principal doctrines of the Christian religion without inquiry are obliged to accept in like manner a great number of moral truths originating in it and connected with it Hence the activity of individual analysis is restrained within narrow limits and many of the most important of human opinions are removed from the range of its influence The second circumstance to which I have alluded is the following the social condition and the constitution of the Americans are democratic but they have not had a democratic revolution They arrived upon the soil they occupy in nearly the condition in which we see them at the present day and this is of very considerable importance There are no revolutions which do not shake existing belief enervate authority and throw doubts over commonly received ideas The effect of all revolutions is therefore more or less to surrender men to their own guidance and to open to the mind of every man a void and almost unlimited range of speculation When equality of conditions succeeds a protracted conflict between the different classes of which the elder society was composed envy hatred and uncharitableness pride and exaggerated self confidence are apt to seize upon the human heart and plant their sway there for a time This independently of equality itself tends powerfully to divide men to lead them to mistrust the judgment of others and to seek the light of truth nowhere but in their own understandings Everyone then attempts to be his own sufficient guide and makes it his boast to form his own opinions on all subjects Men are no longer bound together by ideas but by interests and it would seem as if human opinions were reduced to a sort of intellectual dust scattered on every side unable to collect unable to cohere Thus that independence of mind which equality supposes to exist is never so great nor ever appears so excessive as at the time when equality is beginning to establish itself and in the course of that painful labor by which it is established That sort of intellectual freedom which equality may give ought therefore to be very carefully distinguished from the anarchy which revolution brings Each of these two things must be severally considered in order not to conceive exaggerated hopes or fears of the future I believe that the men who will live under the new forms of society will make frequent use of their private judgment but I am far from thinking that they will often abuse it This is attributable to a cause of more general application to all democratic countries and which in the long run must needs restrain in them the independence of individual speculation within fixed and sometimes narrow limits I shall proceed to point out this cause in the next chapter Chapter II Of The Principal Source Of Belief Among Democratic Nations At different periods dogmatical belief is more or less abundant It arises in different ways and it may change its object or its form but under no circumstances will dogmatical belief cease to exist or in other words men will never cease to entertain some implicit opinions without trying them by actual discussion If everyone undertook to form his own opinions and to seek for truth by isolated paths struck out by himself alone it is not to be supposed that any considerable number of men would ever unite in any common belief But obviously without such common belief no society can prosper say rather no society can subsist for without ideas held in common there is no common action and without common action there may still be men but there is no social body In order that society should exist and a fortiori that a society should prosper it is required that all the minds of the citizens should be rallied and held together by certain predominant ideas and this cannot be the case unless each of them sometimes draws his opinions from the common source and consents to accept certain matters of belief at the hands of the community If I now consider man in his isolated capacity I find that dogmatical belief is not less indispensable to him in order to live alone than it is to enable him to company operate with his fellow creatures If man were forced to demonstrate to himself all the truths of which he makes daily use his task would never end He would exhaust his strength in preparatory exercises without advancing beyond them As from the shortness of his life he has not the time nor from the limits of his intelligence the capacity to accomplish this he is reduced to take upon trust a number of facts and opinions which he has not had either the time or the power to verify himself but which men of greater ability have sought out or which the world adopts On this groundwork he raises for himself the structure of his own thoughts nor is he led to proceed in this manner by choice so much as he is constrained by the inflexible law of his condition There is no philosopher of such great parts in the world but that he believes a million of things on the faith of other people and supposes a great many more truths than he demonstrates This is not only necessary but desirable A man who should undertake to inquire into everything for himself could devote to each thing but little time and attention His task would keep his mind in perpetual unrest which would prevent him from penetrating to the depth of any truth or of grappling his mind indissolubly to any conviction His intellect would be at once independent and powerless He must therefore make his choice from amongst the various objects of human belief and he must adopt many opinions without discussion in order to search the better into that smaller number which he sets apart for investigation It is true that whoever receives an opinion on the word of another does so far enslave his mind but it is a salutary servitude which allows him to make a good use of freedom A principle of authority must then always occur under all circumstances in some part or other of the moral and intellectual world Its place is variable but a place it necessarily has The independence of individual minds may be greater or it may be less unbounded it cannot be Thus the question is not to know whether any intellectual authority exists in the ages of democracy but simply where it resides and by what standard it is to be measured I have shown in the preceding chapter how the equality of conditions leads men to entertain a sort of instinctive incredulity of the supernatural and a very lofty and often exaggerated opinion of the human understanding The men who live at a period of social equality are not therefore easily led to place that intellectual authority to which they bow either beyond or above humanity They commonly seek for the sources of truth in themselves or in those who are like themselves This would be enough to prove that at such periods no new religion could be established and that all schemes for such a purpose would be not only impious but absurd and irrational It may be foreseen that a democratic people will not easily give credence to divine missions that they will turn modern prophets to a ready jest and they that will seek to discover the chief arbiter of their belief within and not beyond the limits of their kind When the ranks of society are unequal and men unlike each other in condition there are some individuals invested with all the power of superior intelligence learning and enlightenment whilst the multitude is sunk in ignorance and prejudice Men living at these aristocratic periods are therefore naturally induced to shape their opinions by the superior standard of a person or a class of persons whilst they are averse to recognize the infallibility of the mass of the people The contrary takes place in ages of equality The nearer the citizens are drawn to the common level of an equal and similar condition the less prone does each man become to place implicit faith in a certain man or a certain class of men But his readiness to believe the multitude increases and opinion is more than ever mistress of the world Not only is common opinion the only guide which private judgment retains amongst a democratic people but amongst such a people it possesses a power infinitely beyond what it has elsewhere At periods of equality men have no faith in one another by reason of their common resemblance but this very resemblance gives them almost unbounded confidence in the judgment of the public for it would not seem probable as they are all endowed with equal means of judging but that the greater truth should go with the greater number When the inhabitant of a democratic country compares himself individually with all those about him he feels with pride that he is the equal of any one of them but when he comes to survey the totality of his fellows and to place himself in contrast to so huge a body he is instantly overwhelmed by the sense of his own insignificance and weakness The same equality which renders him independent of each of his fellow citizens taken severally exposes him alone and unprotected to the influence of the greater number The public has therefore among a democratic people a singular power of which aristocratic nations could never so much as conceive an idea for it does not persuade to certain opinions but it enforces them and infuses them into the faculties by a sort of enormous pressure of the minds of all upon the reason of each In the United States the majority undertakes to supply a multitude of ready made opinions for the use of individuals who are thus relieved from the necessity of forming opinions of their own Everybody there adopts great numbers of theories on philosophy morals and politics without inquiry upon public trust and if we look to it very narrowly it will be perceived that religion herself holds her sway there much less as a doctrine of revelation than as a commonly received opinion The fact that the political laws of the Americans are such that the majority rules the community with sovereign sway materially increases the power which that majority naturally exercises over the mind For nothing is more customary in man than to recognize superior wisdom in the person of his oppressor This political omnipotence of the majority in the United States doubtless augments the influence which public opinion would obtain without it over the mind of each member of the community but the foundations of that influence do not rest upon it They must be sought for in the principle of equality itself not in the more or less popular institutions which men living under that condition may give themselves The intellectual dominion of the greater number would probably be less absolute amongst a democratic people governed by a king than in the sphere of a pure democracy but it will always be extremely absolute and by whatever political laws men are governed in the ages of equality it may be foreseen that faith in public opinion will become a species of religion there and the majority its ministering prophet Thus intellectual authority will be different but it will not be diminished and far from thinking that it will disappear I augur that it may readily acquire too much preponderance and confine the action of private judgment within narrower limits than are suited either to the greatness or the happiness of the human race In the principle of equality I very clearly discern two tendencies the one leading the mind of every man to untried thoughts the other inclined to prohibit him from thinking at all And I perceive how under the dominion of certain laws democracy would extinguish that liberty of the mind to which a democratic social condition is favorable so that after having broken all the bondage once imposed on it by ranks or by men the human mind would be closely fettered to the general will of the greatest number If the absolute power of the majority were to be substituted by democratic nations for all the different powers which checked or retarded overmuch the energy of individual minds the evil would only have changed its symptoms Men would not have found the means of independent life they would simply have invented no easy task a new dress for servitude There is and I cannot repeat it too often there is in this matter for profound reflection for those who look on freedom as a holy thing and who hate not only the despot but despotism For myself when I feel the hand of power lie heavy on my brow I care but little to know who oppresses me and I am not the more disposed to pass beneath the yoke because it is held out to me by the arms of a million of men Chapter III Why The Americans Display More Readiness And More Taste For General Ideas Than Their Forefathers The English The Deity does not regard the human race collectively He surveys at one glance and severally all the beings of whom mankind is composed and he discerns in each man the resemblances which assimilate him to all his fellows and the differences which distinguish him from them God therefore stands in no need of general ideas that is to say he is never sensible of the necessity of collecting a considerable number of analogous objects under the same form for greater convenience in thinking Such is however not the case with man If the human mind were to attempt to examine and pass a judgment on all the individual cases before it the immensity of detail would soon lead it astray and bewilder its discernment in this strait man has recourse to an imperfect but necessary expedient which at once assists and demonstrates his weakness Having superficially considered a certain number of objects and remarked their resemblance he assigns to them a common name sets them apart and proceeds onwards General ideas are no proof of the strength but rather of the insufficiency of the human intellect for there are in nature no beings exactly alike no things precisely identical nor any rules indiscriminately and alike applicable to several objects at once The chief merit of general ideas is that they enable the human mind to pass a rapid judgment on a great many objects at once but on the other hand the notions they convey are never otherwise than incomplete and they always cause the mind to lose as much in accuracy as it gains in comprehensiveness As social bodies advance in civilization they acquire the knowledge of new facts and they daily lay hold almost unconsciously of some particular truths The more truths of this kind a man apprehends the more general ideas is he naturally led to conceive A multitude of particular facts cannot be seen separately without at last discovering the common tie which connects them Several individuals lead to the perception of the species several species to that of the genus Hence the habit and the taste for general ideas will always be greatest amongst a people of ancient cultivation and extensive knowledge But there are other reasons which impel men to generalize their ideas or which restrain them from it The Americans are much more addicted to the use of general ideas than the English and entertain a much greater relish for them this appears very singular at first sight when it is remembered that the two nations have the same origin that they lived for centuries under the same laws and that they still incessantly interchange their opinions and their manners This contrast becomes much more striking still if we fix our eyes on our own part of the world and compare together the two most enlightened nations which inhabit it It would seem as if the mind of the English could only tear itself reluctantly and painfully away from the observation of particular facts to rise from them to their causes and that it only generalizes in spite of itself Amongst the French on the contrary the taste for general ideas would seem to have grown to so ardent a passion that it must be satisfied on every occasion I am informed every morning when I wake that some general and eternal law has just been discovered which I never heard mentioned before There is not a mediocre scribbler who does not try his hand at discovering truths applicable to a great kingdom and who is very ill pleased with himself if he does not succeed in compressing the human race into the compass of an article So great a dissimilarity between two very enlightened nations surprises me If I again turn my attention to England and observe the events which have occurred there in the last half century I think I may affirm that a taste for general ideas increases in that country in proportion as its ancient constitution is weakened The state of civilization is therefore insufficient by itself to explain what suggests to the human mind the love of general ideas or diverts it from them When the conditions of men are very unequal and inequality itself is the permanent state of society individual men gradually become so dissimilar that each class assumes the aspect of a distinct race only one of these classes is ever in view at the same instant and losing sight of that general tie which binds them all within the vast bosom of mankind the observation invariably rests not on man but on certain men Those who live in this aristocratic state of society never therefore conceive very general ideas respecting themselves and that is enough to imbue them with an habitual distrust of such ideas and an instinctive aversion of them He on the contrary who inhabits a democratic country sees around him one very hand men differing but little from each other he cannot turn his mind to any one portion of mankind without expanding and dilating his thought till it embrace the whole All the truths which are applicable to himself appear to him equally and similarly applicable to each of his fellow citizens and fellow men Having contracted the habit of generalizing his ideas in the study which engages him most and interests him more than others he transfers the same habit to all his pursuits and thus it is that the craving to discover general laws in everything to include a great number of objects under the same formula and to explain a mass of facts by a single cause becomes an ardent and sometimes an undiscerning passion in the human mind Nothing shows the truth of this proposition more clearly than the opinions of the ancients respecting their slaves The most profound and capacious minds of Rome and Greece were never able to reach the idea at once so general and so simple of the common likeness of men and of the common birthright of each to freedom they strove to prove that slavery was in the order of nature and that it would always exist Nay more everything shows that those of the ancients who had passed from the servile to the free condition many of whom have left us excellent writings did themselves regard servitude in no other light All the great writers of antiquity belonged to the aristocracy of masters or at least they saw that aristocracy established and uncontested before their eyes Their mind after it had expanded itself in several directions was barred from further progress in this one and the advent of Jesus Christ upon earth was required to teach that all the members of the human race are by nature equal and alike In the ages of equality all men are independent of each other isolated and weak The movements of the multitude are not permanently guided by the will of any individuals at such times humanity seems always to advance of itself In order therefore to explain what is passing in the world man is driven to seek for some great causes which acting in the same manner on all our fellow creatures thus impel them all involuntarily to pursue the same track This again naturally leads the human mind to conceive general ideas and superinduces a taste for them I have already shown in what way the equality of conditions leads every man to investigate truths for himself It may readily be perceived that a method of this kind must insensibly beget a tendency to general ideas in the human mind When I repudiate the traditions of rank profession and birth when I escape from the authority of example to seek out by the single effort of my reason the path to be followed I am inclined to derive the motives of my opinions from human nature itself which leads me necessarily and almost unconsciously to adopt a great number of very general notions All that I have here said explains the reasons for which the English display much less readiness and taste or the generalization of ideas than their American progeny and still less again than their French neighbors and likewise the reason for which the English of the present day display more of these qualities than their forefathers did The English have long been a very enlightened and a very aristocratic nation their enlightened condition urged them constantly to generalize and their aristocratic habits confined them to particularize Hence arose that philosophy at once bold and timid broad and narrow which has hitherto prevailed in England and which still obstructs and stagnates in so many minds in that country Independently of the causes I have pointed out in what goes before others may be discerned less apparent but no less efficacious which engender amongst almost every democratic people a taste and frequently a passion for general ideas An accurate distinction must be taken between ideas of this kind Some are the result of slow minute and conscientious labor of the mind and these extend the sphere of human knowledge others spring up at once from the first rapid exercise of the wits and beget none but very superficial and very uncertain notions Men who live in ages of equality have a great deal of curiosity and very little leisure their life is so practical so confused so excited so active that but little time remains to them for thought Such men are prone to general ideas because they spare them the trouble of studying particulars they contain if I may so speak a great deal in a little compass and give in a little time a great return If then upon a brief and inattentive investigation a common relation is thought to be detected between certain obtects inquiry is not pushed any further and without examining in detail how far these different objects differ or agree they are hastily arranged under one formulary in order to pass to another subject One of the distinguishing characteristics of a democratic period is the taste all men have at such ties for easy success and present enjoyment This occurs in the pursuits of the intellect as well as in all others Most of those who live at a time of equality are full of an ambition at once aspiring and relaxed they would fain succeed brilliantly and at once but they would be dispensed from great efforts to obtain success These conflicting tendencies lead straight to the research of general ideas by aid of which they flatter themselves that they can figure very importantly at a small expense and draw the attention of the public with very little trouble And I know not whether they be wrong in thinking thus For their readers are as much averse to investigating anything to the bottom as they can be themselves and what is generally sought in the productions of the mind is easy pleasure and information without labor If aristocratic nations do not make sufficient use of general ideas and frequently treat them with inconsiderate disdain it is true on the other hand that a democratic people is ever ready to carry ideas of this kind to excess and to espouse the with injudicious warmth Chapter IV Why The Americans Have Never Been So Eager As The French For General Ideas In Political Matters I observed in the last chapter that the Americans show a less decided taste for general ideas than the French this is more especially true in political matters Although the Americans infuse into their legislation infinitely more general ideas than the English and although they pay much more attention than the latter people to the adjustment of the practice of affairs to theory no political bodies in the United States have ever shown so warm an attachment to general ideas as the Constituent Assembly and the Convention in France At no time has the American people laid hold on ideas of this kind with the passionate energy of the French people in the eighteenth century or displayed the same blind confidence in the value and absolute truth of any theory This difference between the Americans and the French originates in several causes but principally in the following one The Americans form a democratic people which has always itself directed public affairs The French are a democratic people who for a long time could only speculate on the best manner of conducting them The social condition of France led that people to conceive very general ideas on the subject of government whilst its political constitution prevented it from correcting those ideas by experiment and from gradually detecting their insufficiency whereas in America the two things constantly balance and correct each other It may seem at first sight that this is very much opposed to what I have said before that democratic nations derive their love of theory from the excitement of their active life A more attentive examination will show that there is nothing contradictory in the proposition Men living in democratic countries eagerly lay hold of general ideas because they have but little leisure and because these ideas spare them the trouble of studying particulars This is true but it is only to be understood to apply to those matters which are not the necessary and habitual subjects of their thoughts Mercantile men will take up very eagerly and without any very close scrutiny all the general ideas on philosophy politics science or the arts which may be presented to them but for such as relate to commerce they will not receive them without inquiry or adopt them without reserve The same thing applies to statesmen with regard to general ideas in politics If then there be a subject upon which a democratic people is peculiarly liable to abandon itself blindly and extravagantly to general ideas the best corrective that can be used will be to make that subject a part of the daily practical occupation of that people The people will then be compelled to enter upon its details and the details will teach them the weak points of the theory This remedy may frequently be a painful one but its effect is certain Thus it happens that the democratic institutions which compel every citizen to take a practical part in the government moderate that excessive taste for general theories in politics which the principle of equality suggests Chapter V Of The Manner In Which Religion In The United States Avails Itself Of Democratic Tendencies I have laid it down in a preceding chapter that men cannot do without dogmatical belief and even that it is very much to be desired that such belief should exist amongst them I now add that of all the kinds of dogmatical belief the most desirable appears to me to be dogmatical belief in matters of religion and this is a very clear inference even from no higher consideration than the interests of this world There is hardly any human action however particular a character be assigned to it which does not originate in some very general idea men have conceived of the Deity of his relation to mankind of the nature of their own souls and of their duties to their fellow creatures Nor can anything prevent these ideas from being the common spring from which everything else emanates Men are therefore immeasurably interested in acquiring fixed ideas of God of the soul and of their common duties to their Creator and to their fellow men for doubt on these first principles would abandon all their actions to the impulse of chance and would condemn them to live to a certain extent powerless and undisciplined This is then the subject on which it is most important for each of us to entertain fixed ideas and unhappily it is also the subject on which it is most difficult for each of us left to himself to settle his opinions by the sole force of his reason None but minds singularly free from the ordinary anxieties of life minds at once penetrating subtle and trained by thinking can even with the assistance of much time and care sound the depth of these most necessary truths And indeed we see that these philosophers are themselves almost always enshrouded in uncertainties that at every step the natural light which illuminates their path grows dimmer and less secure and that in spite of all their efforts they have as yet only discovered a small number of conflicting notions on which the mind of man has been tossed about for thousands of years without either laying a firmer grasp on truth or finding novelty even in its errors Studies of this nature are far above the average capacity of men and even if the majority of mankind were capable of such pursuits it is evident that leisure to cultivate them would still be wanting Fixed ideas of God and human nature are indispensable to the daily practice of men s lives but the practice of their lives prevents them from acquiring such ideas The difficulty appears to me to be without a parallel Amongst the sciences there are some which are useful to the mass of mankind and which are within its reach others can only be approached by the few and are not cultivated by the many who require nothing beyond their more remote applications but the daily practice of the science I speak of is indispensable to all although the study of it is inaccessible to the far greater number General ideas respecting God and human nature are therefore the ideas above all others which it is most suitable to withdraw from the habitual action of private judgment and in which there is most to gain and least to lose by recognizing a principle of authority The first object and one of the principal advantages of religions is to furnish to each of these fundamental questions a solution which is at once clear precise intelligible to the mass of mankind and lasting There are religions which are very false and very absurd but it may be affirmed that any religion which remains within the circle I have just traced without aspiring to go beyond it as many religions have attempted to do for the purpose of enclosing on every side the free progress of the human mind imposes a salutary restraint on the intellect and it must be admitted that if it do not save men in another world such religion is at least very conducive to their happiness and their greatness in this This is more especially true of men living in free countries When the religion of a people is destroyed doubt gets hold of the highest portions of the intellect and half paralyzes all the rest of its powers Every man accustoms himself to entertain none but confused and changing notions on the subjects most interesting to his fellow creatures and himself His opinions are ill defended and easily abandoned and despairing of ever resolving by himself the hardest problems of the destiny of man he ignobly submits to think no more about them Such a condition cannot but enervate the soul relax the springs of the will and prepare a people for servitude Nor does it only happen in such a case that they allow their freedom to be wrested from them they frequently themselves surrender it When there is no longer any principle of authority in religion any more than in politics men are speedily frightened at the aspect of this unbounded independence The constant agitation of all surrounding things alarms and exhausts them As everything is at sea in the sphere of the intellect they determine at least that the mechanism of society should be firm and fixed and as they cannot resume their ancient belief they assume a master For my own part I doubt whether man can ever support at the same time complete religious independence and entire public freedom And I am inclined to think that if faith be wanting in him he must serve and if he be free he must believe Perhaps however this great utility of religions is still more obvious amongst nations where equality of conditions prevails than amongst others It must be acknowledged that equality which brings great benefits into the world nevertheless suggests to men as will be shown hereafter some very dangerous propensities It tends to isolate them from each other to concentrate every man s attention upon himself and it lays open the soul to an inordinate love of material gratification The greatest advantage of religion is to inspire diametrically contrary principles There is no religion which does not place the object of man s desires above and beyond the treasures of earth and which does not naturally raise his soul to regions far above those of the senses Nor is there any which does not impose on man some sort of duties to his kind and thus draws him at times from the contemplation of himself This occurs in religions the most false and dangerous Religious nations are therefore naturally strong on the very point on which democratic nations are weak which shows of what importance it is for men to preserve their religion as their conditions become more equal I have neither the right nor the intention of examining the supernatural means which God employs to infuse religious belief into the heart of man I am at this moment considering religions in a purely human point of view my object is to inquire by what means they may most easily retain their sway in the democratic ages upon which we are entering It has been shown that at times of general cultivation and equality the human mind does not consent to adopt dogmatical opinions without reluctance and feels their necessity acutely in spiritual matters only This proves in the first place that at such times religions ought more cautiously than at any other to confine themselves within their own precincts for in seeking to extend their power beyond religious matters they incur a risk of not being believed at all The circle within which they seek to bound the human intellect ought therefore to be carefully traced and beyond its verge the mind should be left in entire freedom to its own guidance Mahommed professed to derive from Heaven and he has inserted in the Koran not only a body of religious doctrines but political maxims civil and criminal laws and theories of science The gospel on the contrary only speaks of the general relations of men to God and to each other beyond which it inculcates and imposes no point of faith This alone besides a thousand other reasons would suffice to prove that the former of these religions will never long predominate in a cultivated and democratic age whilst the latter is destined to retain its sway at these as at all other periods But in continuation of this branch of the subject I find that in order for religions to maintain their authority humanly speaking in democratic ages they must not only confine themselves strictly within the circle of spiritual matters their power also depends very much on the nature of the belief they inculcate on the external forms they assume and on the obligations they impose The preceding observation that equality leads men to very general and very extensive notions is principally to be understood as applied to the question of religion Men living in a similar and equal condition in the world readily conceive the idea of the one God governing every man by the same laws and granting to every man future happiness on the same conditions The idea of the unity of mankind constantly leads them back to the idea of the unity of the Creator whilst on the contrary in a state of society where men are broken up into very unequal ranks they are apt to devise as many deities as there are nations castes classes or families and to trace a thousand private roads to heaven It cannot be denied that Christianity itself has felt to a certain extent the influence which social and political conditions exercise on religious opinions At the epoch at which the Christian religion appeared upon earth Providence by whom the world was doubtless prepared for its coming had gathered a large portion of the human race like an immense flock under the sceptre of the Caesars The men of whom this multitude was composed were distinguished by numerous differences but they had thus much in common that they all obeyed the same laws and that every subject was so weak and insignificant in relation to the imperial potentate that all appeared equal when their condition was contrasted with his This novel and peculiar state of mankind necessarily predisposed men to listen to the general truths which Christianity teaches and may serve to explain the facility and rapidity with which they then penetrated into the human mind The counterpart of this state of things was exhibited after the destruction of the empire The Roman world being then as it were shattered into a thousand fragments each nation resumed its pristine individuality An infinite scale of ranks very soon grew up in the bosom of these nations the different races were more sharply defined and each nation was divided by castes into several peoples In the midst of this common effort which seemed to be urging human society to the greatest conceivable amount of voluntary subdivision Christianity did not lose sight of the leading general ideas which it had brought into the world But it appeared nevertheless to lend itself as much as was possible to those new tendencies to which the fractional distribution of mankind had given birth Men continued to worship an only God the Creator and Preserver of all things but every people every city and so to speak every man thought to obtain some distinct privilege and win the favor of an especial patron at the foot of the Throne of Grace Unable to subdivide the Deity they multiplied and improperly enhanced the importance of the divine agents The homage due to saints and angels became an almost idolatrous worship amongst the majority of the Christian world and apprehensions might be entertained for a moment lest the religion of Christ should retrograde towards the superstitions which it had subdued It seems evident that the more the barriers are removed which separate nation from nation amongst mankind and citizen from citizen amongst a people the stronger is the bent of the human mind as if by its own impulse towards the idea of an only and all powerful Being dispensing equal laws in the same manner to every man In democratic ages then it is more particularly important not to allow the homage paid to secondary agents to be confounded with the worship due to the Creator alone Another truth is no less clear that religions ought to assume fewer external observances in democratic periods than at any others In speaking of philosophical method among the Americans I have shown that nothing is more repugnant to the human mind in an age of equality than the idea of subjection to forms Men living at such times are impatient of figures to their eyes symbols appear to be the puerile artifice which is used to conceal or to set off truths which should more naturally be bared to the light of open day they are unmoved by ceremonial observances and they are predisposed to attach a secondary importance to the details of public worship Those whose care it is to regulate the external forms of religion in a democratic age should pay a close attention to these natural propensities of the human mind in order not unnecessarily to run counter to them I firmly believe in the necessity of forms which fix the human mind in the contemplation of abstract truths and stimulate its ardor in the pursuit of them whilst they invigorate its powers of retaining them steadfastly Nor do I suppose that it is possible to maintain a religion without external observances but on the other hand I am persuaded that in the ages upon which we are entering it would be peculiarly dangerous to multiply them beyond measure and that they ought rather to be limited to as much as is absolutely necessary to perpetuate the doctrine itself which is the substance of religions of which the ritual is only the form a A religion which should become more minute more peremptory and more surcharged with small observances at a time in which men are becoming more equal would soon find itself reduced to a band of fanatical zealots in the midst of an infidel people Footnote a In all religions there are some ceremonies which are inherent in the substance of the faith itself and in these nothing should on any account be changed This is especially the case with Roman Catholicism in which the doctrine and the form are frequently so closely united as to form one point of belief I anticipate the objection that as all religions have general and eternal truths for their object they cannot thus shape themselves to the shifting spirit of every age without forfeiting their claim to certainty in the eyes of mankind To this I reply again that the principal opinions which constitute belief and which theologians call articles of faith must be very carefully distinguished from the accessories connected with them Religions are obliged to hold fast to the former whatever be the peculiar spirit of the age but they should take good care not to bind themselves in the same manner to the latter at a time when everything is in transition and when the mind accustomed to the moving pageant of human affairs reluctantly endures the attempt to fix it to any given point The fixity of external and secondary things can only afford a chance of duration when civil society is itself fixed under any other circumstances I hold it to be perilous We shall have occasion to see that of all the passions which originate in or are fostered by equality there is one which it renders peculiarly intense and which it infuses at the same time into the heart of every man I mean the love of well being The taste for well being is the prominent and indelible feature of democratic ages It may be believed that a religion which should undertake to destroy so deep seated a passion would meet its own destruction thence in the end and if it attempted to wean men entirely from the contemplation of the good things of this world in order to devote their faculties exclusively to the thought of another it may be foreseen that the soul would at length escape from its grasp to plunge into the exclusive enjoyment of present and material pleasures The chief concern of religions is to purify to regulate and to restrain the excessive and exclusive taste for well being which men feel at periods of equality but they would err in attempting to control it completely or to eradicate it They will not succeed in curing men of the love of riches but they may still persuade men to enrich themselves by none but honest means This brings me to a final consideration which comprises as it were all the others The more the conditions of men are equalized and assimilated to each other the more important is it for religions whilst they carefully abstain from the daily turmoil of secular affairs not needlessly to run counter to the ideas which generally prevail and the permanent interests which exist in the mass of the people For as public opinion grows to be more and more evidently the first and most irresistible of existing powers the religious principle has no external support strong enough to enable it long to resist its attacks This is not less true of a democratic people ruled by a despot than in a republic In ages of equality kings may often command obedience but the majority always commands belief to the majority therefore deference is to be paid in whatsoever is not contrary to the faith I showed in my former volumes how the American clergy stand aloof from secular affairs This is the most obvious but it is not the only example of their self restraint In America religion is a distinct sphere in which the priest is sovereign but out of which he takes care never to go Within its limits he is the master of the mind beyond them he leaves men to themselves and surrenders them to the independence and instability which belong to their nature and their age I have seen no country in which Christianity is clothed with fewer forms figures and observances than in the United States or where it presents more distinct more simple or more general notions to the mind Although the Christians of America are divided into a multitude of sects they all look upon their religion in the same light This applies to Roman Catholicism as well as to the other forms of belief There are no Romish priests who show less taste for the minute individual observances for extraordinary or peculiar means of salvation or who cling more to the spirit and less to the letter of the law than the Roman Catholic priests of the United States Nowhere is that doctrine of the Church which prohibits the worship reserved to God alone from being offered to the saints more clearly inculcated or more generally followed Yet the Roman Catholics of America are very submissive and very sincere Another remark is applicable to the clergy of every communion The American ministers of the gospel do not attempt to draw or to fix all the thoughts of man upon the life to come they are willing to surrender a portion of his heart to the cares of the present seeming to consider the goods of this world as important although as secondary objects If they take no part themselves in productive labor they are at least interested in its progression and ready to applaud its results and whilst they never cease to point to the other world as the great object of the hopes and fears of the believer they do not forbid him honestly to court prosperity in this Far from attempting to show that these things are distinct and contrary to one another they study rather to find out on what point they are most nearly and closely connected All the American clergy know and respect the intellectual supremacy exercised by the majority they never sustain any but necessary conflicts with it They take no share in the altercations of parties but they readily adopt the general opinions of their country and their age and they allow themselves to be borne away without opposition in the current of feeling and opinion by which everything around them is carried along They endeavor to amend their contemporaries but they do not quit fellowship with them Public opinion is therefore never hostile to them it rather supports and protects them and their belief owes its authority at the same time to the strength which is its own and to that which they borrow from the opinions of the majority Thus it is that by respecting all democratic tendencies not absolutely contrary to herself and by making use of several of them for her own purposes religion sustains an advantageous struggle with that spirit of individual independence which is her most dangerous antagonist Chapter VI Of The Progress Of Roman Catholicism In The United States America is the most democratic country in the world and it is at the same time according to reports worthy of belief the country in which the Roman Catholic religion makes most progress At first sight this is surprising Two things must here be accurately distinguished equality inclines men to wish to form their own opinions but on the other hand it imbues them with the taste and the idea of unity simplicity and impartiality in the power which governs society Men living in democratic ages are therefore very prone to shake off all religious authority but if they consent to subject themselves to any authority of this kind they choose at least that it should be single and uniform Religious powers not radiating from a common centre are naturally repugnant to their minds and they almost as readily conceive that there should be no religion as that there should be several At the present time more than in any preceding one Roman Catholics are seen to lapse into infidelity and Protestants to be converted to Roman Catholicism If the Roman Catholic faith be considered within the pale of the church it would seem to be losing ground without that pale to be gaining it Nor is this circumstance difficult of explanation The men of our days are naturally disposed to believe but as soon as they have any religion they immediately find in themselves a latent propensity which urges them unconsciously towards Catholicism Many of the doctrines and the practices of the Romish Church astonish them but they feel a secret admiration for its discipline and its great unity attracts them If Catholicism could at length withdraw itself from the political animosities to which it has given rise I have hardly any doubt but that the same spirit of the age which appears to be so opposed to it would become so favorable as to admit of its great and sudden advancement One of the most ordinary weaknesses of the human intellect is to seek to reconcile contrary principles and to purchase peace at the expense of logic Thus there have ever been and will ever be men who after having submitted some portion of their religious belief to the principle of authority will seek to exempt several other parts of their faith from its influence and to keep their minds floating at random between liberty and obedience But I am inclined to believe that the number of these thinkers will be less in democratic than in other ages and that our posterity will tend more and more to a single division into two parts some relinquishing Christianity entirely and others returning to the bosom of the Church of Rome Chapter VII Of The Cause Of A Leaning To Pantheism Amongst Democratic Nations I shall take occasion hereafter to show under what form the preponderating taste of a democratic people for very general ideas manifests itself in politics but I would point out at the present stage of my work its principal effect on philosophy It cannot be denied that pantheism has made great progress in our age The writings of a part of Europe bear visible marks of it the Germans introduce it into philosophy and the French into literature Most of the works of imagination published in France contain some opinions or some tinge caught from pantheistical doctrines or they disclose some tendency to such doctrines in their authors This appears to me not only to proceed from an accidental but from a permanent cause When the conditions of society are becoming more equal and each individual man becomes more like all the rest more weak and more insignificant a habit grows up of ceasing to notice the citizens to consider only the people and of overlooking individuals to think only of their kind At such times the human mind seeks to embrace a multitude of different objects at once and it constantly strives to succeed in connecting a variety of consequences with a single cause The idea of unity so possesses itself of man and is sought for by him so universally that if he thinks he has found it he readily yields himself up to repose in that belief Nor does he content himself with the discovery that nothing is in the world but a creation and a Creator still embarrassed by this primary division of things he seeks to expand and to simplify his conception by including God and the universe in one great whole If there be a philosophical system which teaches that all things material and immaterial visible and invisible which the world contains are only to be considered as the several parts of an immense Being which alone remains unchanged amidst the continual change and ceaseless transformation of all that constitutes it we may readily infer that such a system although it destroy the individuality of man nay rather because it destroys that individuality will have secret charms for men living in democracies All their habits of thought prepare them to conceive it and predispose them to adopt it It naturally attracts and fixes their imagination it fosters the pride whilst it soothes the indolence of their minds Amongst the different systems by whose aid philosophy endeavors to explain the universe I believe pantheism to be one of those most fitted to seduce the human mind in democratic ages Against it all who abide in their attachment to the true greatness of man should struggle and combine Chapter VIII The Principle Of Equality Suggests To The Americans The Idea Of The Indefinite Perfectibility Of Man Equality suggests to the human mind several ideas which would not have originated from any other source and it modifies almost all those previously entertained I take as an example the idea of human perfectibility because it is one of the principal notions that the intellect can conceive and because it constitutes of itself a great philosophical theory which is every instant to be traced by its consequences in the practice of human affairs Although man has many points of resemblance with the brute creation one characteristic is peculiar to himself he improves they are incapable of improvement Mankind could not fail to discover this difference from its earliest period The idea of perfectibility is therefore as old as the world equality did not give birth to it although it has imparted to it a novel character When the citizens of a community are classed according to their rank their profession or their birth and when all men are constrained to follow the career which happens to open before them everyone thinks that the utmost limits of human power are to be discerned in proximity to himself and none seeks any longer to resist the inevitable law of his destiny Not indeed that an aristocratic people absolutely contests man s faculty of self improvement but they do not hold it to be indefinite amelioration they conceive but not change they imagine that the future condition of society may be better but not essentially different and whilst they admit that mankind has made vast strides in improvement and may still have some to make they assign to it beforehand certain impassable limits Thus they do not presume that they have arrived at the supreme good or at absolute truth what people or what man was ever wild enough to imagine it but they cherish a persuasion that they have pretty nearly reached that degree of greatness and knowledge which our imperfect nature admits of and as nothing moves about them they are willing to fancy that everything is in its fit place Then it is that the legislator affects to lay down eternal laws that kings and nations will raise none but imperishable monuments and that the present generation undertakes to spare generations to come the care of regulating their destinies In proportion as castes disappear and the classes of society approximate as manners customs and laws vary from the tumultuous intercourse of men as new facts arise as new truths are brought to light as ancient opinions are dissipated and others take their place the image of an ideal perfection forever on the wing presents itself to the human mind Continual changes are then every instant occurring under the observation of every man the position of some is rendered worse and he learns but too well that no people and no individual how enlightened soever they may be can lay claim to infallibility the condition of others is improved whence he infers that man is endowed with an indefinite faculty of improvement His reverses teach him that none may hope to have discovered absolute good his success stimulates him to the never ending pursuit of it Thus forever seeking forever falling to rise again often disappointed but not discouraged he tends unceasingly towards that unmeasured greatness so indistinctly visible at the end of the long track which humanity has yet to tread It can hardly be believed how many facts naturally flow from the philosophical theory of the indefinite perfectibility of man or how strong an influence it exercises even on men who living entirely for the purposes of action and not of thought seem to conform their actions to it without knowing anything about it I accost an American sailor and I inquire why the ships of his country are built so as to last but for a short time he answers without hesitation that the art of navigation is every day making such rapid progress that the finest vessel would become almost useless if it lasted beyond a certain number of years In these words which fell accidentally and on a particular subject from a man of rude attainments I recognize the general and systematic idea upon which a great people directs all its concerns Aristocratic nations are naturally too apt to narrow the scope of human perfectibility democratic nations to expand it beyond compass Chapter IX The Example Of The Americans Does Not Prove That A Democratic People Can Have No Aptitude And No Taste For Science Literature Or Art It must be acknowledged that amongst few of the civilized nations of our time have the higher sciences made less progress than in the United States and in few have great artists fine poets or celebrated writers been more rare Many Europeans struck by this fact have looked upon it as a natural and inevitable result of equality and they have supposed that if a democratic state of society and democratic institutions were ever to prevail over the whole earth the human mind would gradually find its beacon lights grow dim and men would relapse into a period of darkness To reason thus is I think to confound several ideas which it is important to divide and to examine separately it is to mingle unintentionally what is democratic with what is only American The religion professed by the first emigrants and bequeathed by them to their descendants simple in its form of worship austere and almost harsh in its principles and hostile to external symbols and to ceremonial pomp is naturally unfavorable to the fine arts and only yields a reluctant sufferance to the pleasures of literature The Americans are a very old and a very enlightened people who have fallen upon a new and unbounded country where they may extend themselves at pleasure and which they may fertilize without difficulty This state of things is without a parallel in the history of the world In America then every one finds facilities unknown elsewhere for making or increasing his fortune The spirit of gain is always on the stretch and the human mind constantly diverted from the pleasures of imagination and the labors of the intellect is there swayed by no impulse but the pursuit of wealth Not only are manufacturing and commercial classes to be found in the United States as they are in all other countries but what never occurred elsewhere the whole community is simultaneously engaged in productive industry and commerce I am convinced that if the Americans had been alone in the world with the freedom and the knowledge acquired by their forefathers and the passions which are their own they would not have been slow to discover that progress cannot long be made in the application of the sciences without cultivating the theory of them that all the arts are perfected by one another and however absorbed they might have been by the pursuit of the principal object of their desires they would speedily have admitted that it is necessary to turn aside from it occasionally in order the better to attain it in the end The taste for the pleasures of the mind is moreover so natural to the heart of civilized man that amongst the polite nations which are least disposed to give themselves up to these pursuits a certain number of citizens are always to be found who take part in them This intellectual craving when once felt would very soon have been satisfied But at the very time when the Americans were naturally inclined to require nothing of science but its special applications to the useful arts and the means of rendering life comfortable learned and literary Europe was engaged in exploring the common sources of truth and in improving at the same time all that can minister to the pleasures or satisfy the wants of man At the head of the enlightened nations of the Old World the inhabitants of the United States more particularly distinguished one to which they were closely united by a common origin and by kindred habits Amongst this people they found distinguished men of science artists of skill writers of eminence and they were enabled to enjoy the treasures of the intellect without requiring to labor in amassing them I cannot consent to separate America from Europe in spite of the ocean which intervenes I consider the people of the United States as that portion of the English people which is commissioned to explore the wilds of the New World whilst the rest of the nation enjoying more leisure and less harassed by the drudgery of life may devote its energies to thought and enlarge in all directions the empire of the mind The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one Their strictly Puritanical origin their exclusively commercial habits even the country they inhabit which seems to divert their minds from the pursuit of science literature and the arts the proximity of Europe which allows them to neglect these pursuits without relapsing into barbarism a thousand special causes of which I have only been able to point out the most important have singularly concurred to fix the mind of the American upon purely practical objects His passions his wants his education and everything about him seem to unite in drawing the native of the United States earthward his religion alone bids him turn from time to time a transient and distracted glance to heaven Let us cease then to view all democratic nations under the mask of the American people and let us attempt to survey them at length with their own proper features It is possible to conceive a people not subdivided into any castes or scale of ranks in which the law recognizing no privileges should divide inherited property into equal shares but which at the same time should be without knowledge and without freedom Nor is this an empty hypothesis a despot may find that it is his interest to render his subjects equal and to leave them ignorant in order more easily to keep them slaves Not only would a democratic people of this kind show neither aptitude nor taste for science literature or art but it would probably never arrive at the possession of them The law of descent would of itself provide for the destruction of fortunes at each succeeding generation and new fortunes would be acquired by none The poor man without either knowledge or freedom would not so much as conceive the idea of raising himself to wealth and the rich man would allow himself to be degraded to poverty without a notion of self defence Between these two members of the community complete and invincible equality would soon be established No one would then have time or taste to devote himself to the pursuits or pleasures of the intellect but all men would remain paralyzed by a state of common ignorance and equal servitude When I conceive a democratic society of this kind I fancy myself in one of those low close and gloomy abodes where the light which breaks in from without soon faints and fades away A sudden heaviness overpowers me and I grope through the surrounding darkness to find the aperture which will restore me to daylight and the air But all this is not applicable to men already enlightened who retain their freedom after having abolished from amongst them those peculiar and hereditary rights which perpetuated the tenure of property in the hands of certain individuals or certain bodies When men living in a democratic state of society are enlightened they readily discover that they are confined and fixed within no limits which constrain them to take up with their present fortune They all therefore conceive the idea of increasing it if they are free they all attempt it but all do not succeed in the same manner The legislature it is true no longer grants privileges but they are bestowed by nature As natural inequality is very great fortunes become unequal as soon as every man exerts all his faculties to get rich The law of descent prevents the establishment of wealthy families but it does not prevent the existence of wealthy individuals It constantly brings back the members of the community to a common level from which they as constantly escape and the inequality of fortunes augments in proportion as knowledge is diffused and liberty increased A sect which arose in our time and was celebrated for its talents and its extravagance proposed to concentrate all property into the hands of a central power whose function it should afterwards be to parcel it out to individuals according to their capacity This would have been a method of escaping from that complete and eternal equality which seems to threaten democratic society But it would be a simpler and less dangerous remedy to grant no privilege to any giving to all equal cultivation and equal independence and leaving everyone to determine his own position Natural inequality will very soon make way for itself and wealth will spontaneously pass into the hands of the most capable Free and democratic communities then will always contain a considerable number of people enjoying opulence or competency The wealthy will not be so closely linked to each other as the members of the former aristocratic class of society their propensities will be different and they will scarcely ever enjoy leisure as secure or as complete but they will be far more numerous than those who belonged to that class of society could ever be These persons will not be strictly confined to the cares of practical life and they will still be able though in different degrees to indulge in the pursuits and pleasures of the intellect In those pleasures they will indulge for if it be true that the human mind leans on one side to the narrow the practical and the useful it naturally rises on the other to the infinite the spiritual and the beautiful Physical wants confine it to the earth but as soon as the tie is loosened it will unbend itself again Not only will the number of those who can take an interest in the productions of the mind be enlarged but the taste for intellectual enjoyment will descend step by step even to those who in aristocratic societies seem to have neither time nor ability to in indulge in them When hereditary wealth the privileges of rank and the prerogatives of birth have ceased to be and when every man derives his strength from himself alone it becomes evident that the chief cause of disparity between the fortunes of men is the mind Whatever tends to invigorate to extend or to adorn the mind instantly rises to great value The utility of knowledge becomes singularly conspicuous even to the eyes of the multitude those who have no taste for its charms set store upon its results and make some efforts to acquire it In free and enlightened democratic ages there is nothing to separate men from each other or to retain them in their peculiar sphere they rise or sink with extreme rapidity All classes live in perpetual intercourse from their great proximity to each other They communicate and intermingle every day they imitate and envy one other this suggests to the people many ideas notions and desires which it would never have entertained if the distinctions of rank had been fixed and society at rest In such nations the servant never considers himself as an entire stranger to the pleasures and toils of his master nor the poor man to those of the rich the rural population assimilates itself to that of the towns and the provinces to the capital No one easily allows himself to be reduced to the mere material cares of life and the humblest artisan casts at times an eager and a furtive glance into the higher regions of the intellect People do not read with the same notions or in the same manner as they do in an aristocratic community but the circle of readers is unceasingly expanded till it includes all the citizens As soon as the multitude begins to take an interest in the labors of the mind it finds out that to excel in some of them is a powerful method of acquiring fame power or wealth The restless ambition which equality begets instantly takes this direction as it does all others The number of those who cultivate science letters and the arts becomes immense The intellectual world starts into prodigious activity everyone endeavors to open for himself a path there and to draw the eyes of the public after him Something analogous occurs to what happens in society in the United States politically considered What is done is often imperfect but the attempts are innumerable and although the results of individual effort are commonly very small the total amount is always very large It is therefore not true to assert that men living in democratic ages are naturally indifferent to science literature and the arts only it must be acknowledged that they cultivate them after their own fashion and bring to the task their own peculiar qualifications and deficiencies Chapter X Why The Americans Are More Addicted To Practical Than To Theoretical Science If a democratic state of society and democratic institutions do not stop the career of the human mind they incontestably guide it in one direction in preference to another Their effects thus circumscribed are still exceedingly great and I trust I may be pardoned if I pause for a moment to survey them We had occasion in speaking of the philosophical method of the American people to make several remarks which must here be turned to account Equality begets in man the desire of judging of everything for himself it gives him in all things a taste for the tangible and the real a contempt for tradition and for forms These general tendencies are principally discernible in the peculiar subject of this chapter Those who cultivate the sciences amongst a democratic people are always afraid of losing their way in visionary speculation They mistrust systems they adhere closely to facts and the study of facts with their own senses As they do not easily defer to the mere name of any fellow man they are never inclined to rest upon any man s authority but on the contrary they are unremitting in their efforts to point out the weaker points of their neighbors opinions Scientific precedents have very little weight with them they are never long detained by the subtilty of the schools nor ready to accept big words for sterling coin they penetrate as far as they can into the principal parts of the subject which engages them and they expound them in the vernacular tongue Scientific pursuits then follow a freer and a safer course but a less lofty one The mind may as it appears to me divide science into three parts The first comprises the most theoretical principles and those more abstract notions whose application is either unknown or very remote The second is composed of those general truths which still belong to pure theory but lead nevertheless by a straight and short road to practical results Methods of application and means of execution make up the third Each of these different portions of science may be separately cultivated although reason and experience show that none of them can prosper long if it be absolutely cut off from the two others In America the purely practical part of science is admirably understood and careful attention is paid to the theoretical portion which is immediately requisite to application On this head the Americans always display a clear free original and inventive power of mind But hardly anyone in the United States devotes himself to the essentially theoretical and abstract portion of human knowledge In this respect the Americans carry to excess a tendency which is I think discernible though in a less degree amongst all democratic nations Nothing is more necessary to the culture of the higher sciences or of the more elevated departments of science than meditation and nothing is less suited to meditation than the structure of democratic society We do not find there as amongst an aristocratic people one class which clings to a state of repose because it is well off and another which does not venture to stir because it despairs of improving its condition Everyone is actively in motion some in quest of power others of gain In the midst of this universal tumult this incessant conflict of jarring interests this continual stride of men after fortune where is that calm to be found which is necessary for the deeper combinations of the intellect How can the mind dwell upon any single point when everything whirls around it and man himself is swept and beaten onwards by the heady current which rolls all things in its course But the permanent agitation which subsists in the bosom of a peaceable and established democracy must be distinguished from the tumultuous and revolutionary movements which almost always attend the birth and growth of democratic society When a violent revolution occurs amongst a highly civilized people it cannot fail to give a sudden impulse to their feelings and their opinions This is more particularly true of democratic revolutions which stir up all the classes of which a people is composed and beget at the same time inordinate ambition in the breast of every member of the community The French made most surprising advances in the exact sciences at the very time at which they were finishing the destruction of the remains of their former feudal society yet this sudden fecundity is not to be attributed to democracy but to the unexampled revolution which attended its growth What happened at that period was a special incident and it would be unwise to regard it as the test of a general principle Great revolutions are not more common amongst democratic nations than amongst others I am even inclined to believe that they are less so But there prevails amongst those populations a small distressing motion a sort of incessant jostling of men which annoys and disturbs the mind without exciting or elevating it Men who live in democratic communities not only seldom indulge in meditation but they naturally entertain very little esteem for it A democratic state of society and democratic institutions plunge the greater part of men in constant active life and the habits of mind which are suited to an active life are not always suited to a contemplative one The man of action is frequently obliged to content himself with the best he can get because he would never accomplish his purpose if he chose to carry every detail to perfection He has perpetually occasion to rely on ideas which he has not had leisure to search to the bottom for he is much more frequently aided by the opportunity of an idea than by its strict accuracy and in the long run he risks less in making use of some false principles than in spending his time in establishing all his principles on the basis of truth The world is not led by long or learned demonstrations a rapid glance at particular incidents the daily study of the fleeting passions of the multitude the accidents of the time and the art of turning them to account decide all its affairs In the ages in which active life is the condition of almost everyone men are therefore generally led to attach an excessive value to the rapid bursts and superficial conceptions of the intellect and on the other hand to depreciate below their true standard its slower and deeper labors This opinion of the public influences the judgment of the men who cultivate the sciences they are persuaded that they may succeed in those pursuits without meditation or deterred from such pursuits as demand it There are several methods of studying the sciences Amongst a multitude of men you will find a selfish mercantile and trading taste for the discoveries of the mind which must not be confounded with that disinterested passion which is kindled in the heart of the few A desire to utilize knowledge is one thing the pure desire to know is another I do not doubt that in a few minds and far between an ardent inexhaustible love of truth springs up self supported and living in ceaseless fruition without ever attaining the satisfaction which it seeks This ardent love it is this proud disinterested love of what is true which raises men to the abstract sources of truth to draw their mother knowledge thence If Pascal had had nothing in view but some large gain or even if he had been stimulated by the love of fame alone I cannot conceive that he would ever have been able to rally all the powers of his mind as he did for the better discovery of the most hidden things of the Creator When I see him as it were tear his soul from the midst of all the cares of life to devote it wholly to these researches and prematurely snapping the links which bind the frame to life die of old age before forty I stand amazed and I perceive that no ordinary cause is at work to produce efforts so extra ordinary The future will prove whether these passions at once so rare and so productive come into being and into growth as easily in the midst of democratic as in aristocratic communities For myself I confess that I am slow to believe it In aristocratic society the class which gives the tone to opinion and has the supreme guidance of affairs being permanently and hereditarily placed above the multitude naturally conceives a lofty idea of itself and of man It loves to invent for him noble pleasures to carve out splendid objects for his ambition Aristocracies often commit very tyrannical and very inhuman actions but they rarely entertain grovelling thoughts and they show a kind of haughty contempt of little pleasures even whilst they indulge in them The effect is greatly to raise the general pitch of society In aristocratic ages vast ideas are commonly entertained of the dignity the power and the greatness of man These opinions exert their influence on those who cultivate the sciences as well as on the rest of the community They facilitate the natural impulse of the mind to the highest regions of thought and they naturally prepare it to conceive a sublime nay almost a divine love of truth Men of science at such periods are consequently carried away by theory and it even happens that they frequently conceive an inconsiderate contempt for the practical part of learning Archimedes says Plutarch was of so lofty a spirit that he never condescended to write any treatise on the manner of constructing all these engines of offence and defence And as he held this science of inventing and putting together engines and all arts generally speaking which tended to any useful end in practice to be vile low and mercenary he spent his talents and his studious hours in writing of those things only whose beauty and subtilty had in them no admixture of necessity Such is the aristocratic aim of science in democratic nations it cannot be the same The greater part of the men who constitute these nations are extremely eager in the pursuit of actual and physical gratification As they are always dissatisfied with the position which they occupy and are always free to leave it they think of nothing but the means of changing their fortune or of increasing it To minds thus predisposed every new method which leads by a shorter road to wealth every machine which spares labor every instrument which diminishes the cost of production every discovery which facilitates pleasures or augments them seems to be the grandest effort of the human intellect It is chiefly from these motives that a democratic people addicts itself to scientific pursuits that it understands and that it respects them In aristocratic ages science is more particularly called upon to furnish gratification to the mind in democracies to the body You may be sure that the more a nation is democratic enlightened and free the greater will be the number of these interested promoters of scientific genius and the more will discoveries immediately applicable to productive industry confer gain fame and even power on their authors For in democracies the working class takes a part in public affairs and public honors as well as pecuniary remuneration may be awarded to those who deserve them In a community thus organized it may easily be conceived that the human mind may be led insensibly to the neglect of theory and that it is urged on the contrary with unparalleled vehemence to the applications of science or at least to that portion of theoretical science which is necessary to those who make such applications In vain will some innate propensity raise the mind towards the loftier spheres of the intellect interest draws it down to the middle zone There it may develop all its energy and restless activity there it may engender all its wonders These very Americans who have not discovered one of the general laws of mechanics have introduced into navigation an engine which changes the aspect of the world Assuredly I do not content that the democratic nations of our time are destined to witness the extinction of the transcendent luminaries of man s intelligence nor even that no new lights will ever start into existence At the age at which the world has now arrived and amongst so many cultivated nations perpetually excited by the fever of productive industry the bonds which connect the different parts of science together cannot fail to strike the observation and the taste for practical science itself if it be enlightened ought to lead men not to neglect theory In the midst of such numberless attempted applications of so many experiments repeated every day it is almost impossible that general laws should not frequently be brought to light so that great discoveries would be frequent though great inventors be rare I believe moreover in the high calling of scientific minds If the democratic principle does not on the one hand induce men to cultivate science for its own sake on the other it enormously increases the number of those who do cultivate it Nor is it credible that from amongst so great a multitude no speculative genius should from time to time arise inflamed by the love of truth alone Such a one we may be sure would dive into the deepest mysteries of nature whatever be the spirit of his country or his age He requires no assistance in his course enough that he be not checked in it All that I mean to say is this permanent inequality of conditions leads men to confine themselves to the arrogant and sterile research of abstract truths whilst the social condition and the institutions of democracy prepare them to seek the immediate and useful practical results of the sciences This tendency is natural and inevitable it is curious to be acquainted with it and it may be necessary to point it out If those who are called upon to guide the nations of our time clearly discerned from afar off these new tendencies which will soon be irresistible they would understand that possessing education and freedom men living in democratic ages cannot fail to improve the industrial part of science and that henceforward all the efforts of the constituted authorities ought to be directed to support the highest branches of learning and to foster the nobler passion for science itself In the present age the human mind must be coerced into theoretical studies it runs of its own accord to practical applications and instead of perpetually referring it to the minute examination of secondary effects it is well to divert it from them sometimes in order to raise it up to the contemplation of primary causes Because the civilization of ancient Rome perished in consequence of the invasion of the barbarians we are perhaps too apt to think that civilization cannot perish in any other manner If the light by which we are guided is ever extinguished it will dwindle by degrees and expire of itself By dint of close adherence to mere applications principles would be lost sight of and when the principles were wholly forgotten the methods derived from them would be ill pursued New methods could no longer be invented and men would continue to apply without intelligence and without art scientific processes no longer understood When Europeans first arrived in China three hundred years ago they found that almost all the arts had reached a certain degree of perfection there and they were surprised that a people which had attained this point should not have gone beyond it At a later period they discovered some traces of the higher branches of science which were lost The nation was absorbed in productive industry the greater part of its scientific processes had been preserved but science itself no longer existed there This served to explain the strangely motionless state in which they found the minds of this people The Chinese in following the track of their forefathers had forgotten the reasons by which the latter had been guided They still used the formula without asking for its meaning they retained the instrument but they no longer possessed the art of altering or renewing it The Chinese then had lost the power of change for them to improve was impossible They were compelled at all times and in all points to imitate their predecessors lest they should stray into utter darkness by deviating for an instant from the path already laid down for them The source of human knowledge was all but dry and though the stream still ran on it could neither swell its waters nor alter its channel Notwithstanding this China had subsisted peaceably for centuries The invaders who had conquered the country assumed the manners of the inhabitants and order prevailed there A sort of physical prosperity was everywhere discernible revolutions were rare and war was so to speak unknown It is then a fallacy to flatter ourselves with the reflection that the barbarians are still far from us for if there be some nations which allow civilization to be torn from their grasp there are others who trample it themselves under their feet Chapter XI Of The Spirit In Which The Americans Cultivate The Arts It would be to waste the time of my readers and my own if I strove to demonstrate how the general mediocrity of fortunes the absence of superfluous wealth the universal desire of comfort and the constant efforts by which everyone attempts to procure it make the taste for the useful predominate over the love of the beautiful in the heart of man Democratic nations amongst which all these things exist will therefore cultivate the arts which serve to render life easy in preference to those whose object is to adorn it They will habitually prefer the useful to the beautiful and they will require that the beautiful should be useful But I propose to go further and after having pointed out this first feature to sketch several others It commonly happens that in the ages of privilege the practice of almost all the arts becomes a privilege and that every profession is a separate walk upon which it is not allowable for everyone to enter Even when productive industry is free the fixed character which belongs to aristocratic nations gradually segregates all the persons who practise the same art till they form a distinct class always composed of the same families whose members are all known to each other and amongst whom a public opinion of their own and a species of corporate pride soon spring up In a class or guild of this kind each artisan has not only his fortune to make but his reputation to preserve He is not exclusively swayed by his own interest or even by that of his customer but by that of the body to which he belongs and the interest of that body is that each artisan should produce the best possible workmanship In aristocratic ages the object of the arts is therefore to manufacture as well as possible not with the greatest despatch or at the lowest rate When on the contrary every profession is open to all when a multitude of persons are constantly embracing and abandoning it and when its several members are strangers to each other indifferent and from their numbers hardly seen amongst themselves the social tie is destroyed and each workman standing alone endeavors simply to gain the greatest possible quantity of money at the least possible cost The will of the customer is then his only limit But at the same time a corresponding revolution takes place in the customer also In countries in which riches as well as power are concentrated and retained in the hands of the few the use of the greater part of this world s goods belongs to a small number of individuals who are always the same Necessity public opinion or moderate desires exclude all others from the enjoyment of them As this aristocratic class remains fixed at the pinnacle of greatness on which it stands without diminution or increase it is always acted upon by the same wants and affected by them in the same manner The men of whom it is composed naturally derive from their superior and hereditary position a taste for what is extremely well made and lasting This affects the general way of thinking of the nation in relation to the arts It often occurs among such a people that even the peasant will rather go without the object he covets than procure it in a state of imperfection In aristocracies then the handicraftsmen work for only a limited number of very fastidious customers the profit they hope to make depends principally on the perfection of their workmanship Such is no longer the case when all privileges being abolished ranks are intermingled and men are forever rising or sinking upon the ladder of society Amongst a democratic people a number of citizens always exist whose patrimony is divided and decreasing They have contracted under more prosperous circumstances certain wants which remain after the means of satisfying such wants are gone and they are anxiously looking out for some surreptitious method of providing for them On the other hand there are always in democracies a large number of men whose fortune is upon the increase but whose desires grow much faster than their fortunes and who gloat upon the gifts of wealth in anticipation long before they have means to command them Such men eager to find some short cut to these gratifications already almost within their reach From the combination of these causes the result is that in democracies there are always a multitude of individuals whose wants are above their means and who are very willing to take up with imperfect satisfaction rather than abandon the object of their desires The artisan readily understands these passions for he himself partakes in them in an aristocracy he would seek to sell his workmanship at a high price to the few he now conceives that the more expeditious way of getting rich is to sell them at a low price to all But there are only two ways of lowering the price of commodities The first is to discover some better shorter and more ingenious method of producing them the second is to manufacture a larger quantity of goods nearly similar but of less value Amongst a democratic population all the intellectual faculties of the workman are directed to these two objects he strives to invent methods which may enable him not only to work better but quicker and cheaper or if he cannot succeed in that to diminish the intrinsic qualities of the thing he makes without rendering it wholly unfit for the use for which it is intended When none but the wealthy had watches they were almost all very good ones few are now made which are worth much but everybody has one in his pocket Thus the democratic principle not only tends to direct the human mind to the useful arts but it induces the artisan to produce with greater rapidity a quantity of imperfect commodities and the consumer to content himself with these commodities Not that in democracies the arts are incapable of producing very commendable works if such be required This may occasionally be the case if customers appear who are ready to pay for time and trouble In this rivalry of every kind of industry in the midst of this immense competition and these countless experiments some excellent workmen are formed who reach the utmost limits of their craft But they have rarely an opportunity of displaying what they can do they are scrupulously sparing of their powers they remain in a state of accomplished mediocrity which condemns itself and though it be very well able to shoot beyond the mark before it aims only at what it hits In aristocracies on the contrary workmen always do all they can and when they stop it is because they have reached the limit of their attainments When I arrive in a country where I find some of the finest productions of the arts I learn from this fact nothing of the social condition or of the political constitution of the country But if I perceive that the productions of the arts are generally of an inferior quality very abundant and very cheap I am convinced that amongst the people where this occurs privilege is on the decline and that ranks are beginning to intermingle and will soon be confounded together The handicraftsmen of democratic ages endeavor not only to bring their useful productions within the reach of the whole community but they strive to give to all their commodities attractive qualities which they do not in reality possess In the confusion of all ranks everyone hopes to appear what he is not and makes great exertions to succeed in this object This sentiment indeed which is but too natural to the heart of man does not originate in the democratic principle but that principle applies it to material objects To mimic virtue is of every age but the hypocrisy of luxury belongs more particularly to the ages of democracy To satisfy these new cravings of human vanity the arts have recourse to every species of imposture and these devices sometimes go so far as to defeat their own purpose Imitation diamonds are now made which may be easily mistaken for real ones as soon as the art of fabricating false diamonds shall have reached so high a degree of perfection that they cannot be distinguished from real ones it is probable that both one and the other will be abandoned and become mere pebbles again This leads me to speak of those arts which are called the fine arts by way of distinction I do not believe that it is a necessary effect of a democratic social condition and of democratic institutions to diminish the number of men who cultivate the fine arts but these causes exert a very powerful influence on the manner in which these arts are cultivated Many of those who had already contracted a taste for the fine arts are impoverished on the other hand many of those who are not yet rich begin to conceive that taste at least by imitation and the number of consumers increases but opulent and fastidious consumers become more scarce Something analogous to what I have already pointed out in the useful arts then takes place in the fine arts the productions of artists are more numerous but the merit of each production is diminished No longer able to soar to what is great they cultivate what is pretty and elegant and appearance is more attended to than reality In aristocracies a few great pictures are produced in democratic countries a vast number of insignificant ones In the former statues are raised of bronze in the latter they are modelled in plaster When I arrived for the first time at New York by that part of the Atlantic Ocean which is called the Narrows I was surprised to perceive along the shore at some distance from the city a considerable number of little palaces of white marble several of which were built after the models of ancient architecture When I went the next day to inspect more closely the building which had particularly attracted my notice I found that its walls were of whitewashed brick and its columns of painted wood All the edifices which I had admired the night before were of the same kind The social condition and the institutions of democracy impart moreover certain peculiar tendencies to all the imitative arts which it is easy to point out They frequently withdraw them from the delineation of the soul to fix them exclusively on that of the body and they substitute the representation of motion and sensation for that of sentiment and thought in a word they put the real in the place of the ideal I doubt whether Raphael studied the minutest intricacies of the mechanism of the human body as thoroughly as the draughtsmen of our own time He did not attach the same importance to rigorous accuracy on this point as they do because he aspired to surpass nature He sought to make of man something which should be superior to man and to embellish beauty s self David and his scholars were on the contrary as good anatomists as they were good painters They wonderfully depicted the models which they had before their eyes but they rarely imagined anything beyond them they followed nature with fidelity whilst Raphael sought for something better than nature They have left us an exact portraiture of man but he discloses in his works a glimpse of the Divinity This remark as to the manner of treating a subject is no less applicable to the choice of it The painters of the Middle Ages generally sought far above themselves and away from their own time for mighty subjects which left to their imagination an unbounded range Our painters frequently employ their talents in the exact imitation of the details of private life which they have always before their eyes and they are forever copying trivial objects the originals of which are only too abundant in nature Chapter XII Why The Americans Raise Some Monuments So Insignificant And Others So Important I have just observed that in democratic ages monuments of the arts tend to become more numerous and less important I now hasten to point out the exception to this rule In a democratic community individuals are very powerless but the State which represents them all and contains them all in its grasp is very powerful Nowhere do citizens appear so insignificant as in a democratic nation nowhere does the nation itself appear greater or does the mind more easily take in a wide general survey of it In democratic communities the imagination is compressed when men consider themselves it expands indefinitely when they think of the State Hence it is that the same men who live on a small scale in narrow dwellings frequently aspire to gigantic splendor in the erection of their public monuments The Americans traced out the circuit of an immense city on the site which they intended to make their capital but which up to the present time is hardly more densely peopled than Pontoise though according to them it will one day contain a million of inhabitants They have already rooted up trees for ten miles round lest they should interfere with the future citizens of this imaginary metropolis They have erected a magnificent palace for Congress in the centre of the city and have given it the pompous name of the Capitol The several States of the Union are every day planning and erecting for themselves prodigious undertakings which would astonish the engineers of the great European nations Thus democracy not only leads men to a vast number of inconsiderable productions it also leads them to raise some monuments on the largest scale but between these two extremes there is a blank A few scattered remains of enormous buildings can therefore teach us nothing of the social condition and the institutions of the people by whom they were raised I may add though the remark leads me to step out of my subject that they do not make us better acquainted with its greatness its civilization and its real prosperity Whensoever a power of any kind shall be able to make a whole people company operate in a single undertaking that power with a little knowledge and a great deal of time will succeed in obtaining something enormous from the company operation of efforts so multiplied But this does not lead to the conclusion that the people was very happy very enlightened or even very strong The Spaniards found the City of Mexico full of magnificent temples and vast palaces but that did not prevent Cortes from conquering the Mexican Empire with six hundred foot soldiers and sixteen horses If the Romans had been better acquainted with the laws of hydraulics they would not have constructed all the aqueducts which surround the ruins of their cities they would have made a better use of their power and their wealth If they had invented the steam engine perhaps they would not have extended to the extremities of their empire those long artificial roads which are called Roman roads These things are at once the splendid memorials of their ignorance and of their greatness A people which should leave no other vestige of its track than a few leaden pipes in the earth and a few iron rods upon its surface might have been more the master of nature than the Romans Chapter XIII Literary Characteristics Of Democratic Ages When a traveller goes into a bookseller s shop in the United States and examines the American books upon the shelves the number of works appears extremely great whilst that of known authors appears on the contrary to be extremely small He will first meet with a number of elementary treatises destined to teach the rudiments of human knowledge Most of these books are written in Europe the Americans reprint them adapting them to their own country Next comes an enormous quantity of religious works Bibles sermons edifying anecdotes controversial divinity and reports of charitable societies lastly appears the long catalogue of political pamphlets In America parties do not write books to combat each others opinions but pamphlets which are circulated for a day with incredible rapidity and then expire In the midst of all these obscure productions of the human brain are to be found the more remarkable works of that small number of authors whose names are or ought to be known to Europeans Although America is perhaps in our days the civilized country in which literature is least attended to a large number of persons are nevertheless to be found there who take an interest in the productions of the mind and who make them if not the study of their lives at least the charm of their leisure hours But England supplies these readers with the larger portion of the books which they require Almost all important English books are republished in the United States The literary genius of Great Britain still darts its rays into the recesses of the forests of the New World There is hardly a pioneer s hut which does not contain a few odd volumes of Shakespeare I remember that I read the feudal play of Henry V for the first time in a loghouse Not only do the Americans constantly draw upon the treasures of English literature but it may be said with truth that they find the literature of England growing on their own soil The larger part of that small number of men in the United States who are engaged in the composition of literary works are English in substance and still more so in form Thus they transport into the midst of democracy the ideas and literary fashions which are current amongst the aristocratic nation they have taken for their model They paint with colors borrowed from foreign manners and as they hardly ever represent the country they were born in as it really is they are seldom popular there The citizens of the United States are themselves so convinced that it is not for them that books are published that before they can make up their minds upon the merit of one of their authors they generally wait till his fame has been ratified in England just as in pictures the author of an original is held to be entitled to judge of the merit of a copy The inhabitants of the United States have then at present properly speaking no literature The only authors whom I acknowledge as American are the journalists They indeed are not great writers but they speak the language of their countrymen and make themselves heard by them Other authors are aliens they are to the Americans what the imitators of the Greeks and Romans were to us at the revival of learning an object of curiosity not of general sympathy They amuse the mind but they do not act upon the manners of the people I have already said that this state of things is very far from originating in democracy alone and that the causes of it must be sought for in several peculiar circumstances independent of the democratic principle If the Americans retaining the same laws and social condition had had a different origin and had been transported into another country I do not question that they would have had a literature Even as they now are I am convinced that they will ultimately have one but its character will be different from that which marks the American literary productions of our time and that character will be peculiarly its own Nor is it impossible to trace this character beforehand I suppose an aristocratic people amongst whom letters are cultivated the labors of the mind as well as the affairs of state are conducted by a ruling class in society The literary as well as the political career is almost entirely confined to this class or to those nearest to it in rank These premises suffice to give me a key to all the rest When a small number of the same men are engaged at the same time upon the same objects they easily concert with one another and agree upon certain leading rules which are to govern them each and all If the object which attracts the attention of these men is literature the productions of the mind will soon be subjected by them to precise canons from which it will no longer be allowable to depart If these men occupy a hereditary position in the country they will be naturally inclined not only to adopt a certain number of fixed rules for themselves but to follow those which their forefathers laid down for their own guidance their code will be at once strict and traditional As they are not necessarily engrossed by the cares of daily life as they have never been so any more than their fathers were before them they have learned to take an interest for several generations back in the labors of the mind They have learned to understand literature as an art to love it in the end for its own sake and to feel a scholar like satisfaction in seeing men conform to its rules Nor is this all the men of whom I speak began and will end their lives in easy or in affluent circumstances hence they have naturally conceived a taste for choice gratifications and a love of refined and delicate pleasures Nay more a kind of indolence of mind and heart which they frequently contract in the midst of this long and peaceful enjoyment of so much welfare leads them to put aside even from their pleasures whatever might be too startling or too acute They had rather be amused than intensely excited they wish to be interested but not to be carried away Now let us fancy a great number of literary performances executed by the men or for the men whom I have just described and we shall readily conceive a style of literature in which everything will be regular and prearranged The slightest work will be carefully touched in its least details art and labor will be conspicuous in everything each kind of writing will have rules of its own from which it will not be allowed to swerve and which distinguish it from all others Style will be thought of almost as much importance as thought and the form will be no less considered than the matter the diction will be polished measured and uniform The tone of the mind will be always dignified seldom very animated and writers will care more to perfect what they produce than to multiply their productions It will sometimes happen that the members of the literary class always living amongst themselves and writing for themselves alone will lose sight of the rest of the world which will infect them with a false and labored style they will lay down minute literary rules for their exclusive use which will insensibly lead them to deviate from common sense and finally to transgress the bounds of nature By dint of striving after a mode of parlance different from the vulgar they will arrive at a sort of aristocratic jargon which is hardly less remote from pure language than is the coarse dialect of the people Such are the natural perils of literature amongst aristocracies Every aristocracy which keeps itself entirely aloof from the people becomes impotent a fact which is as true in literature as it is in politics a Footnote a All this is especially true of the aristocratic countries which have been long and peacefully subject to a monarchical government When liberty prevails in an aristocracy the higher ranks are constantly obliged to make use of the lower classes and when they use they approach them This frequently introduces something of a democratic spirit into an aristocratic community There springs up moreover in a privileged body governing with energy and an habitually bold policy a taste for stir and excitement which must infallibly affect all literary performances Let us now turn the picture and consider the other side of it let us transport ourselves into the midst of a democracy not unprepared by ancient traditions and present culture to partake in the pleasures of the mind Ranks are there intermingled and confounded knowledge and power are both infinitely subdivided and if I may use the expression scattered on every side Here then is a motley multitude whose intellectual wants are to be supplied These new votaries of the pleasures of the mind have not all received the same education they do not possess the same degree of culture as their fathers nor any resemblance to them nay they perpetually differ from themselves for they live in a state of incessant change of place feelings and fortunes The mind of each member of the community is therefore unattached to that of his fellow citizens by tradition or by common habits and they have never had the power the inclination nor the time to concert together It is however from the bosom of this heterogeneous and agitated mass that authors spring and from the same source their profits and their fame are distributed I can without difficulty understand that under these circumstances I must expect to meet in the literature of such a people with but few of those strict conventional rules which are admitted by readers and by writers in aristocratic ages If it should happen that the men of some one period were agreed upon any such rules that would prove nothing for the following period for amongst democratic nations each new generation is a new people Amongst such nations then literature will not easily be subjected to strict rules and it is impossible that any such rules should ever be permanent In democracies it is by no means the case that all the men who cultivate literature have received a literary education and most of those who have some tinge of belles lettres are either engaged in politics or in a profession which only allows them to taste occasionally and by stealth the pleasures of the mind These pleasures therefore do not constitute the principal charm of their lives but they are considered as a transient and necessary recreation amidst the serious labors of life Such man can never acquire a sufficiently intimate knowledge of the art of literature to appreciate its more delicate beauties and the minor shades of expression must escape them As the time they can devote to letters is very short they seek to make the best use of the whole of it They prefer books which may be easily procured quickly read and which require no learned researches to be understood They ask for beauties self proffered and easily enjoyed above all they must have what is unexpected and new Accustomed to the struggle the crosses and the monotony of practical life they require rapid emotions startling passages truths or errors brilliant enough to rouse them up and to plunge them at once as if by violence into the midst of a subject Why should I say more or who does not understand what is about to follow before I have expressed it Taken as a whole literature in democratic ages can never present as it does in the periods of aristocracy an aspect of order regularity science and art its form will on the contrary ordinarily be slighted sometimes despised Style will frequently be fantastic incorrect overburdened and loose almost always vehement and bold Authors will aim at rapidity of execution more than at perfection of detail Small productions will be more common than bulky books there will be more wit than erudition more imagination than profundity and literary performances will bear marks of an untutored and rude vigor of thought frequently of great variety and singular fecundity The object of authors will be to astonish rather than to please and to stir the passions more than to charm the taste Here and there indeed writers will doubtless occur who will choose a different track and who will if they are gifted with superior abilities succeed in finding readers in spite of their defects or their better qualities but these exceptions will be rare and even the authors who shall so depart from the received practice in the main subject of their works will always relapse into it in some lesser details I have just depicted two extreme conditions the transition by which a nation passes from the former to the latter is not sudden but gradual and marked with shades of very various intensity In the passage which conducts a lettered people from the one to the other there is almost always a moment at which the literary genius of democratic nations has its confluence with that of aristocracies and both seek to establish their joint sway over the human mind Such epochs are transient but very brilliant they are fertile without exuberance and animated without confusion The French literature of the eighteenth century may serve as an example I should say more than I mean if I were to assert that the literature of a nation is always subordinate to its social condition and its political constitution I am aware that independently of these causes there are several others which confer certain characteristics on literary productions but these appear to me to be the chief The relations which exist between the social and political condition of a people and the genius of its authors are always very numerous whoever knows the one is never completely ignorant of the other Chapter XIV The Trade Of Literature Democracy not only infuses a taste for letters among the trading classes but introduces a trading spirit into literature In aristocracies readers are fastidious and few in number in democracies they are far more numerous and far less difficult to please The consequence is that among aristocratic nations no one can hope to succeed without immense exertions and that these exertions may bestow a great deal of fame but can never earn much money whilst among democratic nations a writer may flatter himself that he will obtain at a cheap rate a meagre reputation and a large fortune For this purpose he need not be admired it is enough that he is liked The ever increasing crowd of readers and their continual craving for something new insure the sale of books which nobody much esteems In democratic periods the public frequently treat authors as kings do their courtiers they enrich and they despise them What more is needed by the venal souls which are born in courts or which are worthy to live there Democratic literature is always infested with a tribe of writers who look upon letters as a mere trade and for some few great authors who adorn it you may reckon thousands of idea mongers Chapter XV The Study Of Greek And Latin Literature Peculiarly Useful In Democratic Communities What was called the People in the most democratic republics of antiquity was very unlike what we designate by that term In Athens all the citizens took part in public affairs but there were only twenty thousand citizens to more than three hundred fifty thousand inhabitants All the rest were slaves and discharged the greater part of those duties which belong at the present day to the lower or even to the middle classes Athens then with her universal suffrage was after all merely an aristocratic republic in which all the nobles had an equal right to the government The struggle between the patricians and plebeians of Rome must be considered in the same light it was simply an intestine feud between the elder and younger branches of the same family All the citizens belonged in fact to the aristocracy and partook of its character It is moreover to be remarked that amongst the ancients books were always scarce and dear and that very great difficulties impeded their publication and circulation These circumstances concentrated literary tastes and habits amongst a small number of men who formed a small literary aristocracy out of the choicer spirits of the great political aristocracy Accordingly nothing goes to prove that literature was ever treated as a trade amongst the Greeks and Romans These peoples which not only constituted aristocracies but very polished and free nations of course imparted to their literary productions the defects and the merits which characterize the literature of aristocratic ages And indeed a very superficial survey of the literary remains of the ancients will suffice to convince us that if those writers were sometimes deficient in variety or fertility in their subjects or in boldness vivacity or power of generalization in their thoughts they always displayed exquisite care and skill in their details Nothing in their works seems to be done hastily or at random every line is written for the eye of the connoisseur and is shaped after some conception of ideal beauty No literature places those fine qualities in which the writers of democracies are naturally deficient in bolder relief than that of the ancients no literature therefore ought to be more studied in democratic ages This study is better suited than any other to combat the literary defects inherent in those ages as for their more praiseworthy literary qualities they will spring up of their own accord without its being necessary to learn to acquire them It is important that this point should be clearly understood A particular study may be useful to the literature of a people without being appropriate to its social and political wants If men were to persist in teaching nothing but the literature of the dead languages in a community where everyone is habitually led to make vehement exertions to augment or to maintain his fortune the result would be a very polished but a very dangerous race of citizens For as their social and political condition would give them every day a sense of wants which their education would never teach them to supply they would perturb the State in the name of the Greeks and Romans instead of enriching it by their productive industry It is evident that in democratic communities the interest of individuals as well as the security of the commonwealth demands that the education of the greater number should be scientific commercial and industrial rather than literary Greek and Latin should not be taught in all schools but it is important that those who by their natural disposition or their fortune are destined to cultivate letters or prepared to relish them should find schools where a complete knowledge of ancient literature may be acquired and where the true scholar may be formed A few excellent universities would do more towards the attainment of this object than a vast number of bad grammar schools where superfluous matters badly learned stand in the way of sound instruction in necessary studies All who aspire to literary excellence in democratic nations ought frequently to refresh themselves at the springs of ancient literature there is no more wholesome course for the mind Not that I hold the literary productions of the ancients to be irreproachable but I think that they have some especial merits admirably calculated to counterbalance our peculiar defects They are a prop on the side on which we are in most danger of falling Chapter XVI The Effect Of Democracy On Language If the reader has rightly understood what I have already said on the subject of literature in general he will have no difficulty in comprehending that species of influence which a democratic social condition and democratic institutions may exercise over language itself which is the chief instrument of thought American authors may truly be said to live more in England than in their own country since they constantly study the English writers and take them every day for their models But such is not the case with the bulk of the population which is more immediately subjected to the peculiar causes acting upon the United States It is not then to the written but to the spoken language that attention must be paid if we would detect the modifications which the idiom of an aristocratic people may undergo when it becomes the language of a democracy Englishmen of education and more competent judges than I can be myself of the nicer shades of expression have frequently assured me that the language of the educated classes in the United States is notably different from that of the educated classes in Great Britain They complain not only that the Americans have brought into use a number of new words the difference and the distance between the two countries might suffice to explain that much but that these new words are more especially taken from the jargon of parties the mechanical arts or the language of trade They assert in addition to this that old English words are often used by the Americans in new acceptations and lastly that the inhabitants of the United States frequently intermingle their phraseology in the strangest manner and sometimes place words together which are always kept apart in the language of the mother country These remarks which were made to me at various times by persons who appeared to be worthy of credit led me to reflect upon the subject and my reflections brought me by theoretical reasoning to the same point at which my informants had arrived by practical observation In aristocracies language must naturally partake of that state of repose in which everything remains Few new words are coined because few new things are made and even if new things were made they would be designated by known words whose meaning has been determined by tradition If it happens that the human mind bestirs itself at length or is roused by light breaking in from without the novel expressions which are introduced are characterized by a degree of learning intelligence and philosophy which shows that they do not originate in a democracy After the fall of Constantinople had turned the tide of science and literature towards the west the French language was almost immediately invaded by a multitude of new words which had all Greek or Latin roots An erudite neologism then sprang up in France which was confined to the educated classes and which produced no sensible effect or at least a very gradual one upon the people All the nations of Europe successively exhibited the same change Milton alone introduced more than six hundred words into the English language almost all derived from the Latin the Greek or the Hebrew The constant agitation which prevails in a democratic community tends unceasingly on the contrary to change the character of the language as it does the aspect of affairs In the midst of this general stir and competition of minds a great number of new ideas are formed old ideas are lost or reappear or are subdivided into an infinite variety of minor shades The consequence is that many words must fall into desuetude and others must be brought into use Democratic nations love change for its own sake and this is seen in their language as much as in their politics Even when they do not need to change words they sometimes feel a wish to transform them The genius of a democratic people is not only shown by the great number of words they bring into use but also by the nature of the ideas these new words represent Amongst such a people the majority lays down the law in language as well as in everything else its prevailing spirit is as manifest in that as in other respects But the majority is more engaged in business than in study in political and commercial interests than in philosophical speculation or literary pursuits Most of the words coined or adopted for its use will therefore bear the mark of these habits they will mainly serve to express the wants of business the passions of party or the details of the public administration In these departments the language will constantly spread whilst on the other hand it will gradually lose ground in metaphysics and theology As to the source from which democratic nations are wont to derive their new expressions and the manner in which they go to work to coin them both may easily be described Men living in democratic countries know but little of the language which was spoken at Athens and at Rome and they do not care to dive into the lore of antiquity to find the expression they happen to want If they have sometimes recourse to learned etymologies vanity will induce them to search at the roots of the dead languages but erudition does not naturally furnish them with its resources The most ignorant it sometimes happens will use them most The eminently democratic desire to get above their own sphere will often lead them to seek to dignify a vulgar profession by a Greek or Latin name The lower the calling is and the more remote from learning the more pompous and erudite is its appellation Thus the French rope dancers have transformed themselves into acrobates and funambules In the absence of knowledge of the dead languages democratic nations are apt to borrow words from living tongues for their mutual intercourse becomes perpetual and the inhabitants of different countries imitate each other the more readily as they grow more like each other every day But it is principally upon their own languages that democratic nations attempt to perpetrate innovations From time to time they resume forgotten expressions in their vocabulary which they restore to use or they borrow from some particular class of the community a term peculiar to it which they introduce with a figurative meaning into the language of daily life Many expressions which originally belonged to the technical language of a profession or a party are thus drawn into general circulation The most common expedient employed by democratic nations to make an innovation in language consists in giving some unwonted meaning to an expression already in use This method is very simple prompt and convenient no learning is required to use it aright and ignorance itself rather facilitates the practice but that practice is most dangerous to the language When a democratic people doubles the meaning of a word in this way they sometimes render the signification which it retains as ambiguous as that which it acquires An author begins by a slight deflection of a known expression from its primitive meaning and he adapts it thus modified as well as he can to his subject A second writer twists the sense of the expression in another way a third takes possession of it for another purpose and as there is no common appeal to the sentence of a permanent tribunal which may definitely settle the signification of the word it remains in an ambiguous condition The consequence is that writers hardly ever appear to dwell upon a single thought but they always seem to point their aim at a knot of ideas leaving the reader to judge which of them has been hit This is a deplorable consequence of democracy I had rather that the language should be made hideous with words imported from the Chinese the Tartars or the Hurons than that the meaning of a word in our own language should become indeterminate Harmony and uniformity are only secondary beauties in composition many of these things are conventional and strictly speaking it is possible to forego them but without clear phraseology there is no good language The principle of equality necessarily introduces several other changes into language In aristocratic ages when each nation tends to stand aloof from all others and likes to have distinct characteristics of its own it often happens that several peoples which have a common origin become nevertheless estranged from each other so that without ceasing to understand the same language they no longer all speak it in the same manner In these ages each nation is divided into a certain number of classes which see but little of each other and do not intermingle Each of these classes contracts and invariably retains habits of mind peculiar to itself and adopts by choice certain words and certain terms which afterwards pass from generation to generation like their estates The same idiom then comprises a language of the poor and a language of the rich a language of the citizen and a language of the nobility a learned language and a vulgar one The deeper the divisions and the more impassable the barriers of society become the more must this be the case I would lay a wager that amongst the castes of India there are amazing variations of language and that there is almost as much difference between the language of the pariah and that of the Brahmin as there is in their dress When on the contrary men being no longer restrained by ranks meet on terms of constant intercourse when castes are destroyed and the classes of society are recruited and intermixed with each other all the words of a language are mingled Those which are unsuitable to the greater number perish the remainder form a common store whence everyone chooses pretty nearly at random Almost all the different dialects which divided the idioms of European nations are manifestly declining there is no patois in the New World and it is disappearing every day from the old countries The influence of this revolution in social conditions is as much felt in style as it is in phraseology Not only does everyone use the same words but a habit springs up of using them without discrimination The rules which style had set up are almost abolished the line ceases to be drawn between expressions which seem by their very nature vulgar and other which appear to be refined Persons springing from different ranks of society carry the terms and expressions they are accustomed to use with them into whatever circumstances they may pass thus the origin of words is lost like the origin of individuals and there is as much confusion in language as there is in society I am aware that in the classification of words there are rules which do not belong to one form of society any more than to another but which are derived from the nature of things Some expressions and phrases are vulgar because the ideas they are meant to express are low in themselves others are of a higher character because the objects they are intended to designate are naturally elevated No intermixture of ranks will ever efface these differences But the principle of equality cannot fail to root out whatever is merely conventional and arbitrary in the forms of thought Perhaps the necessary classification which I pointed out in the last sentence will always be less respected by a democratic people than by any other because amongst such a people there are no men who are permanently disposed by education culture and leisure to study the natural laws of language and who cause those laws to be respected by their own observance of them I shall not quit this topic without touching on a feature of democratic languages which is perhaps more characteristic of them than any other It has already been shown that democratic nations have a taste and sometimes a passion for general ideas and that this arises from their peculiar merits and defects This liking for general ideas is displayed in democratic languages by the continual use of generic terms or abstract expressions and by the manner in which they are employed This is the great merit and the great imperfection of these languages Democratic nations are passionately addicted to generic terms or abstract expressions because these modes of speech enlarge thought and assist the operations of the mind by enabling it to include several objects in a small compass A French democratic writer will be apt to say capacites in the abstract for men of capacity and without particularizing the objects to which their capacity is applied he will talk about actualities to designate in one word the things passing before his eyes at the instant and he will comprehend under the term eventualities whatever may happen in the universe dating from the moment at which he speaks Democratic writers are perpetually coining words of this kind in which they sublimate into further abstraction the abstract terms of the language Nay more to render their mode of speech more succinct they personify the subject of these abstract terms and make it act like a real entity Thus they would say in French La force des choses veut que les capacites gouvernent I cannot better illustrate what I mean than by my own example I have frequently used the word equality in an absolute sense nay I have personified equality in several places thus I have said that equality does such and such things or refrains from doing others It may be affirmed that the writers of the age of Louis XIV would not have used these expressions they would never have thought of using the word equality without applying it to some particular object and they would rather have renounced the term altogether than have consented to make a living personage of it These abstract terms which abound in democratic languages and which are used on every occasion without attaching them to any particular fact enlarge and obscure the thoughts they are intended to convey they render the mode of speech more succinct and the idea contained in it less clear But with regard to language democratic nations prefer obscurity to labor I know not indeed whether this loose style has not some secret charm for those who speak and write amongst these nations As the men who live there are frequently left to the efforts of their individual powers of mind they are almost always a prey to doubt and as their situation in life is forever changing they are never held fast to any of their opinions by the certain tenure of their fortunes Men living in democratic countries are then apt to entertain unsettled ideas and they require loose expressions to convey them As they never know whether the idea they express to day will be appropriate to the new position they may occupy to morrow they naturally acquire a liking for abstract terms An abstract term is like a box with a false bottom you may put in it what ideas you please and take them out again without being observed Amongst all nations generic and abstract terms form the basis of language I do not therefore affect to expel these terms from democratic languages I simply remark that men have an especial tendency in the ages of democracy to multiply words of this kind to take them always by themselves in their most abstract acceptation and to use them on all occasions even when the nature of the discourse does not require them Chapter XVII Of Some Of The Sources Of Poetry Amongst Democratic Nations Various different significations have been given to the word poetry It would weary my readers if I were to lead them into a discussion as to which of these definitions ought to be selected I prefer telling them at once that which I have chosen In my opinion poetry is the search and the delineation of the ideal The poet is he who by suppressing a part of what exists by adding some imaginary touches to the picture and by combining certain real circumstances but which do not in fact concurrently happen completes and extends the work of nature Thus the object of poetry is not to represent what is true but to adorn it and to present to the mind some loftier imagery Verse regarded as the ideal beauty of language may be eminently poetical but verse does not of itself constitute poetry I now proceed to inquire whether amongst the actions the sentiments and the opinions of democratic nations there are any which lead to a conception of ideal beauty and which may for this reason be considered as natural sources of poetry It must in the first place be acknowledged that the taste for ideal beauty and the pleasure derived from the expression of it are never so intense or so diffused amongst a democratic as amongst an aristocratic people In aristocratic nations it sometimes happens that the body goes on to act as it were spontaneously whilst the higher faculties are bound and burdened by repose Amongst these nations the people will very often display poetic tastes and sometimes allow their fancy to range beyond and above what surrounds them But in democracies the love of physical gratification the notion of bettering one s condition the excitement of competition the charm of anticipated success are so many spurs to urge men onwards in the active professions they have embraced without allowing them to deviate for an instant from the track The main stress of the faculties is to this point The imagination is not extinct but its chief function is to devise what may be useful and to represent what is real The principle of equality not only diverts men from the description of ideal beauty it also diminishes the number of objects to be described Aristocracy by maintaining society in a fixed position is favorable to the solidity and duration of positive religions as well as to the stability of political institutions It not only keeps the human mind within a certain sphere of belief but it predisposes the mind to adopt one faith rather than another An aristocratic people will always be prone to place intermediate powers between God and man In this respect it may be said that the aristocratic element is favorable to poetry When the universe is peopled with supernatural creatures not palpable to the senses but discovered by the mind the imagination ranges freely and poets finding a thousand subjects to delineate also find a countless audience to take an interest in their productions In democratic ages it sometimes happens on the contrary that men are as much afloat in matters of belief as they are in their laws Scepticism then draws the imagination of poets back to earth and confines them to the real and visible world Even when the principle of equality does not disturb religious belief it tends to simplify it and to divert attention from secondary agents to fix it principally on the Supreme Power Aristocracy naturally leads the human mind to the contemplation of the past and fixes it there Democracy on the contrary gives men a sort of instinctive distaste for what is ancient In this respect aristocracy is far more favorable to poetry for things commonly grow larger and more obscure as they are more remote and for this twofold reason they are better suited to the delineation of the ideal After having deprived poetry of the past the principle of equality robs it in part of the present Amongst aristocratic nations there are a certain number of privileged personages whose situation is as it were without and above the condition of man to these power wealth fame wit refinement and distinction in all things appear peculiarly to belong The crowd never sees them very closely or does not watch them in minute details and little is needed to make the description of such men poetical On the other hand amongst the same people you will meet with classes so ignorant low and enslaved that they are no less fit objects for poetry from the excess of their rudeness and wretchedness than the former are from their greatness and refinement Besides as the different classes of which an aristocratic community is composed are widely separated and imperfectly acquainted with each other the imagination may always represent them with some addition to or some subtraction from what they really are In democratic communities where men are all insignificant and very much alike each man instantly sees all his fellows when he surveys himself The poets of democratic ages can never therefore take any man in particular as the subject of a piece for an object of slender importance which is distinctly seen on all sides will never lend itself to an ideal conception Thus the principle of equality in proportion as it has established itself in the world has dried up most of the old springs of poetry Let us now attempt to show what new ones it may disclose When scepticism had depopulated heaven and the progress of equality had reduced each individual to smaller and better known proportions the poets not yet aware of what they could substitute for the great themes which were departing together with the aristocracy turned their eyes to inanimate nature As they lost sight of gods and heroes they set themselves to describe streams and mountains Thence originated in the last century that kind of poetry which has been called by way of distinction the descriptive Some have thought that this sort of delineation embellished with all the physical and inanimate objects which cover the earth was the kind of poetry peculiar to democratic ages but I believe this to be an error and that it only belongs to a period of transition I am persuaded that in the end democracy diverts the imagination from all that is external to man and fixes it on man alone Democratic nations may amuse themselves for a while with considering the productions of nature but they are only excited in reality by a survey of themselves Here and here alone the true sources of poetry amongst such nations are to be found and it may be believed that the poets who shall neglect to draw their inspirations hence will lose all sway over the minds which they would enchant and will be left in the end with none but unimpassioned spectators of their transports I have shown how the ideas of progression and of the indefinite perfectibility of the human race belong to democratic ages Democratic nations care but little for what has been but they are haunted by visions of what will be in this direction their unbounded imagination grows and dilates beyond all measure Here then is the wildest range open to the genius of poets which allows them to remove their performances to a sufficient distance from the eye Democracy shuts the past against the poet but opens the future before him As all the citizens who compose a democratic community are nearly equal and alike the poet cannot dwell upon any one of them but the nation itself invites the exercise of his powers The general similitude of individuals which renders any one of them taken separately an improper subject of poetry allows poets to include them all in the same imagery and to take a general survey of the people itself Democractic nations have a clearer perception than any others of their own aspect and an aspect so imposing is admirably fitted to the delineation of the ideal I readily admit that the Americans have no poets I cannot allow that they have no poetic ideas In Europe people talk a great deal of the wilds of America but the Americans themselves never think about them they are insensible to the wonders of inanimate nature and they may be said not to perceive the mighty forests which surround them till they fall beneath the hatchet Their eyes are fixed upon another sight the American people views its own march across these wilds drying swamps turning the course of rivers peopling solitudes and subduing nature This magnificent image of themselves does not meet the gaze of the Americans at intervals only it may be said to haunt every one of them in his least as well as in his most important actions and to be always flitting before his mind Nothing conceivable is so petty so insipid so crowded with paltry interests in one word so anti poetic as the life of a man in the United States But amongst the thoughts which it suggests there is always one which is full of poetry and that is the hidden nerve which gives vigor to the frame In aristocratic ages each people as well as each individual is prone to stand separate and aloof from all others In democratic ages the extreme fluctuations of men and the impatience of their desires keep them perpetually on the move so that the inhabitants of different countries intermingle see listen to and borrow from each other s stores It is not only then the members of the same community who grow more alike communities are themselves assimilated to one another and the whole assemblage presents to the eye of the spectator one vast democracy each citizen of which is a people This displays the aspect of mankind for the first time in the broadest light All that belongs to the existence of the human race taken as a whole to its vicissitudes and to its future becomes an abundant mine of poetry The poets who lived in aristocratic ages have been eminently successful in their delineations of certain incidents in the life of a people or a man but none of them ever ventured to include within his performances the destinies of mankind a task which poets writing in democratic ages may attempt At that same time at which every man raising his eyes above his country begins at length to discern mankind at large the Divinity is more and more manifest to the human mind in full and entire majesty If in democratic ages faith in positive religions be often shaken and the belief in intermediate agents by whatever name they are called be overcast on the other hand men are disposed to conceive a far broader idea of Providence itself and its interference in human affairs assumes a new and more imposing appearance to their eyes Looking at the human race as one great whole they easily conceive that its destinies are regulated by the same design and in the actions of every individual they are led to acknowledge a trace of that universal and eternal plan on which God rules our race This consideration may be taken as another prolific source of poetry which is opened in democratic ages Democratic poets will always appear trivial and frigid if they seek to invest gods demons or angels with corporeal forms and if they attempt to draw them down from heaven to dispute the supremacy of earth But if they strive to connect the great events they commemorate with the general providential designs which govern the universe and without showing the finger of the Supreme Governor reveal the thoughts of the Supreme Mind their works will be admired and understood for the imagination of their contemporaries takes this direction of its own accord It may be foreseen in the like manner that poets living in democratic ages will prefer the delineation of passions and ideas to that of persons and achievements The language the dress and the daily actions of men in democracies are repugnant to ideal conceptions These things are not poetical in themselves and if it were otherwise they would cease to be so because they are too familiar to all those to whom the poet would speak of them This forces the poet constantly to search below the external surface which is palpable to the senses in order to read the inner soul and nothing lends itself more to the delineation of the ideal than the scrutiny of the hidden depths in the immaterial nature of man I need not to ramble over earth and sky to discover a wondrous object woven of contrasts of greatness and littleness infinite of intense gloom and of amazing brightness capable at once of exciting pity admiration terror contempt I find that object in myself Man springs out of nothing crosses time and disappears forever in the bosom of God he is seen but for a moment staggering on the verge of the two abysses and there he is lost If man were wholly ignorant of himself he would have no poetry in him for it is impossible to describe what the mind does not conceive If man clearly discerned his own nature his imagination would remain idle and would have nothing to add to the picture But the nature of man is sufficiently disclosed for him to apprehend something of himself and sufficiently obscure for all the rest to be plunged in thick darkness in which he gropes forever and forever in vain to lay hold on some completer notion of his being Amongst a democratic people poetry will not be fed with legendary lays or the memorials of old traditions The poet will not attempt to people the universe with supernatural beings in whom his readers and his own fancy have ceased to believe nor will he present virtues and vices in the mask of frigid personification which are better received under their own features All these resources fail him but Man remains and the poet needs no more The destinies of mankind man himself taken aloof from his age and his country and standing in the presence of Nature and of God with his passions his doubts his rare prosperities and inconceivable wretchedness will become the chief if not the sole theme of poetry amongst these nations Experience may confirm this assertion if we consider the productions of the greatest poets who have appeared since the world has been turned to democracy The authors of our age who have so admirably delineated the features of Faust Childe Harold Rene and Jocelyn did not seek to record the actions of an individual but to enlarge and to throw light on some of the obscurer recesses of the human heart Such are the poems of democracy The principle of equality does not then destroy all the subjects of poetry it renders them less numerous but more vast Chapter XVIII Of The Inflated Style Of American Writers And Orators I have frequently remarked that the Americans who generally treat of business in clear plain language devoid of all ornament and so extremely simple as to be often coarse are apt to become inflated as soon as they attempt a more poetical diction They then vent their pomposity from one end of a harangue to the other and to hear them lavish imagery on every occasion one might fancy that they never spoke of anything with simplicity The English are more rarely given to a similar failing The cause of this may be pointed out without much difficulty In democratic communities each citizen is habitually engaged in the contemplation of a very puny object namely himself If he ever raises his looks higher he then perceives nothing but the immense form of society at large or the still more imposing aspect of mankind His ideas are all either extremely minute and clear or extremely general and vague what lies between is an open void When he has been drawn out of his own sphere therefore he always expects that some amazing object will be offered to his attention and it is on these terms alone that he consents to tear himself for an instant from the petty complicated cares which form the charm and the excitement of his life This appears to me sufficiently to explain why men in democracies whose concerns are in general so paltry call upon their poets for conceptions so vast and descriptions so unlimited The authors on their part do not fail to obey a propensity of which they themselves partake they perpetually inflate their imaginations and expanding them beyond all bounds they not unfrequently abandon the great in order to reach the gigantic By these means they hope to attract the observation of the multitude and to fix it easily upon themselves nor are their hopes disappointed for as the multitude seeks for nothing in poetry but subjects of very vast dimensions it has neither the time to measure with accuracy the proportions of all the subjects set before it nor a taste sufficiently correct to perceive at once in what respect they are out of proportion The author and the public at once vitiate one another We have just seen that amongst democratic nations the sources of poetry are grand but not abundant They are soon exhausted and poets not finding the elements of the ideal in what is real and true abandon them entirely and create monsters I do not fear that the poetry of democratic nations will prove too insipid or that it will fly too near the ground I rather apprehend that it will be forever losing itself in the clouds and that it will range at last to purely imaginary regions I fear that the productions of democratic poets may often be surcharged with immense and incoherent imagery with exaggerated descriptions and strange creations and that the fantastic beings of their brain may sometimes make us regret the world of reality Chapter XIX Some Observations On The Drama Amongst Democratic Nations When the revolution which subverts the social and political state of an aristocratic people begins to penetrate into literature it generally first manifests itself in the drama and it always remains conspicuous there The spectator of a dramatic piece is to a certain extent taken by surprise by the impression it conveys He has no time to refer to his memory or to consult those more able to judge than himself It does not occur to him to resist the new literary tendencies which begin to be felt by him he yields to them before he knows what they are Authors are very prompt in discovering which way the taste of the public is thus secretly inclined They shape their productions accordingly and the literature of the stage after having served to indicate the approaching literary revolution speedily completes its accomplishment If you would judge beforehand of the literature of a people which is lapsing into democracy study its dramatic productions The literature of the stage moreover even amongst aristocratic nations constitutes the most democratic part of their literature No kind of literary gratification is so much within the reach of the multitude as that which is derived from theatrical representations Neither preparation nor study is required to enjoy them they lay hold on you in the midst of your prejudices and your ignorance When the yet untutored love of the pleasures of the mind begins to affect a class of the community it instantly draws them to the stage The theatres of aristocratic nations have always been filled with spectators not belonging to the aristocracy At the theatre alone the higher ranks mix with the middle and the lower classes there alone do the former consent to listen to the opinion of the latter or at least to allow them to give an opinion at all At the theatre men of cultivation and of literary attainments have always had more difficulty than elsewhere in making their taste prevail over that of the people and in preventing themselves from being carried away by the latter The pit has frequently made laws for the boxes If it be difficult for an aristocracy to prevent the people from getting the upper hand in the theatre it will readily be understood that the people will be supreme there when democratic principles have crept into the laws and manners when ranks are intermixed when minds as well as fortunes are brought more nearly together and when the upper class has lost with its hereditary wealth its power its precedents and its leisure The tastes and propensities natural to democratic nations in respect to literature will therefore first be discernible in the drama and it may be foreseen that they will break out there with vehemence In written productions the literary canons of aristocracy will be gently gradually and so to speak legally modified at the theatre they will be riotously overthrown The drama brings out most of the good qualities and almost all the defects inherent in democratic literature Democratic peoples hold erudition very cheap and care but little for what occurred at Rome and Athens they want to hear something which concerns themselves and the delineation of the present age is what they demand When the heroes and the manners of antiquity are frequently brought upon the stage and dramatic authors faithfully observe the rules of antiquated precedent that is enough to warrant a conclusion that the democratic classes have not yet got the upper hand of the theatres Racine makes a very humble apology in the preface to the Britannicus for having disposed of Junia amongst the Vestals who according to Aulus Gellius he says admitted no one below six years of age nor above ten We may be sure that he would neither have accused himself of the offence nor defended himself from censure if he had written for our contemporaries A fact of this kind not only illustrates the state of literature at the time when it occurred but also that of society itself A democratic stage does not prove that the nation is in a state of democracy for as we have just seen even in aristocracies it may happen that democratic tastes affect the drama but when the spirit of aristocracy reigns exclusively on the stage the fact irrefragably demonstrates that the whole of society is aristocratic and it may be boldly inferred that the same lettered and learned class which sways the dramatic writers commands the people and governs the country The refined tastes and the arrogant bearing of an aristocracy will rarely fail to lead it when it manages the stage to make a kind of selection in human nature Some of the conditions of society claim its chief interest and the scenes which delineate their manners are preferred upon the stage Certain virtues and even certain vices are thought more particularly to deserve to figure there and they are applauded whilst all others are excluded Upon the stage as well as elsewhere an aristocratic audience will only meet personages of quality and share the emotions of kings The same thing applies to style an aristocracy is apt to impose upon dramatic authors certain modes of expression which give the key in which everything is to be delivered By these means the stage frequently comes to delineate only one side of man or sometimes even to represent what is not to be met with in human nature at all to rise above nature and to go beyond it In democratic communities the spectators have no such partialities and they rarely display any such antipathies they like to see upon the stage that medley of conditions of feelings and of opinions which occurs before their eyes The drama becomes more striking more common and more true Sometimes however those who write for the stage in democracies also transgress the bounds of human nature but it is on a different side from their predecessors By seeking to represent in minute detail the little singularities of the moment and the peculiar characteristics of certain personages they forget to portray the general features of the race When the democratic classes rule the stage they introduce as much license in the manner of treating subjects as in the choice of them As the love of the drama is of all literary tastes that which is most natural to democratic nations the number of authors and of spectators as well as of theatrical representations is constantly increasing amongst these communities A multitude composed of elements so different and scattered in so many different places cannot acknowledge the same rules or submit to the same laws No concurrence is possible amongst judges so numerous who know not when they may meet again and therefore each pronounces his own sentence on the piece If the effect of democracy is generally to question the authority of all literary rules and conventions on the stage it abolishes them altogether and puts in their place nothing but the whim of each author and of each public The drama also displays in an especial manner the truth of what I have said before in speaking more generally of style and art in democratic literature In reading the criticisms which were occasioned by the dramatic productions of the age of Louis XIV one is surprised to remark the great stress which the public laid on the probability of the plot and the importance which was attached to the perfect consistency of the characters and to their doing nothing which could not be easily explained and understood The value which was set upon the forms of language at that period and the paltry strife about words with which dramatic authors were assailed are no less surprising It would seem that the men of the age of Louis XIV attached very exaggerated importance to those details which may be perceived in the study but which escape attention on the stage For after all the principal object of a dramatic piece is to be performed and its chief merit is to affect the audience But the audience and the readers in that age were the same on quitting the theatre they called up the author for judgment to their own firesides In democracies dramatic pieces are listened to but not read Most of those who frequent the amusements of the stage do not go there to seek the pleasures of the mind but the keen emotions of the heart They do not expect to hear a fine literary work but to see a play and provided the author writes the language of his country correctly enough to be understood and that his characters excite curiosity and awaken sympathy the audience are satisfied They ask no more of fiction and immediately return to real life Accuracy of style is therefore less required because the attentive observance of its rules is less perceptible on the stage As for the probability of the plot it is incompatible with perpetual novelty surprise and rapidity of invention It is therefore neglected and the public excuses the neglect You may be sure that if you succeed in bringing your audience into the presence of something that affects them they will not care by what road you brought them there and they will never reproach you for having excited their emotions in spite of dramatic rules The Americans very broadly display all the different propensities which I have here described when they go to the theatres but it must be acknowledged that as yet a very small number of them go to theatres at all Although playgoers and plays have prodigiously increased in the United States in the last forty years the population indulges in this kind of amusement with the greatest reserve This is attributable to peculiar causes which the reader is already acquainted with and of which a few words will suffice to remind him The Puritans who founded the American republics were not only enemies to amusements but they professed an especial abhorrence for the stage They considered it as an abominable pastime and as long as their principles prevailed with undivided sway scenic performances were wholly unknown amongst them These opinions of the first fathers of the colony have left very deep marks on the minds of their descendants The extreme regularity of habits and the great strictness of manners which are observable in the United States have as yet opposed additional obstacles to the growth of dramatic art There are no dramatic subjects in a country which has witnessed no great political catastrophes and in which love invariably leads by a straight and easy road to matrimony People who spend every day in the week in making money and the Sunday in going to church have nothing to invite the muse of Comedy A single fact suffices to show that the stage is not very popular in the United States The Americans whose laws allow of the utmost freedom and even license of language in all other respects have nevertheless subjected their dramatic authors to a sort of censorship Theatrical performances can only take place by permission of the municipal authorities This may serve to show how much communities are like individuals they surrender themselves unscrupulously to their ruling passions and afterwards take the greatest care not to yield too much to the vehemence of tastes which they do not possess No portion of literature is connected by closer or more numerous ties with the present condition of society than the drama The drama of one period can never be suited to the following age if in the interval an important revolution has changed the manners and the laws of the nation The great authors of a preceding age may be read but pieces written for a different public will not be followed The dramatic authors of the past live only in books The traditional taste of certain individuals vanity fashion or the genius of an actor may sustain or resuscitate for a time the aristocratic drama amongst a democracy but it will speedily fall away of itself not overthrown but abandoned Chapter XX Characteristics Of Historians In Democratic Ages Historians who write in aristocratic ages are wont to refer all occurrences to the particular will or temper of certain individuals and they are apt to attribute the most important revolutions to very slight accidents They trace out the smallest causes with sagacity and frequently leave the greatest unperceived Historians who live in democratic ages exhibit precisely opposite characteristics Most of them attribute hardly any influence to the individual over the destiny of the race nor to citizens over the fate of a people but on the other hand they assign great general causes to all petty incidents These contrary tendencies explain each other When the historian of aristocratic ages surveys the theatre of the world he at once perceives a very small number of prominent actors who manage the whole piece These great personages who occupy the front of the stage arrest the observation and fix it on themselves and whilst the historian is bent on penetrating the secret motives which make them speak and act the rest escape his memory The importance of the things which some men are seen to do gives him an exaggerated estimate of the influence which one man may possess and naturally leads him to think that in order to explain the impulses of the multitude it is necessary to refer them to the particular influence of some one individual When on the contrary all the citizens are independent of one another and each of them is individually weak no one is seen to exert a great or still less a lasting power over the community At first sight individuals appear to be absolutely devoid of any influence over it and society would seem to advance alone by the free and voluntary concurrence of all the men who compose it This naturally prompts the mind to search for that general reason which operates upon so many men s faculties at the same time and turns them simultaneously in the same direction I am very well convinced that even amongst democratic nations the genius the vices or the virtues of certain individuals retard or accelerate the natural current of a people s history but causes of this secondary and fortuitous nature are infinitely more various more concealed more complex less powerful and consequently less easy to trace in periods of equality than in ages of aristocracy when the task of the historian is simply to detach from the mass of general events the particular influences of one man or of a few men In the former case the historian is soon wearied by the toil his mind loses itself in this labyrinth and in his inability clearly to discern or conspicuously to point out the influence of individuals he denies their existence He prefers talking about the characteristics of race the physical conformation of the country or the genius of civilization which abridges his own labors and satisfies his reader far better at less cost M de Lafayette says somewhere in his Memoirs that the exaggerated system of general causes affords surprising consolations to second rate statesmen I will add that its effects are not less consolatory to second rate historians it can always furnish a few mighty reasons to extricate them from the most difficult part of their work and it indulges the indolence or incapacity of their minds whilst it confers upon them the honors of deep thinking For myself I am of opinion that at all times one great portion of the events of this world are attributable to general facts and another to special influences These two kinds of cause are always in operation their proportion only varies General facts serve to explain more things in democratic than in aristocratic ages and fewer things are then assignable to special influences At periods of aristocracy the reverse takes place special influences are stronger general causes weaker unless indeed we consider as a general cause the fact itself of the inequality of conditions which allows some individuals to baffle the natural tendencies of all the rest The historians who seek to describe what occurs in democratic societies are right therefore in assigning much to general causes and in devoting their chief attention to discover them but they are wrong in wholly denying the special influence of individuals because they cannot easily trace or follow it The historians who live in democratic ages are not only prone to assign a great cause to every incident but they are also given to connect incidents together so as to deduce a system from them In aristocratic ages as the attention of historians is constantly drawn to individuals the connection of events escapes them or rather they do not believe in any such connection To them the clew of history seems every instant crossed and broken by the step of man In democratic ages on the contrary as the historian sees much more of actions than of actors he may easily establish some kind of sequency and methodical order amongst the former Ancient literature which is so rich in fine historical compositions does not contain a single great historical system whilst the poorest of modern literatures abound with them It would appear that the ancient historians did not make sufficient use of those general theories which our historical writers are ever ready to carry to excess Those who write in democratic ages have another more dangerous tendency When the traces of individual action upon nations are lost it often happens that the world goes on to move though the moving agent is no longer discoverable As it becomes extremely difficult to discern and to analyze the reasons which acting separately on the volition of each member of the community concur in the end to produce movement in the old mass men are led to believe that this movement is involuntary and that societies unconsciously obey some superior force ruling over them But even when the general fact which governs the private volition of all individuals is supposed to be discovered upon the earth the principle of human free will is not secure A cause sufficiently extensive to affect millions of men at once and sufficiently strong to bend them all together in the same direction may well seem irresistible having seen that mankind do yield to it the mind is close upon the inference that mankind cannot resist it Historians who live in democratic ages then not only deny that the few have any power of acting upon the destiny of a people but they deprive the people themselves of the power of modifying their own condition and they subject them either to an inflexible Providence or to some blind necessity According to them each nation is indissolubly bound by its position its origin its precedents and its character to a certain lot which no efforts can ever change They involve generation in generation and thus going back from age to age and from necessity to necessity up to the origin of the world they forge a close and enormous chain which girds and binds the human race To their minds it is not enough to show what events have occurred they would fain show that events could not have occurred otherwise They take a nation arrived at a certain stage of its history and they affirm that it could not but follow the track which brought it thither It is easier to make such an assertion than to show by what means the nation might have adopted a better course In reading the historians of aristocratic ages and especially those of antiquity it would seem that to be master of his lot and to govern his fellow creatures man requires only to be master of himself In perusing the historical volumes which our age has produced it would seem that man is utterly powerless over himself and over all around him The historians of antiquity taught how to command those of our time teach only how to obey in their writings the author often appears great but humanity is always diminutive If this doctrine of necessity which is so attractive to those who write history in democratic ages passes from authors to their readers till it infects the whole mass of the community and gets possession of the public mind it will soon paralyze the activity of modern society and reduce Christians to the level of the Turks I would moreover observe that such principles are peculiarly dangerous at the period at which we are arrived Our contemporaries are but too prone to doubt of the human free will because each of them feels himself confined on every side by his own weakness but they are still willing to acknowledge the strength and independence of men united in society Let not this principle be lost sight of for the great object in our time is to raise the faculties of men not to complete their prostration Chapter XXI Of Parliamentary Eloquence In The United States Amongst aristocratic nations all the members of the community are connected with and dependent upon each other the graduated scale of different ranks acts as a tie which keeps everyone in his proper place and the whole body in subordination Something of the same kind always occurs in the political assemblies of these nations Parties naturally range themselves under certain leaders whom they obey by a sort of instinct which is only the result of habits contracted elsewhere They carry the manners of general society into the lesser assemblage In democratic countries it often happens that a great number of citizens are tending to the same point but each one only moves thither or at least flatters himself that he moves of his own accord Accustomed to regulate his doings by personal impulse alone he does not willingly submit to dictation from without This taste and habit of independence accompany him into the councils of the nation If he consents to connect himself with other men in the prosecution of the same purpose at least he chooses to remain free to contribute to the common success after his own fashion Hence it is that in democratic countries parties are so impatient of control and are never manageable except in moments of great public danger Even then the authority of leaders which under such circumstances may be able to make men act or speak hardly ever reaches the extent of making them keep silence Amongst aristocratic nations the members of political assemblies are at the same time members of the aristocracy Each of them enjoys high established rank in his own right and the position which he occupies in the assembly is often less important in his eyes than that which he fills in the country This consoles him for playing no part in the discussion of public affairs and restrains him from too eagerly attempting to play an insignificant one In America it generally happens that a Representative only becomes somebody from his position in the Assembly He is therefore perpetually haunted by a craving to acquire importance there and he feels a petulant desire to be constantly obtruding his opinions upon the House His own vanity is not the only stimulant which urges him on in this course but that of his constituents and the continual necessity of propitiating them Amongst aristocratic nations a member of the legislature is rarely in strict dependence upon his constituents he is frequently to them a sort of unavoidable representative sometimes they are themselves strictly dependent upon him and if at length they reject him he may easily get elected elsewhere or retiring from public life he may still enjoy the pleasures of splendid idleness In a democratic country like the United States a Representative has hardly ever a lasting hold on the minds of his constituents However small an electoral body may be the fluctuations of democracy are constantly changing its aspect it must therefore be courted unceasingly He is never sure of his supporters and if they forsake him he is left without a resource for his natural position is not sufficiently elevated for him to be easily known to those not close to him and with the complete state of independence prevailing among the people he cannot hope that his friends or the government will send him down to be returned by an electoral body unacquainted with him The seeds of his fortune are therefore sown in his own neighborhood from that nook of earth he must start to raise himself to the command of a people and to influence the destinies of the world Thus it is natural that in democratic countries the members of political assemblies think more of their constituents than of their party whilst in aristocracies they think more of their party than of their constituents But what ought to be said to gratify constituents is not always what ought to be said in order to serve the party to which Representatives profess to belong The general interest of a party frequently demands that members belonging to it should not speak on great questions which they understand imperfectly that they should speak but little on those minor questions which impede the great ones lastly and for the most part that they should not speak at all To keep silence is the most useful service that an indifferent spokesman can render to the commonwealth Constituents however do not think so The population of a district sends a representative to take a part in the government of a country because they entertain a very lofty notion of his merits As men appear greater in proportion to the littleness of the objects by which they are surrounded it may be assumed that the opinion entertained of the delegate will be so much the higher as talents are more rare among his constituents It will therefore frequently happen that the less constituents have to expect from their representative the more they will anticipate from him and however incompetent he may be they will not fail to call upon him for signal exertions corresponding to the rank they have conferred upon him Independently of his position as a legislator of the State electors also regard their Representative as the natural patron of the constituency in the Legislature they almost consider him as the proxy of each of his supporters and they flatter themselves that he will not be less zealous in defense of their private interests than of those of the country Thus electors are well assured beforehand that the Representative of their choice will be an orator that he will speak often if he can and that in case he is forced to refrain he will strive at any rate to compress into his less frequent orations an inquiry into all the great questions of state combined with a statement of all the petty grievances they have themselves to complain to so that though he be not able to come forward frequently he should on each occasion prove what he is capable of doing and that instead of perpetually lavishing his powers he should occasionally condense them in a small compass so as to furnish a sort of complete and brilliant epitome of his constituents and of himself On these terms they will vote for him at the next election These conditions drive worthy men of humble abilities to despair who knowing their own powers would never voluntarily have come forward But thus urged on the Representative begins to speak to the great alarm of his friends and rushing imprudently into the midst of the most celebrated orators he perplexes the debate and wearies the House All laws which tend to make the Representative more dependent on the elector not only affect the conduct of the legislators as I have remarked elsewhere but also their language They exercise a simultaneous influence on affairs themselves and on the manner in which affairs are discussed There is hardly a member of Congress who can make up his mind to go home without having despatched at least one speech to his constituents nor who will endure any interruption until he has introduced into his harangue whatever useful suggestions may be made touching the four and twenty States of which the Union is composed and especially the district which he represents He therefore presents to the mind of his auditors a succession of great general truths which he himself only comprehends and expresses confusedly and of petty minutia which he is but too able to discover and to point out The consequence is that the debates of that great assembly are frequently vague and perplexed and that they seem rather to drag their slow length along than to advance towards a distinct object Some such state of things will I believe always arise in the public assemblies of democracies Propitious circumstances and good laws might succeed in drawing to the legislature of a democratic people men very superior to those who are returned by the Americans to Congress but nothing will ever prevent the men of slender abilities who sit there from obtruding themselves with complacency and in all ways upon the public The evil does not appear to me to be susceptible of entire cure because it not only originates in the tactics of that assembly but in its constitution and in that of the country The inhabitants of the United States seem themselves to consider the matter in this light and they show their long experience of parliamentary life not by abstaining from making bad speeches but by courageously submitting to hear them made They are resigned to it as to an evil which they know to be inevitable We have shown the petty side of political debates in democratic assemblies let us now exhibit the more imposing one The proceedings within the Parliament of England for the last one hundred and fifty years have never occasioned any great sensation out of that country the opinions and feelings expressed by the speakers have never awakened much sympathy even amongst the nations placed nearest to the great arena of British liberty whereas Europe was excited by the very first debates which took place in the small colonial assemblies of America at the time of the Revolution This was attributable not only to particular and fortuitous circumstances but to general and lasting causes I can conceive nothing more admirable or more powerful than a great orator debating on great questions of state in a democratic assembly As no particular class is ever represented there by men commissioned to defend its own interests it is always to the whole nation and in the name of the whole nation that the orator speaks This expands his thoughts and heightens his power of language As precedents have there but little weight as there are no longer any privileges attached to certain property nor any rights inherent in certain bodies or in certain individuals the mind must have recourse to general truths derived from human nature to resolve the particular question under discussion Hence the political debates of a democratic people however small it may be have a degree of breadth which frequently renders them attractive to mankind All men are interested by them because they treat of man who is everywhere the same Amongst the greatest aristocratic nations on the contrary the most general questions are almost always argued on some special grounds derived from the practice of a particular time or the rights of a particular class which interest that class alone or at most the people amongst whom that class happens to exist It is owing to this as much as to the greatness of the French people and the favorable disposition of the nations who listen to them that the great effect which the French political debates sometimes produce in the world must be attributed The orators of France frequently speak to mankind even when they are addressing their countrymen only Section two Influence of Democracy on the Feelings of Americans 
2240_148521_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Chapter I Why Democratic Nations Show A More Ardent And Enduring Love Of Equality Than Of Liberty
none	none	 The first and most intense passion which is engendered by the equality of conditions is I need hardly say the love of that same equality My readers will therefore not be surprised that I speak of its before all others 
2240_148521_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Everybody has remarked that in our time and especially in France this passion for equality is every day gaining ground in the human heart 
none	none	It has been said a hundred times that our contemporaries are far more ardently and tenaciously attached to equality than to freedom but as I do not find that the causes of the fact have been sufficiently analyzed I shall endeavor to point them out 
2240_148521_000003_000000	train-clean-360	It is possible to imagine an extreme point at which freedom and equality would meet and be confounded together 
none	none	Let us suppose that all the members of the community take a part in the government and that each of them has an equal right to take a part in it 
2240_148521_000003_000002	train-clean-360	As none is different from his fellows none can exercise a tyrannical power men will be perfectly free because they will all be entirely equal and they will all be perfectly equal because they will be entirely free 
2240_148521_000003_000003	train-clean-360	To this ideal state democratic nations tend 
2240_148521_000003_000004	train-clean-360	Such is the completest form that equality can assume upon earth but there are a thousand others which without being equally perfect are not less cherished by those nations 
2240_148521_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The principle of equality may be established in civil society without prevailing in the political world 
none	none	Equal rights may exist of indulging in the same pleasures of entering the same professions of frequenting the same places in a word of living in the same manner and seeking wealth by the same means although all men do not take an equal share in the government 
2240_148521_000004_000002	train-clean-360	A kind of equality may even be established in the political world though there should be no political freedom there 
2240_148521_000004_000003	train-clean-360	A man may be the equal of all his countrymen save one who is the master of all without distinction and who selects equally from among them all the agents of his power 
2240_148521_000004_000004	train-clean-360	Several other combinations might be easily imagined by which very great equality would be united to institutions more or less free or even to institutions wholly without freedom Although men cannot become absolutely equal unless they be entirely free and consequently equality pushed to its furthest extent may be confounded with freedom yet there is good reason for distinguishing the one from the other 
none	none	The taste which men have for liberty and that which they feel for equality are in fact two different things and I am not afraid to add that amongst democratic nations they are two unequal things Upon close inspection it will be seen that there is in every age some peculiar and preponderating fact with which all others are connected this fact almost always gives birth to some pregnant idea or some ruling passion which attracts to itself and bears away in its course all the feelings and opinions of the time it is like a great stream towards which each of the surrounding rivulets seems to flow Freedom has appeared in the world at different times and under various forms it has not been exclusively bound to any social condition and it is not confined to democracies 
2240_148521_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Freedom cannot therefore form the distinguishing characteristic of democratic ages 
none	none	The peculiar and preponderating fact which marks those ages as its own is the equality of conditions the ruling passion of men in those periods is the love of this equality 
2240_148521_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Ask not what singular charm the men of democratic ages find in being equal or what special reasons they may have for clinging so tenaciously to equality rather than to the other advantages which society holds out to them equality is the distinguishing characteristic of the age they live in that of itself is enough to explain that they prefer it to all the rest 
2240_148521_000006_000000	train-clean-360	But independently of this reason there are several others which will at all times habitually lead men to prefer equality to freedom 
none	none	If a people could ever succeed in destroying or even in diminishing the equality which prevails in its own body this could only be accomplished by long and laborious efforts 
2240_148521_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Its social condition must be modified its laws abolished its opinions superseded its habits changed its manners corrupted 
2240_148521_000006_000003	train-clean-360	But political liberty is more easily lost to neglect to hold it fast is to allow it to escape 
2240_148521_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Men therefore not only cling to equality because it is dear to them they also adhere to it because they think it will last forever 
2240_148521_000007_000000	train-clean-360	That political freedom may compromise in its excesses the tranquillity the property the lives of individuals is obvious to the narrowest and most unthinking minds 
none	none	But on the contrary none but attentive and clear sighted men perceive the perils with which equality threatens us and they commonly avoid pointing them out 
2240_148521_000007_000002	train-clean-360	They know that the calamities they apprehend are remote and flatter themselves that they will only fall upon future generations for which the present generation takes but little thought 
none	none	The evils which freedom sometimes brings with it are immediate they are apparent to all and all are more or less affected by them 
2240_148521_000007_000004	train-clean-360	The evils which extreme equality may produce are slowly disclosed they creep gradually into the social frame they are only seen at intervals and at the moment at which they become most violent habit already causes them to be no longer felt 
none	none	The advantages which freedom brings are only shown by length of time and it is always easy to mistake the cause in which they originate The advantages of equality are instantaneous and they may constantly be traced from their source Political liberty bestows exalted pleasures from time to time upon a certain number of citizens Equality every day confers a number of small enjoyments on every man The charms of equality are every instant felt and are within the reach of all the noblest hearts are not insensible to them and the most vulgar souls exult in them The passion which equality engenders must therefore be at once strong and general 
2240_148521_000007_000010	train-clean-360	Men cannot enjoy political liberty unpurchased by some sacrifices and they never obtain it without great exertions 
2240_148521_000007_000011	train-clean-360	But the pleasures of equality are self proffered each of the petty incidents of life seems to occasion them and in order to taste them nothing is required but to live 
2240_148521_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Democratic nations are at all times fond of equality but there are certain epochs at which the passion they entertain for it swells to the height of fury 
2240_148521_000008_000001	train-clean-360	This occurs at the moment when the old social system long menaced completes its own destruction after a last intestine struggle and when the barriers of rank are at length thrown down 
none	none	At such times men pounce upon equality as their booty and they cling to it as to some precious treasure which they fear to lose 
2240_148521_000008_000003	train-clean-360	The passion for equality penetrates on every side into men s hearts expands there and fills them entirely 
none	none	Tell them not that by this blind surrender of themselves to an exclusive passion they risk their dearest interests they are deaf 
2240_148521_000008_000005	train-clean-360	Show them not freedom escaping from their grasp whilst they are looking another way they are blind or rather they can discern but one sole object to be desired in the universe 
2240_148521_000009_000000	train-clean-360	What I have said is applicable to all democratic nations what I am about to say concerns the French alone 
none	none	Amongst most modern nations and especially amongst all those of the Continent of Europe the taste and the idea of freedom only began to exist and to extend themselves at the time when social conditions were tending to equality and as a consequence of that very equality 
2240_148521_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Absolute kings were the most efficient levellers of ranks amongst their subjects 
none	none	Amongst these nations equality preceded freedom equality was therefore a fact of some standing when freedom was still a novelty the one had already created customs opinions and laws belonging to it when the other alone and for the first time came into actual existence Thus the latter was still only an affair of opinion and of taste whilst the former had already crept into the habits of the people possessed itself of their manners and given a particular turn to the smallest actions of their lives Can it be wondered that the men of our own time prefer the one to the other 
2240_148521_000010_000000	train-clean-360	I think that democratic communities have a natural taste for freedom left to themselves they will seek it cherish it and view any privation of it with regret 
2240_148521_000010_000001	train-clean-360	But for equality their passion is ardent insatiable incessant invincible they call for equality in freedom and if they cannot obtain that they still call for equality in slavery They will endure poverty servitude barbarism but they will not endure aristocracy 
2240_148521_000010_000002	train-clean-360	This is true at all times and especially true in our own All men and all powers seeking to cope with this irresistible passion will be overthrown and destroyed by it 
2240_148521_000010_000003	train-clean-360	In our age freedom cannot be established without it and despotism itself cannot reign without its support 
2240_148521_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Chapter II Of Individualism In Democratic Countries
none	none	 I have shown how it is that in ages of equality every man seeks for his opinions within himself I am now about to show how it is that in the same ages all his feelings are turned towards himself alone Individualism a is a novel expression to which a novel idea has given birth 
2240_148521_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Our fathers were only acquainted with egotism 
2240_148521_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Egotism is a passionate and exaggerated love of self which leads a man to connect everything with his own person and to prefer himself to everything in the world 
none	none	Individualism is a mature and calm feeling which disposes each member of the community to sever himself from the mass of his fellow creatures and to draw apart with his family and his friends so that after he has thus formed a little circle of his own he willingly leaves society at large to itself Egotism originates in blind instinct individualism proceeds from erroneous judgment more than from depraved feelings it originates as much in the deficiencies of the mind as in the perversity of the heart 
2240_148521_000012_000005	train-clean-360	Egotism blights the germ of all virtue individualism at first only saps the virtues of public life but in the long run it attacks and destroys all others and is at length absorbed in downright egotism 
none	none	Egotism is a vice as old as the world which does not belong to one form of society more than to another individualism is of democratic origin and it threatens to spread in the same ratio as the equality of conditions Footnote a I adopt the expression of the original however strange it may seem to the English ear partly because it illustrates the remark on the introduction of general terms into democratic language which was made in a preceding chapter and partly because I know of no English word exactly equivalent to the expression The chapter itself defines the meaning attached to it by the author Translator s Note Amongst aristocratic nations as families remain for centuries in the same condition often on the same spot all generations become as it were contemporaneous 
2240_148521_000014_000001	train-clean-360	A man almost always knows his forefathers and respects them he thinks he already sees his remote descendants and he loves them 
2240_148521_000014_000002	train-clean-360	He willingly imposes duties on himself towards the former and the latter and he will frequently sacrifice his personal gratifications to those who went before and to those who will come after him 
2240_148521_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Aristocratic institutions have moreover the effect of closely binding every man to several of his fellow citizens 
none	none	As the classes of an aristocratic people are strongly marked and permanent each of them is regarded by its own members as a sort of lesser country more tangible and more cherished than the country at large 
2240_148521_000014_000005	train-clean-360	As in aristocratic communities all the citizens occupy fixed positions one above the other the result is that each of them always sees a man above himself whose patronage is necessary to him and below himself another man whose company operation he may claim 
2240_148521_000014_000006	train-clean-360	Men living in aristocratic ages are therefore almost always closely attached to something placed out of their own sphere and they are often disposed to forget themselves 
2240_148521_000014_000007	train-clean-360	It is true that in those ages the notion of human fellowship is faint and that men seldom think of sacrificing themselves for mankind but they often sacrifice themselves for other men 
2240_148521_000014_000008	train-clean-360	In democratic ages on the contrary when the duties of each individual to the race are much more clear devoted service to any one man becomes more rare the bond of human affection is extended but it is relaxed 
none	none	Amongst democratic nations new families are constantly springing up others are constantly falling away and all that remain change their condition the woof of time is every instant broken and the track of generations effaced 
2240_148521_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Those who went before are soon forgotten of those who will come after no one has any idea the interest of man is confined to those in close propinquity to himself 
2240_148521_000015_000002	train-clean-360	As each class approximates to other classes and intermingles with them its members become indifferent and as strangers to one another 
2240_148521_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Aristocracy had made a chain of all the members of the community from the peasant to the king democracy breaks that chain and severs every link of it 
none	none	As social conditions become more equal the number of persons increases who although they are neither rich enough nor powerful enough to exercise any great influence over their fellow creatures have nevertheless acquired or retained sufficient education and fortune to satisfy their own wants They owe nothing to any man they expect nothing from any man they acquire the habit of always considering themselves as standing alone and they are apt to imagine that their whole destiny is in their own hands Thus not only does democracy make every man forget his ancestors but it hides his descendants and separates his contemporaries from him it throws him back forever upon himself alone and threatens in the end to confine him entirely within the solitude of his own heart Chapter III Individualism Stronger At The Close Of A Democratic Revolution Than At Other Periods 
2240_148522_000001_000000	train-clean-360	The period when the construction of democratic society upon the ruins of an aristocracy has just been completed is especially that at which this separation of men from one another and the egotism resulting from it most forcibly strike the observation 
2240_148522_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Democratic communities not only contain a large number of independent citizens but they are constantly filled with men who having entered but yesterday upon their independent condition are intoxicated with their new power 
2240_148522_000001_000002	train-clean-360	They entertain a presumptuous confidence in their strength and as they do not suppose that they can henceforward ever have occasion to claim the assistance of their fellow creatures they do not scruple to show that they care for nobody but themselves 
2240_148522_000002_000000	train-clean-360	An aristocracy seldom yields without a protracted struggle in the course of which implacable animosities are kindled between the different classes of society 
2240_148522_000002_000001	train-clean-360	These passions survive the victory and traces of them may be observed in the midst of the democratic confusion which ensues 
none	none	Those members of the community who were at the top of the late gradations of rank cannot immediately forget their former greatness they will long regard themselves as aliens in the midst of the newly composed society 
2240_148522_000002_000003	train-clean-360	They look upon all those whom this state of society has made their equals as oppressors whose destiny can excite no sympathy they have lost sight of their former equals and feel no longer bound by a common interest to their fate each of them standing aloof thinks that he is reduced to care for himself alone 
none	none	Those on the contrary who were formerly at the foot of the social scale and who have been brought up to the common level by a sudden revolution cannot enjoy their newly acquired independence without secret uneasiness and if they meet with some of their former superiors on the same footing as themselves they stand aloof from them with an expression of triumph and of fear 
2240_148522_000002_000005	train-clean-360	It is then commonly at the outset of democratic society that citizens are most disposed to live apart 
none	none	Democracy leads men not to draw near to their fellow creatures but democratic revolutions lead them to shun each other and perpetuate in a state of equality the animosities which the state of inequality engendered The great advantage of the Americans is that they have arrived at a state of democracy without having to endure a democratic revolution and that they are born equal instead of becoming so 
2240_148522_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Chapter IV That The Americans Combat The Effects Of Individualism By Free Institutions
2240_148522_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Despotism which is of a very timorous nature is never more secure of continuance than when it can keep men asunder and all is influence is commonly exerted for that purpose 
2240_148522_000004_000001	train-clean-360	No vice of the human heart is so acceptable to it as egotism a despot easily forgives his subjects for not loving him provided they do not love each other 
2240_148522_000004_000002	train-clean-360	He does not ask them to assist him in governing the State it is enough that they do not aspire to govern it themselves 
2240_148522_000004_000003	train-clean-360	He stigmatizes as turbulent and unruly spirits those who would combine their exertions to promote the prosperity of the community and perverting the natural meaning of words he applauds as good citizens those who have no sympathy for any but themselves 
2240_148522_000004_000004	train-clean-360	Thus the vices which despotism engenders are precisely those which equality fosters 
2240_148522_000004_000005	train-clean-360	These two things mutually and perniciously complete and assist each other 
none	none	Equality places men side by side unconnected by any common tie despotism raises barriers to keep them asunder the former predisposes them not to consider their fellow creatures the latter makes general indifference a sort of public virtue Despotism then which is at all times dangerous is more particularly to be feared in democratic ages It is easy to see that in those same ages men stand most in need of freedom 
2240_148522_000005_000002	train-clean-360	When the members of a community are forced to attend to public affairs they are necessarily drawn from the circle of their own interests and snatched at times from self observation 
none	none	As soon as a man begins to treat of public affairs in public he begins to perceive that he is not so independent of his fellow men as he had at first imagined and that in order to obtain their support he must often lend them his company operation 
2240_148522_000006_000000	train-clean-360	When the public is supreme there is no man who does not feel the value of public goodwill or who does not endeavor to court it by drawing to himself the esteem and affection of those amongst whom he is to live Many of the passions which congeal and keep asunder human hearts are then obliged to retire and hide below the surface 
2240_148522_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Pride must be dissembled disdain dares not break out egotism fears its own self Under a free government as most public offices are elective the men whose elevated minds or aspiring hopes are too closely circumscribed in private life constantly feel that they cannot do without the population which surrounds them 
2240_148522_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Men learn at such times to think of their fellow men from ambitious motives and they frequently find it in a manner their interest to forget themselves 
none	none	I may here be met by an objection derived from electioneering intrigues the meannesses of candidates and the calumnies of their opponents These are opportunities for animosity which occur the oftener the more frequent elections become 
2240_148522_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Such evils are doubtless great but they are transient whereas the benefits which attend them remain 
none	none	The desire of being elected may lead some men for a time to violent hostility but this same desire leads all men in the long run mutually to support each other and if it happens that an election accidentally severs two friends the electoral system brings a multitude of citizens permanently together who would always have remained unknown to each other 
2240_148522_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Freedom engenders private animosities but despotism gives birth to general indifference 
2240_148522_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The Americans have combated by free institutions the tendency of equality to keep men asunder and they have subdued it 
none	none	The legislators of America did not suppose that a general representation of the whole nation would suffice to ward off a disorder at once so natural to the frame of democratic society and so fatal they also thought that it would be well to infuse political life into each portion of the territory in order to multiply to an infinite extent opportunities of acting in concert for all the members of the community and to make them constantly feel their mutual dependence on each other 
2240_148522_000008_000002	train-clean-360	The plan was a wise one 
2240_148522_000008_000003	train-clean-360	The general affairs of a country only engage the attention of leading politicians who assemble from time to time in the same places and as they often lose sight of each other afterwards no lasting ties are established between them 
none	none	But if the object be to have the local affairs of a district conducted by the men who reside there the same persons are always in contact and they are in a manner forced to be acquainted and to adapt themselves to one another It is difficult to draw a man out of his own circle to interest him in the destiny of the State because he does not clearly understand what influence the destiny of the State can have upon his own lot But if it be proposed to make a road cross the end of his estate he will see at a glance that there is a connection between this small public affair and his greatest private affairs and he will discover without its being shown to him the close tie which unites private to general interest Thus far more may be done by intrusting to the citizens the administration of minor affairs than by surrendering to them the control of important ones towards interesting them in the public welfare and convincing them that they constantly stand in need one of the other in order to provide for it A brilliant achievement may win for you the favor of a people at one stroke but to earn the love and respect of the population which surrounds you a long succession of little services rendered and of obscure good deeds a constant habit of kindness and an established reputation for disinterestedness will be required Local freedom then which leads a great number of citizens to value the affection of their neighbors and of their kindred perpetually brings men together and forces them to help one another in spite of the propensities which sever them In the United States the more opulent citizens take great care not to stand aloof from the people on the contrary they constantly keep on easy terms with the lower classes they listen to them they speak to them every day 
2240_148522_000010_000001	train-clean-360	They know that the rich in democracies always stand in need of the poor and that in democratic ages you attach a poor man to you more by your manner than by benefits conferred 
2240_148522_000010_000002	train-clean-360	The magnitude of such benefits which sets off the difference of conditions causes a secret irritation to those who reap advantage from them but the charm of simplicity of manners is almost irresistible their affability carries men away and even their want of polish is not always displeasing 
2240_148522_000010_000003	train-clean-360	This truth does not take root at once in the minds of the rich 
none	none	They generally resist it as long as the democratic revolution lasts and they do not acknowledge it immediately after that revolution is accomplished They are very ready to do good to the people but they still choose to keep them at arm s length they think that is sufficient but they are mistaken 
2240_148522_000010_000006	train-clean-360	They might spend fortunes thus without warming the hearts of the population around them that population does not ask them for the sacrifice of their money but of their pride 
none	none	It would seem as if every imagination in the United States were upon the stretch to invent means of increasing the wealth and satisfying the wants of the public The best informed inhabitants of each district constantly use their information to discover new truths which may augment the general prosperity and if they have made any such discoveries they eagerly surrender them to the mass of the people 
2240_148522_000012_000000	train-clean-360	When the vices and weaknesses frequently exhibited by those who govern in America are closely examined the prosperity of the people occasions but improperly occasions surprise 
2240_148522_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Elected magistrates do not make the American democracy flourish it flourishes because the magistrates are elective 
none	none	It would be unjust to suppose that the patriotism and the zeal which every American displays for the welfare of his fellow citizens are wholly insincere Although private interest directs the greater part of human actions in the United States as well as elsewhere it does not regulate them all 
2240_148522_000013_000002	train-clean-360	I must say that I have often seen Americans make great and real sacrifices to the public welfare and I have remarked a hundred instances in which they hardly ever failed to lend faithful support to each other 
2240_148522_000013_000003	train-clean-360	The free institutions which the inhabitants of the United States possess and the political rights of which they make so much use remind every citizen and in a thousand ways that he lives in society 
2240_148522_000013_000004	train-clean-360	They every instant impress upon his mind the notion that it is the duty as well as the interest of men to make themselves useful to their fellow creatures and as he sees no particular ground of animosity to them since he is never either their master or their slave his heart readily leans to the side of kindness 
none	none	Men attend to the interests of the public first by necessity afterwards by choice what was intentional becomes an instinct and by dint of working for the good of one s fellow citizens the habit and the taste for serving them is at length acquired 
2240_148522_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Many people in France consider equality of conditions as one evil and political freedom as a second 
2240_148522_000014_000001	train-clean-360	When they are obliged to yield to the former they strive at least to escape from the latter 
2240_148522_000014_000002	train-clean-360	But I contend that in order to combat the evils which equality may produce there is only one effectual remedy namely political freedom 
none	none	Chapter V Of The Use Which The Americans Make Of Public Associations In Civil Life I do not propose to speak of those political associations by the aid of which men endeavor to defend themselves against the despotic influence of a majority or against the aggressions of regal power That subject I have already treated If each citizen did not learn in proportion as he individually becomes more feeble and consequently more incapable of preserving his freedom single handed to combine with his fellow citizens for the purpose of defending it it is clear that tyranny would unavoidably increase together with equality Those associations only which are formed in civil life without reference to political objects are here adverted to The political associations which exist in the United States are only a single feature in the midst of the immense assemblage of associations in that country Americans of all ages all conditions and all dispositions constantly form associations They have not only commercial and manufacturing companies in which all take part but associations of a thousand other kinds religious moral serious futile extensive or restricted enormous or diminutive The Americans make associations to give entertainments to found establishments for education to build inns to construct churches to diffuse books to send missionaries to the antipodes and in this manner they found hospitals prisons and schools If it be proposed to advance some truth or to foster some feeling by the encouragement of a great example they form a society Wherever at the head of some new undertaking you see the government in France or a man of rank in England in the United States you will be sure to find an association I met with several kinds of associations in America of which I confess I had no previous notion and I have often admired the extreme skill with which the inhabitants of the United States succeed in proposing a common object to the exertions of a great many men and in getting them voluntarily to pursue it I have since travelled over England whence the Americans have taken some of their laws and many of their customs and it seemed to me that the principle of association was by no means so constantly or so adroitly used in that country The English often perform great things singly whereas the Americans form associations for the smallest undertakings It is evident that the former people consider association as a powerful means of action but the latter seem to regard it as the only means they have of acting Thus the most democratic country on the face of the earth is that in which men have in our time carried to the highest perfection the art of pursuing in common the object of their common desires and have applied this new science to the greatest number of purposes Is this the result of accident or is there in reality any necessary connection between the principle of association and that of equality Aristocratic communities always contain amongst a multitude of persons who by themselves are powerless a small number of powerful and wealthy citizens each of whom can achieve great undertakings single handed In aristocratic societies men do not need to combine in order to act because they are strongly held together Every wealthy and powerful citizen constitutes the head of a permanent and compulsory association composed of all those who are dependent upon him or whom he makes subservient to the execution of his designs Amongst democratic nations on the contrary all the citizens are independent and feeble they can do hardly anything by themselves and none of them can oblige his fellow men to lend him their assistance They all therefore fall into a state of incapacity if they do not learn voluntarily to help each other If men living in democratic countries had no right and no inclination to associate for political purposes their independence would be in great jeopardy but they might long preserve their wealth and their cultivation whereas if they never acquired the habit of forming associations in ordinary life civilization itself would be endangered A people amongst which individuals should lose the power of achieving great things single handed without acquiring the means of producing them by united exertions would soon relapse into barbarism Unhappily the same social condition which renders associations so necessary to democratic nations renders their formation more difficult amongst those nations than amongst all others When several members of an aristocracy agree to combine they easily succeed in doing so as each of them brings great strength to the partnership the number of its members may be very limited and when the members of an association are limited in number they may easily become mutually acquainted understand each other and establish fixed regulations The same opportunities do not occur amongst democratic nations where the associated members must always be very numerous for their association to have any power I am aware that many of my countrymen are not in the least embarrassed by this difficulty They contend that the more enfeebled and incompetent the citizens become the more able and active the government ought to be rendered in order that society at large may execute what individuals can no longer accomplish They believe this answers the whole difficulty but I think they are mistaken A government might perform the part of some of the largest American companies and several States members of the Union have already attempted it but what political power could ever carry on the vast multitude of lesser undertakings which the American citizens perform every day with the assistance of the principle of association It is easy to foresee that the time is drawing near when man will be less and less able to produce of himself alone the commonest necessaries of life The task of the governing power will therefore perpetually increase and its very efforts will extend it every day The more it stands in the place of associations the more will individuals losing the notion of combining together require its assistance these are causes and effects which unceasingly engender each other Will the administration of the country ultimately assume the management of all the manufacturers which no single citizen is able to carry on And if a time at length arrives when in consequence of the extreme subdivision of landed property the soil is split into an infinite number of parcels so that it can only be cultivated by companies of husbandmen will it be necessary that the head of the government should leave the helm of state to follow the plough The morals and the intelligence of a democratic people would be as much endangered as its business and manufactures if the government ever wholly usurped the place of private companies Feelings and opinions are recruited the heart is enlarged and the human mind is developed by no other means than by the reciprocal influence of men upon each other I have shown that these influences are almost null in democratic countries they must therefore be artificially created and this can only be accomplished by associations When the members of an aristocratic community adopt a new opinion or conceive a new sentiment they give it a station as it were beside themselves upon the lofty platform where they stand and opinions or sentiments so conspicuous to the eyes of the multitude are easily introduced into the minds or hearts of all around In democratic countries the governing power alone is naturally in a condition to act in this manner but it is easy to see that its action is always inadequate and often dangerous A government can no more be competent to keep alive and to renew the circulation of opinions and feelings amongst a great people than to manage all the speculations of productive industry No sooner does a government attempt to go beyond its political sphere and to enter upon this new track than it exercises even unintentionally an insupportable tyranny for a government can only dictate strict rules the opinions which it favors are rigidly enforced and it is never easy to discriminate between its advice and its commands Worse still will be the case if the government really believes itself interested in preventing all circulation of ideas it will then stand motionless and oppressed by the heaviness of voluntary torpor Governments therefore should not be the only active powers associations ought in democratic nations to stand in lieu of those powerful private individuals whom the equality of conditions has swept away As soon as several of the inhabitants of the United States have taken up an opinion or a feeling which they wish to promote in the world they look out for mutual assistance and as soon as they have found each other out they combine From that moment they are no longer isolated men but a power seen from afar whose actions serve for an example and whose language is listened to The first time I heard in the United States that one hundred thousand men had bound themselves publicly to abstain from spirituous liquors it appeared to me more like a joke than a serious engagement and I did not at once perceive why these temperate citizens could not content themselves with drinking water by their own firesides I at last understood that three hundred thousand Americans alarmed by the progress of drunkenness around them had made up their minds to patronize temperance They acted just in the same way as a man of high rank who should dress very plainly in order to inspire the humbler orders with a contempt of luxury It is probable that if these one hundred thousand men had lived in France each of them would singly have memorialized the government to watch the public houses all over the kingdom Nothing in my opinion is more deserving of our attention than the intellectual and moral associations of America The political and industrial associations of that country strike us forcibly but the others elude our observation or if we discover them we understand them imperfectly because we have hardly ever seen anything of the kind It must however be acknowledged that they are as necessary to the American people as the former and perhaps more so In democratic countries the science of association is the mother of science the progress of all the rest depends upon the progress it has made Amongst the laws which rule human societies there is one which seems to be more precise and clear than all others If men are to remain civilized or to become so the art of associating together must grow and improve in the same ratio in which the equality of conditions is increased Chapter VI Of The Relation Between Public Associations And Newspapers When men are no longer united amongst themselves by firm and lasting ties it is impossible to obtain the cooperation of any great number of them unless you can persuade every man whose concurrence you require that this private interest obliges him voluntarily to unite his exertions to the exertions of all the rest This can only be habitually and conveniently effected by means of a newspaper nothing but a newspaper can drop the same thought into a thousand minds at the same moment A newspaper is an adviser who does not require to be sought but who comes of his own accord and talks to you briefly every day of the common weal without distracting you from your private affairs Newspapers therefore become more necessary in proportion as men become more equal and individualism more to be feared To suppose that they only serve to protect freedom would be to diminish their importance they maintain civilization I shall not deny that in democratic countries newspapers frequently lead the citizens to launch together in very ill digested schemes but if there were no newspapers there would be no common activity The evil which they produce is therefore much less than that which they cure The effect of a newspaper is not only to suggest the same purpose to a great number of persons but also to furnish means for executing in common the designs which they may have singly conceived The principal citizens who inhabit an aristocratic country discern each other from afar and if they wish to unite their forces they move towards each other drawing a multitude of men after them It frequently happens on the contrary in democratic countries that a great number of men who wish or who want to combine cannot accomplish it because as they are very insignificant and lost amidst the crowd they cannot see and know not where to find one another A newspaper then takes up the notion or the feeling which had occurred simultaneously but singly to each of them All are then immediately guided towards this beacon and these wandering minds which had long sought each other in darkness at length meet and unite The newspaper brought them together and the newspaper is still necessary to keep them united In order that an association amongst a democratic people should have any power it must be a numerous body The persons of whom it is composed are therefore scattered over a wide extent and each of them is detained in the place of his domicile by the narrowness of his income or by the small unremitting exertions by which he earns it Means then must be found to converse every day without seeing each other and to take steps in common without having met Thus hardly any democratic association can do without newspapers There is consequently a necessary connection between public associations and newspapers newspapers make associations and associations make newspapers and if it has been correctly advanced that associations will increase in number as the conditions of men become more equal it is not less certain that the number of newspapers increases in proportion to that of associations Thus it is in America that we find at the same time the greatest number of associations and of newspapers This connection between the number of newspapers and that of associations leads us to the discovery of a further connection between the state of the periodical press and the form of the administration in a country and shows that the number of newspapers must diminish or increase amongst a democratic people in proportion as its administration is more or less centralized For amongst democratic nations the exercise of local powers cannot be intrusted to the principal members of the community as in aristocracies Those powers must either be abolished or placed in the hands of very large numbers of men who then in fact constitute an association permanently established by law for the purpose of administering the affairs of a certain extent of territory and they require a journal to bring to them every day in the midst of their own minor concerns some intelligence of the state of their public weal The more numerous local powers are the greater is the number of men in whom they are vested by law and as this want is hourly felt the more profusely do newspapers abound The extraordinary subdivision of administrative power has much more to do with the enormous number of American newspapers than the great political freedom of the country and the absolute liberty of the press If all the inhabitants of the Union had the suffrage but a suffrage which should only extend to the choice of their legislators in Congress they would require but few newspapers because they would only have to act together on a few very important but very rare occasions But within the pale of the great association of the nation lesser associations have been established by law in every country every city and indeed in every village for the purposes of local administration The laws of the country thus compel every American to company operate every day of his life with some of his fellow citizens for a common purpose and each one of them requires a newspaper to inform him what all the others are doing I am of opinion that a democratic people a without any national representative assemblies but with a great number of small local powers would have in the end more newspapers than another people governed by a centralized administration and an elective legislation What best explains to me the enormous circulation of the daily press in the United States is that amongst the Americans I find the utmost national freedom combined with local freedom of every kind There is a prevailing opinion in France and England that the circulation of newspapers would be indefinitely increased by removing the taxes which have been laid upon the press This is a very exaggerated estimate of the effects of such a reform Newspapers increase in numbers not according to their cheapness but according to the more or less frequent want which a great number of men may feel for intercommunication and combination Footnote a I say a democratic people the administration of an aristocratic people may be the reverse of centralized and yet the want of newspapers be little felt because local powers are then vested in the hands of a very small number of men who either act apart or who know each other and can easily meet and come to an understanding In like manner I should attribute the increasing influence of the daily press to causes more general than those by which it is commonly explained A newspaper can only subsist on the condition of publishing sentiments or principles common to a large number of men A newspaper therefore always represents an association which is composed of its habitual readers This association may be more or less defined more or less restricted more or less numerous but the fact that the newspaper keeps alive is a proof that at least the germ of such an association exists in the minds of its readers This leads me to a last reflection with which I shall conclude this chapter The more equal the conditions of men become and the less strong men individually are the more easily do they give way to the current of the multitude and the more difficult is it for them to adhere by themselves to an opinion which the multitude discard A newspaper represents an association it may be said to address each of its readers in the name of all the others and to exert its influence over them in proportion to their individual weakness The power of the newspaper press must therefore increase as the social conditions of men become more equal Chapter VII Connection Of Civil And Political Associations There is only one country on the face of the earth where the citizens enjoy unlimited freedom of association for political purposes This same country is the only one in the world where the continual exercise of the right of association has been introduced into civil life and where all the advantages which civilization can confer are procured by means of it In all the countries where political associations are prohibited civil associations are rare It is hardly probable that this is the result of accident but the inference should rather be that there is a natural and perhaps a necessary connection between these two kinds of associations Certain men happen to have a common interest in some concern either a commercial undertaking is to be managed or some speculation in manufactures to be tried they meet they combine and thus by degrees they become familiar with the principle of association The greater is the multiplicity of small affairs the more do men even without knowing it acquire facility in prosecuting great undertakings in common Civil associations therefore facilitate political association but on the other hand political association singularly strengthens and improves associations for civil purposes In civil life every man may strictly speaking fancy that he can provide for his own wants in politics he can fancy no such thing When a people then have any knowledge of public life the notion of association and the wish to coalesce present themselves every day to the minds of the whole community whatever natural repugnance may restrain men from acting in concert they will always be ready to combine for the sake of a party Thus political life makes the love and practice of association more general it imparts a desire of union and teaches the means of combination to numbers of men who would have always lived apart Politics not only give birth to numerous associations but to associations of great extent In civil life it seldom happens that any one interest draws a very large number of men to act in concert much skill is required to bring such an interest into existence but in politics opportunities present themselves every day Now it is solely in great associations that the general value of the principle of association is displayed Citizens who are individually powerless do not very clearly anticipate the strength which they may acquire by uniting together it must be shown to them in order to be understood Hence it is often easier to collect a multitude for a public purpose than a few persons a thousand citizens do not see what interest they have in combining together ten thousand will be perfectly aware of it In politics men combine for great undertakings and the use they make of the principle of association in important affairs practically teaches them that it is their interest to help each other in those of less moment A political association draws a number of individuals at the same time out of their own circle however they may be naturally kept asunder by age mind and fortune it places them nearer together and brings them into contact Once met they can always meet again Men can embark in few civil partnerships without risking a portion of their possessions this is the case with all manufacturing and trading companies When men are as yet but little versed in the art of association and are unacquainted with its principal rules they are afraid when first they combine in this manner of buying their experience dear They therefore prefer depriving themselves of a powerful instrument of success to running the risks which attend the use of it They are however less reluctant to join political associations which appear to them to be without danger because they adventure no money in them But they cannot belong to these associations for any length of time without finding out how order is maintained amongst a large number of men and by what contrivance they are made to advance harmoniously and methodically to the same object Thus they learn to surrender their own will to that of all the rest and to make their own exertions subordinate to the common impulse things which it is not less necessary to know in civil than in political associations Political associations may therefore be considered as large free schools where all the members of the community go to learn the general theory of association But even if political association did not directly contribute to the progress of civil association to destroy the former would be to impair the latter When citizens can only meet in public for certain purposes they regard such meetings as a strange proceeding of rare occurrence and they rarely think at all about it When they are allowed to meet freely for all purposes they ultimately look upon public association as the universal or in a manner the sole means which men can employ to accomplish the different purposes they may have in view Every new want instantly revives the notion The art of association then becomes as I have said before the mother of action studied and applied by all When some kinds of associations are prohibited and others allowed it is difficult to distinguish the former from the latter beforehand In this state of doubt men abstain from them altogether and a sort of public opinion passes current which tends to cause any association whatsoever to be regarded as a bold and almost an illicit enterprise a Footnote a This is more especially true when the executive government has a discretionary power of allowing or prohibiting associations When certain associations are simply prohibited by law and the courts of justice have to punish infringements of that law the evil is far less considerable Then every citizen knows beforehand pretty nearly what he has to expect He judges himself before he is judged by the law and abstaining from prohibited associations he embarks in those which are legally sanctioned It is by these restrictions that all free nations have always admitted that the right of association might be limited But if the legislature should invest a man with a power of ascertaining beforehand which associations are dangerous and which are useful and should authorize him to destroy all associations in the bud or allow them to be formed as nobody would be able to foresee in what cases associations might be established and in what cases they would be put down the spirit of association would be entirely paralyzed The former of these laws would only assail certain associations the latter would apply to society itself and inflict an injury upon it I can conceive that a regular government may have recourse to the former but I do not concede that any government has the right of enacting the latter It is therefore chimerical to suppose that the spirit of association when it is repressed on some one point will nevertheless display the same vigor on all others and that if men be allowed to prosecute certain undertakings in common that is quite enough for them eagerly to set about them When the members of a community are allowed and accustomed to combine for all purposes they will combine as readily for the lesser as for the more important ones but if they are only allowed to combine for small affairs they will be neither inclined nor able to effect it It is in vain that you will leave them entirely free to prosecute their business on joint stock account they will hardly care to avail themselves of the rights you have granted to them and after having exhausted your strength in vain efforts to put down prohibited associations you will be surprised that you cannot persuade men to form the associations you encourage I do not say that there can be no civil associations in a country where political association is prohibited for men can never live in society without embarking in some common undertakings but I maintain that in such a country civil associations will always be few in number feebly planned unskillfully managed that they will never form any vast designs or that they will fail in the execution of them This naturally leads me to think that freedom of association in political matters is not so dangerous to public tranquillity as is supposed and that possibly after having agitated society for some time it may strengthen the State in the end In democratic countries political associations are so to speak the only powerful persons who aspire to rule the State Accordingly the governments of our time look upon associations of this kind just as sovereigns in the Middle Ages regarded the great vassals of the Crown they entertain a sort of instinctive abhorrence of them and they combat them on all occasions They bear on the contrary a natural goodwill to civil associations because they readily discover that instead of directing the minds of the community to public affairs these institutions serve to divert them from such reflections and that by engaging them more and more in the pursuit of objects which cannot be attained without public tranquillity they deter them from revolutions But these governments do not attend to the fact that political associations tend amazingly to multiply and facilitate those of a civil character and that in avoiding a dangerous evil they deprive themselves of an efficacious remedy When you see the Americans freely and constantly forming associations for the purpose of promoting some political principle of raising one man to the head of affairs or of wresting power from another you have some difficulty in understanding that men so independent do not constantly fall into the abuse of freedom If on the other hand you survey the infinite number of trading companies which are in operation in the United States and perceive that the Americans are on every side unceasingly engaged in the execution of important and difficult plans which the slightest revolution would throw into confusion you will readily comprehend why people so well employed are by no means tempted to perturb the State nor to destroy that public tranquillity by which they all profit Is it enough to observe these things separately or should we not discover the hidden tie which connects them In their political associations the Americans of all conditions minds and ages daily acquire a general taste for association and grow accustomed to the use of it There they meet together in large numbers they converse they listen to each other and they are mutually stimulated to all sorts of undertakings They afterwards transfer to civil life the notions they have thus acquired and make them subservient to a thousand purposes Thus it is by the enjoyment of a dangerous freedom that the Americans learn the art of rendering the dangers of freedom less formidable If a certain moment in the existence of a nation be selected it is easy to prove that political associations perturb the State and paralyze productive industry but take the whole life of a people and it may perhaps be easy to demonstrate that freedom of association in political matters is favorable to the prosperity and even to the tranquillity of the community I said in the former part of this work The unrestrained liberty of political association cannot be entirely assimilated to the liberty of the press The one is at the same time less necessary and more dangerous than the other A nation may confine it within certain limits without ceasing to be mistress of itself and it may sometimes be obliged to do so in order to maintain its own authority And further on I added It cannot be denied that the unrestrained liberty of association for political purposes is the last degree of liberty which a people is fit for If it does not throw them into anarchy it perpetually brings them as it were to the verge of it Thus I do not think that a nation is always at liberty to invest its citizens with an absolute right of association for political purposes and I doubt whether in any country or in any age it be wise to set no limits to freedom of association A certain nation it is said could not maintain tranquillity in the community cause the laws to be respected or establish a lasting government if the right of association were not confined within narrow limits These blessings are doubtless invaluable and I can imagine that to acquire or to preserve them a nation may impose upon itself severe temporary restrictions but still it is well that the nation should know at what price these blessings are purchased I can understand that it may be advisable to cut off a man s arm in order to save his life but it would be ridiculous to assert that he will be as dexterous as he was before he lost it Chapter VIII The Americans Combat Individualism By The Principle Of Interest Rightly Understood When the world was managed by a few rich and powerful individuals these persons loved to entertain a lofty idea of the duties of man They were fond of professing that it is praiseworthy to forget one s self and that good should be done without hope of reward as it is by the Deity himself Such were the standard opinions of that time in morals I doubt whether men were more virtuous in aristocratic ages than in others but they were incessantly talking of the beauties of virtue and its utility was only studied in secret But since the imagination takes less lofty flights and every man s thoughts are centred in himself moralists are alarmed by this idea of self sacrifice and they no longer venture to present it to the human mind They therefore content themselves with inquiring whether the personal advantage of each member of the community does not consist in working for the good of all and when they have hit upon some point on which private interest and public interest meet and amalgamate they are eager to bring it into notice Observations of this kind are gradually multiplied what was only a single remark becomes a general principle and it is held as a truth that man serves himself in serving his fellow creatures and that his private interest is to do good I have already shown in several parts of this work by what means the inhabitants of the United States almost always manage to combine their own advantage with that of their fellow citizens my present purpose is to point out the general rule which enables them to do so In the United States hardly anybody talks of the beauty of virtue but they maintain that virtue is useful and prove it every day The American moralists do not profess that men ought to sacrifice themselves for their fellow creatures because it is noble to make such sacrifices but they boldly aver that such sacrifices are as necessary to him who imposes them upon himself as to him for whose sake they are made They have found out that in their country and their age man is brought home to himself by an irresistible force and losing all hope of stopping that force they turn all their thoughts to the direction of it They therefore do not deny that every man may follow his own interest but they endeavor to prove that it is the interest of every man to be virtuous I shall not here enter into the reasons they allege which would divert me from my subject suffice it to say that they have convinced their fellow countrymen Montaigne said long ago Were I not to follow the straight road for its straightness I should follow it for having found by experience that in the end it is commonly the happiest and most useful track The doctrine of interest rightly understood is not then new but amongst the Americans of our time it finds universal acceptance it has become popular there you may trace it at the bottom of all their actions you will remark it in all they say It is as often to be met with on the lips of the poor man as of the rich In Europe the principle of interest is much grosser than it is in America but at the same time it is less common and especially it is less avowed amongst us men still constantly feign great abnegation which they no longer feel The Americans on the contrary are fond of explaining almost all the actions of their lives by the principle of interest rightly understood they show with complacency how an enlightened regard for themselves constantly prompts them to assist each other and inclines them willingly to sacrifice a portion of their time and property to the welfare of the State In this respect I think they frequently fail to do themselves justice for in the United States as well as elsewhere people are sometimes seen to give way to those disinterested and spontaneous impulses which are natural to man but the Americans seldom allow that they yield to emotions of this kind they are more anxious to do honor to their philosophy than to themselves I might here pause without attempting to pass a judgment on what I have described The extreme difficulty of the subject would be my excuse but I shall not avail myself of it and I had rather that my readers clearly perceiving my object should refuse to follow me than that I should leave them in suspense The principle of interest rightly understood is not a lofty one but it is clear and sure It does not aim at mighty objects but it attains without excessive exertion all those at which it aims As it lies within the reach of all capacities everyone can without difficulty apprehend and retain it By its admirable conformity to human weaknesses it easily obtains great dominion nor is that dominion precarious since the principle checks one personal interest by another and uses to direct the passions the very same instrument which excites them The principle of interest rightly understood produces no great acts of self sacrifice but it suggests daily small acts of self denial By itself it cannot suffice to make a man virtuous but it disciplines a number of citizens in habits of regularity temperance moderation foresight self command and if it does not lead men straight to virtue by the will it gradually draws them in that direction by their habits If the principle of interest rightly understood were to sway the whole moral world extraordinary virtues would doubtless be more rare but I think that gross depravity would then also be less common The principle of interest rightly understood perhaps prevents some men from rising far above the level of mankind but a great number of other men who were falling far below it are caught and restrained by it Observe some few individuals they are lowered by it survey mankind it is raised I am not afraid to say that the principle of interest rightly understood appears to me the best suited of all philosophical theories to the wants of the men of our time and that I regard it as their chief remaining security against themselves Towards it therefore the minds of the moralists of our age should turn even should they judge it to be incomplete it must nevertheless be adopted as necessary I do not think upon the whole that there is more egotism amongst us than in America the only difference is that there it is enlightened here it is not Every American will sacrifice a portion of his private interests to preserve the rest we would fain preserve the whole and oftentimes the whole is lost Everybody I see about me seems bent on teaching his contemporaries by precept and example that what is useful is never wrong Will nobody undertake to make them understand how what is right may be useful No power upon earth can prevent the increasing equality of conditions from inclining the human mind to seek out what is useful or from leading every member of the community to be wrapped up in himself It must therefore be expected that personal interest will become more than ever the principal if not the sole spring of men s actions but it remains to be seen how each man will understand his personal interest If the members of a community as they become more equal become more ignorant and coarse it is difficult to foresee to what pitch of stupid excesses their egotism may lead them and no one can foretell into what disgrace and wretchedness they would plunge themselves lest they should have to sacrifice something of their own well being to the prosperity of their fellow creatures I do not think that the system of interest as it is professed in America is in all its parts self evident but it contains a great number of truths so evident that men if they are but educated cannot fail to see them Educate then at any rate for the age of implicit self sacrifice and instinctive virtues is already flitting far away from us and the time is fast approaching when freedom public peace and social order itself will not be able to exist without education Chapter IX 
2063-148525-0000	train-other-500	That The Americans Apply The Principle Of Interest Rightly Understood To Religious Matters If the principle of interest rightly understood had nothing but the present world in view it would be very insufficient
2063-148525-0001	train-other-500	for there are many sacrifices which can only find their recompense in another and whatever ingenuity may be put forth to demonstrate the utility of virtue
2063-148525-0002	train-other-500	it will never be an easy task to make that man live aright who has no thoughts of dying It is therefore necessary to ascertain whether the principle of interest rightly understood is easily compatible with religious belief
2063-148525-0003	train-other-500	The philosophers who inculcate this system of morals tell men that to be happy in this life they must watch their own passions and steadily control their excess that lasting happiness
2063-148525-0004	train-other-500	can only be secured by renouncing a thousand transient gratifications and that a man must perpetually triumph over himself in order to secure his own advantage The founders of almost all religions
2063-148525-0005	train-other-500	have held the same language The track they point out to man is the same only that the goal is more remote instead of placing in this world the reward of the sacrifices they impose
2063-148525-0006	train-other-500	they transport it to another Nevertheless I cannot believe that all those who practise virtue from religious motives
none	none	 are only actuated by the hope of a recompense 
2063-148525-0007	train-other-500	I have known zealous Christians who constantly forgot themselves
none	none	 to work with greater ardor for the happiness of their fellow men 
2063-148525-0008	train-other-500	and I have heard them declare that all they did was only to earn the blessings of a future state I cannot but think that they deceive themselves I respect them too much to believe them
2063-148525-0009	train-other-500	Christianity indeed teaches that a man must prefer his neighbor to himself in order to gain eternal life but Christianity also teaches that men ought to benefit their fellow creatures for the love of God
2063-148525-0010	train-other-500	A sublime expression Man searching by his intellect into the divine conception and seeing that order is the purpose of God freely combines to prosecute the great design
2063-148525-0011	train-other-500	and whilst he sacrifices his personal interests to this consummate order of all created things expects no other recompense than the pleasure of contemplating it
2063-148525-0012	train-other-500	I do not believe that interest is the sole motive of religious men but I believe that interest is the principal means which religions themselves employ to govern men and I do not question
2063-148525-0013	train-other-500	that this way they strike into the multitude and become popular It is not easy clearly to perceive why the principle of interest rightly understood should keep aloof from religious opinions
2063-148525-0014	train-other-500	and it seems to me more easy to show why it should draw men to them Let it be supposed that in order to obtain happiness in this world
2063-148525-0015	train-other-500	a man combats his instinct on all occasions and deliberately calculates every action of his life that instead of yielding blindly to the
none	none	 impetuosity of first desires 
2063-148525-0016	train-other-500	he has learned the art of resisting them and that he has accustomed himself to sacrifice without an effort the pleasure of a moment to the lasting interest of his whole life
2063-148525-0017	train-other-500	If such a man believes in the religion which he professes it will cost him but little to submit to the restrictions it may impose Reason herself counsels him to obey and habit has prepared him to endure them
2063-148525-0018	train-other-500	If he should have conceived any doubts as to the object of his hopes still he will not easily allow himself to be stopped by them and he will decide that it is wise to risk some of the advantages of this world
2063-148525-0019	train-other-500	in order to preserve his rights to the great inheritance promised him in another To be mistaken in believing that the Christian religion is true says Pascal is no great loss to anyone
2063-148525-0020	train-other-500	but how dreadful to be mistaken in believing it to be false The Americans do not affect a brutal indifference to a future state they affect no
none	none	 puerile pride in despising 
2063-148525-0021	train-other-500	perils which they hope to escape from They therefore profess their religion without shame and without weakness but there generally is even in their zeal
2063-148525-0022	train-other-500	something so indescribably tranquil methodical and deliberate that it would seem as if the head far more than the heart brought them to the foot of the altar
2063-148525-0023	train-other-500	The Americans not only follow their religion from interest but they often place in this world the interest which makes them follow it
2063-148525-0024	train-other-500	In the Middle Ages the clergy spoke of nothing but a future state they hardly cared to prove that a sincere Christian may be a happy man here below But the American preachers are constantly referring
2063-148525-0025	train-other-500	to the earth and it is only with great difficulty that they can divert their attention from it To touch their congregations they always show them how favorable religious opinions are to freedom and public tranquillity
2063-148525-0026	train-other-500	and it is often difficult to ascertain from their discourses whether the principal object of religion is to procure eternal felicity in the other world or prosperity in this

2063-148525-0027	train-other-500	Of The Taste For Physical Well Being In America In America the passion for physical well being is not always exclusive but it is general and if all do not feel it in the same manner
2063-148525-0028	train-other-500	yet it is felt by all Carefully to satisfy all even the least wants of the body and to provide the little conveniences of life is uppermost in every mind
2063-148525-0029	train-other-500	Something of an analogous character is more and more apparent in Europe Amongst the causes which produce these similar consequences in both hemispheres several are so connected with my subject as to deserve notice
2063-148525-0030	train-other-500	When riches are hereditarily fixed in families there are a great number of men who enjoy the comforts of life without feeling an exclusive taste for those comforts
2063-148525-0031	train-other-500	The heart of man is not so much caught by the undisturbed possession of anything valuable as by the desire as yet imperfectly satisfied of possessing it
2063-148525-0032	train-other-500	and by the incessant dread of losing it In aristocratic communities the wealthy never having experienced a condition different from their own entertain no fear of changing it
2063-148525-0033	train-other-500	the existence of such conditions hardly occurs to them The comforts of life are not to them the end of life but simply a way of living they regard them as existence itself
2063-148525-0034	train-other-500	enjoyed but scarcely thought of As the natural and instinctive taste which all men feel for being well off is thus satisfied without trouble and without apprehension their faculties are turned elsewhere
2063-148525-0035	train-other-500	and cling to more arduous and more lofty undertakings which excite and engross their minds Hence it is that in the midst of physical gratifications
2063-148525-0036	train-other-500	the members of an aristocracy often display a haughty contempt of these very enjoyments and exhibit singular powers of endurance under the privation of them
2063-148525-0037	train-other-500	All the revolutions which have ever shaken or destroyed aristocracies have shown how easily men accustomed to superfluous luxuries can do without the necessaries of life
2063-148525-0038	train-other-500	whereas men who have toiled to acquire a competency can hardly live after they have lost it If I turn my observation from the upper to the lower classes I find analogous effects produced by opposite causes
2063-148525-0039	train-other-500	Amongst a nation where aristocracy predominates in society and keeps it stationary the people in the end get as much accustomed to poverty as the rich to their opulence
2063-148525-0040	train-other-500	The latter bestow no anxiety on their physical comforts because they enjoy them without an effort the former do not think of things which they despair of obtaining
none	none	 and which they hardly know enough of to 
2063-148525-0041	train-other-500	desire them In communities of this kind the imagination of the poor is driven to seek another world the miseries of real life inclose it around
none	none	 but it escapes from their control 
2063-148525-0042	train-other-500	and flies to seek its pleasures far beyond When on the contrary the distinctions of ranks are confounded together and privileges are destroyed when
2063-148525-0043	train-other-500	hereditary property is subdivided and education and freedom widely diffused the desire of acquiring the comforts of the world haunts the imagination of the poor and the dread of losing them that of the rich
2063-148525-0044	train-other-500	Many scanty fortunes spring up those who possess them have a sufficient share of physical gratifications to conceive a taste for these pleasures not enough to satisfy it
2063-148525-0045	train-other-500	They never procure them without exertion and they never indulge in them without apprehension They are therefore always straining to pursue or to
2063-148525-0046	train-other-500	retain gratifications so delightful so imperfect so fugitive If I were to inquire what passion is most natural to men who are stimulated and
none	none	 circumscribed by the obscurity of their birth or the

none	none	 I could discover none more peculiarly 
2063-148525-0048	train-other-500	appropriate to their condition than this love of physical prosperity The passion for physical comforts is essentially a passion of the middle classes with those classes it grows and spreads
2063-148525-0049	train-other-500	with them it preponderates From them it mounts into the higher orders of society and descends into the mass of the people I never met in America with any citizen so poor
2063-148525-0050	train-other-500	as not to cast a glance of hope and envy on the enjoyments of the rich or whose imagination did not possess itself by anticipation of those good things which fate still obstinately withheld from him
2063-148525-0051	train-other-500	On the other hand I never perceived amongst the wealthier inhabitants of the United States that proud contempt of physical gratifications which is sometimes to be met with even in the most opulent and
2063-148525-0052	train-other-500	dissolute aristocracies Most of these wealthy persons were once poor they have felt the sting of want they were long a prey to adverse fortunes and now that the victory is won
2063-148525-0053	train-other-500	the passions which accompanied the contest have survived it their minds are as it were intoxicated by the small enjoyments which they have pursued for forty years
2063-148525-0054	train-other-500	Not but that in the United States as elsewhere there are a certain number of wealthy persons who having come into their property by inheritance possess without exertion
2063-148525-0055	train-other-500	an opulence they have not earned But even these men are not less devotedly attached to the pleasures of material life The love of well being is now become the predominant taste of the nation
none	none	 the great current of man s passions runs in that channel and sweeps everything along in its course Chapter XI Peculiar Effects Of The Love Of Physical Gratifications In Democratic Ages 
2063-148526-0000	train-other-500	It may be supposed from what has just been said that the love of physical gratifications must constantly urge the Americans to irregularities in morals
2063-148526-0001	train-other-500	disturb the peace of families and threaten the security of society at large Such is not the case the passion for physical gratifications produces in democracies effects very different from those which it occasions
2063-148526-0002	train-other-500	in aristocratic nations It sometimes happens that wearied with public affairs and sated with opulence amidst the ruin of religious belief and the decline of the State the heart of an aristocracy
2063-148526-0003	train-other-500	may by degrees be seduced to the pursuit of sensual enjoyments only At other times the power of the monarch or the weakness of the people without stripping the nobility of their fortune
2063-148526-0004	train-other-500	compels them to stand aloof from the administration of affairs and whilst the road to mighty enterprise is closed abandons them to the inquietude of their own desires
2063-148526-0005	train-other-500	they then fall back heavily upon themselves and seek in the pleasures of the body oblivion of their former greatness When the members of an aristocratic body are thus exclusively devoted to the pursuit of physical gratifications
2063-148526-0006	train-other-500	they commonly concentrate in that direction all the energy which they derive from their long experience of power Such men are not satisfied with the pursuit of comfort
2063-148526-0007	train-other-500	they require sumptuous depravity and splendid corruption The worship they pay the senses is a gorgeous one and they seem to vie with each other in the art of degrading their own natures
2063-148526-0008	train-other-500	The stronger the more famous and the more free an aristocracy has been the more depraved will it then become and however brilliant may have been the lustre of its virtues
2063-148526-0009	train-other-500	I dare predict that they will always be surpassed by the splendor of its vices The taste for physical gratifications leads a democratic people into no such excesses
2063-148526-0010	train-other-500	The love of well being is there displayed as a tenacious exclusive universal passion but its range is confined To build enormous palaces to conquer or to mimic nature
none	none	 to ransack the world in order to gratify the passions of a man is not thought of but to add a few roods of land to your field 
2063-148526-0011	train-other-500	to plant an orchard to enlarge a dwelling to be always making life more comfortable and convenient to avoid trouble and to satisfy the smallest wants without effort and almost without cost These are small objects
2063-148526-0012	train-other-500	but the soul clings to them it dwells upon them closely and day by day till they at last shut out the rest of the world and sometimes intervene between itself and heaven This it may be said
2063-148526-0013	train-other-500	can only be applicable to those members of the community who are in humble circumstances wealthier individuals will display tastes akin to those which belonged to them in aristocratic ages I contest

none	none	 As soon as they have passed these bounds their minds know not where to fix themselves and they often rush unrestrained beyond the range of common sense Chapter XIII Causes Of The Restless Spirit Of Americans In The Midst Of Their Prosperity In certain remote corners of the Old World you may still sometimes stumble upon a small district which seems to have been forgotten amidst the general tumult and to have remained stationary whilst everything around it was in motion The inhabitants are for the most part extremely ignorant and poor they take no part in the business of the country and they are frequently oppressed by the government yet their countenances are generally placid and their spirits light In America I saw the freest and most enlightened men placed in the happiest circumstances which the world affords it seemed to me as if a cloud habitually hung upon their brow and I thought them serious and almost sad even in their pleasures The chief reason of this contrast is that the former do not think of the ills they endure the latter are forever brooding over advantages they do not possess It is strange to see with what feverish ardor the Americans pursue their own welfare and to watch the vague dread that constantly torments them lest they should not have chosen the shortest path which may lead to it A native of the United States clings to this world s goods as if he were certain never to die and he is so hasty in grasping at all within his reach that one would suppose he was constantly afraid of not living long enough to enjoy them He clutches everything he holds nothing fast but soon loosens his grasp to pursue fresh gratifications In the United States a man builds a house to spend his latter years in it and he sells it before the roof is on he plants a garden and lets it just as the trees are coming into bearing he brings a field into tillage and leaves other men to gather the crops he embraces a profession and gives it up he settles in a place which he soon afterwards leaves to carry his changeable longings elsewhere If his private affairs leave him any leisure he instantly plunges into the vortex of politics and if at the end of a year of unremitting labor he finds he has a few days vacation his eager curiosity whirls him over the vast extent of the United States and he will travel fifteen hundred miles in a few days to shake off his happiness Death at length overtakes him but it is before he is weary of his bootless chase of that complete felicity which is forever on the wing At first sight there is something surprising in this strange unrest of so many happy men restless in the midst of abundance The spectacle itself is however as old as the world the novelty is to see a whole people furnish an exemplification of it Their taste for physical gratifications must be regarded as the original source of that secret inquietude which the actions of the Americans betray and of that inconstancy of which they afford fresh examples every day He who has set his heart exclusively upon the pursuit of worldly welfare is always in a hurry for he has but a limited time at his disposal to reach it to grasp it and to enjoy it The recollection of the brevity of life is a constant spur to him Besides the good things which he possesses he every instant fancies a thousand others which death will prevent him from trying if he does not try them soon This thought fills him with anxiety fear and regret and keeps his mind in ceaseless trepidation which leads him perpetually to change his plans and his abode If in addition to the taste for physical well being a social condition be superadded in which the laws and customs make no condition permanent here is a great additional stimulant to this restlessness of temper Men will then be seen continually to change their track for fear of missing the shortest cut to happiness It may readily be conceived that if men passionately bent upon physical gratifications desire eagerly they are also easily discouraged as their ultimate object is to enjoy the means to reach that object must be prompt and easy or the trouble of acquiring the gratification would be greater than the gratification itself Their prevailing frame of mind then is at once ardent and relaxed violent and enervated Death is often less dreaded than perseverance in continuous efforts to one end The equality of conditions leads by a still straighter road to several of the effects which I have here described When all the privileges of birth and fortune are abolished when all professions are accessible to all and a man s own energies may place him at the top of any one of them an easy and unbounded career seems open to his ambition and he will readily persuade himself that he is born to no vulgar destinies But this is an erroneous notion which is corrected by daily experience The same equality which allows every citizen to conceive these lofty hopes renders all the citizens less able to realize them it circumscribes their powers on every side whilst it gives freer scope to their desires Not only are they themselves powerless but they are met at every step by immense obstacles which they did not at first perceive They have swept away the privileges of some of their fellow creatures which stood in their way but they have opened the door to universal competition the barrier has changed its shape rather than its position When men are nearly alike and all follow the same track it is very difficult for any one individual to walk quick and cleave a way through the dense throng which surrounds and presses him This constant strife between the propensities springing from the equality of conditions and the means it supplies to satisfy them harasses and wearies the mind It is possible to conceive men arrived at a degree of freedom which should completely content them they would then enjoy their independence without anxiety and without impatience But men will never establish any equality with which they can be contented Whatever efforts a people may make they will never succeed in reducing all the conditions of society to a perfect level and even if they unhappily attained that absolute and complete depression the inequality of minds would still remain which coming directly from the hand of God will forever escape the laws of man However democratic then the social state and the political constitution of a people may be it is certain that every member of the community will always find out several points about him which command his own position and we may foresee that his looks will be doggedly fixed in that direction When inequality of conditions is the common law of society the most marked inequalities do not strike the eye when everything is nearly on the same level the slightest are marked enough to hurt it Hence the desire of equality always becomes more insatiable in proportion as equality is more complete Amongst democratic nations men easily attain a certain equality of conditions they can never attain the equality they desire It perpetually retires from before them yet without hiding itself from their sight and in retiring draws them on At every moment they think they are about to grasp it it escapes at every moment from their hold They are near enough to see its charms but too far off to enjoy them and before they have fully tasted its delights they die To these causes must be attributed that strange melancholy which oftentimes will haunt the inhabitants of democratic countries in the midst of their abundance and that disgust at life which sometimes seizes upon them in the midst of calm and easy circumstances Complaints are made in France that the number of suicides increases in America suicide is rare but insanity is said to be more common than anywhere else These are all different symptoms of the same disease The Americans do not put an end to their lives however disquieted they may be because their religion forbids it and amongst them materialism may be said hardly to exist notwithstanding the general passion for physical gratification The will resists reason frequently gives way In democratic ages enjoyments are more intense than in the ages of aristocracy and especially the number of those who partake in them is larger but on the other hand it must be admitted that man s hopes and his desires are oftener blasted the soul is more stricken and perturbed and care itself more keen Chapter XIV Taste For Physical Gratifications United In America To Love Of Freedom And Attention To Public Affairs When a democratic state turns to absolute monarchy the activity which was before directed to public and to private affairs is all at once centred upon the latter the immediate consequence is for some time great physical prosperity but this impulse soon slackens and the amount of productive industry is checked I know not if a single trading or manufacturing people can be cited from the Tyrians down to the Florentines and the English who were not a free people also There is therefore a close bond and necessary relation between these two elements freedom and productive industry This proposition is generally true of all nations but especially of democratic nations I have already shown that men who live in ages of equality continually require to form associations in order to procure the things they covet and on the other hand I have shown how great political freedom improves and diffuses the art of association Freedom in these ages is therefore especially favorable to the production of wealth nor is it difficult to perceive that despotism is especially adverse to the same result The nature of despotic power in democratic ages is not to be fierce or cruel but minute and meddling Despotism of this kind though it does not trample on humanity is directly opposed to the genius of commerce and the pursuits of industry Thus the men of democratic ages require to be free in order more readily to procure those physical enjoyments for which they are always longing It sometimes happens however that the excessive taste they conceive for these same enjoyments abandons them to the first master who appears The passion for worldly welfare then defeats itself and without perceiving it throws the object of their desires to a greater distance There is indeed a most dangerous passage in the history of a democratic people When the taste for physical gratifications amongst such a people has grown more rapidly than their education and their experience of free institutions the time will come when men are carried away and lose all self restraint at the sight of the new possessions they are about to lay hold upon In their intense and exclusive anxiety to make a fortune they lose sight of the close connection which exists between the private fortune of each of them and the prosperity of all It is not necessary to do violence to such a people in order to strip them of the rights they enjoy they themselves willingly loosen their hold The discharge of political duties appears to them to be a troublesome annoyance which diverts them from their occupations and business If they be required to elect representatives to support the Government by personal service to meet on public business they have no time they cannot waste their precious time in useless engagements such idle amusements are unsuited to serious men who are engaged with the more important interests of life These people think they are following the principle of self interest but the idea they entertain of that principle is a very rude one and the better to look after what they call their business they neglect their chief business which is to remain their own masters As the citizens who work do not care to attend to public business and as the class which might devote its leisure to these duties has ceased to exist the place of the Government is as it were unfilled If at that critical moment some able and ambitious man grasps the supreme power he will find the road to every kind of usurpation open before him If he does but attend for some time to the material prosperity of the country no more will be demanded of him Above all he must insure public tranquillity men who are possessed by the passion of physical gratification generally find out that the turmoil of freedom disturbs their welfare before they discover how freedom itself serves to promote it If the slightest rumor of public commotion intrudes into the petty pleasures of private life they are aroused and alarmed by it The fear of anarchy perpetually haunts them and they are always ready to fling away their freedom at the first disturbance I readily admit that public tranquillity is a great good but at the same time I cannot forget that all nations have been enslaved by being kept in good order Certainly it is not to be inferred that nations ought to despise public tranquillity but that state ought not to content them A nation which asks nothing of its government but the maintenance of order is already a slave at heart the slave of its own well being awaiting but the hand that will bind it By such a nation the despotism of faction is not less to be dreaded than the despotism of an individual When the bulk of the community is engrossed by private concerns the smallest parties need not despair of getting the upper hand in public affairs At such times it is not rare to see upon the great stage of the world as we see at our theatres a multitude represented by a few players who alone speak in the name of an absent or inattentive crowd they alone are in action whilst all are stationary they regulate everything by their own caprice they change the laws and tyrannize at will over the manners of the country and then men wonder to see into how small a number of weak and worthless hands a great people may fall Hitherto the Americans have fortunately escaped all the perils which I have just pointed out and in this respect they are really deserving of admiration Perhaps there is no country in the world where fewer idle men are to be met with than in America or where all who work are more eager to promote their own welfare But if the passion of the Americans for physical gratifications is vehement at least it is not indiscriminating and reason though unable to restrain it still directs its course An American attends to his private concerns as if he were alone in the world and the next minute he gives himself up to the common weal as if he had forgotten them At one time he seems animated by the most selfish cupidity at another by the most lively patriotism The human heart cannot be thus divided The inhabitants of the United States alternately display so strong and so similar a passion for their own welfare and for their freedom that it may be supposed that these passions are united and mingled in some part of their character And indeed the Americans believe their freedom to be the best instrument and surest safeguard of their welfare they are attached to the one by the other They by no means think that they are not called upon to take a part in the public weal they believe on the contrary that their chief business is to secure for themselves a government which will allow them to acquire the things they covet and which will not debar them from the peaceful enjoyment of those possessions which they have acquired Chapter XV That Religious Belief Sometimes Turns The Thoughts Of The Americans To Immaterial Pleasures In the United States on the seventh day of every week the trading and working life of the nation seems suspended all noises cease a deep tranquillity say rather the solemn calm of meditation succeeds the turmoil of the week and the soul resumes possession and contemplation of itself Upon this day the marts of traffic are deserted every member of the community accompanied by his children goes to church where he listens to strange language which would seem unsuited to his ear He is told of the countless evils caused by pride and covetousness he is reminded of the necessity of checking his desires of the finer pleasures which belong to virtue alone and of the true happiness which attends it On his return home he does not turn to the ledgers of his calling but he opens the book of Holy Scripture there he meets with sublime or affecting descriptions of the greatness and goodness of the Creator of the infinite magnificence of the handiwork of God of the lofty destinies of man of his duties and of his immortal privileges Thus it is that the American at times steals an hour from himself and laying aside for a while the petty passions which agitate his life and the ephemeral interests which engross it he strays at once into an ideal world where all is great eternal and pure I have endeavored to point out in another part of this work the causes to which the maintenance of the political institutions of the Americans is attributable and religion appeared to be one of the most prominent amongst them I am now treating of the Americans in an individual capacity and I again observe that religion is not less useful to each citizen than to the whole State The Americans show by their practice that they feel the high necessity of imparting morality to democratic communities by means of religion What they think of themselves in this respect is a truth of which every democratic nation ought to be thoroughly persuaded I do not doubt that the social and political constitution of a people predisposes them to adopt a certain belief and certain tastes which afterwards flourish without difficulty amongst them whilst the same causes may divert a people from certain opinions and propensities without any voluntary effort and as it were without any distinct consciousness on their part The whole art of the legislator is correctly to discern beforehand these natural inclinations of communities of men in order to know whether they should be assisted or whether it may not be necessary to check them For the duties incumbent on the legislator differ at different times the goal towards which the human race ought ever to be tending is alone stationary the means of reaching it are perpetually to be varied If I had been born in an aristocratic age in the midst of a nation where the hereditary wealth of some and the irremediable penury of others should equally divert men from the idea of bettering their condition and hold the soul as it were in a state of torpor fixed on the contemplation of another world I should then wish that it were possible for me to rouse that people to a sense of their wants I should seek to discover more rapid and more easy means for satisfying the fresh desires which I might have awakened and directing the most strenuous efforts of the human mind to physical pursuits I should endeavor to stimulate it to promote the well being of man If it happened that some men were immoderately incited to the pursuit of riches and displayed an excessive liking for physical gratifications I should not be alarmed these peculiar symptoms would soon be absorbed in the general aspect of the people The attention of the legislators of democracies is called to other cares Give democratic nations education and freedom and leave them alone They will soon learn to draw from this world all the benefits which it can afford they will improve each of the useful arts and will day by day render life more comfortable more convenient and more easy Their social condition naturally urges them in this direction I do not fear that they will slacken their course But whilst man takes delight in this honest and lawful pursuit of his wellbeing it is to be apprehended that he may in the end lose the use of his sublimest faculties and that whilst he is busied in improving all around him he may at length degrade himself Here and here only does the peril lie It should therefore be the unceasing object of the legislators of democracies and of all the virtuous and enlightened men who live there to raise the souls of their fellow citizens and keep them lifted up towards heaven It is necessary that all who feel an interest in the future destinies of democratic society should unite and that all should make joint and continual efforts to diffuse the love of the infinite a sense of greatness and a love of pleasures not of earth If amongst the opinions of a democratic people any of those pernicious theories exist which tend to inculcate that all perishes with the body let men by whom such theories are professed be marked as the natural foes of such a people The materialists are offensive to me in many respects their doctrines I hold to be pernicious and I am disgusted at their arrogance If their system could be of any utility to man it would seem to be by giving him a modest opinion of himself But these reasoners show that it is not so and when they think they have said enough to establish that they are brutes they show themselves as proud as if they had demonstrated that they are gods Materialism is amongst all nations a dangerous disease of the human mind but it is more especially to be dreaded amongst a democratic people because it readily amalgamates with that vice which is most familiar to the heart under such circumstances Democracy encourages a taste for physical gratification this taste if it become excessive soon disposes men to believe that all is matter only and materialism in turn hurries them back with mad impatience to these same delights such is the fatal circle within which democratic nations are driven round It were well that they should see the danger and hold back Most religions are only general simple and practical means of teaching men the doctrine of the immortality of the soul That is the greatest benefit which a democratic people derives from its belief and hence belief is more necessary to such a people than to all others When therefore any religion has struck its roots deep into a democracy beware lest you disturb them but rather watch it carefully as the most precious bequest of aristocratic ages Seek not to supersede the old religious opinions of men by new ones lest in the passage from one faith to another the soul being left for a while stripped of all belief the love of physical gratifications should grow upon it and fill it wholly The doctrine of metempsychosis is assuredly not more rational than that of materialism nevertheless if it were absolutely necessary that a democracy should choose one of the two I should not hesitate to decide that the community would run less risk of being brutalized by believing that the soul of man will pass into the carcass of a hog than by believing that the soul of man is nothing at all The belief in a supersensual and immortal principle united for a time to matter is so indispensable to man s greatness that its effects are striking even when it is not united to the doctrine of future reward and punishment and when it holds no more than that after death the divine principle contained in man is absorbed in the Deity or transferred to animate the frame of some other creature Men holding so imperfect a belief will still consider the body as the secondary and inferior portion of their nature and they will despise it even whilst they yield to its influence whereas they have a natural esteem and secret admiration for the immaterial part of man even though they sometimes refuse to submit to its dominion That is enough to give a lofty cast to their opinions and their tastes and to bid them tend with no interested motive and as it were by impulse to pure feelings and elevated thoughts It is not certain that Socrates and his followers had very fixed opinions as to what would befall man hereafter but the sole point of belief on which they were determined that the soul has nothing in common with the body and survives it was enough to give the Platonic philosophy that sublime aspiration by which it is distinguished It is clear from the works of Plato that many philosophical writers his predecessors or contemporaries professed materialism These writers have not reached us or have reached us in mere fragments The same thing has happened in almost all ages the greater part of the most famous minds in literature adhere to the doctrines of a supersensual philosophy The instinct and the taste of the human race maintain those doctrines they save them oftentimes in spite of men themselves and raise the names of their defenders above the tide of time It must not then be supposed that at any period or under any political condition the passion for physical gratifications and the opinions which are superinduced by that passion can ever content a whole people The heart of man is of a larger mould it can at once comprise a taste for the possessions of earth and the love of those of heaven at times it may seem to cling devotedly to the one but it will never be long without thinking of the other If it be easy to see that it is more particularly important in democratic ages that spiritual opinions should prevail it is not easy to say by what means those who govern democratic nations may make them predominate I am no believer in the prosperity any more than in the durability of official philosophies and as to state religions I have always held that if they be sometimes of momentary service to the interests of political power they always sooner or later become fatal to the Church Nor do I think with those who assert that to raise religion in the eyes of the people and to make them do honor to her spiritual doctrines it is desirable indirectly to give her ministers a political influence which the laws deny them I am so much alive to the almost inevitable dangers which beset religious belief whenever the clergy take part in public affairs and I am so convinced that Christianity must be maintained at any cost in the bosom of modern democracies that I had rather shut up the priesthood within the sanctuary than allow them to step beyond it What means then remain in the hands of constituted authorities to bring men back to spiritual opinions or to hold them fast to the religion by which those opinions are suggested My answer will do me harm in the eyes of politicians I believe that the sole effectual means which governments can employ in order to have the doctrine of the immortality of the soul duly respected is ever to act as if they believed in it themselves and I think that it is only by scrupulous conformity to religious morality in great affairs that they can hope to teach the community at large to know to love and to observe it in the lesser concerns of life Chapter XVI That Excessive Care Of Worldly Welfare May Impair That Welfare There is a closer tie than is commonly supposed between the improvement of the soul and the amelioration of what belongs to the body Man may leave these two things apart and consider each of them alternately but he cannot sever them entirely without at last losing sight of one and of the other The beasts have the same senses as ourselves and very nearly the same appetites We have no sensual passions which are not common to our race and theirs and which are not to be found at least in the germ in a dog as well as in a man Whence is it then that the animals can only provide for their first and lowest wants whereas we can infinitely vary and endlessly increase our enjoyments We are superior to the beasts in this that we use our souls to find out those material benefits to which they are only led by instinct In man the angel teaches the brute the art of contenting its desires It is because man is capable of rising above the things of the body and of contemning life itself of which the beasts have not the least notion that he can multiply these same things of the body to a degree which inferior races are equally unable to conceive Whatever elevates enlarges and expands the soul renders it more capable of succeeding in those very undertakings which concern it not Whatever on the other hand enervates or lowers it weakens it for all purposes the chiefest as well as the least and threatens to render it almost equally impotent for the one and for the other Hence the soul must remain great and strong though it were only to devote its strength and greatness from time to time to the service of the body If men were ever to content themselves with material objects it is probable that they would lose by degrees the art of producing them and they would enjoy them in the end like the brutes without discernment and without improvement

none	none	The men of those ages therefore naturally and in a manner involuntarily accustom themselves to fix their gaze for a long course of years on some immovable object towards which they are constantly tending and they learn by insensible degrees to repress a multitude of petty passing desires in order to be the better able to content that great and lasting desire which possesses them When these same men engage in the affairs of this world the same habits may be traced in their conduct They are apt to set up some general and certain aim and end to their actions here below towards which all their efforts are directed they do not turn from day to day to chase some novel object of desire but they have settled designs which they are never weary of pursuing This explains why religious nations have so often achieved such lasting results for whilst they were thinking only of the other world they had found out the great secret of success in this 
2240_148529_000001_000004	train-clean-360	Religions give men a general habit of conducting themselves with a view to futurity in this respect they are not less useful to happiness in this life than to felicity hereafter and this is one of their chief political characteristics 
2240_148529_000002_000000	train-clean-360	But in proportion as the light of faith grows dim the range of man s sight is circumscribed as if the end and aim of human actions appeared every day to be more within his reach

none	none	As soon as they have lost the habit of placing their chief hopes upon remote events they naturally seek to gratify without delay their smallest desires and no sooner do they despair of living forever than they are disposed to act as if they were to exist but for a single day In sceptical ages it is always therefore to be feared that men may perpetually give way to their daily casual desires and that wholly renouncing whatever cannot be acquired without protracted effort they may establish nothing great permanent and calm 
2240_148529_000003_000000	train-clean-360	If the social condition of a people under these circumstances becomes democratic the danger which I here point out is thereby increased

2240_148529_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Circumscribed by the character of his country and his age the moralist must learn to vindicate his principles in that position 
2240_148529_000004_000002	train-clean-360	He must constantly endeavor to show his contemporaries that even in the midst of the perpetual commotion around them it is easier than they think to conceive and to execute protracted undertakings 
none	none	He must teach them that although the aspect of mankind may have changed the methods by which men may provide for their prosperity in this world are still the same and that amongst democratic nations as well as elsewhere it is only by resisting a thousand petty selfish passions of the hour that the general and unquenchable passion for happiness can be satisfied The task of those in power is not less clearly marked out At all times it is important that those who govern nations should act with a view to the future but this is even more necessary in democratic and sceptical ages than in any others By acting thus the leading men of democracies not only make public affairs prosperous but they also teach private individuals by their example the art of managing private concerns Above all they must strive as much as possible to banish chance from the sphere of politics 
2240_148529_000005_000003	train-clean-360	The sudden and undeserved promotion of a courtier produces only a transient impression in an aristocratic country because the aggregate institutions and opinions of the nation habitually compel men to advance slowly in tracks which they cannot get out of 
none	none	But nothing is more pernicious than similar instances of favor exhibited to the eyes of a democratic people they give the last impulse to the public mind in a direction where everything hurries it onwards At times of scepticism and equality more especially the favor of the people or of the prince which chance may confer or chance withhold ought never to stand in lieu of attainments or services It is desirable that every advancement should there appear to be the result of some effort so that no greatness should be of too easy acquirement and that ambition should be obliged to fix its gaze long upon an object before it is gratified Governments must apply themselves to restore to men that love of the future with which religion and the state of society no longer inspire them and without saying so they must practically teach the community day by day that wealth fame and power are the rewards of labor that great success stands at the utmost range of long desires and that nothing lasting is obtained but what is obtained by toil 
2240_148529_000005_000007	train-clean-360	When men have accustomed themselves to foresee from afar what is likely to befall in the world and to feed upon hopes they can hardly confine their minds within the precise circumference of life and they are ready to break the boundary and cast their looks beyond 
2240_148529_000005_000008	train-clean-360	I do not doubt that by training the members of a community to think of their future condition in this world they would be gradually and unconsciously brought nearer to religious convictions 
none	none	Thus the means which allow men up to a certain point to go without religion are perhaps after all the only means we still possess for bringing mankind back by a long and roundabout path to a state of faith 
2240_148529_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Chapter XVIII That Amongst The Americans All Honest Callings Are Honorable
none	none	 Amongst a democratic people where there is no hereditary wealth every man works to earn a living or has worked or is born of parents who have worked 
2240_148529_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The notion of labor is therefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary natural and honest condition of human existence 
2240_148529_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Not only is labor not dishonorable amongst such a people but it is held in honor the prejudice is not against it but in its favor In the United States a wealthy man thinks that he owes it to public opinion to devote his leisure to some kind of industrial or commercial pursuit or to public business 
2240_148529_000007_000003	train-clean-360	He would think himself in bad repute if he employed his life solely in living 
2240_148529_000007_000004	train-clean-360	It is for the purpose of escaping this obligation to work that so many rich Americans come to Europe where they find some scattered remains of aristocratic society amongst which idleness is still held in honor 
2240_148529_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Equality of conditions not only ennobles the notion of labor in men s estimation but it raises the notion of labor as a source of profit 
2240_148529_000008_000001	train-clean-360	In aristocracies it is not exactly labor that is despised but labor with a view to profit 
none	none	Labor is honorific in itself when it is undertaken at the sole bidding of ambition or of virtue 
2240_148529_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Yet in aristocratic society it constantly happens that he who works for honor is not insensible to the attractions of profit 
2240_148529_000008_000004	train-clean-360	But these two desires only intermingle in the innermost depths of his soul he carefully hides from every eye the point at which they join he would fain conceal it from himself 
2240_148529_000008_000005	train-clean-360	In aristocratic countries there are few public officers who do not affect to serve their country without interested motives 
2240_148529_000008_000006	train-clean-360	Their salary is an incident of which they think but little and of which they always affect not to think at all 
2240_148529_000008_000007	train-clean-360	Thus the notion of profit is kept distinct from that of labor however they may be united in point of fact they are not thought of together 
2240_148529_000009_000000	train-clean-360	In democratic communities these two notions are on the contrary always palpably united 
2240_148529_000009_000001	train-clean-360	As the desire of well being is universal as fortunes are slender or fluctuating as everyone wants either to increase his own resources or to provide fresh ones for his progeny men clearly see that it is profit which if not wholly at least partially leads them to work 
2240_148529_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Even those who are principally actuated by the love of fame are necessarily made familiar with the thought that they are not exclusively actuated by that motive and they discover that the desire of getting a living is mingled in their minds with the desire of making life illustrious 
none	none	As soon as on the one hand labor is held by the whole community to be an honorable necessity of man s condition and on the other as soon as labor is always ostensibly performed wholly or in part for the purpose of earning remuneration the immense interval which separated different callings in aristocratic societies disappears If all are not alike all at least have one feature in common 
2240_148529_000010_000002	train-clean-360	No profession exists in which men do not work for money and the remuneration which is common to them all gives them all an air of resemblance 
none	none	This serves to explain the opinions which the Americans entertain with respect to different callings In America no one is degraded because he works for everyone about him works also nor is anyone humiliated by the notion of receiving pay for the President of the United States also works for pay 
2240_148529_000010_000005	train-clean-360	He is paid for commanding other men for obeying orders 
none	none	In the United States professions are more or less laborious more or less profitable but they are never either high or low every honest calling is honorable Chapter XIX That Almost All The Americans Follow Industrial Callings Agriculture is perhaps of all the useful arts that which improves most slowly amongst democratic nations Frequently indeed it would seem to be stationary because other arts are making rapid strides towards perfection On the other hand almost all the tastes and habits which the equality of condition engenders naturally lead men to commercial and industrial occupations Suppose an active enlightened and free man enjoying a competency but full of desires he is too poor to live in idleness he is rich enough to feel himself protected from the immediate fear of want and he thinks how he can better his condition This man has conceived a taste for physical gratifications which thousands of his fellow men indulge in around him he has himself begun to enjoy these pleasures and he is eager to increase his means of satisfying these tastes more completely But life is slipping away time is urgent to what is he to turn The cultivation of the ground promises an almost certain result to his exertions but a slow one men are not enriched by it without patience and toil Agriculture is therefore only suited to those who have already large superfluous wealth or to those whose penury bids them only seek a bare subsistence The choice of such a man as we have supposed is soon made he sells his plot of ground leaves his dwelling and embarks in some hazardous but lucrative calling Democratic communities abound in men of this kind and in proportion as the equality of conditions becomes greater their multitude increases Thus democracy not only swells the number of workingmen but it leads men to prefer one kind of labor to another and whilst it diverts them from agriculture it encourages their taste for commerce and manufactures a Footnote a It has often been remarked that manufacturers and mercantile men are inordinately addicted to physical gratifications and this has been attributed to commerce and manufactures but that is I apprehend to take the effect for the cause The taste for physical gratifications is not imparted to men by commerce or manufactures but it is rather this taste which leads men to embark in commerce and manufactures as a means by which they hope to satisfy themselves more promptly and more completely If commerce and manufactures increase the desire of well being it is because every passion gathers strength in proportion as it is cultivated and is increased by all the efforts made to satiate it All the causes which make the love of worldly welfare predominate in the heart of man are favorable to the growth of commerce and manufactures Equality of conditions is one of those causes it encourages trade not directly by giving men a taste for business but indirectly by strengthening and expanding in their minds a taste for prosperity This spirit may be observed even amongst the richest members of the community In democratic countries however opulent a man is supposed to be he is almost always discontented with his fortune because he finds that he is less rich than his father was and he fears that his sons will be less rich than himself Most rich men in democracies are therefore constantly haunted by the desire of obtaining wealth and they naturally turn their attention to trade and manufactures which appear to offer the readiest and most powerful means of success In this respect they share the instincts of the poor without feeling the same necessities say rather they feel the most imperious of all necessities that of not sinking in the world In aristocracies the rich are at the same time those who govern The attention which they unceasingly devote to important public affairs diverts them from the lesser cares which trade and manufactures demand If the will of an individual happens nevertheless to turn his attention to business the will of the body to which he belongs will immediately debar him from pursuing it for however men may declaim against the rule of numbers they cannot wholly escape their sway and even amongst those aristocratic bodies which most obstinately refuse to acknowledge the rights of the majority of the nation a private majority is formed which governs the rest b Footnote b Some aristocracies however have devoted themselves eagerly to commerce and have cultivated manufactures with success The history of the world might furnish several conspicuous examples But generally speaking it may be affirmed that the aristocratic principle is not favorable to the growth of trade and manufactures Moneyed aristocracies are the only exception to the rule Amongst such aristocracies there are hardly any desires which do not require wealth to satisfy them the love of riches becomes so to speak the high road of human passions which is crossed by or connected with all lesser tracks The love of money and the thirst for that distinction which attaches to power are then so closely intermixed in the same souls that it becomes difficult to discover whether men grow covetous from ambition or whether they are ambitious from covetousness This is the case in England where men seek to get rich in order to arrive at distinction and seek distinctions as a manifestation of their wealth The mind is then seized by both ends and hurried into trade and manufactures which are the shortest roads that lead to opulence This however strikes me as an exceptional and transitory circumstance When wealth is become the only symbol of aristocracy it is very difficult for the wealthy to maintain sole possession of political power to the exclusion of all other men The aristocracy of birth and pure democracy are at the two extremes of the social and political state of nations between them moneyed aristocracy finds its place The latter approximates to the aristocracy of birth by conferring great privileges on a small number of persons it so far belongs to the democratic element that these privileges may be successively acquired by all It frequently forms a natural transition between these two conditions of society and it is difficult to say whether it closes the reign of aristocratic institutions or whether it already opens the new era of democracy In democratic countries where money does not lead those who possess it to political power but often removes them from it the rich do not know how to spend their leisure They are driven into active life by the inquietude and the greatness of their desires by the extent of their resources and by the taste for what is extraordinary which is almost always felt by those who rise by whatsoever means above the crowd Trade is the only road open to them In democracies nothing is more great or more brilliant than commerce it attracts the attention of the public and fills the imagination of the multitude all energetic passions are directed towards it Neither their own prejudices nor those of anybody else can prevent the rich from devoting themselves to it The wealthy members of democracies never form a body which has manners and regulations of its own the opinions peculiar to their class do not restrain them and the common opinions of their country urge them on Moreover as all the large fortunes which are to be met with in a democratic community are of commercial growth many generations must succeed each other before their possessors can have entirely laid aside their habits of business Circumscribed within the narrow space which politics leave them rich men in democracies eagerly embark in commercial enterprise there they can extend and employ their natural advantages and indeed it is even by the boldness and the magnitude of their industrial speculations that we may measure the slight esteem in which productive industry would have been held by them if they had been born amidst an aristocracy A similar observation is likewise applicable to all men living in democracies whether they be poor or rich Those who live in the midst of democratic fluctuations have always before their eyes the phantom of chance and they end by liking all undertakings in which chance plays a part They are therefore all led to engage in commerce not only for the sake of the profit it holds out to them but for the love of the constant excitement occasioned by that pursuit The United States of America have only been emancipated for half a century in eighteen forty from the state of colonial dependence in which they stood to Great Britain the number of large fortunes there is small and capital is still scarce Yet no people in the world has made such rapid progress in trade and manufactures as the Americans they constitute at the present day the second maritime nation in the world and although their manufactures have to struggle with almost insurmountable natural impediments they are not prevented from making great and daily advances In the United States the greatest undertakings and speculations are executed without difficulty because the whole population is engaged in productive industry and because the poorest as well as the most opulent members of the commonwealth are ready to combine their efforts for these purposes The consequence is that a stranger is constantly amazed by the immense public works executed by a nation which contains so to speak no rich men The Americans arrived but as yesterday on the territory which they inhabit and they have already changed the whole order of nature for their own advantage They have joined the Hudson to the Mississippi and made the Atlantic Ocean communicate with the Gulf of Mexico across a continent of more than five hundred leagues in extent which separates the two seas The longest railroads which have been constructed up to the present time are in America But what most astonishes me in the United States is not so much the marvellous grandeur of some undertakings as the innumerable multitude of small ones Almost all the farmers of the United States combine some trade with agriculture most of them make agriculture itself a trade It seldom happens that an American farmer settles for good upon the land which he occupies especially in the districts of the Far West he brings land into tillage in order to sell it again and not to farm it he builds a farmhouse on the speculation that as the state of the country will soon be changed by the increase of population a good price will be gotten for it Every year a swarm of the inhabitants of the North arrive in the Southern States and settle in the parts where the cotton plant and the sugar cane grow These men cultivate the soil in order to make it produce in a few years enough to enrich them and they already look forward to the time when they may return home to enjoy the competency thus acquired Thus the Americans carry their business like qualities into agriculture and their trading passions are displayed in that as in their other pursuits The Americans make immense progress in productive industry because they all devote themselves to it at once and for this same reason they are exposed to very unexpected and formidable embarrassments As they are all engaged in commerce their commercial affairs are affected by such various and complex causes that it is impossible to foresee what difficulties may arise As they are all more or less engaged in productive industry at the least shock given to business all private fortunes are put in jeopardy at the same time and the State is shaken I believe that the return of these commercial panics is an endemic disease of the democratic nations of our age It may be rendered less dangerous but it cannot be cured because it does not originate in accidental circumstances but in the temperament of these nations Chapter XX That Aristocracy May Be Engendered By Manufactures I have shown that democracy is favorable to the growth of manufactures and that it increases without limit the numbers of the manufacturing classes we shall now see by what side road manufacturers may possibly in their turn bring men back to aristocracy It is acknowledged that when a workman is engaged every day upon the same detail the whole commodity is produced with greater ease promptitude and economy It is likewise acknowledged that the cost of the production of manufactured goods is diminished by the extent of the establishment in which they are made and by the amount of capital employed or of credit These truths had long been imperfectly discerned but in our time they have been demonstrated They have been already applied to many very important kinds of manufactures and the humblest will gradually be governed by them I know of nothing in politics which deserves to fix the attention of the legislator more closely than these two new axioms of the science of manufactures When a workman is unceasingly and exclusively engaged in the fabrication of one thing he ultimately does his work with singular dexterity but at the same time he loses the general faculty of applying his mind to the direction of the work He every day becomes more adroit and less industrious so that it may be said of him that in proportion as the workman improves the man is degraded What can be expected of a man who has spent twenty years of his life in making heads for pins and to what can that mighty human intelligence which has so often stirred the world be applied in him except it be to investigate the best method of making pins heads When a workman has spent a considerable portion of his existence in this manner his thoughts are forever set upon the object of his daily toil his body has contracted certain fixed habits which it can never shake off in a word he no longer belongs to himself but to the calling which he has chosen It is in vain that laws and manners have been at the pains to level all barriers round such a man and to open to him on every side a thousand different paths to fortune a theory of manufactures more powerful than manners and laws binds him to a craft and frequently to a spot which he cannot leave it assigns to him a certain place in society beyond which he cannot go in the midst of universal movement it has rendered him stationary In proportion as the principle of the division of labor is more extensively applied the workman becomes more weak more narrow minded and more dependent The art advances the artisan recedes On the other hand in proportion as it becomes more manifest that the productions of manufactures are by so much the cheaper and better as the manufacture is larger and the amount of capital employed more considerable wealthy and educated men come forward to embark in manufactures which were heretofore abandoned to poor or ignorant handicraftsmen The magnitude of the efforts required and the importance of the results to be obtained attract them Thus at the very time at which the science of manufactures lowers the class of workmen it raises the class of masters Whereas the workman concentrates his faculties more and more upon the study of a single detail the master surveys a more extensive whole and the mind of the latter is enlarged in proportion as that of the former is narrowed In a short time the one will require nothing but physical strength without intelligence the other stands in need of science and almost of genius to insure success This man resembles more and more the administrator of a vast empire that man a brute The master and the workman have then here no similarity and their differences increase every day They are only connected as the two rings at the extremities of a long chain Each of them fills the station which is made for him and out of which he does not get the one is continually closely and necessarily dependent upon the other and seems as much born to obey as that other is to command What is this but aristocracy As the conditions of men constituting the nation become more and more equal the demand for manufactured commodities becomes more general and more extensive and the cheapness which places these objects within the reach of slender fortunes becomes a great element of success Hence there are every day more men of great opulence and education who devote their wealth and knowledge to manufactures and who seek by opening large establishments and by a strict division of labor to meet the fresh demands which are made on all sides Thus in proportion as the mass of the nation turns to democracy that particular class which is engaged in manufactures becomes more aristocratic Men grow more alike in the one more different in the other and inequality increases in the less numerous class in the same ratio in which it decreases in the community Hence it would appear on searching to the bottom that aristocracy should naturally spring out of the bosom of democracy But this kind of aristocracy by no means resembles those kinds which preceded it It will be observed at once that as it applies exclusively to manufactures and to some manufacturing callings it is a monstrous exception in the general aspect of society The small aristocratic societies which are formed by some manufacturers in the midst of the immense democracy of our age contain like the great aristocratic societies of former ages some men who are very opulent and a multitude who are wretchedly poor The poor have few means of escaping from their condition and becoming rich but the rich are constantly becoming poor or they give up business when they have realized a fortune Thus the elements of which the class of the poor is composed are fixed but the elements of which the class of the rich is composed are not so To say the truth though there are rich men the class of rich men does not exist for these rich individuals have no feelings or purposes in common no mutual traditions or mutual hopes there are therefore members but no body Not only are the rich not compactly united amongst themselves but there is no real bond between them and the poor Their relative position is not a permanent one they are constantly drawn together or separated by their interests The workman is generally dependent on the master but not on any particular master these two men meet in the factory but know not each other elsewhere and whilst they come into contact on one point they stand very wide apart on all others The manufacturer asks nothing of the workman but his labor the workman expects nothing from him but his wages The one contracts no obligation to protect nor the other to defend and they are not permanently connected either by habit or by duty The aristocracy created by business rarely settles in the midst of the manufacturing population which it directs the object is not to govern that population but to use it An aristocracy thus constituted can have no great hold upon those whom it employs and even if it succeed in retaining them at one moment they escape the next it knows not how to will and it cannot act The territorial aristocracy of former ages was either bound by law or thought itself bound by usage to come to the relief of its serving men and to succor their distresses But the manufacturing aristocracy of our age first impoverishes and debases the men who serve it and then abandons them to be supported by the charity of the public This is a natural consequence of what has been said before Between the workmen and the master there are frequent relations but no real partnership I am of opinion upon the whole that the manufacturing aristocracy which is growing up under our eyes is one of the harshest which ever existed in the world but at the same time it is one of the most confined and least dangerous Nevertheless the friends of democracy should keep their eyes anxiously fixed in this direction for if ever a permanent inequality of conditions and aristocracy again penetrate into the world it may be predicted that this is the channel by which they will enter Book Three Influence Of Democracy On Manners Properly So Called Chapter I That Manners Are Softened As Social Conditions Become More Equal We perceive that for several ages social conditions have tended to equality and we discover that in the course of the same period the manners of society have been softened Are these two things merely contemporaneous or does any secret link exist between them so that the one cannot go on without making the other advance Several causes may concur to render the manners of a people less rude but of all these causes the most powerful appears to me to be the equality of conditions Equality of conditions and growing civility in manners are then in my eyes not only contemporaneous occurrences but correlative facts When the fabulists seek to interest us in the actions of beasts they invest them with human notions and passions the poets who sing of spirits and angels do the same there is no wretchedness so deep nor any happiness so pure as to fill the human mind and touch the heart unless we are ourselves held up to our own eyes under other features This is strictly applicable to the subject upon which we are at present engaged When all men are irrevocably marshalled in an aristocratic community according to their professions their property and their birth the members of each class considering themselves as children of the same family cherish a constant and lively sympathy towards each other which can never be felt in an equal degree by the citizens of a democracy But the same feeling does not exist between the several classes towards each other Amongst an aristocratic people each caste has its own opinions feelings rights manners and modes of living Thus the men of whom each caste is composed do not resemble the mass of their fellow citizens they do not think or feel in the same manner and they scarcely believe that they belong to the same human race They cannot therefore thoroughly understand what others feel nor judge of others by themselves Yet they are sometimes eager to lend each other mutual aid but this is not contrary to my previous observation These aristocratic institutions which made the beings of one and the same race so different nevertheless bound them to each other by close political ties Although the serf had no natural interest in the fate of nobles he did not the less think himself obliged to devote his person to the service of that noble who happened to be his lord and although the noble held himself to be of a different nature from that of his serfs he nevertheless held that his duty and his honor constrained him to defend at the risk of his own life those who dwelt upon his domains It is evident that these mutual obligations did not originate in the law of nature but in the law of society and that the claim of social duty was more stringent than that of mere humanity These services were not supposed to be due from man to man but to the vassal or to the lord Feudal institutions awakened a lively sympathy for the sufferings of certain men but none at all for the miseries of mankind They infused generosity rather than mildness into the manners of the time and although they prompted men to great acts of self devotion they engendered no real sympathies for real sympathies can only exist between those who are alike and in aristocratic ages men acknowledge none but the members of their own caste to be like themselves When the chroniclers of the Middle Ages who all belonged to the aristocracy by birth or education relate the tragical end of a noble their grief flows apace whereas they tell you at a breath and without wincing of massacres and tortures inflicted on the common sort of people Not that these writers felt habitual hatred or systematic disdain for the people war between the several classes of the community was not yet declared They were impelled by an instinct rather than by a passion as they had formed no clear notion of a poor man s sufferings they cared but little for his fate The same feelings animated the lower orders whenever the feudal tie was broken The same ages which witnessed so many heroic acts of self devotion on the part of vassals for their lords were stained with atrocious barbarities exercised from time to time by the lower classes on the higher It must not be supposed that this mutual insensibility arose solely from the absence of public order and education for traces of it are to be found in the following centuries which became tranquil and enlightened whilst they remained aristocratic In sixteen seventy five the lower classes in Brittany revolted at the imposition of a new tax These disturbances were put down with unexampled atrocity Observe the language in which Madame de Sevigne a witness of these horrors relates them to her daughter Aux Rochers thirty Octobre sixteen seventy five Mon Dieu ma fille que votre lettre d Aix est plaisante Au moins relisez vos lettres avant que de les envoyer laissez vous surpendre a leur agrement et consolez vous par ce plaisir de la peine que vous avez d en tant ecrire Vous avez donc baise toute la Provence il n y aurait pas satisfaction a baiser toute la Bretagne a moins qu on n aimat a sentir le vin Voulez vous savoir des nouvelles de Rennes On a fait une taxe de cent mille ecus sur le bourgeois et si on ne trouve point cette somme dans vingt quatre heures elle sera doublee et exigible par les soldats On a chasse et banni toute une grand rue et defendu de les recueillir sous peine de la vie de sorte qu on voyait tous ces miserables veillards femmes accouchees enfans errer en pleurs au sortir de cette ville sans savoir ou aller On roua avant hier un violon qui avait commence la danse et la pillerie du papier timbre il a ete ecartele apres sa mort et ses quatre quartiers exposes aux quatre coins de la ville On a pris soixante bourgeois et on commence demain les punitions Cette province est un bel exemple pour les autres et surtout de respecter les gouverneurs et les gouvernantes et de ne point jeter de pierres dans leur jardin a Footnote a To feel the point of this joke the reader should recollect that Madame de Grignan was Gouvernante de Provence Madame de Tarente etait hier dans ces bois par un temps enchante il n est question ni de chambre ni de collation elle entre par la barriere et s en retourne de meme In another letter she adds Vous me parlez bien plaisamment de nos miseres nous ne sommes plus si roues un en huit jours pour entretenir la justice Il est vrai que la penderie me parait maintenant un refraichissement J ai une tout autre idee de la justice depuis que je suis en ce pays Vos galeriens me paraissent une societe d honnetes gens qui se sont retires du monde pour mener une vie douce It would be a mistake to suppose that Madame de Sevigne who wrote these lines was a selfish or cruel person she was passionately attached to her children and very ready to sympathize in the sorrows of her friends nay her letters show that she treated her vassals and servants with kindness and indulgence But Madame de Sevigne had no clear notion of suffering in anyone who was not a person of quality In our time the harshest man writing to the most insensible person of his acquaintance would not venture wantonly to indulge in the cruel jocularity which I have quoted and even if his own manners allowed him to do so the manners of society at large would forbid it Whence does this arise Have we more sensibility than our forefathers I know not that we have but I am sure that our insensibility is extended to a far greater range of objects When all the ranks of a community are nearly equal as all men think and feel in nearly the same manner each of them may judge in a moment of the sensations of all the others he casts a rapid glance upon himself and that is enough There is no wretchedness into which he cannot readily enter and a secret instinct reveals to him its extent It signifies not that strangers or foes be the sufferers imagination puts him in their place something like a personal feeling is mingled with his pity and makes himself suffer whilst the body of his fellow creature is in torture In democratic ages men rarely sacrifice themselves for one another but they display general compassion for the members of the human race They inflict no useless ills and they are happy to relieve the griefs of others when they can do so without much hurting themselves they are not disinterested but they are humane Although the Americans have in a manner reduced egotism to a social and philosophical theory they are nevertheless extremely open to compassion In no country is criminal justice administered with more mildness than in the United States Whilst the English seem disposed carefully to retain the bloody traces of the dark ages in their penal legislation the Americans have almost expunged capital punishment from their codes North America is I think the only one country upon earth in which the life of no one citizen has been taken for a political offence in the course of the last fifty years The circumstance which conclusively shows that this singular mildness of the Americans arises chiefly from their social condition is the manner in which they treat their slaves Perhaps there is not upon the whole a single European colony in the New World in which the physical condition of the blacks is less severe than in the United States yet the slaves still endure horrid sufferings there and are constantly exposed to barbarous punishments It is easy to perceive that the lot of these unhappy beings inspires their masters with but little compassion and that they look upon slavery not only as an institution which is profitable to them but as an evil which does not affect them Thus the same man who is full of humanity towards his fellow creatures when they are at the same time his equals becomes insensible to their afflictions as soon as that equality ceases His mildness should therefore be attributed to the equality of conditions rather than to civilization and education What I have here remarked of individuals is to a certain extent applicable to nations When each nation has its distinct opinions belief laws and customs it looks upon itself as the whole of mankind and is moved by no sorrows but its own Should war break out between two nations animated by this feeling it is sure to be waged with great cruelty At the time of their highest culture the Romans slaughtered the generals of their enemies after having dragged them in triumph behind a car and they flung their prisoners to the beasts of the Circus for the amusement of the people Cicero who declaimed so vehemently at the notion of crucifying a Roman citizen had not a word to say against these horrible abuses of victory It is evident that in his eyes a barbarian did not belong to the same human race as a Roman On the contrary in proportion as nations become more like each other they become reciprocally more compassionate and the law of nations is mitigated Chapter II That Democracy Renders The Habitual Intercourse Of The Americans Simple And Easy Democracy does not attach men strongly to each other but it places their habitual intercourse upon an easier footing If two Englishmen chance to meet at the Antipodes where they are surrounded by strangers whose language and manners are almost unknown to them they will first stare at each other with much curiosity and a kind of secret uneasiness they will then turn away or if one accosts the other they will take care only to converse with a constrained and absent air upon very unimportant subjects Yet there is no enmity between these men they have never seen each other before and each believes the other to be a respectable person Why then should they stand so cautiously apart We must go back to England to learn the reason When it is birth alone independent of wealth which classes men in society everyone knows exactly what his own position is upon the social scale he does not seek to rise he does not fear to sink In a community thus organized men of different castes communicate very little with each other but if accident brings them together they are ready to converse without hoping or fearing to lose their own position Their intercourse is not upon a footing of equality but it is not constrained When moneyed aristocracy succeeds to aristocracy of birth the case is altered The privileges of some are still extremely great but the possibility of acquiring those privileges is open to all whence it follows that those who possess them are constantly haunted by the apprehension of losing them or of other men s sharing them those who do not yet enjoy them long to possess them at any cost or if they fail to appear at least to possess them which is not impossible As the social importance of men is no longer ostensibly and permanently fixed by blood and is infinitely varied by wealth ranks still exist but it is not easy clearly to distinguish at a glance those who respectively belong to them Secret hostilities then arise in the community one set of men endeavor by innumerable artifices to penetrate or to appear to penetrate amongst those who are above them another set are constantly in arms against these usurpers of their rights or rather the same individual does both at once and whilst he seeks to raise himself into a higher circle he is always on the defensive against the intrusion of those below him Such is the condition of England at the present time and I am of opinion that the peculiarity before adverted to is principally to be attributed to this cause As aristocratic pride is still extremely great amongst the English and as the limits of aristocracy are ill defined everybody lives in constant dread lest advantage should be taken of his familiarity Unable to judge at once of the social position of those he meets an Englishman prudently avoids all contact with them Men are afraid lest some slight service rendered should draw them into an unsuitable acquaintance they dread civilities and they avoid the obtrusive gratitude of a stranger quite as much as his hatred Many people attribute these singular anti social propensities and the reserved and taciturn bearing of the English to purely physical causes I may admit that there is something of it in their race but much more of it is attributable to their social condition as is proved by the contrast of the Americans In America where the privileges of birth never existed and where riches confer no peculiar rights on their possessors men unacquainted with each other are very ready to frequent the same places and find neither peril nor advantage in the free interchange of their thoughts If they meet by accident they neither seek nor avoid intercourse their manner is therefore natural frank and open it is easy to see that they hardly expect or apprehend anything from each other and that they do not care to display any more than to conceal their position in the world If their demeanor is often cold and serious it is never haughty or constrained and if they do not converse it is because they are not in a humor to talk not because they think it their interest to be silent In a foreign country two Americans are at once friends simply because they are Americans They are repulsed by no prejudice they are attracted by their common country For two Englishmen the same blood is not enough they must be brought together by the same rank The Americans remark this unsociable mood of the English as much as the French do and they are not less astonished by it Yet the Americans are connected with England by their origin their religion their language and partially by their manners they only differ in their social condition It may therefore be inferred that the reserve of the English proceeds from the constitution of their country much more than from that of its inhabitants Chapter III Why The Americans Show So Little Sensitiveness In Their Own Country And Are So Sensitive In Europe The temper of the Americans is vindictive like that of all serious and reflecting nations They hardly ever forget an offence but it is not easy to offend them and their resentment is as slow to kindle as it is to abate In aristocratic communities where a small number of persons manage everything the outward intercourse of men is subject to settled conventional rules Everyone then thinks he knows exactly what marks of respect or of condescension he ought to display and none are presumed to be ignorant of the science of etiquette These usages of the first class in society afterwards serve as a model to all the others besides which each of the latter lays down a code of its own to which all its members are bound to conform Thus the rules of politeness form a complex system of legislation which it is difficult to be perfectly master of but from which it is dangerous for anyone to deviate so that men are constantly exposed involuntarily to inflict or to receive bitter affronts But as the distinctions of rank are obliterated as men differing in education and in birth meet and mingle in the same places of resort it is almost impossible to agree upon the rules of good breeding As its laws are uncertain to disobey them is not a crime even in the eyes of those who know what they are men attach more importance to intentions than to forms and they grow less civil but at the same time less quarrelsome There are many little attentions which an American does not care about he thinks they are not due to him or he presumes that they are not known to be due he therefore either does not perceive a rudeness or he forgives it his manners become less courteous and his character more plain and masculine The mutual indulgence which the Americans display and the manly confidence with which they treat each other also result from another deeper and more general cause which I have already adverted to in the preceding chapter In the United States the distinctions of rank in civil society are slight in political society they are null an American therefore does not think himself bound to pay particular attentions to any of his fellow citizens nor does he require such attentions from them towards himself As he does not see that it is his interest eagerly to seek the company of any of his countrymen he is slow to fancy that his own company is declined despising no one on account of his station he does not imagine that anyone can despise him for that cause and until he has clearly perceived an insult he does not suppose that an affront was intended The social condition of the Americans naturally accustoms them not to take offence in small matters and on the other hand the democratic freedom which they enjoy transfuses this same mildness of temper into the character of the nation The political institutions of the United States constantly bring citizens of all ranks into contact and compel them to pursue great undertakings in concert People thus engaged have scarcely time to attend to the details of etiquette and they are besides too strongly interested in living harmoniously for them to stick at such things They therefore soon acquire a habit of considering the feelings and opinions of those whom they meet more than their manners and they do not allow themselves to be annoyed by trifles I have often remarked in the United States that it is not easy to make a man understand that his presence may be dispensed with hints will not always suffice to shake him off I contradict an American at every word he says to show him that his conversation bores me he instantly labors with fresh pertinacity to convince me I preserve a dogged silence and he thinks I am meditating deeply on the truths which he is uttering at last I rush from his company and he supposes that some urgent business hurries me elsewhere This man will never understand that he wearies me to extinction unless I tell him so and the only way to get rid of him is to make him my enemy for life It appears surprising at first sight that the same man transported to Europe suddenly becomes so sensitive and captious that I often find it as difficult to avoid offending him here as it was to put him out of countenance These two opposite effects proceed from the same cause Democratic institutions generally give men a lofty notion of their country and of themselves An American leaves his country with a heart swollen with pride on arriving in Europe he at once finds out that we are not so engrossed by the United States and the great people which inhabits them as he had supposed and this begins to annoy him He has been informed that the conditions of society are not equal in our part of the globe and he observes that among the nations of Europe the traces of rank are not wholly obliterated that wealth and birth still retain some indeterminate privileges which force themselves upon his notice whilst they elude definition He is therefore profoundly ignorant of the place which he ought to occupy in this half ruined scale of classes which are sufficiently distinct to hate and despise each other yet sufficiently alike for him to be always confounding them He is afraid of ranging himself too high still more is he afraid of being ranged too low this twofold peril keeps his mind constantly on the stretch and embarrasses all he says and does He learns from tradition that in Europe ceremonial observances were infinitely varied according to different ranks this recollection of former times completes his perplexity and he is the more afraid of not obtaining those marks of respect which are due to him as he does not exactly know in what they consist He is like a man surrounded by traps society is not a recreation for him but a serious toil he weighs your least actions interrogates your looks and scrutinizes all you say lest there should be some hidden allusion to affront him I doubt whether there was ever a provincial man of quality so punctilious in breeding as he is he endeavors to attend to the slightest rules of etiquette and does not allow one of them to be waived towards himself he is full of scruples and at the same time of pretensions he wishes to do enough but fears to do too much and as he does not very well know the limits of the one or of the other he keeps up a haughty and embarrassed air of reserve But this is not all here is yet another double of the human heart An American is forever talking of the admirable equality which prevails in the United States aloud he makes it the boast of his country but in secret he deplores it for himself and he aspires to show that for his part he is an exception to the general state of things which he vaunts There is hardly an American to be met with who does not claim some remote kindred with the first founders of the colonies and as for the scions of the noble families of England America seemed to me to be covered with them When an opulent American arrives in Europe his first care is to surround himself with all the luxuries of wealth he is so afraid of being taken for the plain citizen of a democracy that he adopts a hundred distorted ways of bringing some new instance of his wealth before you every day His house will be in the most fashionable part of the town he will always be surrounded by a host of servants I have heard an American complain that in the best houses of Paris the society was rather mixed the taste which prevails there was not pure enough for him and he ventured to hint that in his opinion there was a want of elegance of manner he could not accustom himself to see wit concealed under such unpretending forms These contrasts ought not to surprise us If the vestiges of former aristocratic distinctions were not so completely effaced in the United States the Americans would be less simple and less tolerant in their own country they would require less and be less fond of borrowed manners in ours Chapter IV Consequences Of The Three Preceding Chapters When men feel a natural compassion for their mutual sufferings when they are brought together by easy and frequent intercourse and no sensitive feelings keep them asunder it may readily be supposed that they will lend assistance to one another whenever it is needed When an American asks for the company operation of his fellow citizens it is seldom refused and I have often seen it afforded spontaneously and with great goodwill If an accident happens on the highway everybody hastens to help the sufferer if some great and sudden calamity befalls a family the purses of a thousand strangers are at once willingly opened and small but numerous donations pour in to relieve their distress It often happens amongst the most civilized nations of the globe that a poor wretch is as friendless in the midst of a crowd as the savage in his wilds this is hardly ever the case in the United States The Americans who are always cold and often coarse in their manners seldom show insensibility and if they do not proffer services eagerly yet they do not refuse to render them All this is not in contradiction to what I have said before on the subject of individualism The two things are so far from combating each other that I can see how they agree Equality of conditions whilst it makes men feel their independence shows them their own weakness they are free but exposed to a thousand accidents and experience soon teaches them that although they do not habitually require the assistance of others a time almost always comes when they cannot do without it We constantly see in Europe that men of the same profession are ever ready to assist each other they are all exposed to the same ills and that is enough to teach them to seek mutual preservatives however hard hearted and selfish they may otherwise be When one of them falls into danger from which the others may save him by a slight transient sacrifice or a sudden effort they do not fail to make the attempt Not that they are deeply interested in his fate for if by chance their exertions are unavailing they immediately forget the object of them and return to their own business but a sort of tacit and almost involuntary agreement has been passed between them by which each one owes to the others a temporary support which he may claim for himself in turn Extend to a people the remark here applied to a class and you will understand my meaning A similar covenant exists in fact between all the citizens of a democracy they all feel themselves subject to the same weakness and the same dangers and their interest as well as their sympathy makes it a rule with them to lend each other mutual assistance when required The more equal social conditions become the more do men display this reciprocal disposition to oblige each other In democracies no great benefits are conferred but good offices are constantly rendered a man seldom displays self devotion but all men are ready to be of service to one another Chapter V How Democracy Affects the Relation Of Masters And Servants An American who had travelled for a long time in Europe once said to me The English treat their servants with a stiffness and imperiousness of manner which surprise us but on the other hand the French sometimes treat their attendants with a degree of familiarity or of politeness which we cannot conceive It looks as if they were afraid to give orders the posture of the superior and the inferior is ill maintained The remark was a just one and I have often made it myself I have always considered England as the country in the world where in our time the bond of domestic service is drawn most tightly and France as the country where it is most relaxed Nowhere have I seen masters stand so high or so low as in these two countries Between these two extremes the Americans are to be placed Such is the fact as it appears upon the surface of things to discover the causes of that fact it is necessary to search the matter thoroughly No communities have ever yet existed in which social conditions have been so equal that there were neither rich nor poor and consequently neither masters nor servants Democracy does not prevent the existence of these two classes but it changes their dispositions and modifies their mutual relations Amongst aristocratic nations servants form a distinct class not more variously composed than that of masters A settled order is soon established in the former as well as in the latter class a scale is formed with numerous distinctions or marked gradations of rank and generations succeed each other thus without any change of position These two communities are superposed one above the other always distinct but regulated by analogous principles This aristocratic constitution does not exert a less powerful influence on the notions and manners of servants than on those of masters and although the effects are different the same cause may easily be traced Both classes constitute small communities in the heart of the nation and certain permanent notions of right and wrong are ultimately engendered amongst them The different acts of human life are viewed by one particular and unchanging light In the society of servants as in that of masters men exercise a great influence over each other they acknowledge settled rules and in the absence of law they are guided by a sort of public opinion their habits are settled and their conduct is placed under a certain control These men whose destiny is to obey certainly do not understand fame virtue honesty and honor in the same manner as their masters but they have a pride a virtue and an honesty pertaining to their condition and they have a notion if I may use the expression of a sort of servile honor a Because a class is mean it must not be supposed that all who belong to it are mean hearted to think so would be a great mistake However lowly it may be he who is foremost there and who has no notion of quitting it occupies an aristocratic position which inspires him with lofty feelings pride and self respect that fit him for the higher virtues and actions above the common Amongst aristocratic nations it was by no means rare to find men of noble and vigorous minds in the service of the great who felt not the servitude they bore and who submitted to the will of their masters without any fear of their displeasure But this was hardly ever the case amongst the inferior ranks of domestic servants It may be imagined that he who occupies the lowest stage of the order of menials stands very low indeed The French created a word on purpose to designate the servants of the aristocracy they called them lackeys This word lackey served as the strongest expression when all others were exhausted to designate human meanness Under the old French monarchy to denote by a single expression a low spirited contemptible fellow it was usual to say that he had the soul of a lackey the term was enough to convey all that was intended Footnote a If the principal opinions by which men are guided are examined closely and in detail the analogy appears still more striking and one is surprised to find amongst them just as much as amongst the haughtiest scions of a feudal race pride of birth respect for their ancestry and their descendants disdain of their inferiors a dread of contact a taste for etiquette precedents and antiquity The permanent inequality of conditions not only gives servants certain peculiar virtues and vices but it places them in a peculiar relation with respect to their masters Amongst aristocratic nations the poor man is familiarized from his childhood with the notion of being commanded to whichever side he turns his eyes the graduated structure of society and the aspect of obedience meet his view Hence in those countries the master readily obtains prompt complete respectful and easy obedience from his servants because they revere in him not only their master but the class of masters He weighs down their will by the whole weight of the aristocracy He orders their actions to a certain extent he even directs their thoughts In aristocracies the master often exercises even without being aware of it an amazing sway over the opinions the habits and the manners of those who obey him and his influence extends even further than his authority In aristocratic communities there are not only hereditary families of servants as well as of masters but the same families of servants adhere for several generations to the same families of masters like two parallel lines which neither meet nor separate and this considerably modifies the mutual relations of these two classes of persons Thus although in aristocratic society the master and servant have no natural resemblance although on the contrary they are placed at an immense distance on the scale of human beings by their fortune education and opinions yet time ultimately binds them together They are connected by a long series of common reminiscences and however different they may be they grow alike whilst in democracies where they are naturally almost alike they always remain strangers to each other Amongst an aristocratic people the master gets to look upon his servants as an inferior and secondary part of himself and he often takes an interest in their lot by a last stretch of egotism Servants on their part are not averse to regard themselves in the same light and they sometimes identify themselves with the person of the master so that they become an appendage to him in their own eyes as well as in his In aristocracies a servant fills a subordinate position which he cannot get out of above him is another man holding a superior rank which he cannot lose On one side are obscurity poverty obedience for life on the other and also for life fame wealth and command The two conditions are always distinct and always in propinquity the tie that connects them is as lasting as they are themselves In this predicament the servant ultimately detaches his notion of interest from his own person he deserts himself as it were or rather he transports himself into the character of his master and thus assumes an imaginary personality He complacently invests himself with the wealth of those who command him he shares their fame exalts himself by their rank and feeds his mind with borrowed greatness to which he attaches more importance than those who fully and really possess it There is something touching and at the same time ridiculous in this strange confusion of two different states of being These passions of masters when they pass into the souls of menials assume the natural dimensions of the place they occupy they are contracted and lowered What was pride in the former becomes puerile vanity and paltry ostentation in the latter The servants of a great man are commonly most punctilious as to the marks of respect due to him and they attach more importance to his slightest privileges than he does himself In France a few of these old servants of the aristocracy are still to be met with here and there they have survived their race which will soon disappear with them altogether In the United States I never saw anyone at all like them The Americans are not only unacquainted with the kind of man but it is hardly possible to make them understand that such ever existed It is scarcely less difficult for them to conceive it than for us to form a correct notion of what a slave was amongst the Romans or a serf in the Middle Ages All these men were in fact though in different degrees results of the same cause they are all retiring from our sight and disappearing in the obscurity of the past together with the social condition to which they owed their origin Equality of conditions turns servants and masters into new beings and places them in new relative positions When social conditions are nearly equal men are constantly changing their situations in life there is still a class of menials and a class of masters but these classes are not always composed of the same individuals still less of the same families and those who command are not more secure of perpetuity than those who obey As servants do not form a separate people they have no habits prejudices or manners peculiar to themselves they are not remarkable for any particular turn of mind or moods of feeling They know no vices or virtues of their condition but they partake of the education the opinions the feelings the virtues and the vices of their contemporaries and they are honest men or scoundrels in the same way as their masters are The conditions of servants are not less equal than those of masters As no marked ranks or fixed subordination are to be found amongst them they will not display either the meanness or the greatness which characterizes the aristocracy of menials as well as all other aristocracies I never saw a man in the United States who reminded me of that class of confidential servants of which we still retain a reminiscence in Europe neither did I ever meet with such a thing as a lackey all traces of the one and of the other have disappeared In democracies servants are not only equal amongst themselves but it may be said that they are in some sort the equals of their masters This requires explanation in order to be rightly understood At any moment a servant may become a master and he aspires to rise to that condition the servant is therefore not a different man from the master Why then has the former a right to command and what compels the latter to obey the free and temporary consent of both their wills Neither of them is by nature inferior to the other they only become so for a time by covenant Within the terms of this covenant the one is a servant the other a master beyond it they are two citizens of the commonwealth two men I beg the reader particularly to observe that this is not only the notion which servants themselves entertain of their own condition domestic service is looked upon by masters in the same light and the precise limits of authority and obedience are as clearly settled in the mind of the one as in that of the other When the greater part of the community have long attained a condition nearly alike and when equality is an old and acknowledged fact the public mind which is never affected by exceptions assigns certain general limits to the value of man above or below which no man can long remain placed It is in vain that wealth and poverty authority and obedience accidentally interpose great distances between two men public opinion founded upon the usual order of things draws them to a common level and creates a species of imaginary equality between them in spite of the real inequality of their conditions This all powerful opinion penetrates at length even into the hearts of those whose interest might arm them to resist it it affects their judgment whilst it subdues their will In their inmost convictions the master and the servant no longer perceive any deep seated difference between them and they neither hope nor fear to meet with any such at any time They are therefore neither subject to disdain nor to anger and they discern in each other neither humility nor pride The master holds the contract of service to be the only source of his power and the servant regards it as the only cause of his obedience They do not quarrel about their reciprocal situations but each knows his own and keeps it In the French army the common soldier is taken from nearly the same classes as the officer and may hold the same commissions out of the ranks he considers himself entirely equal to his military superiors and in point of fact he is so but when under arms he does not hesitate to obey and his obedience is not the less prompt precise and ready for being voluntary and defined This example may give a notion of what takes place between masters and servants in democratic communities It would be preposterous to suppose that those warm and deep seated affections which are sometimes kindled in the domestic service of aristocracy will ever spring up between these two men or that they will exhibit strong instances of self sacrifice In aristocracies masters and servants live apart and frequently their only intercourse is through a third person yet they commonly stand firmly by one another In democratic countries the master and the servant are close together they are in daily personal contact but their minds do not intermingle they have common occupations hardly ever common interests Amongst such a people the servant always considers himself as a sojourner in the dwelling of his masters He knew nothing of their forefathers he will see nothing of their descendants he has nothing lasting to expect from their hand Why then should he confound his life with theirs and whence should so strange a surrender of himself proceed The reciprocal position of the two men is changed their mutual relations must be so too I would fain illustrate all these reflections by the example of the Americans but for this purpose the distinctions of persons and places must be accurately traced In the South of the Union slavery exists all that I have just said is consequently inapplicable there In the North the majority of servants are either freedmen or the children of freedmen these persons occupy a contested position in the public estimation by the laws they are brought up to the level of their masters by the manners of the country they are obstinately detruded from it They do not themselves clearly know their proper place and they are almost always either insolent or craven But in the Northern States especially in New England there are a certain number of whites who agree for wages to yield a temporary obedience to the will of their fellow citizens I have heard that these servants commonly perform the duties of their situation with punctuality and intelligence and that without thinking themselves naturally inferior to the person who orders them they submit without reluctance to obey him They appear to me to carry into service some of those manly habits which independence and equality engender Having once selected a hard way of life they do not seek to escape from it by indirect means and they have sufficient respect for themselves not to refuse to their master that obedience which they have freely promised On their part masters require nothing of their servants but the faithful and rigorous performance of the covenant they do not ask for marks of respect they do not claim their love or devoted attachment it is enough that as servants they are exact and honest It would not then be true to assert that in democratic society the relation of servants and masters is disorganized it is organized on another footing the rule is different but there is a rule It is not my purpose to inquire whether the new state of things which I have just described is inferior to that which preceded it or simply different Enough for me that it is fixed and determined for what is most important to meet with among men is not any given ordering but order But what shall I say of those sad and troubled times at which equality is established in the midst of the tumult of revolution when democracy after having been introduced into the state of society still struggles with difficulty against the prejudices and manners of the country The laws and partially public opinion already declare that no natural or permanent inferiority exists between the servant and the master But this new belief has not yet reached the innermost convictions of the latter or rather his heart rejects it in the secret persuasion of his mind the master thinks that he belongs to a peculiar and superior race he dares not say so but he shudders whilst he allows himself to be dragged to the same level His authority over his servants becomes timid and at the same time harsh he has already ceased to entertain for them the feelings of patronizing kindness which long uncontested power always engenders and he is surprised that being changed himself his servant changes also He wants his attendants to form regular and permanent habits in a condition of domestic service which is only temporary he requires that they should appear contented with and proud of a servile condition which they will one day shake off that they should sacrifice themselves to a man who can neither protect nor ruin them and in short that they should contract an indissoluble engagement to a being like themselves and one who will last no longer than they will Amongst aristocratic nations it often happens that the condition of domestic service does not degrade the character of those who enter upon it because they neither know nor imagine any other and the amazing inequality which is manifest between them and their master appears to be the necessary and unavoidable consequence of some hidden law of Providence In democracies the condition of domestic service does not degrade the character of those who enter upon it because it is freely chosen and adopted for a time only because it is not stigmatized by public opinion and creates no permanent inequality between the servant and the master But whilst the transition from one social condition to another is going on there is almost always a time when men s minds fluctuate between the aristocratic notion of subjection and the democratic notion of obedience Obedience then loses its moral importance in the eyes of him who obeys he no longer considers it as a species of divine obligation and he does not yet view it under its purely human aspect it has to him no character of sanctity or of justice and he submits to it as to a degrading but profitable condition At that moment a confused and imperfect phantom of equality haunts the minds of servants they do not at once perceive whether the equality to which they are entitled is to be found within or without the pale of domestic service and they rebel in their hearts against a subordination to which they have subjected themselves and from which they derive actual profit They consent to serve and they blush to obey they like the advantages of service but not the master or rather they are not sure that they ought not themselves to be masters and they are inclined to consider him who orders them as an unjust usurper of their own rights Then it is that the dwelling of every citizen offers a spectacle somewhat analogous to the gloomy aspect of political society A secret and intestine warfare is going on there between powers ever rivals and suspicious of one another the master is ill natured and weak the servant ill natured and intractable the one constantly attempts to evade by unfair restrictions his obligation to protect and to remunerate the other his obligation to obey The reins of domestic government dangle between them to be snatched at by one or the other The lines which divide authority from oppression liberty from license and right from might are to their eyes so jumbled together and confused that no one knows exactly what he is or what he may be or what he ought to be Such a condition is not democracy but revolution Chapter VI That Democratic Institutions And Manners Tend To Raise Rents And Shorten The Terms Of Leases What has been said of servants and masters is applicable to a certain extent to landowners and farming tenants but this subject deserves to be considered by itself In America there are properly speaking no tenant farmers every man owns the ground he tills It must be admitted that democratic laws tend greatly to increase the number of landowners and to diminish that of farming tenants Yet what takes place in the United States is much less attributable to the institutions of the country than to the country itself In America land is cheap and anyone may easily become a landowner its returns are small and its produce cannot well be divided between a landowner and a farmer America therefore stands alone in this as well as in many other respects and it would be a mistake to take it as an example I believe that in democratic as well as in aristocratic countries there will be landowners and tenants but the connection existing between them will be of a different kind In aristocracies the hire of a farm is paid to the landlord not only in rent but in respect regard and duty in democracies the whole is paid in cash When estates are divided and passed from hand to hand and the permanent connection which existed between families and the soil is dissolved the landowner and the tenant are only casually brought into contact They meet for a moment to settle the conditions of the agreement and then lose sight of each other they are two strangers brought together by a common interest and who keenly talk over a matter of business the sole object of which is to make money In proportion as property is subdivided and wealth distributed over the country the community is filled with people whose former opulence is declining and with others whose fortunes are of recent growth and whose wants increase more rapidly than their resources For all such persons the smallest pecuniary profit is a matter of importance and none of them feel disposed to waive any of their claims or to lose any portion of their income As ranks are intermingled and as very large as well as very scanty fortunes become more rare every day brings the social condition of the landowner nearer to that of the farmer the one has not naturally any uncontested superiority over the other between two men who are equal and not at ease in their circumstances the contract of hire is exclusively an affair of money A man whose estate extends over a whole district and who owns a hundred farms is well aware of the importance of gaining at the same time the affections of some thousands of men this object appears to call for his exertions and to attain it he will readily make considerable sacrifices But he who owns a hundred acres is insensible to similar considerations and he cares but little to win the private regard of his tenant An aristocracy does not expire like a man in a single day the aristocratic principle is slowly undermined in men s opinion before it is attacked in their laws Long before open war is declared against it the tie which had hitherto united the higher classes to the lower may be seen to be gradually relaxed Indifference and contempt are betrayed by one class jealousy and hatred by the others the intercourse between rich and poor becomes less frequent and less kind and rents are raised This is not the consequence of a democratic revolution but its certain harbinger for an aristocracy which has lost the affections of the people once and forever is like a tree dead at the root which is the more easily torn up by the winds the higher its branches have spread In the course of the last fifty years the rents of farms have amazingly increased not only in France but throughout the greater part of Europe The remarkable improvements which have taken place in agriculture and manufactures within the same period do not suffice in my opinion to explain this fact recourse must be had to another cause more powerful and more concealed I believe that cause is to be found in the democratic institutions which several European nations have adopted and in the democratic passions which more or less agitate all the rest I have frequently heard great English landowners congratulate themselves that at the present day they derive a much larger income from their estates than their fathers did They have perhaps good reasons to be glad but most assuredly they know not what they are glad of They think they are making a clear gain when it is in reality only an exchange their influence is what they are parting with for cash and what they gain in money will ere long be lost in power There is yet another sign by which it is easy to know that a great democratic revolution is going on or approaching In the Middle Ages almost all lands were leased for lives or for very long terms the domestic economy of that period shows that leases for ninety nine years were more frequent then than leases for twelve years are now Men then believed that families were immortal men s conditions seemed settled forever and the whole of society appeared to be so fixed that it was not supposed that anything would ever be stirred or shaken in its structure In ages of equality the human mind takes a different bent the prevailing notion is that nothing abides and man is haunted by the thought of mutability Under this impression the landowner and the tenant himself are instinctively averse to protracted terms of obligation they are afraid of being tied up to morrow by the contract which benefits them today They have vague anticipations of some sudden and unforeseen change in their conditions they mistrust themselves they fear lest their taste should change and lest they should lament that they cannot rid themselves of what they coveted nor are such fears unfounded for in democratic ages that which is most fluctuating amidst the fluctuation of all around is the heart of man Chapter VII Influence Of Democracy On Wages Most of the remarks which I have already made in speaking of servants and masters may be applied to masters and workmen As the gradations of the social scale come to be less observed whilst the great sink the humble rise and as poverty as well as opulence ceases to be hereditary the distance both in reality and in opinion which heretofore separated the workman from the master is lessened every day The workman conceives a more lofty opinion of his rights of his future of himself he is filled with new ambition and with new desires he is harassed by new wants Every instant he views with longing eyes the profits of his employer and in order to share them he strives to dispose of his labor at a higher rate and he generally succeeds at length in the attempt In democratic countries as well as elsewhere most of the branches of productive industry are carried on at a small cost by men little removed by their wealth or education above the level of those whom they employ These manufacturing speculators are extremely numerous their interests differ they cannot therefore easily concert or combine their exertions On the other hand the workmen have almost always some sure resources which enable them to refuse to work when they cannot get what they conceive to be the fair price of their labor In the constant struggle for wages which is going on between these two classes their strength is divided and success alternates from one to the other It is even probable that in the end the interest of the working class must prevail for the high wages which they have already obtained make them every day less dependent on their masters and as they grow more independent they have greater facilities for obtaining a further increase of wages I shall take for example that branch of productive industry which is still at the present day the most generally followed in France and in almost all the countries of the world I mean the cultivation of the soil In France most of those who labor for hire in agriculture are themselves owners of certain plots of ground which just enable them to subsist without working for anyone else When these laborers come to offer their services to a neighboring landowner or farmer if he refuses them a certain rate of wages they retire to their own small property and await another opportunity I think that upon the whole it may be asserted that a slow and gradual rise of wages is one of the general laws of democratic communities In proportion as social conditions become more equal wages rise and as wages are higher social conditions become more equal But a great and gloomy exception occurs in our own time I have shown in a preceding chapter that aristocracy expelled from political society has taken refuge in certain departments of productive industry and has established its sway there under another form this powerfully affects the rate of wages As a large capital is required to embark in the great manufacturing speculations to which I allude the number of persons who enter upon them is exceedingly limited as their number is small they can easily concert together and fix the rate of wages as they please Their workmen on the contrary are exceedingly numerous and the number of them is always increasing for from time to time an extraordinary run of business takes place during which wages are inordinately high and they attract the surrounding population to the factories But when once men have embraced that line of life we have already seen that they cannot quit it again because they soon contract habits of body and mind which unfit them for any other sort of toil These men have generally but little education and industry with but few resources they stand therefore almost at the mercy of the master When competition or other fortuitous circumstances lessen his profits he can reduce the wages of his workmen almost at pleasure and make from them what he loses by the chances of business Should the workmen strike the master who is a rich man can very well wait without being ruined until necessity brings them back to him but they must work day by day or they die for their only property is in their hands They have long been impoverished by oppression and the poorer they become the more easily may they be oppressed they can never escape from this fatal circle of cause and consequence It is not then surprising that wages after having sometimes suddenly risen are permanently lowered in this branch of industry whereas in other callings the price of labor which generally increases but little is nevertheless constantly augmented This state of dependence and wretchedness in which a part of the manufacturing population of our time lives forms an exception to the general rule contrary to the state of all the rest of the community but for this very reason no circumstance is more important or more deserving of the especial consideration of the legislator for when the whole of society is in motion it is difficult to keep any one class stationary and when the greater number of men are opening new paths to fortune it is no less difficult to make the few support in peace their wants and their desires Chapter VIII Influence Of Democracy On Kindred I have just examined the changes which the equality of conditions produces in the mutual relations of the several members of the community amongst democratic nations and amongst the Americans in particular I would now go deeper and inquire into the closer ties of kindred my object here is not to seek for new truths but to show in what manner facts already known are connected with my subject It has been universally remarked that in our time the several members of a family stand upon an entirely new footing towards each other that the distance which formerly separated a father from his sons has been lessened and that paternal authority if not destroyed is at least impaired Something analogous to this but even more striking may be observed in the United States In America the family in the Roman and aristocratic signification of the word does not exist All that remains of it are a few vestiges in the first years of childhood when the father exercises without opposition that absolute domestic authority which the feebleness of his children renders necessary and which their interest as well as his own incontestable superiority warrants But as soon as the young American approaches manhood the ties of filial obedience are relaxed day by day master of his thoughts he is soon master of his conduct In America there is strictly speaking no adolescence at the close of boyhood the man appears and begins to trace out his own path It would be an error to suppose that this is preceded by a domestic struggle in which the son has obtained by a sort of moral violence the liberty that his father refused him The same habits the same principles which impel the one to assert his independence predispose the other to consider the use of that independence as an incontestable right The former does not exhibit any of those rancorous or irregular passions which disturb men long after they have shaken off an established authority the latter feels none of that bitter and angry regret which is apt to survive a bygone power The father foresees the limits of his authority long beforehand and when the time arrives he surrenders it without a struggle the son looks forward to the exact period at which he will be his own master and he enters upon his freedom without precipitation and without effort as a possession which is his own and which no one seeks to wrest from him a Footnote a The Americans however have not yet thought fit to strip the parent as has been done in France of one of the chief elements of parental authority by depriving him of the power of disposing of his property at his death In the United States there are no restrictions on the powers of a testator In this respect as in almost all others it is easy to perceive that if the political legislation of the Americans is much more democratic than that of the French the civil legislation of the latter is infinitely more democratic than that of the former This may easily be accounted for The civil legislation of France was the work of a man who saw that it was his interest to satisfy the democratic passions of his contemporaries in all that was not directly and immediately hostile to his own power He was willing to allow some popular principles to regulate the distribution of property and the government of families provided they were not to be introduced into the administration of public affairs Whilst the torrent of democracy overwhelmed the civil laws of the country he hoped to find an easy shelter behind its political institutions This policy was at once both adroit and selfish but a compromise of this kind could not last for in the end political institutions never fail to become the image and expression of civil society and in this sense it may be said that nothing is more political in a nation than its civil legislation It may perhaps not be without utility to show how these changes which take place in family relations are closely connected with the social and political revolution which is approaching its consummation under our own observation There are certain great social principles which a people either introduces everywhere or tolerates nowhere In countries which are aristocratically constituted with all the gradations of rank the government never makes a direct appeal to the mass of the governed as men are united together it is enough to lead the foremost the rest will follow This is equally applicable to the family as to all aristocracies which have a head Amongst aristocratic nations social institutions recognize in truth no one in the family but the father children are received by society at his hands society governs him he governs them Thus the parent has not only a natural right but he acquires a political right to command them he is the author and the support of his family but he is also its constituted ruler In democracies where the government picks out every individual singly from the mass to make him subservient to the general laws of the community no such intermediate person is required a father is there in the eye of the law only a member of the community older and richer than his sons When most of the conditions of life are extremely unequal and the inequality of these conditions is permanent the notion of a superior grows upon the imaginations of men if the law invested him with no privileges custom and public opinion would concede them When on the contrary men differ but little from each other and do not always remain in dissimilar conditions of life the general notion of a superior becomes weaker and less distinct it is vain for legislation to strive to place him who obeys very much beneath him who commands the manners of the time bring the two men nearer to one another and draw them daily towards the same level Although the legislation of an aristocratic people should grant no peculiar privileges to the heads of families I shall not be the less convinced that their power is more respected and more extensive than in a democracy for I know that whatsoever the laws may be superiors always appear higher and inferiors lower in aristocracies than amongst democratic nations When men live more for the remembrance of what has been than for the care of what is and when they are more given to attend to what their ancestors thought than to think themselves the father is the natural and necessary tie between the past and the present the link by which the ends of these two chains are connected In aristocracies then the father is not only the civil head of the family but the oracle of its traditions the expounder of its customs the arbiter of its manners He is listened to with deference he is addressed with respect and the love which is felt for him is always tempered with fear When the condition of society becomes democratic and men adopt as their general principle that it is good and lawful to judge of all things for one s self using former points of belief not as a rule of faith but simply as a means of information the power which the opinions of a father exercise over those of his sons diminishes as well as his legal power Perhaps the subdivision of estates which democracy brings with it contributes more than anything else to change the relations existing between a father and his children When the property of the father of a family is scanty his son and himself constantly live in the same place and share the same occupations habit and necessity bring them together and force them to hold constant communication the inevitable consequence is a sort of familiar intimacy which renders authority less absolute and which can ill be reconciled with the external forms of respect Now in democratic countries the class of those who are possessed of small fortunes is precisely that which gives strength to the notions and a particular direction to the manners of the community That class makes its opinions preponderate as universally as its will and even those who are most inclined to resist its commands are carried away in the end by its example I have known eager opponents of democracy who allowed their children to address them with perfect colloquial equality Thus at the same time that the power of aristocracy is declining the austere the conventional and the legal part of parental authority vanishes and a species of equality prevails around the domestic hearth I know not upon the whole whether society loses by the change but I am inclined to believe that man individually is a gainer by it I think that in proportion as manners and laws become more democratic the relation of father and son becomes more intimate and more affectionate rules and authority are less talked of confidence and tenderness are oftentimes increased and it would seem that the natural bond is drawn closer in proportion as the social bond is loosened In a democratic family the father exercises no other power than that with which men love to invest the affection and the experience of age his orders would perhaps be disobeyed but his advice is for the most part authoritative Though he be not hedged in with ceremonial respect his sons at least accost him with confidence no settled form of speech is appropriated to the mode of addressing him but they speak to him constantly and are ready to consult him day by day the master and the constituted ruler have vanished the father remains Nothing more is needed in order to judge of the difference between the two states of society in this respect than to peruse the family correspondence of aristocratic ages The style is always correct ceremonious stiff and so cold that the natural warmth of the heart can hardly be felt in the language The language on the contrary addressed by a son to his father in democratic countries is always marked by mingled freedom familiarity and affection which at once show that new relations have sprung up in the bosom of the family A similar revolution takes place in the mutual relations of children In aristocratic families as well as in aristocratic society every place is marked out beforehand Not only does the father occupy a separate rank in which he enjoys extensive privileges but even the children are not equal amongst themselves The age and sex of each irrevocably determine his rank and secure to him certain privileges most of these distinctions are abolished or diminished by democracy In aristocratic families the eldest son inheriting the greater part of the property and almost all the rights of the family becomes the chief and to a certain extent the master of his brothers Greatness and power are for him for them mediocrity and dependence Nevertheless it would be wrong to suppose that amongst aristocratic nations the privileges of the eldest son are advantageous to himself alone or that they excite nothing but envy and hatred in those around him The eldest son commonly endeavors to procure wealth and power for his brothers because the general splendor of the house is reflected back on him who represents it the younger sons seek to back the elder brother in all his undertakings because the greatness and power of the head of the family better enable him to provide for all its branches The different members of an aristocratic family are therefore very closely bound together their interests are connected their minds agree but their hearts are seldom in harmony Democracy also binds brothers to each other but by very different means Under democratic laws all the children are perfectly equal and consequently independent nothing brings them forcibly together but nothing keeps them apart and as they have the same origin as they are trained under the same roof as they are treated with the same care and as no peculiar privilege distinguishes or divides them the affectionate and youthful intimacy of early years easily springs up between them Scarcely any opportunities occur to break the tie thus formed at the outset of life for their brotherhood brings them daily together without embarrassing them It is not then by interest but by common associations and by the free sympathy of opinion and of taste that democracy unites brothers to each other It divides their inheritance but it allows their hearts and minds to mingle together Such is the charm of these democratic manners that even the partisans of aristocracy are caught by it and after having experienced it for some time they are by no means tempted to revert to the respectful and frigid observance of aristocratic families They would be glad to retain the domestic habits of democracy if they might throw off its social conditions and its laws but these elements are indissolubly united and it is impossible to enjoy the former without enduring the latter The remarks I have made on filial love and fraternal affection are applicable to all the passions which emanate spontaneously from human nature itself If a certain mode of thought or feeling is the result of some peculiar condition of life when that condition is altered nothing whatever remains of the thought or feeling Thus a law may bind two members of the community very closely to one another but that law being abolished they stand asunder Nothing was more strict than the tie which united the vassal to the lord under the feudal system at the present day the two men know not each other the fear the gratitude and the affection which formerly connected them have vanished and not a vestige of the tie remains Such however is not the case with those feelings which are natural to mankind Whenever a law attempts to tutor these feelings in any particular manner it seldom fails to weaken them by attempting to add to their intensity it robs them of some of their elements for they are never stronger than when left to themselves Democracy which destroys or obscures almost all the old conventional rules of society and which prevents men from readily assenting to new ones entirely effaces most of the feelings to which these conventional rules have given rise but it only modifies some others and frequently imparts to them a degree of energy and sweetness unknown before Perhaps it is not impossible to condense into a single proposition the whole meaning of this chapter and of several others that preceded it Democracy loosens social ties but it draws the ties of nature more tight it brings kindred more closely together whilst it places the various members of the community more widely apart Chapter IX Education Of Young Women In The United States No free communities ever existed without morals and as I observed in the former part of this work morals are the work of woman Consequently whatever affects the condition of women their habits and their opinions has great political importance in my eyes Amongst almost all Protestant nations young women are far more the mistresses of their own actions than they are in Catholic countries This independence is still greater in Protestant countries like England which have retained or acquired the right of self government the spirit of freedom is then infused into the domestic circle by political habits and by religious opinions In the United States the doctrines of Protestantism are combined with great political freedom and a most democratic state of society and nowhere are young women surrendered so early or so completely to their own guidance Long before an American girl arrives at the age of marriage her emancipation from maternal control begins she has scarcely ceased to be a child when she already thinks for herself speaks with freedom and acts on her own impulse The great scene of the world is constantly open to her view far from seeking concealment it is every day disclosed to her more completely and she is taught to survey it with a firm and calm gaze Thus the vices and dangers of society are early revealed to her as she sees them clearly she views them without illusions and braves them without fear for she is full of reliance on her own strength and her reliance seems to be shared by all who are about her An American girl scarcely ever displays that virginal bloom in the midst of young desires or that innocent and ingenuous grace which usually attends the European woman in the transition from girlhood to youth It is rarely that an American woman at any age displays childish timidity or ignorance Like the young women of Europe she seeks to please but she knows precisely the cost of pleasing If she does not abandon herself to evil at least she knows that it exists and she is remarkable rather for purity of manners than for chastity of mind I have been frequently surprised and almost frightened at the singular address and happy boldness with which young women in America contrive to manage their thoughts and their language amidst all the difficulties of stimulating conversation a philosopher would have stumbled at every step along the narrow path which they trod without accidents and without effort It is easy indeed to perceive that even amidst the independence of early youth an American woman is always mistress of herself she indulges in all permitted pleasures without yielding herself up to any of them and her reason never allows the reins of self guidance to drop though it often seems to hold them loosely In France where remnants of every age are still so strangely mingled in the opinions and tastes of the people women commonly receive a reserved retired and almost cloistral education as they did in aristocratic times and then they are suddenly abandoned without a guide and without assistance in the midst of all the irregularities inseparable from democratic society The Americans are more consistent They have found out that in a democracy the independence of individuals cannot fail to be very great youth premature tastes ill restrained customs fleeting public opinion often unsettled and powerless paternal authority weak and marital authority contested Under these circumstances believing that they had little chance of repressing in woman the most vehement passions of the human heart they held that the surer way was to teach her the art of combating those passions for herself As they could not prevent her virtue from being exposed to frequent danger they determined that she should know how best to defend it and more reliance was placed on the free vigor of her will than on safeguards which have been shaken or overthrown Instead then of inculcating mistrust of herself they constantly seek to enhance their confidence in her own strength of character As it is neither possible nor desirable to keep a young woman in perpetual or complete ignorance they hasten to give her a precocious knowledge on all subjects Far from hiding the corruptions of the world from her they prefer that she should see them at once and train herself to shun them and they hold it of more importance to protect her conduct than to be over scrupulous of her innocence Although the Americans are a very religious people they do not rely on religion alone to defend the virtue of woman they seek to arm her reason also In this they have followed the same method as in several other respects they first make the most vigorous efforts to bring individual independence to exercise a proper control over itself and they do not call in the aid of religion until they have reached the utmost limits of human strength I am aware that an education of this kind is not without danger I am sensible that it tends to invigorate the judgment at the expense of the imagination and to make cold and virtuous women instead of affectionate wives and agreeable companions to man Society may be more tranquil and better regulated but domestic life has often fewer charms These however are secondary evils which may be braved for the sake of higher interests At the stage at which we are now arrived the time for choosing is no longer within our control a democratic education is indispensable to protect women from the dangers with which democratic institutions and manners surround them Chapter X The Young Woman In The Character Of A Wife In America the independence of woman is irrevocably lost in the bonds of matrimony if an unmarried woman is less constrained there than elsewhere a wife is subjected to stricter obligations The former makes her father s house an abode of freedom and of pleasure the latter lives in the home of her husband as if it were a cloister Yet these two different conditions of life are perhaps not so contrary as may be supposed and it is natural that the American women should pass through the one to arrive at the other Religious peoples and trading nations entertain peculiarly serious notions of marriage the former consider the regularity of woman s life as the best pledge and most certain sign of the purity of her morals the latter regard it as the highest security for the order and prosperity of the household The Americans are at the same time a puritanical people and a commercial nation their religious opinions as well as their trading habits consequently lead them to require much abnegation on the part of woman and a constant sacrifice of her pleasures to her duties which is seldom demanded of her in Europe Thus in the United States the inexorable opinion of the public carefully circumscribes woman within the narrow circle of domestic interest and duties and forbids her to step beyond it Upon her entrance into the world a young American woman finds these notions firmly established she sees the rules which are derived from them she is not slow to perceive that she cannot depart for an instant from the established usages of her contemporaries without putting in jeopardy her peace of mind her honor nay even her social existence and she finds the energy required for such an act of submission in the firmness of her understanding and in the virile habits which her education has given her It may be said that she has learned by the use of her independence to surrender it without a struggle and without a murmur when the time comes for making the sacrifice But no American woman falls into the toils of matrimony as into a snare held out to her simplicity and ignorance She has been taught beforehand what is expected of her and voluntarily and freely does she enter upon this engagement She supports her new condition with courage because she chose it As in America paternal discipline is very relaxed and the conjugal tie very strict a young woman does not contract the latter without considerable circumspection and apprehension Precocious marriages are rare Thus American women do not marry until their understandings are exercised and ripened whereas in other countries most women generally only begin to exercise and to ripen their understandings after marriage I by no means suppose however that the great change which takes place in all the habits of women in the United States as soon as they are married ought solely to be attributed to the constraint of public opinion it is frequently imposed upon themselves by the sole effort of their own will When the time for choosing a husband is arrived that cold and stern reasoning power which has been educated and invigorated by the free observation of the world teaches an American woman that a spirit of levity and independence in the bonds of marriage is a constant subject of annoyance not of pleasure it tells her that the amusements of the girl cannot become the recreations of the wife and that the sources of a married woman s happiness are in the home of her husband As she clearly discerns beforehand the only road which can lead to domestic happiness she enters upon it at once and follows it to the end without seeking to turn back The same strength of purpose which the young wives of America display in bending themselves at once and without repining to the austere duties of their new condition is no less manifest in all the great trials of their lives In no country in the world are private fortunes more precarious than in the United States It is not uncommon for the same man in the course of his life to rise and sink again through all the grades which lead from opulence to poverty American women support these vicissitudes with calm and unquenchable energy it would seem that their desires contract as easily as they expand with their fortunes a Footnote a See Appendix S The greater part of the adventurers who migrate every year to people the western wilds belong as I observed in the former part of this work to the old Anglo American race of the Northern States Many of these men who rush so boldly onwards in pursuit of wealth were already in the enjoyment of a competency in their own part of the country They take their wives along with them and make them share the countless perils and privations which always attend the commencement of these expeditions I have often met even on the verge of the wilderness with young women who after having been brought up amidst all the comforts of the large towns of New England had passed almost without any intermediate stage from the wealthy abode of their parents to a comfortless hovel in a forest Fever solitude and a tedious life had not broken the springs of their courage Their features were impaired and faded but their looks were firm they appeared to be at once sad and resolute I do not doubt that these young American women had amassed in the education of their early years that inward strength which they displayed under these circumstances The early culture of the girl may still therefore be traced in the United States under the aspect of marriage her part is changed her habits are different but her character is the same Chapter XI That The Equality Of Conditions Contributes To The Maintenance Of Good Morals In America Some philosophers and historians have said or have hinted that the strictness of female morality was increased or diminished simply by the distance of a country from the equator This solution of the difficulty was an easy one and nothing was required but a globe and a pair of compasses to settle in an instant one of the most difficult problems in the condition of mankind But I am not aware that this principle of the materialists is supported by facts The same nations have been chaste or dissolute at different periods of their history the strictness or the laxity of their morals depended therefore on some variable cause not only on the natural qualities of their country which were invariable I do not deny that in certain climates the passions which are occasioned by the mutual attraction of the sexes are peculiarly intense but I am of opinion that this natural intensity may always be excited or restrained by the condition of society and by political institutions Although the travellers who have visited North America differ on a great number of points they all agree in remarking that morals are far more strict there than elsewhere It is evident that on this point the Americans are very superior to their progenitors the English A superficial glance at the two nations will establish the fact In England as in all other countries of Europe public malice is constantly attacking the frailties of women Philosophers and statesmen are heard to deplore that morals are not sufficiently strict and the literary productions of the country constantly lead one to suppose so In America all books novels not excepted suppose women to be chaste and no one thinks of relating affairs of gallantry No doubt this great regularity of American morals originates partly in the country in the race of the people and in their religion but all these causes which operate elsewhere do not suffice to account for it recourse must be had to some special reason This reason appears to me to be the principle of equality and the institutions derived from it Equality of conditions does not of itself engender regularity of morals but it unquestionably facilitates and increases it a Footnote a See Appendix T Amongst aristocratic nations birth and fortune frequently make two such different beings of man and woman that they can never be united to each other Their passions draw them together but the condition of society and the notions suggested by it prevent them from contracting a permanent and ostensible tie The necessary consequence is a great number of transient and clandestine connections Nature secretly avenges herself for the constraint imposed upon her by the laws of man This is not so much the case when the equality of conditions has swept away all the imaginary or the real barriers which separated man from woman No girl then believes that she cannot become the wife of the man who loves her and this renders all breaches of morality before marriage very uncommon for whatever be the credulity of the passions a woman will hardly be able to persuade herself that she is beloved when her lover is perfectly free to marry her and does not The same cause operates though more indirectly on married life Nothing better serves to justify an illicit passion either to the minds of those who have conceived it or to the world which looks on than compulsory or accidental marriages b In a country in which a woman is always free to exercise her power of choosing and in which education has prepared her to choose rightly public opinion is inexorable to her faults The rigor of the Americans arises in part from this cause They consider marriages as a covenant which is often onerous but every condition of which the parties are strictly bound to fulfil because they knew all those conditions beforehand and were perfectly free not to have contracted them Footnote b The literature of Europe sufficiently corroborates this remark When a European author wishes to depict in a work of imagination any of these great catastrophes in matrimony which so frequently occur amongst us he takes care to bespeak the compassion of the reader by bringing before him ill assorted or compulsory marriages Although habitual tolerance has long since relaxed our morals an author could hardly succeed in interesting us in the misfortunes of his characters if he did not first palliate their faults This artifice seldom fails the daily scenes we witness prepare us long beforehand to be indulgent But American writers could never render these palliations probable to their readers their customs and laws are opposed to it and as they despair of rendering levity of conduct pleasing they cease to depict it This is one of the causes to which must be attributed the small number of novels published in the United States The very circumstances which render matrimonial fidelity more obligatory also render it more easy In aristocratic countries the object of marriage is rather to unite property than persons hence the husband is sometimes at school and the wife at nurse when they are betrothed It cannot be wondered at if the conjugal tie which holds the fortunes of the pair united allows their hearts to rove this is the natural result of the nature of the contract When on the contrary a man always chooses a wife for himself without any external coercion or even guidance it is generally a conformity of tastes and opinions which brings a man and a woman together and this same conformity keeps and fixes them in close habits of intimacy Our forefathers had conceived a very strange notion on the subject of marriage as they had remarked that the small number of love matches which occurred in their time almost always turned out ill they resolutely inferred that it was exceedingly dangerous to listen to the dictates of the heart on the subject Accident appeared to them to be a better guide than choice Yet it was not very difficult to perceive that the examples which they witnessed did in fact prove nothing at all For in the first place if democratic nations leave a woman at liberty to choose her husband they take care to give her mind sufficient knowledge and her will sufficient strength to make so important a choice whereas the young women who amongst aristocratic nations furtively elope from the authority of their parents to throw themselves of their own accord into the arms of men whom they have had neither time to know nor ability to judge of are totally without those securities It is not surprising that they make a bad use of their freedom of action the first time they avail themselves of it nor that they fall into such cruel mistakes when not having received a democratic education they choose to marry in conformity to democratic customs But this is not all When a man and woman are bent upon marriage in spite of the differences of an aristocratic state of society the difficulties to be overcome are enormous Having broken or relaxed the bonds of filial obedience they have then to emancipate themselves by a final effort from the sway of custom and the tyranny of opinion and when at length they have succeeded in this arduous task they stand estranged from their natural friends and kinsmen the prejudice they have crossed separates them from all and places them in a situation which soon breaks their courage and sours their hearts If then a couple married in this manner are first unhappy and afterwards criminal it ought not to be attributed to the freedom of their choice but rather to their living in a community in which this freedom of choice is not admitted Moreover it should not be forgotten that the same effort which makes a man violently shake off a prevailing error commonly impels him beyond the bounds of reason that to dare to declare war in however just a cause against the opinion of one s age and country a violent and adventurous spirit is required and that men of this character seldom arrive at happiness or virtue whatever be the path they follow And this it may be observed by the way is the reason why in the most necessary and righteous revolutions it is so rare to meet with virtuous or moderate revolutionary characters There is then no just ground for surprise if a man who in an age of aristocracy chooses to consult nothing but his own opinion and his own taste in the choice of a wife soon finds that infractions of morality and domestic wretchedness invade his household but when this same line of action is in the natural and ordinary course of things when it is sanctioned by parental authority and backed by public opinion it cannot be doubted that the internal peace of families will be increased by it and conjugal fidelity more rigidly observed Almost all men in democracies are engaged in public or professional life and on the other hand the limited extent of common incomes obliges a wife to confine herself to the house in order to watch in person and very closely over the details of domestic economy All these distinct and compulsory occupations are so many natural barriers which by keeping the two sexes asunder render the solicitations of the one less frequent and less ardent the resistance of the other more easy Not indeed that the equality of conditions can ever succeed in making men chaste but it may impart a less dangerous character to their breaches of morality As no one has then either sufficient time or opportunity to assail a virtue armed in self defence there will be at the same time a great number of courtesans and a great number of virtuous women This state of things causes lamentable cases of individual hardship but it does not prevent the body of society from being strong and alert it does not destroy family ties or enervate the morals of the nation Society is endangered not by the great profligacy of a few but by laxity of morals amongst all In the eyes of a legislator prostitution is less to be dreaded than intrigue The tumultuous and constantly harassed life which equality makes men lead not only distracts them from the passion of love by denying them time to indulge in it but it diverts them from it by another more secret but more certain road All men who live in democratic ages more or less contract the ways of thinking of the manufacturing and trading classes their minds take a serious deliberate and positive turn they are apt to relinquish the ideal in order to pursue some visible and proximate object which appears to be the natural and necessary aim of their desires Thus the principle of equality does not destroy the imagination but lowers its flight to the level of the earth No men are less addicted to reverie than the citizens of a democracy and few of them are ever known to give way to those idle and solitary meditations which commonly precede and produce the great emotions of the heart It is true they attach great importance to procuring for themselves that sort of deep regular and quiet affection which constitutes the charm and safeguard of life but they are not apt to run after those violent and capricious sources of excitement which disturb and abridge it I am aware that all this is only applicable in its full extent to America and cannot at present be extended to Europe In the course of the last half century whilst laws and customs have impelled several European nations with unexampled force towards democracy we have not had occasion to observe that the relations of man and woman have become more orderly or more chaste In some places the very reverse may be detected some classes are more strict the general morality of the people appears to be more lax I do not hesitate to make the remark for I am as little disposed to flatter my contemporaries as to malign them This fact must distress but it ought not to surprise us The propitious influence which a democratic state of society may exercise upon orderly habits is one of those tendencies which can only be discovered after a time If the equality of conditions is favorable to purity of morals the social commotion by which conditions are rendered equal is adverse to it In the last fifty years during which France has been undergoing this transformation that country has rarely had freedom always disturbance Amidst this universal confusion of notions and this general stir of opinions amidst this incoherent mixture of the just and unjust of truth and falsehood of right and might public virtue has become doubtful and private morality wavering But all revolutions whatever may have been their object or their agents have at first produced similar consequences even those which have in the end drawn the bonds of morality more tightly began by loosening them The violations of morality which the French frequently witness do not appear to me to have a permanent character and this is already betokened by some curious signs of the times Nothing is more wretchedly corrupt than an aristocracy which retains its wealth when it has lost its power and which still enjoys a vast deal of leisure after it is reduced to mere vulgar pastimes The energetic passions and great conceptions which animated it heretofore leave it then and nothing remains to it but a host of petty consuming vices which cling about it like worms upon a carcass No one denies that the French aristocracy of the last century was extremely dissolute whereas established habits and ancient belief still preserved some respect for morality amongst the other classes of society Nor will it be contested that at the present day the remnants of that same aristocracy exhibit a certain severity of morals whilst laxity of morals appears to have spread amongst the middle and lower ranks So that the same families which were most profligate fifty years ago are nowadays the most exemplary and democracy seems only to have strengthened the morality of the aristocratic classes The French Revolution by dividing the fortunes of the nobility by forcing them to attend assiduously to their affairs and to their families by making them live under the same roof with their children and in short by giving a more rational and serious turn to their minds has imparted to them almost without their being aware of it a reverence for religious belief a love of order of tranquil pleasures of domestic endearments and of comfort whereas the rest of the nation which had naturally these same tastes was carried away into excesses by the effort which was required to overthrow the laws and political habits of the country The old French aristocracy has undergone the consequences of the Revolution but it neither felt the revolutionary passions nor shared in the anarchical excitement which produced that crisis it may easily be conceived that this aristocracy feels the salutary influence of the Revolution in its manners before those who achieve it It may therefore be said though at first it seems paradoxical that at the present day the most anti democratic classes of the nation principally exhibit the kind of morality which may reasonably be anticipated from democracy I cannot but think that when we shall have obtained all the effects of this democratic Revolution after having got rid of the tumult it has caused the observations which are now only applicable to the few will gradually become true of the whole community Chapter XII How The Americans Understand The Equality Of The Sexes I Have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society but is this all or does it not ultimately affect that great inequality of man and woman which has seemed up to the present day to be eternally based in human nature I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son the master and servant and superiors and inferiors generally speaking will raise woman and make her more and more the equal of man But here more than ever I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range There are people in Europe who confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike They would give to both the same functions impose on both the same duties and grant to both the same rights they would mix them in all things their occupations their pleasures their business It may readily be conceived that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other both are degraded and from so preposterous a medley of the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes They admit that as nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things but in getting each of them to fulfil their respective tasks in the best possible manner The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on In no country has such constant care been taken as in America to trace two clearly distinct lines of action for the two sexes and to make them keep pace one with the other but in two pathways which are always different American women never manage the outward concerns of the family or conduct a business or take a part in political life nor are they on the other hand ever compelled to perform the rough labor of the fields or to make any of those laborious exertions which demand the exertion of physical strength No families are so poor as to form an exception to this rule If on the one hand an American woman cannot escape from the quiet circle of domestic employments on the other hand she is never forced to go beyond it Hence it is that the women of America who often exhibit a masculine strength of understanding and a manly energy generally preserve great delicacy of personal appearance and always retain the manners of women although they sometimes show that they have the hearts and minds of men Nor have the Americans ever supposed that one consequence of democratic principles is the subversion of marital power of the confusion of the natural authorities in families They hold that every association must have a head in order to accomplish its object and that the natural head of the conjugal association is man They do not therefore deny him the right of directing his partner and they maintain that in the smaller association of husband and wife as well as in the great social community the object of democracy is to regulate and legalize the powers which are necessary not to subvert all power This opinion is not peculiar to one sex and contested by the other I never observed that the women of America consider conjugal authority as a fortunate usurpation of their rights nor that they thought themselves degraded by submitting to it It appeared to me on the contrary that they attach a sort of pride to the voluntary surrender of their own will and make it their boast to bend themselves to the yoke not to shake it off Such at least is the feeling expressed by the most virtuous of their sex the others are silent and in the United States it is not the practice for a guilty wife to clamor for the rights of women whilst she is trampling on her holiest duties It has often been remarked that in Europe a certain degree of contempt lurks even in the flattery which men lavish upon women although a European frequently affects to be the slave of woman it may be seen that he never sincerely thinks her his equal In the United States men seldom compliment women but they daily show how much they esteem them They constantly display an entire confidence in the understanding of a wife and a profound respect for her freedom they have decided that her mind is just as fitted as that of a man to discover the plain truth and her heart as firm to embrace it and they have never sought to place her virtue any more than his under the shelter of prejudice ignorance and fear It would seem that in Europe where man so easily submits to the despotic sway of women they are nevertheless curtailed of some of the greatest qualities of the human species and considered as seductive but imperfect beings and what may well provoke astonishment women ultimately look upon themselves in the same light and almost consider it as a privilege that they are entitled to show themselves futile feeble and timid The women of America claim no such privileges Again it may be said that in our morals we have reserved strange immunities to man so that there is as it were one virtue for his use and another for the guidance of his partner and that according to the opinion of the public the very same act may be punished alternately as a crime or only as a fault The Americans know not this iniquitous division of duties and rights amongst them the seducer is as much dishonored as his victim It is true that the Americans rarely lavish upon women those eager attentions which are commonly paid them in Europe but their conduct to women always implies that they suppose them to be virtuous and refined and such is the respect entertained for the moral freedom of the sex that in the presence of a woman the most guarded language is used lest her ear should be offended by an expression In America a young unmarried woman may alone and without fear undertake a long journey The legislators of the United States who have mitigated almost all the penalties of criminal law still make rape a capital offence and no crime is visited with more inexorable severity by public opinion This may be accounted for as the Americans can conceive nothing more precious than a woman s honor and nothing which ought so much to be respected as her independence they hold that no punishment is too severe for the man who deprives her of them against her will In France where the same offence is visited with far milder penalties it is frequently difficult to get a verdict from a jury against the prisoner Is this a consequence of contempt of decency or contempt of women I cannot but believe that it is a contempt of one and of the other Thus the Americans do not think that man and woman have either the duty or the right to perform the same offices but they show an equal regard for both their respective parts and though their lot is different they consider both of them as beings of equal value They do not give to the courage of woman the same form or the same direction as to that of man but they never doubt her courage and if they hold that man and his partner ought not always to exercise their intellect and understanding in the same manner they at least believe the understanding of the one to be as sound as that of the other and her intellect to be as clear Thus then whilst they have allowed the social inferiority of woman to subsist they have done all they could to raise her morally and intellectually to the level of man and in this respect they appear to me to have excellently understood the true principle of democratic improvement As for myself I do not hesitate to avow that although the women of the United States are confined within the narrow circle of domestic life and their situation is in some respects one of extreme dependence I have nowhere seen woman occupying a loftier position and if I were asked now that I am drawing to the close of this work in which I have spoken of so many important things done by the Americans to what the singular prosperity and growing strength of that people ought mainly to be attributed I should reply to the superiority of their women Chapter XIII That The Principle Of Equality Naturally Divides The Americans Into A Number Of Small Private Circles It may probably be supposed that the final consequence and necessary effect of democratic institutions is to confound together all the members of the community in private as well as in public life and to compel them all to live in common but this would be to ascribe a very coarse and oppressive form to the equality which originates in democracy No state of society or laws can render men so much alike but that education fortune and tastes will interpose some differences between them and though different men may sometimes find it their interest to combine for the same purposes they will never make it their pleasure They will therefore always tend to evade the provisions of legislation whatever they may be and departing in some one respect from the circle within which they were to be bounded they will set up close by the great political community small private circles united together by the similitude of their conditions habits and manners In the United States the citizens have no sort of pre eminence over each other they owe each other no mutual obedience or respect they all meet for the administration of justice for the government of the State and in general to treat of the affairs which concern their common welfare but I never heard that attempts have been made to bring them all to follow the same diversions or to amuse themselves promiscuously in the same places of recreation The Americans who mingle so readily in their political assemblies and courts of justice are wont on the contrary carefully to separate into small distinct circles in order to indulge by themselves in the enjoyments of private life Each of them is willing to acknowledge all his fellow citizens as his equals but he will only receive a very limited number of them amongst his friends or his guests This appears to me to be very natural In proportion as the circle of public society is extended it may be anticipated that the sphere of private intercourse will be contracted far from supposing that the members of modern society will ultimately live in common I am afraid that they may end by forming nothing but small coteries Amongst aristocratic nations the different classes are like vast chambers out of which it is impossible to get into which it is impossible to enter These classes have no communication with each other but within their pale men necessarily live in daily contact even though they would not naturally suit the general conformity of a similar condition brings them nearer together But when neither law nor custom professes to establish frequent and habitual relations between certain men their intercourse originates in the accidental analogy of opinions and tastes hence private society is infinitely varied In democracies where the members of the community never differ much from each other and naturally stand in such propinquity that they may all at any time be confounded in one general mass numerous artificial and arbitrary distinctions spring up by means of which every man hopes to keep himself aloof lest he should be carried away in the crowd against his will This can never fail to be the case for human institutions may be changed but not man whatever may be the general endeavor of a community to render its members equal and alike the personal pride of individuals will always seek to rise above the line and to form somewhere an inequality to their own advantage In aristocracies men are separated from each other by lofty stationary barriers in democracies they are divided by a number of small and almost invisible threads which are constantly broken or moved from place to place Thus whatever may be the progress of equality in democratic nations a great number of small private communities will always be formed within the general pale of political society but none of them will bear any resemblance in its manners to the highest class in aristocracies Chapter XIV Some Reflections On American Manners Nothing seems at first sight less important than the outward form of human actions yet there is nothing upon which men set more store they grow used to everything except to living in a society which has not their own manners The influence of the social and political state of a country upon manners is therefore deserving of serious examination Manners are generally the product of the very basis of the character of a people but they are also sometimes the result of an arbitrary convention between certain men thus they are at once natural and acquired When certain men perceive that they are the foremost persons in society without contestation and without effort when they are constantly engaged on large objects leaving the more minute details to others and when they live in the enjoyment of wealth which they did not amass and which they do not fear to lose it may be supposed that they feel a kind of haughty disdain of the petty interests and practical cares of life and that their thoughts assume a natural greatness which their language and their manners denote In democratic countries manners are generally devoid of dignity because private life is there extremely petty in its character and they are frequently low because the mind has few opportunities of rising above the engrossing cares of domestic interests True dignity in manners consists in always taking one s proper station neither too high nor too low and this is as much within the reach of a peasant as of a prince In democracies all stations appear doubtful hence it is that the manners of democracies though often full of arrogance are commonly wanting in dignity and moreover they are never either well disciplined or accomplished The men who live in democracies are too fluctuating for a certain number of them ever to succeed in laying down a code of good breeding and in forcing people to follow it Every man therefore behaves after his own fashion and there is always a certain incoherence in the manners of such times because they are moulded upon the feelings and notions of each individual rather than upon an ideal model proposed for general imitation This however is much more perceptible at the time when an aristocracy has just been overthrown than after it has long been destroyed New political institutions and new social elements then bring to the same places of resort and frequently compel to live in common men whose education and habits are still amazingly dissimilar and this renders the motley composition of society peculiarly visible The existence of a former strict code of good breeding is still remembered but what it contained or where it is to be found is already forgotten Men have lost the common law of manners and they have not yet made up their minds to do without it but everyone endeavors to make to himself some sort of arbitrary and variable rule from the remnant of former usages so that manners have neither the regularity and the dignity which they often display amongst aristocratic nations nor the simplicity and freedom which they sometimes assume in democracies they are at once constrained and without constraint This however is not the normal state of things When the equality of conditions is long established and complete as all men entertain nearly the same notions and do nearly the same things they do not require to agree or to copy from one another in order to speak or act in the same manner their manners are constantly characterized by a number of lesser diversities but not by any great differences They are never perfectly alike because they do not copy from the same pattern they are never very unlike because their social condition is the same At first sight a traveller would observe that the manners of all the Americans are exactly similar it is only upon close examination that the peculiarities in which they differ may be detected The English make game of the manners of the Americans but it is singular that most of the writers who have drawn these ludicrous delineations belonged themselves to the middle classes in England to whom the same delineations are exceedingly applicable so that these pitiless censors for the most part furnish an example of the very thing they blame in the United States they do not perceive that they are deriding themselves to the great amusement of the aristocracy of their own country Nothing is more prejudicial to democracy than its outward forms of behavior many men would willingly endure its vices who cannot support its manners I cannot however admit that there is nothing commendable in the manners of a democratic people Amongst aristocratic nations all who live within reach of the first class in society commonly strain to be like it which gives rise to ridiculous and insipid imitations As a democratic people does not possess any models of high breeding at least it escapes the daily necessity of seeing wretched copies of them In democracies manners are never so refined as amongst aristocratic nations but on the other hand they are never so coarse Neither the coarse oaths of the populace nor the elegant and choice expressions of the nobility are to be heard there the manners of such a people are often vulgar but they are neither brutal nor mean I have already observed that in democracies no such thing as a regular code of good breeding can be laid down this has some inconveniences and some advantages In aristocracies the rules of propriety impose the same demeanor on everyone they make all the members of the same class appear alike in spite of their private inclinations they adorn and they conceal the natural man Amongst a democratic people manners are neither so tutored nor so uniform but they are frequently more sincere They form as it were a light and loosely woven veil through which the real feelings and private opinions of each individual are easily discernible The form and the substance of human actions often therefore stand in closer relation and if the great picture of human life be less embellished it is more true Thus it may be said in one sense that the effect of democracy is not exactly to give men any particular manners but to prevent them from having manners at all The feelings the passions the virtues and the vices of an aristocracy may sometimes reappear in a democracy but not its manners they are lost and vanish forever as soon as the democratic revolution is completed It would seem that nothing is more lasting than the manners of an aristocratic class for they are preserved by that class for some time after it has lost its wealth and its power nor so fleeting for no sooner have they disappeared than not a trace of them is to be found and it is scarcely possible to say what they have been as soon as they have ceased to be A change in the state of society works this miracle and a few generations suffice to consummate it The principal characteristics of aristocracy are handed down by history after an aristocracy is destroyed but the light and exquisite touches of manners are effaced from men s memories almost immediately after its fall Men can no longer conceive what these manners were when they have ceased to witness them they are gone and their departure was unseen unfelt for in order to feel that refined enjoyment which is derived from choice and distinguished manners habit and education must have prepared the heart and the taste for them is lost almost as easily as the practice of them Thus not only a democratic people cannot have aristocratic manners but they neither comprehend nor desire them and as they never have thought of them it is to their minds as if such things had never been Too much importance should not be attached to this loss but it may well be regretted I am aware that it has not unfrequently happened that the same men have had very high bred manners and very low born feelings the interior of courts has sufficiently shown what imposing externals may conceal the meanest hearts But though the manners of aristocracy did not constitute virtue they sometimes embellish virtue itself It was no ordinary sight to see a numerous and powerful class of men whose every outward action seemed constantly to be dictated by a natural elevation of thought and feeling by delicacy and regularity of taste and by urbanity of manners Those manners threw a pleasing illusory charm over human nature and though the picture was often a false one it could not be viewed without a noble satisfaction Chapter XV Of The Gravity Of The Americans And Why It Does Not Prevent Them From Often Committing Inconsiderate Actions Men who live in democratic countries do not value the simple turbulent or coarse diversions in which the people indulge in aristocratic communities such diversions are thought by them to be puerile or insipid Nor have they a greater inclination for the intellectual and refined amusements of the aristocratic classes They want something productive and substantial in their pleasures they want to mix actual fruition with their joy In aristocratic communities the people readily give themselves up to bursts of tumultuous and boisterous gayety which shake off at once the recollection of their privations the natives of democracies are not fond of being thus violently broken in upon and they never lose sight of their own selves without regret They prefer to these frivolous delights those more serious and silent amusements which are like business and which do not drive business wholly from their minds An American instead of going in a leisure hour to dance merrily at some place of public resort as the fellows of his calling continue to do throughout the greater part of Europe shuts himself up at home to drink He thus enjoys two pleasures he can go on thinking of his business and he can get drunk decently by his own fireside I thought that the English constituted the most serious nation on the face of the earth but I have since seen the Americans and have changed my opinion I do not mean to say that temperament has not a great deal to do with the character of the inhabitants of the United States but I think that their political institutions are a still more influential cause I believe the seriousness of the Americans arises partly from their pride In democratic countries even poor men entertain a lofty notion of their personal importance they look upon themselves with complacency and are apt to suppose that others are looking at them too With this disposition they watch their language and their actions with care and do not lay themselves open so as to betray their deficiencies to preserve their dignity they think it necessary to retain their gravity But I detect another more deep seated and powerful cause which instinctively produces amongst the Americans this astonishing gravity Under a despotism communities give way at times to bursts of vehement joy but they are generally gloomy and moody because they are afraid Under absolute monarchies tempered by the customs and manners of the country their spirits are often cheerful and even because as they have some freedom and a good deal of security they are exempted from the most important cares of life but all free peoples are serious because their minds are habitually absorbed by the contemplation of some dangerous or difficult purpose This is more especially the case amongst those free nations which form democratic communities Then there are in all classes a very large number of men constantly occupied with the serious affairs of the government and those whose thoughts are not engaged in the direction of the commonwealth are wholly engrossed by the acquisition of a private fortune Amongst such a people a serious demeanor ceases to be peculiar to certain men and becomes a habit of the nation We are told of small democracies in the days of antiquity in which the citizens met upon the public places with garlands of roses and spent almost all their time in dancing and theatrical amusements I do not believe in such republics any more than in that of Plato or if the things we read of really happened I do not hesitate to affirm that these supposed democracies were composed of very different elements from ours and that they had nothing in common with the latter except their name But it must not be supposed that in the midst of all their toils the people who live in democracies think themselves to be pitied the contrary is remarked to be the case No men are fonder of their own condition Life would have no relish for them if they were delivered from the anxieties which harass them and they show more attachment to their cares than aristocratic nations to their pleasures I am next led to inquire how it is that these same democratic nations which are so serious sometimes act in so inconsiderate a manner The Americans who almost always preserve a staid demeanor and a frigid air nevertheless frequently allow themselves to be borne away far beyond the bound of reason by a sudden passion or a hasty opinion and they sometimes gravely commit strange absurdities This contrast ought not to surprise us There is one sort of ignorance which originates in extreme publicity In despotic States men know not how to act because they are told nothing in democratic nations they often act at random because nothing is to be left untold The former do not know the latter forget and the chief features of each picture are lost to them in a bewilderment of details It is astonishing what imprudent language a public man may sometimes use in free countries and especially in democratic States without being compromised whereas in absolute monarchies a few words dropped by accident are enough to unmask him forever and ruin him without hope of redemption This is explained by what goes before When a man speaks in the midst of a great crowd many of his words are not heard or are forthwith obliterated from the memories of those who hear them but amidst the silence of a mute and motionless throng the slightest whisper strikes the ear In democracies men are never stationary a thousand chances waft them to and fro and their life is always the sport of unforeseen or so to speak extemporaneous circumstances Thus they are often obliged to do things which they have imperfectly learned to say things they imperfectly understand and to devote themselves to work for which they are unprepared by long apprenticeship In aristocracies every man has one sole object which he unceasingly pursues but amongst democratic nations the existence of man is more complex the same mind will almost always embrace several objects at the same time and these objects are frequently wholly foreign to each other as it cannot know them all well the mind is readily satisfied with imperfect notions of each When the inhabitant of democracies is not urged by his wants he is so at least by his desires for of all the possessions which he sees around him none are wholly beyond his reach He therefore does everything in a hurry he is always satisfied with pretty well and never pauses more than an instant to consider what he has been doing His curiosity is at once insatiable and cheaply satisfied for he cares more to know a great deal quickly than to know anything well he has no time and but little taste to search things to the bottom Thus then democratic peoples are grave because their social and political condition constantly leads them to engage in serious occupations and they act inconsiderately because they give but little time and attention to each of these occupations The habit of inattention must be considered as the greatest bane of the democratic character Chapter XVI Why The National Vanity Of The Americans Is More Restless And Captious Than That Of The English All free nations are vainglorious but national pride is not displayed by all in the same manner The Americans in their intercourse with strangers appear impatient of the smallest censure and insatiable of praise The most slender eulogium is acceptable to them the most exalted seldom contents them they unceasingly harass you to extort praise and if you resist their entreaties they fall to praising themselves It would seem as if doubting their own merit they wished to have it constantly exhibited before their eyes Their vanity is not only greedy but restless and jealous it will grant nothing whilst it demands everything but is ready to beg and to quarrel at the same time If I say to an American that the country he lives in is a fine one Ay he replies there is not its fellow in the world If I applaud the freedom which its inhabitants enjoy he answers Freedom is a fine thing but few nations are worthy to enjoy it If I remark the purity of morals which distinguishes the United States I can imagine says he that a stranger who has been struck by the corruption of all other nations is astonished at the difference At length I leave him to the contemplation of himself but he returns to the charge and does not desist till he has got me to repeat all I had just been saying It is impossible to conceive a more troublesome or more garrulous patriotism it wearies even those who are disposed to respect it a Footnote a See Appendix U Such is not the case with the English An Englishman calmly enjoys the real or imaginary advantages which in his opinion his country possesses If he grants nothing to other nations neither does he solicit anything for his own The censure of foreigners does not affect him and their praise hardly flatters him his position with regard to the rest of the world is one of disdainful and ignorant reserve his pride requires no sustenance it nourishes itself It is remarkable that two nations so recently sprung from the same stock should be so opposite to one another in their manner of feeling and conversing In aristocratic countries the great possess immense privileges upon which their pride rests without seeking to rely upon the lesser advantages which accrue to them As these privileges came to them by inheritance they regard them in some sort as a portion of themselves or at least as a natural right inherent in their own persons They therefore entertain a calm sense of their superiority they do not dream of vaunting privileges which everyone perceives and no one contests and these things are not sufficiently new to them to be made topics of conversation They stand unmoved in their solitary greatness well assured that they are seen of all the world without any effort to show themselves off and that no one will attempt to drive them from that position When an aristocracy carries on the public affairs its national pride naturally assumes this reserved indifferent and haughty form which is imitated by all the other classes of the nation When on the contrary social conditions differ but little the slightest privileges are of some importance as every man sees around himself a million of people enjoying precisely similar or analogous advantages his pride becomes craving and jealous he clings to mere trifles and doggedly defends them In democracies as the conditions of life are very fluctuating men have almost always recently acquired the advantages which they possess the consequence is that they feel extreme pleasure in exhibiting them to show others and convince themselves that they really enjoy them As at any instant these same advantages may be lost their possessors are constantly on the alert and make a point of showing that they still retain them Men living in democracies love their country just as they love themselves and they transfer the habits of their private vanity to their vanity as a nation The restless and insatiable vanity of a democratic people originates so entirely in the equality and precariousness of social conditions that the members of the haughtiest nobility display the very same passion in those lesser portions of their existence in which there is anything fluctuating or contested An aristocratic class always differs greatly from the other classes of the nation by the extent and perpetuity of its privileges but it often happens that the only differences between the members who belong to it consist in small transient advantages which may any day be lost or acquired The members of a powerful aristocracy collected in a capital or a court have been known to contest with virulence those frivolous privileges which depend on the caprice of fashion or the will of their master These persons then displayed towards each other precisely the same puerile jealousies which animate the men of democracies the same eagerness to snatch the smallest advantages which their equals contested and the same desire to parade ostentatiously those of which they were in possession If national pride ever entered into the minds of courtiers I do not question that they would display it in the same manner as the members of a democratic community Chapter XVII That The Aspect Of Society In The United States Is At Once Excited And Monotonous It would seem that nothing can be more adapted to stimulate and to feed curiosity than the aspect of the United States Fortunes opinions and laws are there in ceaseless variation it is as if immutable nature herself were mutable such are the changes worked upon her by the hand of man Yet in the end the sight of this excited community becomes monotonous and after having watched the moving pageant for a time the spectator is tired of it Amongst aristocratic nations every man is pretty nearly stationary in his own sphere but men are astonishingly unlike each other their passions their notions their habits and their tastes are essentially different nothing changey but everything differs In democracies on the contrary all men are alike and do things pretty nearly alike It is true that they are subject to great and frequent vicissitudes but as the same events of good or adverse fortune are continually recurring the name of the actors only is changed the piece is always the same The aspect of American society is animated because men and things are always changing but it is monotonous because all these changes are alike Men living in democratic ages have many passions but most of their passions either end in the love of riches or proceed from it The cause of this is not that their souls are narrower but that the importance of money is really greater at such times When all the members of a community are independent of or indifferent to each other the company operation of each of them can only be obtained by paying for it this infinitely multiplies the purposes to which wealth may be applied and increases its value When the reverence which belonged to what is old has vanished birth condition and profession no longer distinguish men or scarcely distinguish them at all hardly anything but money remains to create strongly marked differences between them and to raise some of them above the common level The distinction originating in wealth is increased by the disappearance and diminution of all other distinctions Amongst aristocratic nations money only reaches to a few points on the vast circle of man s desires in democracies it seems to lead to all The love of wealth is therefore to be traced either as a principal or an accessory motive at the bottom of all that the Americans do this gives to all their passions a sort of family likeness and soon renders the survey of them exceedingly wearisome This perpetual recurrence of the same passion is monotonous the peculiar methods by which this passion seeks its own gratification are no less so In an orderly and constituted democracy like the United States where men cannot enrich themselves by war by public office or by political confiscation the love of wealth mainly drives them into business and manufactures Although these pursuits often bring about great commotions and disasters they cannot prosper without strictly regular habits and a long routine of petty uniform acts The stronger the passion is the more regular are these habits and the more uniform are these acts It may be said that it is the vehemence of their desires which makes the Americans so methodical it perturbs their minds but it disciplines their lives The remark I here apply to America may indeed be addressed to almost all our contemporaries Variety is disappearing from the human race the same ways of acting thinking and feeling are to be met with all over the world This is not only because nations work more upon each other and are more faithful in their mutual imitation but as the men of each country relinquish more and more the peculiar opinions and feelings of a caste a profession or a family they simultaneously arrive at something nearer to the constitution of man which is everywhere the same Thus they become more alike even without having imitated each other Like travellers scattered about some large wood which is intersected by paths converging to one point if all of them keep their eyes fixed upon that point and advance towards it they insensibly draw nearer together though they seek not though they see not though they know not each other and they will be surprised at length to find themselves all collected on the same spot All the nations which take not any particular man but man himself as the object of their researches and their imitations are tending in the end to a similar state of society like these travellers converging to the central plot of the forest Chapter XVIII Of Honor In The United States And In Democratic Communities It would seem that men employ two very distinct methods in the public estimation a of the actions of their fellowmen at one time they judge them by those simple notions of right and wrong which are diffused all over the world at another they refer their decision to a few very special notions which belong exclusively to some particular age and country It often happens that these two rules differ they sometimes conflict but they are never either entirely identified or entirely annulled by one another Honor at the periods of its greatest power sways the will more than the belief of men and even whilst they yield without hesitation and without a murmur to its dictates they feel notwithstanding by a dim but mighty instinct the existence of a more general more ancient and more holy law which they sometimes disobey although they cease not to acknowledge it Some actions have been held to be at the same time virtuous and dishonorable a refusal to fight a duel is a case in point Footnote a The word honor is not always used in the same sense either in French or English I It first signifies the dignity glory or reverence which a man receives from his kind and in this sense a man is said to acquire honor two Honor signifies the aggregate of those rules by the assistance of which this dignity glory or reverence is obtained Thus we say that a man has always strictly obeyed the laws of honor or a man has violated his honor In this chapter the word is always used in the latter sense I think these peculiarities may be otherwise explained than by the mere caprices of certain individuals and nations as has hitherto been the customary mode of reasoning on the subject Mankind is subject to general and lasting wants that have engendered moral laws to the neglect of which men have ever and in all places attached the notion of censure and shame to infringe them was to do ill to do well was to conform to them Within the bosom of this vast association of the human race lesser associations have been formed which are called nations and amidst these nations further subdivisions have assumed the names of classes or castes Each of these associations forms as it were a separate species of the human race and though it has no essential difference from the mass of mankind to a certain extent it stands apart and has certain wants peculiar to itself To these special wants must be attributed the modifications which affect in various degrees and in different countries the mode of considering human actions and the estimate which ought to be formed of them It is the general and permanent interest of mankind that men should not kill each other but it may happen to be the peculiar and temporary interest of a people or a class to justify or even to honor homicide Honor is simply that peculiar rule founded upon a peculiar state of society by the application of which a people or a class allot praise or blame Nothing is more unproductive to the mind than an abstract idea I therefore hasten to call in the aid of facts and examples to illustrate my meaning I select the most extraordinary kind of honor which was ever known in the world and that which we are best acquainted with viz aristocratic honor springing out of feudal society I shall explain it by means of the principle already laid down and I shall explain the principle by means of the illustration I am not here led to inquire when and how the aristocracy of the Middle Ages came into existence why it was so deeply severed from the remainder of the nation or what founded and consolidated its power I take its existence as an established fact and I am endeavoring to account for the peculiar view which it took of the greater part of human actions The first thing that strikes me is that in the feudal world actions were not always praised or blamed with reference to their intrinsic worth but that they were sometimes appreciated exclusively with reference to the person who was the actor or the object of them which is repugnant to the general conscience of mankind Thus some of the actions which were indifferent on the part of a man in humble life dishonored a noble others changed their whole character according as the person aggrieved by them belonged or did not belong to the aristocracy When these different notions first arose the nobility formed a distinct body amidst the people which it commanded from the inaccessible heights where it was ensconced To maintain this peculiar position which constituted its strength it not only required political privileges but it required a standard of right and wrong for its own especial use That some particular virtue or vice belonged to the nobility rather than to the humble classes that certain actions were guiltless when they affected the villain which were criminal when they touched the noble these were often arbitrary matters but that honor or shame should be attached to a man s actions according to his condition was a result of the internal constitution of an aristocratic community This has been actually the case in all the countries which have had an aristocracy as long as a trace of the principle remains these peculiarities will still exist to debauch a woman of color scarcely injures the reputation of an American to marry her dishonors him In some cases feudal honor enjoined revenge and stigmatized the forgiveness of insults in others it imperiously commanded men to conquer their own passions and imposed forgetfulness of self It did not make humanity or kindness its law but it extolled generosity it set more store on liberality than on benevolence it allowed men to enrich themselves by gambling or by war but not by labor it preferred great crimes to small earnings cupidity was less distasteful to it than avarice violence it often sanctioned but cunning and treachery it invariably reprobated as contemptible These fantastical notions did not proceed exclusively from the caprices of those who entertained them A class which has succeeded in placing itself at the head of and above all others and which makes perpetual exertions to maintain this lofty position must especially honor those virtues which are conspicuous for their dignity and splendor and which may be easily combined with pride and the love of power Such men would not hesitate to invert the natural order of the conscience in order to give those virtues precedence before all others It may even be conceived that some of the more bold and brilliant vices would readily be set above the quiet unpretending virtues The very existence of such a class in society renders these things unavoidable The nobles of the Middle Ages placed military courage foremost amongst virtues and in lieu of many of them This was again a peculiar opinion which arose necessarily from the peculiarity of the state of society Feudal aristocracy existed by war and for war its power had been founded by arms and by arms that power was maintained it therefore required nothing more than military courage and that quality was naturally exalted above all others whatever denoted it even at the expense of reason and humanity was therefore approved and frequently enjoined by the manners of the time Such was the main principle the caprice of man was only to be traced in minuter details That a man should regard a tap on the cheek as an unbearable insult and should be obliged to kill in single combat the person who struck him thus lightly is an arbitrary rule but that a noble could not tranquilly receive an insult and was dishonored if he allowed himself to take a blow without fighting were direct consequences of the fundamental principles and the wants of military aristocracy Thus it was true to a certain extent to assert that the laws of honor were capricious but these caprices of honor were always confined within certain necessary limits The peculiar rule which was called honor by our forefathers is so far from being an arbitrary law in my eyes that I would readily engage to ascribe its most incoherent and fantastical injunctions to a small number of fixed and invariable wants inherent in feudal society If I were to trace the notion of feudal honor into the domain of politics I should not find it more difficult to explain its dictates The state of society and the political institutions of the Middle Ages were such that the supreme power of the nation never governed the community directly That power did not exist in the eyes of the people every man looked up to a certain individual whom he was bound to obey by that intermediate personage he was connected with all the others Thus in feudal society the whole system of the commonwealth rested upon the sentiment of fidelity to the person of the lord to destroy that sentiment was to open the sluices of anarchy Fidelity to a political superior was moreover a sentiment of which all the members of the aristocracy had constant opportunities of estimating the importance for every one of them was a vassal as well as a lord and had to command as well as to obey To remain faithful to the lord to sacrifice one s self for him if called upon to share his good or evil fortunes to stand by him in his undertakings whatever they might be such were the first injunctions of feudal honor in relation to the political institutions of those times The treachery of a vassal was branded with extraordinary severity by public opinion and a name of peculiar infamy was invented for the offence which was called felony On the contrary few traces are to be found in the Middle Ages of the passion which constituted the life of the nations of antiquity I mean patriotism the word itself is not of very ancient date in the language b Feudal institutions concealed the country at large from men s sight and rendered the love of it less necessary The nation was forgotten in the passions which attached men to persons Hence it was no part of the strict law of feudal honor to remain faithful to one s country Not indeed that the love of their country did not exist in the hearts of our forefathers but it constituted a dim and feeble instinct which has grown more clear and strong in proportion as aristocratic classes have been abolished and the supreme power of the nation centralized This may be clearly seen from the contrary judgments which European nations have passed upon the various events of their histories according to the generations by which such judgments have been formed The circumstance which most dishonored the Constable de Bourbon in the eyes of his contemporaries was that he bore arms against his king that which most dishonors him in our eyes is that he made war against his country we brand him as deeply as our forefathers did but for different reasons Footnote b Even the word patrie was not used by the French writers until the sixteenth century I have chosen the honor of feudal times by way of illustration of my meaning because its characteristics are more distinctly marked and more familiar to us than those of any other period but I might have taken an example elsewhere and I should have reached the same conclusion by a different road Although we are less perfectly acquainted with the Romans than with our own ancestors yet we know that certain peculiar notions of glory and disgrace obtained amongst them which were not solely derived from the general principles of right and wrong Many human actions were judged differently according as they affected a Roman citizen or a stranger a freeman or a slave certain vices were blazoned abroad certain virtues were extolled above all others In that age says Plutarch in the life of Coriolanus martial prowess was more honored and prized in Rome than all the other virtues insomuch that it was called virtus the name of virtue itself by applying the name of the kind to this particular species so that virtue in Latin was as much as to say valor Can anyone fail to recognize the peculiar want of that singular community which was formed for the conquest of the world Any nation would furnish us with similar grounds of observation for as I have already remarked whenever men collect together as a distinct community the notion of honor instantly grows up amongst them that is to say a system of opinions peculiar to themselves as to what is blamable or commendable and these peculiar rules always originate in the special habits and special interests of the community This is applicable to a certain extent to democratic communities as well as to others as we shall now proceed to prove by the example of the Americans c Some loose notions of the old aristocratic honor of Europe are still to be found scattered amongst the opinions of the Americans but these traditional opinions are few in number they have but little root in the country and but little power They are like a religion which has still some temples left standing though men have ceased to believe in it But amidst these half obliterated notions of exotic honor some new opinions have sprung up which constitute what may be termed in our days American honor I have shown how the Americans are constantly driven to engage in commerce and industry Their origin their social condition their political institutions and even the spot they inhabit urge them irresistibly in this direction Their present condition is then that of an almost exclusively manufacturing and commercial association placed in the midst of a new and boundless country which their principal object is to explore for purposes of profit This is the characteristic which most peculiarly distinguishes the American people from all others at the present time All those quiet virtues which tend to give a regular movement to the community and to encourage business will therefore be held in peculiar honor by that people and to neglect those virtues will be to incur public contempt All the more turbulent virtues which often dazzle but more frequently disturb society will on the contrary occupy a subordinate rank in the estimation of this same people they may be neglected without forfeiting the esteem of the community to acquire them would perhaps be to run a risk of losing it Footnote c I speak here of the Americans inhabiting those States where slavery does not exist they alone can be said to present a complete picture of democratic society The Americans make a no less arbitrary classification of men s vices There are certain propensities which appear censurable to the general reason and the universal conscience of mankind but which happen to agree with the peculiar and temporary wants of the American community these propensities are lightly reproved sometimes even encouraged for instance the love of wealth and the secondary propensities connected with it may be more particularly cited To clear to till and to transform the vast uninhabited continent which is his domain the American requires the daily support of an energetic passion that passion can only be the love of wealth the passion for wealth is therefore not reprobated in America and provided it does not go beyond the bounds assigned to it for public security it is held in honor The American lauds as a noble and praiseworthy ambition what our own forefathers in the Middle Ages stigmatized as servile cupidity just as he treats as a blind and barbarous frenzy that ardor of conquest and martial temper which bore them to battle In the United States fortunes are lost and regained without difficulty the country is boundless and its resources inexhaustible The people have all the wants and cravings of a growing creature and whatever be their efforts they are always surrounded by more than they can appropriate It is not the ruin of a few individuals which may be soon repaired but the inactivity and sloth of the community at large which would be fatal to such a people Boldness of enterprise is the foremost cause of its rapid progress its strength and its greatness Commercial business is there like a vast lottery by which a small number of men continually lose but the State is always a gainer such a people ought therefore to encourage and do honor to boldness in commercial speculations But any bold speculation risks the fortune of the speculator and of all those who put their trust in him The Americans who make a virtue of commercial temerity have no right in any case to brand with disgrace those who practise it Hence arises the strange indulgence which is shown to bankrupts in the United States their honor does not suffer by such an accident In this respect the Americans differ not only from the nations of Europe but from all the commercial nations of our time and accordingly they resemble none of them in their position or their wants In America all those vices which tend to impair the purity of morals and to destroy the conjugal tie are treated with a degree of severity which is unknown in the rest of the world At first sight this seems strangely at variance with the tolerance shown there on other subjects and one is surprised to meet with a morality so relaxed and so austere amongst the selfsame people But these things are less incoherent than they seem to be Public opinion in the United States very gently represses that love of wealth which promotes the commercial greatness and the prosperity of the nation and it especially condemns that laxity of morals which diverts the human mind from the pursuit of well being and disturbs the internal order of domestic life which is so necessary to success in business To earn the esteem of their countrymen the Americans are therefore constrained to adapt themselves to orderly habits and it may be said in this sense that they make it a matter of honor to live chastely On one point American honor accords with the notions of honor acknowledged in Europe it places courage as the highest virtue and treats it as the greatest of the moral necessities of man but the notion of courage itself assumes a different aspect In the United States martial valor is but little prized the courage which is best known and most esteemed is that which emboldens men to brave the dangers of the ocean in order to arrive earlier in port to support the privations of the wilderness without complaint and solitude more cruel than privations the courage which renders them almost insensible to the loss of a fortune laboriously acquired and instantly prompts to fresh exertions to make another Courage of this kind is peculiarly necessary to the maintenance and prosperity of the American communities and it is held by them in peculiar honor and estimation to betray a want of it is to incur certain disgrace I have yet another characteristic point which may serve to place the idea of this chapter in stronger relief In a democratic society like that of the United States where fortunes are scanty and insecure everybody works and work opens a way to everything this has changed the point of honor quite round and has turned it against idleness I have sometimes met in America with young men of wealth personally disinclined to all laborious exertion but who had been compelled to embrace a profession Their disposition and their fortune allowed them to remain without employment public opinion forbade it too imperiously to be disobeyed In the European countries on the contrary where aristocracy is still struggling with the flood which overwhelms it I have often seen men constantly spurred on by their wants and desires remain in idleness in order not to lose the esteem of their equals and I have known them submit to ennui and privations rather than to work No one can fail to perceive that these opposite obligations are two different rules of conduct both nevertheless originating in the notion of honor What our forefathers designated as honor absolutely was in reality only one of its forms they gave a generic name to what was only a species Honor therefore is to be found in democratic as well as in aristocratic ages but it will not be difficult to show that it assumes a different aspect in the former Not only are its injunctions different but we shall shortly see that they are less numerous less precise and that its dictates are less rigorously obeyed The position of a caste is always much more peculiar than that of a people Nothing is so much out of the way of the world as a small community invariably composed of the same families as was for instance the aristocracy of the Middle Ages whose object is to concentrate and to retain exclusively and hereditarily education wealth and power amongst its own members But the more out of the way the position of a community happens to be the more numerous are its special wants and the more extensive are its notions of honor corresponding to those wants The rules of honor will therefore always be less numerous amongst a people not divided into castes than amongst any other If ever any nations are constituted in which it may even be difficult to find any peculiar classes of society the notion of honor will be confined to a small number of precepts which will be more and more in accordance with the moral laws adopted by the mass of mankind Thus the laws of honor will be less peculiar and less multifarious amongst a democratic people than in an aristocracy They will also be more obscure and this is a necessary consequence of what goes before for as the distinguishing marks of honor are less numerous and less peculiar it must often be difficult to distinguish them To this other reasons may be added Amongst the aristocratic nations of the Middle Ages generation succeeded generation in vain each family was like a never dying ever stationary man and the state of opinions was hardly more changeable than that of conditions Everyone then had always the same objects before his eyes which he contemplated from the same point his eyes gradually detected the smallest details and his discernment could not fail to become in the end clear and accurate Thus not only had the men of feudal times very extraordinary opinions in matters of honor but each of those opinions was present to their minds under a clear and precise form This can never be the case in America where all men are in constant motion and where society transformed daily by its own operations changes its opinions together with its wants In such a country men have glimpses of the rules of honor but they have seldom time to fix attention upon them But even if society were motionless it would still be difficult to determine the meaning which ought to be attached to the word honor In the Middle Ages as each class had its own honor the same opinion was never received at the same time by a large number of men and this rendered it possible to give it a determined and accurate form which was the more easy as all those by whom it was received having a perfectly identical and most peculiar position were naturally disposed to agree upon the points of a law which was made for themselves alone Thus the code of honor became a complete and detailed system in which everything was anticipated and provided for beforehand and a fixed and always palpable standard was applied to human actions Amongst a democratic nation like the Americans in which ranks are identified and the whole of society forms one single mass composed of elements which are all analogous though not entirely similar it is impossible ever to agree beforehand on what shall or shall not be allowed by the laws of honor Amongst that people indeed some national wants do exist which give rise to opinions common to the whole nation on points of honor but these opinions never occur at the same time in the same manner or with the same intensity to the minds of the whole community the law of honor exists but it has no organs to promulgate it The confusion is far greater still in a democratic country like France where the different classes of which the former fabric of society was composed being brought together but not yet mingled import day by day into each other s circles various and sometimes conflicting notions of honor where every man at his own will and pleasure forsakes one portion of his forefathers creed and retains another so that amidst so many arbitrary measures no common rule can ever be established and it is almost impossible to predict which actions will be held in honor and which will be thought disgraceful Such times are wretched but they are of short duration As honor amongst democratic nations is imperfectly defined its influence is of course less powerful for it is difficult to apply with certainty and firmness a law which is not distinctly known Public opinion the natural and supreme interpreter of the laws of honor not clearly discerning to which side censure or approval ought to lean can only pronounce a hesitating judgment Sometimes the opinion of the public may contradict itself more frequently it does not act and lets things pass The weakness of the sense of honor in democracies also arises from several other causes In aristocratic countries the same notions of honor are always entertained by only a few persons always limited in number often separated from the rest of their fellow citizens Honor is easily mingled and identified in their minds with the idea of all that distinguishes their own position it appears to them as the chief characteristic of their own rank they apply its different rules with all the warmth of personal interest and they feel if I may use the expression a passion for complying with its dictates This truth is extremely obvious in the old black letter lawbooks on the subject of trial by battel The nobles in their disputes were bound to use the lance and sword whereas the villains used only sticks amongst themselves inasmuch as to use the words of the old books villains have no honor This did not mean as it may be imagined at the present day that these people were contemptible but simply that their actions were not to be judged by the same rules which were applied to the actions of the aristocracy It is surprising at first sight that when the sense of honor is most predominant its injunctions are usually most strange so that the further it is removed from common reason the better it is obeyed whence it has sometimes been inferred that the laws of honor were strengthened by their own extravagance The two things indeed originate from the same source but the one is not derived from the other Honor becomes fantastical in proportion to the peculiarity of the wants which it denotes and the paucity of the men by whom those wants are felt and it is because it denotes wants of this kind that its influence is great Thus the notion of honor is not the stronger for being fantastical but it is fantastical and strong from the selfsame cause Further amongst aristocratic nations each rank is different but all ranks are fixed every man occupies a place in his own sphere which he cannot relinquish and he lives there amidst other men who are bound by the same ties Amongst these nations no man can either hope or fear to escape being seen no man is placed so low but that he has a stage of his own and none can avoid censure or applause by his obscurity In democratic States on the contrary where all the members of the community are mingled in the same crowd and in constant agitation public opinion has no hold on men they disappear at every instant and elude its power Consequently the dictates of honor will be there less imperious and less stringent for honor acts solely for the public eye differing in this respect from mere virtue which lives upon itself contented with its own approval If the reader has distinctly apprehended all that goes before he will understand that there is a close and necessary relation between the inequality of social conditions and what has here been styled honor a relation which if I am not mistaken had not before been clearly pointed out I shall therefore make one more attempt to illustrate it satisfactorily Suppose a nation stands apart from the rest of mankind independently of certain general wants inherent in the human race it will also have wants and interests peculiar to itself certain opinions of censure or approbation forthwith arise in the community which are peculiar to itself and which are styled honor by the members of that community Now suppose that in this same nation a caste arises which in its turn stands apart from all the other classes and contracts certain peculiar wants which give rise in their turn to special opinions The honor of this caste composed of a medley of the peculiar notions of the nation and the still more peculiar notions of the caste will be as remote as it is possible to conceive from the simple and general opinions of men Having reached this extreme point of the argument I now return When ranks are commingled and privileges abolished the men of whom a nation is composed being once more equal and alike their interests and wants become identical and all the peculiar notions which each caste styled honor successively disappear the notion of honor no longer proceeds from any other source than the wants peculiar to the nation at large and it denotes the individual character of that nation to the world Lastly if it be allowable to suppose that all the races of mankind should be commingled and that all the peoples of earth should ultimately come to have the same interests the same wants undistinguished from each other by any characteristic peculiarities no conventional value whatever would then be attached to men s actions they would all be regarded by all in the same light the general necessities of mankind revealed by conscience to every man would become the common standard The simple and general notions of right and wrong only would then be recognized in the world to which by a natural and necessary tie the idea of censure or approbation would be attached Thus to comprise all my meaning in a single proposition the dissimilarities and inequalities of men gave rise to the notion of honor that notion is weakened in proportion as these differences are obliterated and with them it would disappear Chapter XIX Why So Many Ambitious Men And So Little Lofty Ambition Are To Be Found In The United States The first thing which strikes a traveller in the United States is the innumerable multitude of those who seek to throw off their original condition and the second is the rarity of lofty ambition to be observed in the midst of the universally ambitious stir of society No Americans are devoid of a yearning desire to rise but hardly any appear to entertain hopes of great magnitude or to drive at very lofty aims All are constantly seeking to acquire property power and reputation few contemplate these things upon a great scale and this is the more surprising as nothing is to be discerned in the manners or laws of America to limit desire or to prevent it from spreading its impulses in every direction It seems difficult to attribute this singular state of things to the equality of social conditions for at the instant when that same equality was established in France the flight of ambition became unbounded Nevertheless I think that the principal cause which may be assigned to this fact is to be found in the social condition and democratic manners of the Americans All revolutions enlarge the ambition of men this proposition is more peculiarly true of those revolutions which overthrow an aristocracy When the former barriers which kept back the multitude from fame and power are suddenly thrown down a violent and universal rise takes place towards that eminence so long coveted and at length to be enjoyed In this first burst of triumph nothing seems impossible to anyone not only are desires boundless but the power of satisfying them seems almost boundless too Amidst the general and sudden renewal of laws and customs in this vast confusion of all men and all ordinances the various members of the community rise and sink again with excessive rapidity and power passes so quickly from hand to hand that none need despair of catching it in turn It must be recollected moreover that the people who destroy an aristocracy have lived under its laws they have witnessed its splendor and they have unconsciously imbibed the feelings and notions which it entertained Thus at the moment when an aristocracy is dissolved its spirit still pervades the mass of the community and its tendencies are retained long after it has been defeated Ambition is therefore always extremely great as long as a democratic revolution lasts and it will remain so for some time after the revolution is consummated The reminiscence of the extraordinary events which men have witnessed is not obliterated from their memory in a day The passions which a revolution has roused do not disappear at its close A sense of instability remains in the midst of re established order a notion of easy success survives the strange vicissitudes which gave it birth desires still remain extremely enlarged when the means of satisfying them are diminished day by day The taste for large fortunes subsists though large fortunes are rare and on every side we trace the ravages of inordinate and hapless ambition kindled in hearts which they consume in secret and in vain At length however the last vestiges of the struggle are effaced the remains of aristocracy completely disappear the great events by which its fall was attended are forgotten peace succeeds to war and the sway of order is restored in the new realm desires are again adapted to the means by which they may be fulfilled the wants the opinions and the feelings of men cohere once more the level of the community is permanently determined and democratic society established A democratic nation arrived at this permanent and regular state of things will present a very different spectacle from that which we have just described and we may readily conclude that if ambition becomes great whilst the conditions of society are growing equal it loses that quality when they have grown so As wealth is subdivided and knowledge diffused no one is entirely destitute of education or of property the privileges and disqualifications of caste being abolished and men having shattered the bonds which held them fixed the notion of advancement suggests itself to every mind the desire to rise swells in every heart and all men want to mount above their station ambition is the universal feeling But if the equality of conditions gives some resources to all the members of the community it also prevents any of them from having resources of great extent which necessarily circumscribes their desires within somewhat narrow limits Thus amongst democratic nations ambition is ardent and continual but its aim is not habitually lofty and life is generally spent in eagerly coveting small objects which are within reach What chiefly diverts the men of democracies from lofty ambition is not the scantiness of their fortunes but the vehemence of the exertions they daily make to improve them They strain their faculties to the utmost to achieve paltry results and this cannot fail speedily to limit their discernment and to circumscribe their powers They might be much poorer and still be greater The small number of opulent citizens who are to be found amidst a democracy do not constitute an exception to this rule A man who raises himself by degrees to wealth and power contracts in the course of this protracted labor habits of prudence and restraint which he cannot afterwards shake off A man cannot enlarge his mind as he would his house The same observation is applicable to the sons of such a man they are born it is true in a lofty position but their parents were humble they have grown up amidst feelings and notions which they cannot afterwards easily get rid of and it may be presumed that they will inherit the propensities of their father as well as his wealth It may happen on the contrary that the poorest scion of a powerful aristocracy may display vast ambition because the traditional opinions of his race and the general spirit of his order still buoy him up for some time above his fortune Another thing which prevents the men of democratic periods from easily indulging in the pursuit of lofty objects is the lapse of time which they foresee must take place before they can be ready to approach them It is a great advantage says Pascal to be a man of quality since it brings one man as forward at eighteen or twenty as another man would be at fifty which is a clear gain of thirty years Those thirty years are commonly wanting to the ambitious characters of democracies The principle of equality which allows every man to arrive at everything prevents all men from rapid advancement In a democratic society as well as elsewhere there are only a certain number of great fortunes to be made and as the paths which lead to them are indiscriminately open to all the progress of all must necessarily be slackened As the candidates appear to be nearly alike and as it is difficult to make a selection without infringing the principle of equality which is the supreme law of democratic societies the first idea which suggests itself is to make them all advance at the same rate and submit to the same probation Thus in proportion as men become more alike and the principle of equality is more peaceably and deeply infused into the institutions and manners of the country the rules of advancement become more inflexible advancement itself slower the difficulty of arriving quickly at a certain height far greater From hatred of privilege and from the embarrassment of choosing all men are at last constrained whatever may be their standard to pass the same ordeal all are indiscriminately subjected to a multitude of petty preliminary exercises in which their youth is wasted and their imagination quenched so that they despair of ever fully attaining what is held out to them and when at length they are in a condition to perform any extraordinary acts the taste for such things has forsaken them In China where the equality of conditions is exceedingly great and very ancient no man passes from one public office to another without undergoing a probationary trial This probation occurs afresh at every stage of his career and the notion is now so rooted in the manners of the people that I remember to have read a Chinese novel in which the hero after numberless crosses succeeds at length in touching the heart of his mistress by taking honors A lofty ambition breathes with difficulty in such an atmosphere The remark I apply to politics extends to everything equality everywhere produces the same effects where the laws of a country do not regulate and retard the advancement of men by positive enactment competition attains the same end In a well established democratic community great and rapid elevation is therefore rare it forms an exception to the common rule and it is the singularity of such occurrences that makes men forget how rarely they happen Men living in democracies ultimately discover these things they find out at last that the laws of their country open a boundless field of action before them but that no one can hope to hasten across it Between them and the final object of their desires they perceive a multitude of small intermediate impediments which must be slowly surmounted this prospect wearies and discourages their ambition at once They therefore give up hopes so doubtful and remote to search nearer to themselves for less lofty and more easy enjoyments Their horizon is not bounded by the laws but narrowed by themselves I have remarked that lofty ambitions are more rare in the ages of democracy than in times of aristocracy I may add that when in spite of these natural obstacles they do spring into existence their character is different In aristocracies the career of ambition is often wide but its boundaries are determined In democracies ambition commonly ranges in a narrower field but if once it gets beyond that hardly any limits can be assigned to it As men are individually weak as they live asunder and in constant motion as precedents are of little authority and laws but of short duration resistance to novelty is languid and the fabric of society never appears perfectly erect or firmly consolidated So that when once an ambitious man has the power in his grasp there is nothing he may noted are and when it is gone from him he meditates the overthrow of the State to regain it This gives to great political ambition a character of revolutionary violence which it seldom exhibits to an equal degree in aristocratic communities The common aspect of democratic nations will present a great number of small and very rational objects of ambition from amongst which a few ill controlled desires of a larger growth will at intervals break out but no such a thing as ambition conceived and contrived on a vast scale is to be met with there I have shown elsewhere by what secret influence the principle of equality makes the passion for physical gratifications and the exclusive love of the present predominate in the human heart these different propensities mingle with the sentiment of ambition and tinge it as it were with their hues I believe that ambitious men in democracies are less engrossed than any others with the interests and the judgment of posterity the present moment alone engages and absorbs them They are more apt to complete a number of undertakings with rapidity than to raise lasting monuments of their achievements and they care much more for success than for fame What they most ask of men is obedience what they most covet is empire Their manners have in almost all cases remained below the height of their station the consequence is that they frequently carry very low tastes into their extraordinary fortunes and that they seem to have acquired the supreme power only to minister to their coarse or paltry pleasures I think that in our time it is very necessary to cleanse to regulate and to adapt the feeling of ambition but that it would be extremely dangerous to seek to impoverish and to repress it over much We should attempt to lay down certain extreme limits which it should never be allowed to outstep but its range within those established limits should not be too much checked I confess that I apprehend much less for democratic society from the boldness than from the mediocrity of desires What appears to me most to be dreaded is that in the midst of the small incessant occupations of private life ambition should lose its vigor and its greatness that the passions of man should abate but at the same time be lowered so that the march of society should every day become more tranquil and less aspiring I think then that the leaders of modern society would be wrong to seek to lull the community by a state of too uniform and too peaceful happiness and that it is well to expose it from time to time to matters of difficulty and danger in order to raise ambition and to give it a field of action Moralists are constantly complaining that the ruling vice of the present time is pride This is true in one sense for indeed no one thinks that he is not better than his neighbor or consents to obey his superior but it is extremely false in another for the same man who cannot endure subordination or equality has so contemptible an opinion of himself that he thinks he is only born to indulge in vulgar pleasures He willingly takes up with low desires without daring to embark in lofty enterprises of which he scarcely dreams Thus far from thinking that humility ought to be preached to our contemporaries I would have endeavors made to give them a more enlarged idea of themselves and of their kind Humility is unwholesome to them what they most want is in my opinion pride I would willingly exchange several of our small virtues for this one vice Chapter XX The Trade Of Place Hunting In Certain Democratic Countries In the United States as soon as a man has acquired some education and pecuniary resources he either endeavors to get rich by commerce or industry or he buys land in the bush and turns pioneer All that he asks of the State is not to be disturbed in his toil and to be secure of his earnings Amongst the greater part of European nations when a man begins to feel his strength and to extend his desires the first thing that occurs to him is to get some public employment These opposite effects originating in the same cause deserve our passing notice When public employments are few in number ill paid and precarious whilst the different lines of business are numerous and lucrative it is to business and not to official duties that the new and eager desires engendered by the principle of equality turn from every side But if whilst the ranks of society are becoming more equal the education of the people remains incomplete or their spirit the reverse of bold if commerce and industry checked in their growth afford only slow and arduous means of making a fortune the various members of the community despairing of ameliorating their own condition rush to the head of the State and demand its assistance To relieve their own necessities at the cost of the public treasury appears to them to be the easiest and most open if not the only way they have to rise above a condition which no longer contents them place hunting becomes the most generally followed of all trades This must especially be the case in those great centralized monarchies in which the number of paid offices is immense and the tenure of them tolerably secure so that no one despairs of obtaining a place and of enjoying it as undisturbedly as a hereditary fortune I shall not remark that the universal and inordinate desire for place is a great social evil that it destroys the spirit of independence in the citizen and diffuses a venal and servile humor throughout the frame of society that it stifles the manlier virtues nor shall I be at the pains to demonstrate that this kind of traffic only creates an unproductive activity which agitates the country without adding to its resources all these things are obvious But I would observe that a government which encourages this tendency risks its own tranquillity and places its very existence in great jeopardy I am aware that at a time like our own when the love and respect which formerly clung to authority are seen gradually to decline it may appear necessary to those in power to lay a closer hold on every man by his own interest and it may seem convenient to use his own passions to keep him in order and in silence but this cannot be so long and what may appear to be a source of strength for a certain time will assuredly become in the end a great cause of embarrassment and weakness Amongst democratic nations as well as elsewhere the number of official appointments has in the end some limits but amongst those nations the number of aspirants is unlimited it perpetually increases with a gradual and irresistible rise in proportion as social conditions become more equal and is only checked by the limits of the population Thus when public employments afford the only outlet for ambition the government necessarily meets with a permanent opposition at last for it is tasked to satisfy with limited means unlimited desires It is very certain that of all people in the world the most difficult to restrain and to manage are a people of solicitants Whatever endeavors are made by rulers such a people can never be contented and it is always to be apprehended that they will ultimately overturn the constitution of the country and change the aspect of the State for the sole purpose of making a clearance of places The sovereigns of the present age who strive to fix upon themselves alone all those novel desires which are aroused by equality and to satisfy them will repent in the end if I am not mistaken that they ever embarked in this policy they will one day discover that they have hazarded their own power by making it so necessary and that the more safe and honest course would have been to teach their subjects the art of providing for themselves a Footnote a As a matter of fact more recent experience has shown that place hunting is quite as intense in the United States as in any country in Europe It is regarded by the Americans themselves as one of the great evils of their social condition and it powerfully affects their political institutions But the American who seeks a place seeks not so much a means of subsistence as the distinction which office and public employment confer In the absence of any true aristocracy the public service creates a spurious one which is as much an object of ambition as the distinctions of rank in aristocratic countries Translator s Note Chapter XXI Why Great Revolutions Will Become More Rare A people which has existed for centuries under a system of castes and classes can only arrive at a democratic state of society by passing through a long series of more or less critical transformations accomplished by violent efforts and after numerous vicissitudes in the course of which property opinions and power are rapidly transferred from one hand to another Even after this great revolution is consummated the revolutionary habits engendered by it may long be traced and it will be followed by deep commotion As all this takes place at the very time at which social conditions are becoming more equal it is inferred that some concealed relation and secret tie exist between the principle of equality itself and revolution insomuch that the one cannot exist without giving rise to the other On this point reasoning may seem to lead to the same result as experience Amongst a people whose ranks are nearly equal no ostensible bond connects men together or keeps them settled in their station None of them have either a permanent right or power to command none are forced by their condition to obey but every man finding himself possessed of some education and some resources may choose his won path and proceed apart from all his fellow men The same causes which make the members of the community independent of each other continually impel them to new and restless desires and constantly spur them onwards It therefore seems natural that in a democratic community men things and opinions should be forever changing their form and place and that democratic ages should be times of rapid and incessant transformation But is this really the case does the equality of social conditions habitually and permanently lead men to revolution does that state of society contain some perturbing principle which prevents the community from ever subsiding into calm and disposes the citizens to alter incessantly their laws their principles and their manners I do not believe it and as the subject is important I beg for the reader s close attention Almost all the revolutions which have changed the aspect of nations have been made to consolidate or to destroy social inequality Remove the secondary causes which have produced the great convulsions of the world and you will almost always find the principle of inequality at the bottom Either the poor have attempted to plunder the rich or the rich to enslave the poor If then a state of society can ever be founded in which every man shall have something to keep and little to take from others much will have been done for the peace of the world I am aware that amongst a great democratic people there will always be some members of the community in great poverty and others in great opulence but the poor instead of forming the immense majority of the nation as is always the case in aristocratic communities are comparatively few in number and the laws do not bind them together by the ties of irremediable and hereditary penury The wealthy on their side are scarce and powerless they have no privileges which attract public observation even their wealth as it is no longer incorporated and bound up with the soil is impalpable and as it were invisible As there is no longer a race of poor men so there is no longer a race of rich men the latter spring up daily from the multitude and relapse into it again Hence they do not form a distinct class which may be easily marked out and plundered and moreover as they are connected with the mass of their fellow citizens by a thousand secret ties the people cannot assail them without inflicting an injury upon itself Between these two extremes of democratic communities stand an innumerable multitude of men almost alike who without being exactly either rich or poor are possessed of sufficient property to desire the maintenance of order yet not enough to excite envy Such men are the natural enemies of violent commotions their stillness keeps all beneath them and above them still and secures the balance of the fabric of society Not indeed that even these men are contented with what they have gotten or that they feel a natural abhorrence for a revolution in which they might share the spoil without sharing the calamity on the contrary they desire with unexampled ardor to get rich but the difficulty is to know from whom riches can be taken The same state of society which constantly prompts desires restrains these desires within necessary limits it gives men more liberty of changing and less interest in change Not only are the men of democracies not naturally desirous of revolutions but they are afraid of them All revolutions more or less threaten the tenure of property but most of those who live in democratic countries are possessed of property not only are they possessed of property but they live in the condition of men who set the greatest store upon their property If we attentively consider each of the classes of which society is composed it is easy to see that the passions engendered by property are keenest and most tenacious amongst the middle classes The poor often care but little for what they possess because they suffer much more from the want of what they have not than they enjoy the little they have The rich have many other passions besides that of riches to satisfy and besides the long and arduous enjoyment of a great fortune sometimes makes them in the end insensible to its charms But the men who have a competency alike removed from opulence and from penury attach an enormous value to their possessions As they are still almost within the reach of poverty they see its privations near at hand and dread them between poverty and themselves there is nothing but a scanty fortune upon which they immediately fix their apprehensions and their hopes Every day increases the interest they take in it by the constant cares which it occasions and they are the more attached to it by their continual exertions to increase the amount The notion of surrendering the smallest part of it is insupportable to them and they consider its total loss as the worst of misfortunes Now these eager and apprehensive men of small property constitute the class which is constantly increased by the equality of conditions Hence in democratic communities the majority of the people do not clearly see what they have to gain by a revolution but they continually and in a thousand ways feel that they might lose by one I have shown in another part of this work that the equality of conditions naturally urges men to embark in commercial and industrial pursuits and that it tends to increase and to distribute real property I have also pointed out the means by which it inspires every man with an eager and constant desire to increase his welfare Nothing is more opposed to revolutionary passions than these things It may happen that the final result of a revolution is favorable to commerce and manufactures but its first consequence will almost always be the ruin of manufactures and mercantile men because it must always change at once the general principles of consumption and temporarily upset the existing proportion between supply and demand I know of nothing more opposite to revolutionary manners than commercial manners Commerce is naturally adverse to all the violent passions it loves to temporize takes delight in compromise and studiously avoids irritation It is patient insinuating flexible and never has recourse to extreme measures until obliged by the most absolute necessity Commerce renders men independent of each other gives them a lofty notion of their personal importance leads them to seek to conduct their own affairs and teaches how to conduct them well it therefore prepares men for freedom but preserves them from revolutions In a revolution the owners of personal property have more to fear than all others for on the one hand their property is often easy to seize and on the other it may totally disappear at any moment a subject of alarm to which the owners of real property are less exposed since although they may lose the income of their estates they may hope to preserve the land itself through the greatest vicissitudes Hence the former are much more alarmed at the symptoms of revolutionary commotion than the latter Thus nations are less disposed to make revolutions in proportion as personal property is augmented and distributed amongst them and as the number of those possessing it increases Moreover whatever profession men may embrace and whatever species of property they may possess one characteristic is common to them all No one is fully contented with his present fortune all are perpetually striving in a thousand ways to improve it Consider any one of them at any period of his life and he will be found engaged with some new project for the purpose of increasing what he has talk not to him of the interests and the rights of mankind this small domestic concern absorbs for the time all his thoughts and inclines him to defer political excitement to some other season This not only prevents men from making revolutions but deters men from desiring them Violent political passions have but little hold on those who have devoted all their faculties to the pursuit of their well being The ardor which they display in small matters calms their zeal for momentous undertakings From time to time indeed enterprising and ambitious men will arise in democratic communities whose unbounded aspirations cannot be contented by following the beaten track Such men like revolutions and hail their approach but they have great difficulty in bringing them about unless unwonted events come to their assistance No man can struggle with advantage against the spirit of his age and country and however powerful he may be supposed to be he will find it difficult to make his contemporaries share in feelings and opinions which are repugnant to t all their feelings and desires It is a mistake to believe that when once the equality of conditions has become the old and uncontested state of society and has imparted its characteristics to the manners of a nation men will easily allow themselves to be thrust into perilous risks by an imprudent leader or a bold innovator Not indeed that they will resist him openly by well contrived schemes or even by a premeditated plan of resistance They will not struggle energetically against him sometimes they will even applaud him but they do not follow him To his vehemence they secretly oppose their inertia to his revolutionary tendencies their conservative interests their homely tastes to his adventurous passions their good sense to the flights of his genius to his poetry their prose With immense exertion he raises them for an instant but they speedily escape from him and fall back as it were by their own weight He strains himself to rouse the indifferent and distracted multitude and finds at last that he is reduced to impotence not because he is conquered but because he is alone I do not assert that men living in democratic communities are naturally stationary I think on the contrary that a perpetual stir prevails in the bosom of those societies and that rest is unknown there but I think that men bestir themselves within certain limits beyond which they hardly ever go They are forever varying altering and restoring secondary matters but they carefully abstain from touching what is fundamental They love change but they dread revolutions Although the Americans are constantly modifying or abrogating some of their laws they by no means display revolutionary passions It may be easily seen from the promptitude with which they check and calm themselves when public excitement begins to grow alarming and at the very moment when passions seem most roused that they dread a revolution as the worst of misfortunes and that every one of them is inwardly resolved to make great sacrifices to avoid such a catastrophe In no country in the world is the love of property more active and more anxious than in the United States nowhere does the majority display less inclination for those principles which threaten to alter in whatever manner the laws of property I have often remarked that theories which are of a revolutionary nature since they cannot be put in practice without a complete and sometimes a sudden change in the state of property and persons are much less favorably viewed in the United States than in the great monarchical countries of Europe if some men profess them the bulk of the people reject them with instinctive abhorrence I do not hesitate to say that most of the maxims commonly called democratic in France would be proscribed by the democracy of the United States This may easily be understood in America men have the opinions and passions of democracy in Europe we have still the passions and opinions of revolution If ever America undergoes great revolutions they will be brought about by the presence of the black race on the soil of the United States that is to say they will owe their origin not to the equality but to the inequality of conditions When social conditions are equal every man is apt to live apart centred in himself and forgetful of the public If the rulers of democratic nations were either to neglect to correct this fatal tendency or to encourage it from a notion that it weans men from political passions and thus wards off revolutions they might eventually produce the evil they seek to avoid and a time might come when the inordinate passions of a few men aided by the unintelligent selfishness or the pusillanimity of the greater number would ultimately compel society to pass through strange vicissitudes In democratic communities revolutions are seldom desired except by a minority but a minority may sometimes effect them I do not assert that democratic nations are secure from revolutions I merely say that the state of society in those nations does not lead to revolutions but rather wards them off A democratic people left to itself will not easily embark in great hazards it is only led to revolutions unawares it may sometimes undergo them but it does not make them and I will add that when such a people has been allowed to acquire sufficient knowledge and experience it will not suffer them to be made I am well aware that it this respect public institutions may themselves do much they may encourage or repress the tendencies which originate in the state of society I therefore do not maintain I repeat that a people is secure from revolutions simply because conditions are equal in the community but I think that whatever the institutions of such a people may be great revolutions will always be far less violent and less frequent than is supposed and I can easily discern a state of polity which when combined with the principle of equality would render society more stationary than it has ever been in our western apart of the world The observations I have here made on events may also be applied in part to opinions Two things are surprising in the United States the mutability of the greater part of human actions and the singular stability of certain principles Men are in constant motion the mind of man appears almost unmoved When once an opinion has spread over the country and struck root there it would seem that no power on earth is strong enough to eradicate it In the United States general principles in religion philosophy morality and even politics do not vary or at least are only modified by a hidden and often an imperceptible process even the grossest prejudices are obliterated with incredible slowness amidst the continual friction of men and things I hear it said that it is in the nature and the habits of democracies to be constantly changing their opinions and feelings This may be true of small democratic nations like those of the ancient world in which the whole community could be assembled in a public place and then excited at will by an orator But I saw nothing of the kind amongst the great democratic people which dwells upon the opposite shores of the Atlantic Ocean What struck me in the United States was the difficulty in shaking the majority in an opinion once conceived or of drawing it off from a leader once adopted Neither speaking nor writing can accomplish it nothing but experience will avail and even experience must be repeated This is surprising at first sight but a more attentive investigation explains the fact I do not think that it is as easy as is supposed to uproot the prejudices of a democratic people to change its belief to supersede principles once established by new principles in religion politics and morals in a word to make great and frequent changes in men s minds Not that the human mind is there at rest it is in constant agitation but it is engaged in infinitely varying the consequences of known principles and in seeking for new consequences rather than in seeking for new principles Its motion is one of rapid circumvolution rather than of straightforward impulse by rapid and direct effort it extends its orbit by small continual and hasty movements but it does not suddenly alter its position Men who are equal in rights in education in fortune or to comprise all in one word in their social condition have necessarily wants habits and tastes which are hardly dissimilar As they look at objects under the same aspect their minds naturally tend to analogous conclusions and though each of them may deviate from his contemporaries and from opinions of his own they will involuntarily and unconsciously concur in a certain number of received opinions The more attentively I consider the effects of equality upon the mind the more am I persuaded that the intellectual anarchy which we witness about us is not as many men suppose the natural state of democratic nations I think it is rather to be regarded as an accident peculiar to their youth and that it only breaks out at that period of transition when men have already snapped the former ties which bound them together but are still amazingly different in origin education and manners so that having retained opinions propensities and tastes of great diversity nothing any longer prevents men from avowing them openly The leading opinions of men become similar in proportion as their conditions assimilate such appears to me to be the general and permanent law the rest is casual and transient I believe that it will rarely happen to any man amongst a democratic community suddenly to frame a system of notions very remote from that which his contemporaries have adopted and if some such innovator appeared I apprehend that he would have great difficulty in finding listeners still more in finding believers When the conditions of men are almost equal they do not easily allow themselves to be persuaded by each other As they all live in close intercourse as they have learned the same things together and as they lead the same life they are not naturally disposed to take one of themselves for a guide and to follow him implicitly Men seldom take the opinion of their equal or of a man like themselves upon trust Not only is confidence in the superior attainments of certain individuals weakened amongst democratic nations as I have elsewhere remarked but the general notion of the intellectual superiority which any man whatsoever may acquire in relation to the rest of the community is soon overshadowed As men grow more like each other the doctrine of the equality of the intellect gradually infuses itself into their opinions and it becomes more difficult for any innovator to acquire or to exert much influence over the minds of a people In such communities sudden intellectual revolutions will therefore be rare for if we read aright the history of the world we shall find that great and rapid changes in human opinions have been produced far less by the force of reasoning than by the authority of a name Observe too that as the men who live in democratic societies are not connected with each other by any tie each of them must be convinced individually whilst in aristocratic society it is enough to convince a few the rest follow If Luther had lived in an age of equality and had not had princes and potentates for his audience he would perhaps have found it more difficult to change the aspect of Europe Not indeed that the men of democracies are naturally strongly persuaded of the certainty of their opinions or are unwavering in belief they frequently entertain doubts which no one in their eyes can remove It sometimes happens at such times that the human mind would willingly change its position but as nothing urges or guides it forwards it oscillates to and fro without progressive motion a Footnote a If I inquire what state of society is most favorable to the great revolutions of the mind I find that it occurs somewhere between the complete equality of the whole community and the absolute separation of ranks Under a system of castes generations succeed each other without altering men s positions some have nothing more others nothing better to hope for The imagination slumbers amidst this universal silence and stillness and the very idea of change fades from the human mind When ranks have been abolished and social conditions are almost equalized all men are in ceaseless excitement but each of them stands alone independent and weak This latter state of things is excessively different from the former one yet it has one point of analogy great revolutions of the human mind seldom occur in it But between these two extremes of the history of nations is an intermediate period a period as glorious as it is agitated when the conditions of men are not sufficiently settled for the mind to be lulled in torpor when they are sufficiently unequal for men to exercise a vast power on the minds of one another and when some few may modify the convictions of all It is at such times that great reformers start up and new opinions suddenly change the face of the world Even when the reliance of a democratic people has been won it is still no easy matter to gain their attention It is extremely difficult to obtain a hearing from men living in democracies unless it be to speak to them of themselves They do not attend to the things said to them because they are always fully engrossed with the things they are doing For indeed few men are idle in democratic nations life is passed in the midst of noise and excitement and men are so engaged in acting that little remains to them for thinking I would especially remark that they are not only employed but that they are passionately devoted to their employments They are always in action and each of their actions absorbs their faculties the zeal which they display in business puts out the enthusiasm they might otherwise entertain for idea I think that it is extremely difficult to excite the enthusiasm of a democratic people for any theory which has not a palpable direct and immediate connection with the daily occupations of life therefore they will not easily forsake their old opinions for it is enthusiasm which flings the minds of men out of the beaten track and effects the great revolutions of the intellect as well as the great revolutions of the political world Thus democratic nations have neither time nor taste to go in search of novel opinions Even when those they possess become doubtful they still retain them because it would take too much time and inquiry to change them they retain them not as certain but as established There are yet other and more cogent reasons which prevent any great change from being easily effected in the principles of a democratic people I have already adverted to them at the commencement of this part of my work If the influence of individuals is weak and hardly perceptible amongst such a people the power exercised by the mass upon the mind of each individual is extremely great I have already shown for what reasons I would now observe that it is wrong to suppose that this depends solely upon the form of government and that the majority would lose its intellectual supremacy if it were to lose its political power In aristocracies men have often much greatness and strength of their own when they find themselves at variance with the greater number of their fellow countrymen they withdraw to their own circle where they support and console themselves Such is not the case in a democratic country there public favor seems as necessary as the air we breathe and to live at variance with the multitude is as it were not to live The multitude requires no laws to coerce those who think not like itself public disapprobation is enough a sense of their loneliness and impotence overtakes them and drives them to despair Whenever social conditions are equal public opinion presses with enormous weight upon the mind of each individual it surrounds directs and oppresses him and this arises from the very constitution of society much more than from its political laws As men grow more alike each man feels himself weaker in regard to all the rest as he discerns nothing by which he is considerably raised above them or distinguished from them he mistrusts himself as soon as they assail him Not only does he mistrust his strength but he even doubts of his right and he is very near acknowledging that he is in the wrong when the greater number of his countrymen assert that he is so The majority do not need to constrain him they convince him In whatever way then the powers of a democratic community may be organized and balanced it will always be extremely difficult to believe what the bulk of the people reject or to profess what they condemn This circumstance is extraordinarily favorable to the stability of opinions When an opinion has taken root amongst a democratic people and established itself in the minds of the bulk of the community it afterwards subsists by itself and is maintained without effort because no one attacks it Those who at first rejected it as false ultimately receive it as the general impression and those who still dispute it in their hearts conceal their dissent they are careful not to engage in a dangerous and useless conflict It is true that when the majority of a democratic people change their opinions they may suddenly and arbitrarily effect strange revolutions in men s minds but their opinions do not change without much difficulty and it is almost as difficult to show that they are changed Time events or the unaided individual action of the mind will sometimes undermine or destroy an opinion without any outward sign of the change It has not been openly assailed no conspiracy has been formed to make war on it but its followers one by one noiselessly secede day by day a few of them abandon it until last it is only professed by a minority In this state it will still continue to prevail As its enemies remain mute or only interchange their thoughts by stealth they are themselves unaware for a long period that a great revolution has actually been effected and in this state of uncertainly they take no steps they observe each other and are silent The majority have ceased to believe what they believed before but they still affect to believe and this empty phantom of public opinion in strong enough to chill innovators and to keep them silent and at respectful distance We live at a time which has witnessed the most rapid changes of opinion in the minds of men nevertheless it may be that the leading opinions of society will ere long be more settled than they have been for several centuries in our history that time is not yet come but it may perhaps be approaching As I examine more closely the natural wants and tendencies of democratic nations I grow persuaded that if ever social equality is generally and permanently established in the world great intellectual and political revolutions will become more difficult and less frequent than is supposed Because the men of democracies appear always excited uncertain eager changeable in their wills and in their positions it is imagined that they are suddenly to abrogate their laws to adopt new opinions and to assume new manners But if the principle of equality predisposes men to change it also suggests to them certain interests and tastes which cannot be satisfied without a settled order of things equality urges them on but at the same time it holds them back it spurs them but fastens them to earth it kindles their desires but limits their powers This however is not perceived at first the passions which tend to sever the citizens of a democracy are obvious enough but the hidden force which restrains and unites them is not discernible at a glance Amidst the ruins which surround me shall I dare to say that revolutions are not what I most fear coming generations If men continue to shut themselves more closely within the narrow circle of domestic interests and to live upon that kind of excitement it is to be apprehended that they may ultimately become inaccessible to those great and powerful public emotions which perturb nations but which enlarge them and recruit them When property becomes so fluctuating and the love of property so restless and so ardent I cannot but fear that men may arrive at such a state as to regard every new theory as a peril every innovation as an irksome toil every social improvement as a stepping stone to revolution and so refuse to move altogether for fear of being moved too far I dread and I confess it lest they should at last so entirely give way to a cowardly love of present enjoyment as to lose sight of the interests of their future selves and of those of their descendants and to prefer to glide along the easy current of life rather than to make when it is necessary a strong and sudden effort to a higher purpose It is believed by some that modern society will be ever changing its aspect for myself I fear that it will ultimately be too invariably fixed in the same institutions the same prejudices the same manners so that mankind will be stopped and circumscribed that the mind will swing backwards and forwards forever without begetting fresh ideas that man will waste his strength in bootless and solitary trifling and though in continual motion that humanity will cease to advance Chapter XXII Why Democratic Nations Are Naturally Desirous Of Peace And Democratic Armies Of War The same interests the same fears the same passions which deter democratic nations from revolutions deter them also from war the spirit of military glory and the spirit of revolution are weakened at the same time and by the same causes The ever increasing numbers of men of property lovers of peace the growth of personal wealth which war so rapidly consumes the mildness of manners the gentleness of heart those tendencies to pity which are engendered by the equality of conditions that coolness of understanding which renders men comparatively insensible to the violent and poetical excitement of arms all these causes concur to quench the military spirit I think it may be admitted as a general and constant rule that amongst civilized nations the warlike passions will become more rare and less intense in proportion as social conditions shall be more equal War is nevertheless an occurrence to which all nations are subject democratic nations as well as others Whatever taste they may have for peace they must hold themselves in readiness to repel aggression or in other words they must have an army Fortune which has conferred so many peculiar benefits upon the inhabitants of the United States has placed them in the midst of a wilderness where they have so to speak no neighbors a few thousand soldiers are sufficient for their wants but this is peculiar to America not to democracy The equality of conditions and the manners as well as the institutions resulting from it do not exempt a democratic people from the necessity of standing armies and their armies always exercise a powerful influence over their fate It is therefore of singular importance to inquire what are the natural propensities of the men of whom these armies are composed Amongst aristocratic nations especially amongst those in which birth is the only source of rank the same inequality exists in the army as in the nation the officer is noble the soldier is a serf the one is naturally called upon to command the other to obey In aristocratic armies the private soldier s ambition is therefore circumscribed within very narrow limits Nor has the ambition of the officer an unlimited range An aristocratic body not only forms a part of the scale of ranks in the nation but it contains a scale of ranks within itself the members of whom it is composed are placed one above another in a particular and unvarying manner Thus one man is born to the command of a regiment another to that of a company when once they have reached the utmost object of their hopes they stop of their own accord and remain contented with their lot There is besides a strong cause which in aristocracies weakens the officer s desire of promotion Amongst aristocratic nations an officer independently of his rank in the army also occupies an elevated rank in society the former is almost always in his eyes only an appendage to the latter A nobleman who embraces the profession of arms follows it less from motives of ambition than from a sense of the duties imposed on him by his birth He enters the army in order to find an honorable employment for the idle years of his youth and to be able to bring back to his home and his peers some honorable recollections of military life but his principal object is not to obtain by that profession either property distinction or power for he possesses these advantages in his own right and enjoys them without leaving his home In democratic armies all the soldiers may become officers which makes the desire of promotion general and immeasurably extends the bounds of military ambition The officer on his part sees nothing which naturally and necessarily stops him at one grade more than at another and each grade has immense importance in his eyes because his rank in society almost always depends on his rank in the army Amongst democratic nations it often happens that an officer has no property but his pay and no distinction but that of military honors consequently as often as his duties change his fortune changes and he becomes as it were a new man What was only an appendage to his position in aristocratic armies has thus become the main point the basis of his whole condition Under the old French monarchy officers were always called by their titles of nobility they are now always called by the title of their military rank This little change in the forms of language suffices to show that a great revolution has taken place in the constitution of society and in that of the army In democratic armies the desire of advancement is almost universal it is ardent tenacious perpetual it is strengthened by all other desires and only extinguished with life itself But it is easy to see that of all armies in the world those in which advancement must be slowest in time of peace are the armies of democratic countries As the number of commissions is naturally limited whilst the number of competitors is almost unlimited and as the strict law of equality is over all alike none can make rapid progress many can make no progress at all Thus the desire of advancement is greater and the opportunities of advancement fewer there than elsewhere All the ambitious spirits of a democratic army are consequently ardently desirous of war because war makes vacancies and warrants the violation of that law of seniority which is the sole privilege natural to democracy We thus arrive at this singular consequence that of all armies those most ardently desirous of war are democratic armies and of all nations those most fond of peace are democratic nations and what makes these facts still more extraordinary is that these contrary effects are produced at the same time by the principle of equality All the members of the community being alike constantly harbor the wish and discover the possibility of changing their condition and improving their welfare this makes them fond of peace which is favorable to industry and allows every man to pursue his own little undertakings to their completion On the other hand this same equality makes soldiers dream of fields of battle by increasing the value of military honors in the eyes of those who follow the profession of arms and by rendering those honors accessible to all In either case the inquietude of the heart is the same the taste for enjoyment as insatiable the ambition of success as great the means of gratifying it are alone different These opposite tendencies of the nation and the army expose democratic communities to great dangers When a military spirit forsakes a people the profession of arms immediately ceases to be held in honor and military men fall to the lowest rank of the public servants they are little esteemed and no longer understood The reverse of what takes place in aristocratic ages then occurs the men who enter the army are no longer those of the highest but of the lowest rank Military ambition is only indulged in when no other is possible Hence arises a circle of cause and consequence from which it is difficult to escape the best part of the nation shuns the military profession because that profession is not honored and the profession is not honored because the best part of the nation has ceased to follow it It is then no matter of surprise that democratic armies are often restless ill tempered and dissatisfied with their lot although their physical condition is commonly far better and their discipline less strict than in other countries The soldier feels that he occupies an inferior position and his wounded pride either stimulates his taste for hostilities which would render his services necessary or gives him a turn for revolutions during which he may hope to win by force of arms the political influence and personal importance now denied him The composition of democratic armies makes this last mentioned danger much to be feared In democratic communities almost every man has some property to preserve but democratic armies are generally led by men without property most of whom have little to lose in civil broils The bulk of the nation is naturally much more afraid of revolutions than in the ages of aristocracy but the leaders of the army much less so Moreover as amongst democratic nations to repeat what I have just remarked the wealthiest the best educated and the most able men seldom adopt the military profession the army taken collectively eventually forms a small nation by itself where the mind is less enlarged and habits are more rude than in the nation at large Now this small uncivilized nation has arms in its possession and alone knows how to use them for indeed the pacific temper of the community increases the danger to which a democratic people is exposed from the military and turbulent spirit of the army Nothing is so dangerous as an army amidst an unwarlike nation the excessive love of the whole community for quiet continually puts its constitution at the mercy of the soldiery It may therefore be asserted generally speaking that if democratic nations are naturally prone to peace from their interests and their propensities they are constantly drawn to war and revolutions by their armies Military revolutions which are scarcely ever to be apprehended in aristocracies are always to be dreaded amongst democratic nations These perils must be reckoned amongst the most formidable which beset their future fate and the attention of statesmen should be sedulously applied to find a remedy for the evil When a nation perceives that it is inwardly affected by the restless ambition of its army the first thought which occurs is to give this inconvenient ambition an object by going to war I speak no ill of war war almost always enlarges the mind of a people and raises their character In some cases it is the only check to the excessive growth of certain propensities which naturally spring out of the equality of conditions and it must be considered as a necessary corrective to certain inveterate diseases to which democratic communities are liable War has great advantages but we must not flatter ourselves that it can diminish the danger I have just pointed out That peril is only suspended by it to return more fiercely when the war is over for armies are much more impatient of peace after having tasted military exploits War could only be a remedy for a people which should always be athirst for military glory I foresee that all the military rulers who may rise up in great democratic nations will find it easier to conquer with their armies than to make their armies live at peace after conquest There are two things which a democratic people will always find very difficult to begin a war and to end it Again if war has some peculiar advantages for democratic nations on the other hand it exposes them to certain dangers which aristocracies have no cause to dread to an equal extent I shall only point out two of these Although war gratifies the army it embarrasses and often exasperates that countless multitude of men whose minor passions every day require peace in order to be satisfied Thus there is some risk of its causing under another form the disturbance it is intended to prevent No protracted war can fail to endanger the freedom of a democratic country Not indeed that after every victory it is to be apprehended that the victorious generals will possess themselves by force of the supreme power after the manner of Sylla and Caesar the danger is of another kind War does not always give over democratic communities to military government but it must invariably and immeasurably increase the powers of civil government it must almost compulsorily concentrate the direction of all men and the management of all things in the hands of the administration If it lead not to despotism by sudden violence it prepares men for it more gently by their habits All those who seek to destroy the liberties of a democratic nation ought to know that war is the surest and the shortest means to accomplish it This is the first axiom of the science One remedy which appears to be obvious when the ambition of soldiers and officers becomes the subject of alarm is to augment the number of commissions to be distributed by increasing the army This affords temporary relief but it plunges the country into deeper difficulties at some future period To increase the army may produce a lasting effect in an aristocratic community because military ambition is there confined to one class of men and the ambition of each individual stops as it were at a certain limit so that it may be possible to satisfy all who feel its influence But nothing is gained by increasing the army amongst a democratic people because the number of aspirants always rises in exactly the same ratio as the army itself Those whose claims have been satisfied by the creation of new commissions are instantly succeeded by a fresh multitude beyond all power of satisfaction and even those who were but now satisfied soon begin to crave more advancement for the same excitement prevails in the ranks of the army as in the civil classes of democratic society and what men want is not to reach a certain grade but to have constant promotion Though these wants may not be very vast they are perpetually recurring Thus a democratic nation by augmenting its army only allays for a time the ambition of the military profession which soon becomes even more formidable because the number of those who feel it is increased I am of opinion that a restless and turbulent spirit is an evil inherent in the very constitution of democratic armies and beyond hope of cure The legislators of democracies must not expect to devise any military organization capable by its influence of calming and restraining the military profession their efforts would exhaust their powers before the object is attained The remedy for the vices of the army is not to be found in the army itself but in the country Democratic nations are naturally afraid of disturbance and of despotism the object is to turn these natural instincts into well digested deliberate and lasting tastes When men have at last learned to make a peaceful and profitable use of freedom and have felt its blessings when they have conceived a manly love of order and have freely submitted themselves to discipline these same men if they follow the profession of arms bring into it unconsciously and almost against their will these same habits and manners The general spirit of the nation being infused into the spirit peculiar to the army tempers the opinions and desires engendered by military life or represses them by the mighty force of public opinion Teach but the citizens to be educated orderly firm and free the soldiers will be disciplined and obedient Any law which in repressing the turbulent spirit of the army should tend to diminish the spirit of freedom in the nation and to overshadow the notion of law and right would defeat its object it would do much more to favor than to defeat the establishment of military tyranny After all and in spite of all precautions a large army amidst a democratic people will always be a source of great danger the most effectual means of diminishing that danger would be to reduce the army but this is a remedy which all nations have it not in their power to use Chapter XXIII Which Is The Most Warlike And Most Revolutionary Class In Democratic Armies It is a part of the essence of a democratic army to be very numerous in proportion to the people to which it belongs as I shall hereafter show On the other hand men living in democratic times seldom choose a military life Democratic nations are therefore soon led to give up the system of voluntary recruiting for that of compulsory enlistment The necessity of their social condition compels them to resort to the latter means and it may easily be foreseen that they will all eventually adopt it When military service is compulsory the burden is indiscriminately and equally borne by the whole community This is another necessary consequence of the social condition of these nations and of their notions The government may do almost whatever it pleases provided it appeals to the whole community at once it is the unequal distribution of the weight not the weight itself which commonly occasions resistance But as military service is common to all the citizens the evident consequence is that each of them remains but for a few years on active duty Thus it is in the nature of things that the soldier in democracies only passes through the army whilst among most aristocratic nations the military profession is one which the soldier adopts or which is imposed upon him for life This has important consequences Amongst the soldiers of a democratic army some acquire a taste for military life but the majority being enlisted against their will and ever ready to go back to their homes do not consider themselves as seriously engaged in the military profession and are always thinking of quitting it Such men do not contract the wants and only half partake in the passions which that mode of life engenders They adapt themselves to their military duties but their minds are still attached to the interests and the duties which engaged them in civil life They do not therefore imbibe the spirit of the army or rather they infuse the spirit of the community at large into the army and retain it there Amongst democratic nations the private soldiers remain most like civilians upon them the habits of the nation have the firmest hold and public opinion most influence It is by the instrumentality of the private soldiers especially that it may be possible to infuse into a democratic army the love of freedom and the respect of rights if these principles have once been successfully inculcated on the people at large The reverse happens amongst aristocratic nations where the soldiery have eventually nothing in common with their fellow citizens and where they live amongst them as strangers and often as enemies In aristocratic armies the officers are the conservative element because the officers alone have retained a strict connection with civil society and never forego their purpose of resuming their place in it sooner or later in democratic armies the private soldiers stand in this position and from the same cause It often happens on the contrary that in these same democratic armies the officers contract tastes and wants wholly distinct from those of the nation a fact which may be thus accounted for Amongst democratic nations the man who becomes an officer severs all the ties which bound him to civil life he leaves it forever he has no interest to resume it His true country is the army since he owes all he has to the rank he has attained in it he therefore follows the fortunes of the army rises or sinks with it and henceforward directs all his hopes to that quarter only As the wants of an officer are distinct from those of the country he may perhaps ardently desire war or labor to bring about a revolution at the very moment when the nation is most desirous of stability and peace There are nevertheless some causes which allay this restless and warlike spirit Though ambition is universal and continual amongst democratic nations we have seen that it is seldom great A man who being born in the lower classes of the community has risen from the ranks to be an officer has already taken a prodigious step He has gained a footing in a sphere above that which he filled in civil life and he has acquired rights which most democratic nations will ever consider as inalienable a He is willing to pause after so great an effort and to enjoy what he has won The fear of risking what he has already obtained damps the desire of acquiring what he has not got Having conquered the first and greatest impediment which opposed his advancement he resigns himself with less impatience to the slowness of his progress His ambition will be more and more cooled in proportion as the increasing distinction of his rank teaches him that he has more to put in jeopardy If I am not mistaken the least warlike and also the least revolutionary part of a democratic army will always be its chief commanders Footnote a The position of officers is indeed much more secure amongst democratic nations than elsewhere the lower the personal standing of the man the greater is the comparative importance of his military grade and the more just and necessary is it that the enjoyment of that rank should be secured by the laws But the remarks I have just made on officers and soldiers are not applicable to a numerous class which in all armies fills the intermediate space between them I mean the class of non commissioned officers This class of non commissioned officers which have never acted a part in history until the present century is henceforward destined I think to play one of some importance Like the officers non commissioned officers have broken in their minds all the ties which bound them to civil life like the former they devote themselves permanently to the service and perhaps make it even more exclusively the object of all their desires but non commissioned officers are men who have not yet reached a firm and lofty post at which they may pause and breathe more freely ere they can attain further promotion By the very nature of his duties which is invariable a non commissioned officer is doomed to lead an obscure confined comfortless and precarious existence as yet he sees nothing of military life but its dangers he knows nothing but its privations and its discipline more difficult to support than dangers he suffers the more from his present miseries from knowing that the constitution of society and of the army allow him to rise above them he may indeed at any time obtain his commission and enter at once upon command honors independence rights and enjoyments Not only does this object of his hopes appear to him of immense importance but he is never sure of reaching it till it is actually his own the grade he fills is by no means irrevocable he is always entirely abandoned to the arbitrary pleasure of his commanding officer for this is imperiously required by the necessity of discipline a slight fault a whim may always deprive him in an instant of the fruits of many years of toil and endeavor until he has reached the grade to which he aspires he has accomplished nothing not till he reaches that grade does his career seem to begin A desperate ambition cannot fail to be kindled in a man thus incessantly goaded on by his youth his wants his passions the spirit of his age his hopes and his age his hopes and his fears Non commissioned officers are therefore bent on war on war always and at any cost but if war be denied them then they desire revolutions to suspend the authority of established regulations and to enable them aided by the general confusion and the political passions of the time to get rid of their superior officers and to take their places Nor is it impossible for them to bring about such a crisis because their common origin and habits give them much influence over the soldiers however different may be their passions and their desires It would be an error to suppose that these various characteristics of officers non commissioned officers and men belong to any particular time or country they will always occur at all times and amongst all democratic nations In every democratic army the non commissioned officers will be the worst representatives of the pacific and orderly spirit of the country and the private soldiers will be the best The latter will carry with them into military life the strength or weakness of the manners of the nation they will display a faithful reflection of the community if that community is ignorant and weak they will allow themselves to be drawn by their leaders into disturbances either unconsciously or against their will if it is enlightened and energetic the community will itself keep them within the bounds of order Chapter XXIV Causes Which Render Democratic Armies Weaker Than Other Armies At The Outset Of A Campaign And More Formidable In Protracted Warfare Any army is in danger of being conquered at the outset of a campaign after a long peace any army which has long been engaged in warfare has strong chances of victory this truth is peculiarly applicable to democratic armies In aristocracies the military profession being a privileged career is held in honor even in time of peace Men of great talents great attainments and great ambition embrace it the army is in all respects on a level with the nation and frequently above it We have seen on the contrary that amongst a democratic people the choicer minds of the nation are gradually drawn away from the military profession to seek by other paths distinction power and especially wealth After a long peace and in democratic ages the periods of peace are long the army is always inferior to the country itself In this state it is called into active service and until war has altered it there is danger for the country as well as for the army I have shown that in democratic armies and in time of peace the rule of seniority is the supreme and inflexible law of advancement This is not only a consequence as I have before observed of the constitution of these armies but of the constitution of the people and it will always occur Again as amongst these nations the officer derives his position in the country solely from his position in the army and as he draws all the distinction and the competency he enjoys from the same source he does not retire from his profession or is not super annuated till towards the extreme close of life The consequence of these two causes is that when a democratic people goes to war after a long interval of peace all the leading officers of the army are old men I speak not only of the generals but of the non commissioned officers who have most of them been stationary or have only advanced step by step It may be remarked with surprise that in a democratic army after a long peace all the soldiers are mere boys and all the superior officers in declining years so that the former are wanting in experience the latter in vigor This is a strong element of defeat for the first condition of successful generalship is youth I should not have ventured to say so if the greatest captain of modern times had not made the observation These two causes do not act in the same manner upon aristocratic armies as men are promoted in them by right of birth much more than by right of seniority there are in all ranks a certain number of young men who bring to their profession all the early vigor of body and mind Again as the men who seek for military honors amongst an aristocratic people enjoy a settled position in civil society they seldom continue in the army until old age overtakes them After having devoted the most vigorous years of youth to the career of arms they voluntarily retire and spend at home the remainder of their maturer years A long peace not only fills democratic armies with elderly officers but it also gives to all the officers habits both of body and mind which render them unfit for actual service The man who has long lived amidst the calm and lukewarm atmosphere of democratic manners can at first ill adapt himself to the harder toils and sterner duties of warfare and if he has not absolutely lost the taste for arms at least he has assumed a mode of life which unfits him for conquest Amongst aristocratic nations the ease of civil life exercises less influence on the manners of the army because amongst those nations the aristocracy commands the army and an aristocracy however plunged in luxurious pleasures has always many other passions besides that of its own well being and to satisfy those passions more thoroughly its well being will be readily sacrificed a Footnote a See Appendix V I have shown that in democratic armies in time of peace promotion is extremely slow The officers at first support this state of things with impatience they grow excited restless exasperated but in the end most of them make up their minds to it Those who have the largest share of ambition and of resources quit the army others adapting their tastes and their desires to their scanty fortunes ultimately look upon the military profession in a civil point of view The quality they value most in it is the competency and security which attend it their whole notion of the future rests upon the certainty of this little provision and all they require is peaceably to enjoy it Thus not only does a long peace fill an army with old men but it is frequently imparts the views of old men to those who are still in the prime of life I have also shown that amongst democratic nations in time of peace the military profession is held in little honor and indifferently followed This want of public favor is a heavy discouragement to the army it weighs down the minds of the troops and when war breaks out at last they cannot immediately resume their spring and vigor No similar cause of moral weakness occurs in aristocratic armies there the officers are never lowered either in their own eyes or in those of their countrymen because independently of their military greatness they are personally great But even if the influence of peace operated on the two kinds of armies in the same manner the results would still be different When the officers of an aristocratic army have lost their warlike spirit and the desire of raising themselves by service they still retain a certain respect for the honor of their class and an old habit of being foremost to set an example But when the officers of a democratic army have no longer the love of war and the ambition of arms nothing whatever remains to them I am therefore of opinion that when a democratic people engages in a war after a long peace it incurs much more risk of defeat than any other nation but it ought not easily to be cast down by its reverses for the chances of success for such an army are increased by the duration of the war When a war has at length by its long continuance roused the whole community from their peaceful occupations and ruined their minor undertakings the same passions which made them attach so much importance to the maintenance of peace will be turned to arms War after it has destroyed all modes of speculation becomes itself the great and sole speculation to which all the ardent and ambitious desires which equality engenders are exclusively directed Hence it is that the selfsame democratic nations which are so reluctant to engage in hostilities sometimes perform prodigious achievements when once they have taken the field As the war attracts more and more of public attention and is seen to create high reputations and great fortunes in a short space of time the choicest spirits of the nation enter the military profession all the enterprising proud and martial minds no longer of the aristocracy solely but of the whole country are drawn in this direction As the number of competitors for military honors is immense and war drives every man to his proper level great generals are always sure to spring up A long war produces upon a democratic army the same effects that a revolution produces upon a people it breaks through regulations and allows extraordinary men to rise above the common level Those officers whose bodies and minds have grown old in peace are removed or superannuated or they die In their stead a host of young men are pressing on whose frames are already hardened whose desires are extended and inflamed by active service They are bent on advancement at all hazards and perpetual advancement they are followed by others with the same passions and desires and after these are others yet unlimited by aught but the size of the army The principle of equality opens the door of ambition to all and death provides chances for ambition Death is constantly thinning the ranks making vacancies closing and opening the career of arms There is moreover a secret connection between the military character and the character of democracies which war brings to light The men of democracies are naturally passionately eager to acquire what they covet and to enjoy it on easy conditions They for the most part worship chance and are much less afraid of death than of difficulty This is the spirit which they bring to commerce and manufactures and this same spirit carried with them to the field of battle induces them willingly to expose their lives in order to secure in a moment the rewards of victory No kind of greatness is more pleasing to the imagination of a democratic people than military greatness a greatness of vivid and sudden lustre obtained without toil by nothing but the risk of life Thus whilst the interests and the tastes of the members of a democratic community divert them from war their habits of mind fit them for carrying on war well they soon make good soldiers when they are roused from their business and their enjoyments If peace is peculiarly hurtful to democratic armies war secures to them advantages which no other armies ever possess and these advantages however little felt at first cannot fail in the end to give them the victory An aristocratic nation which in a contest with a democratic people does not succeed in ruining the latter at the outset of the war always runs a great risk of being conquered by it Chapter XXV Of Discipline In Democratic Armies It is a very general opinion especially in aristocratic countries that the great social equality which prevails in democracies ultimately renders the private soldier independent of the officer and thus destroys the bond of discipline This is a mistake for there are two kinds of discipline which it is important not to confound When the officer is noble and the soldier a serf one rich the other poor the former educated and strong the latter ignorant and weak the strictest bond of obedience may easily be established between the two men The soldier is broken in to military discipline as it were before he enters the army or rather military discipline is nothing but an enhancement of social servitude In aristocratic armies the soldier will soon become insensible to everything but the orders of his superior officers he acts without reflection triumphs without enthusiasm and dies without complaint in this state he is no longer a man but he is still a most formidable animal trained for war A democratic people must despair of ever obtaining from soldiers that blind minute submissive and invariable obedience which an aristocratic people may impose on them without difficulty The state of society does not prepare them for it and the nation might be in danger of losing its natural advantages if it sought artificially to acquire advantages of this particular kind Amongst democratic communities military discipline ought not to attempt to annihilate the free spring of the faculties all that can be done by discipline is to direct it the obedience thus inculcated is less exact but it is more eager and more intelligent It has its root in the will of him who obeys it rests not only on his instinct but on his reason and consequently it will often spontaneously become more strict as danger requires it The discipline of an aristocratic army is apt to be relaxed in war because that discipline is founded upon habits and war disturbs those habits The discipline of a democratic army on the contrary is strengthened in sight of the enemy because every soldier then clearly perceives that he must be silent and obedient in order to conquer The nations which have performed the greatest warlike achievements knew no other discipline than that which I speak of Amongst the ancients none were admitted into the armies but freemen and citizens who differed but little from one another and were accustomed to treat each other as equals In this respect it may be said that the armies of antiquity were democratic although they came out of the bosom of aristocracy the consequence was that in those armies a sort of fraternal familiarity prevailed between the officers and the men Plutarch s lives of great commanders furnish convincing instances of the fact the soldiers were in the constant habit of freely addressing their general and the general listened to and answered whatever the soldiers had to say they were kept in order by language and by example far more than by constraint or punishment the general was as much their companion as their chief I know not whether the soldiers of Greece and Rome ever carried the minutiae of military discipline to the same degree of perfection as the Russians have done but this did not prevent Alexander from conquering Asia and Rome the world Chapter XXVI Some Considerations On War In Democratic Communities When the principle of equality is in growth not only amongst a single nation but amongst several neighboring nations at the same time as is now the case in Europe the inhabitants of these different countries notwithstanding the dissimilarity of language of customs and of laws nevertheless resemble each other in their equal dread of war and their common love of peace a It is in vain that ambition or anger puts arms in the hands of princes they are appeased in spite of themselves by a species of general apathy and goodwill which makes the sword drop from their grasp and wars become more rare As the spread of equality taking place in several countries at once simultaneously impels their various inhabitants to follow manufactures and commerce not only do their tastes grow alike but their interests are so mixed and entangled with one another that no nation can inflict evils on other nations without those evils falling back upon itself and all nations ultimately regard war as a calamity almost as severe to the conqueror as to the conquered Thus on the one hand it is extremely difficult in democratic ages to draw nations into hostilities but on the other hand it is almost impossible that any two of them should go to war without embroiling the rest The interests of all are so interlaced their opinions and their wants so much alike that none can remain quiet when the others stir Wars therefore become more rare but when they break out they spread over a larger field Neighboring democratic nations not only become alike in some respects but they eventually grow to resemble each other in almost all b This similitude of nations has consequences of great importance in relation to war Footnote a It is scarcely necessary for me to observe that the dread of war displayed by the nations of Europe is not solely attributable to the progress made by the principle of equality amongst them independently of this permanent cause several other accidental causes of great weight might be pointed out and I may mention before all the rest the extreme lassitude which the wars of the Revolution and the Empire have left behind them Footnote b This is not only because these nations have the same social condition but it arises from the very nature of that social condition which leads men to imitate and identify themselves with each other When the members of a community are divided into castes and classes they not only differ from one another but they have no taste and no desire to be alike on the contrary everyone endeavors more and more to keep his own opinions undisturbed to retain his own peculiar habits and to remain himself The characteristics of individuals are very strongly marked When the state of society amongst a people is democratic that is to say when there are no longer any castes or classes in the community and all its members are nearly equal in education and in property the human mind follows the opposite direction Men are much alike and they are annoyed as it were by any deviation from that likeness far from seeking to preserve their own distinguishing singularities they endeavor to shake them off in order to identify themselves with the general mass of the people which is the sole representative of right and of might to their eyes The characteristics of individuals are nearly obliterated In the ages of aristocracy even those who are naturally alike strive to create imaginary differences between themselves in the ages of democracy even those who are not alike seek only to become so and to copy each other so strongly is the mind of every man always carried away by the general impulse of mankind Something of the same kind may be observed between nations two nations having the same aristocratic social condition might remain thoroughly distinct and extremely different because the spirit of aristocracy is to retain strong individual characteristics but if two neighboring nations have the same democratic social condition they cannot fail to adopt similar opinions and manners because the spirit of democracy tends to assimilate men to each other If I inquire why it is that the Helvetic Confederacy made the greatest and most powerful nations of Europe tremble in the fifteenth century whilst at the present day the power of that country is exactly proportioned to its population I perceive that the Swiss are become like all the surrounding communities and those surrounding communities like the Swiss so that as numerical strength now forms the only difference between them victory necessarily attends the largest army Thus one of the consequences of the democratic revolution which is going on in Europe is to make numerical strength preponderate on all fields of battle and to constrain all small nations to incorporate themselves with large States or at least to adopt the policy of the latter As numbers are the determining cause of victory each people ought of course to strive by all the means in its power to bring the greatest possible number of men into the field When it was possible to enlist a kind of troops superior to all others such as the Swiss infantry or the French horse of the sixteenth century it was not thought necessary to raise very large armies but the case is altered when one soldier is as efficient as another The same cause which begets this new want also supplies means of satisfying it for as I have already observed when men are all alike they are all weak and the supreme power of the State is naturally much stronger amongst democratic nations than elsewhere Hence whilst these nations are desirous of enrolling the whole male population in the ranks of the army they have the power of effecting this object the consequence is that in democratic ages armies seem to grow larger in proportion as the love of war declines In the same ages too the manner of carrying on war is likewise altered by the same causes Machiavelli observes in The Prince that it is much more difficult to subdue a people which has a prince and his barons for its leaders than a nation which is commanded by a prince and his slaves To avoid offence let us read public functionaries for slaves and this important truth will be strictly applicable to our own time A great aristocratic people cannot either conquer its neighbors or be conquered by them without great difficulty It cannot conquer them because all its forces can never be collected and held together for a considerable period it cannot be conquered because an enemy meets at every step small centres of resistance by which invasion is arrested War against an aristocracy may be compared to war in a mountainous country the defeated party has constant opportunities of rallying its forces to make a stand in a new position Exactly the reverse occurs amongst democratic nations they easily bring their whole disposable force into the field and when the nation is wealthy and populous it soon becomes victorious but if ever it is conquered and its territory invaded it has few resources at command and if the enemy takes the capital the nation is lost This may very well be explained as each member of the community is individually isolated and extremely powerless no one of the whole body can either defend himself or present a rallying point to others Nothing is strong in a democratic country except the State as the military strength of the State is destroyed by the destruction of the army and its civil power paralyzed by the capture of the chief city all that remains is only a multitude without strength or government unable to resist the organized power by which it is assailed I am aware that this danger may be lessened by the creation of provincial liberties and consequently of provincial powers but this remedy will always be insufficient For after such a catastrophe not only is the population unable to carry on hostilities but it may be apprehended that they will not be inclined to attempt it In accordance with the law of nations adopted in civilized countries the object of wars is not to seize the property of private individuals but simply to get possession of political power The destruction of private property is only occasionally resorted to for the purpose of attaining the latter object When an aristocratic country is invaded after the defeat of its army the nobles although they are at the same time the wealthiest members of the community will continue to defend themselves individually rather than submit for if the conqueror remained master of the country he would deprive them of their political power to which they cling even more closely than to their property They therefore prefer fighting to subjection which is to them the greatest of all misfortunes and they readily carry the people along with them because the people has long been used to follow and obey them and besides has but little to risk in the war Amongst a nation in which equality of conditions prevails each citizen on the contrary has but slender share of political power and often has no share at all on the other hand all are independent and all have something to lose so that they are much less afraid of being conquered and much more afraid of war than an aristocratic people It will always be extremely difficult to decide a democratic population to take up arms when hostilities have reached its own territory Hence the necessity of giving to such a people the rights and the political character which may impart to every citizen some of those interests that cause the nobles to act for the public welfare in aristocratic countries It should never be forgotten by the princes and other leaders of democratic nations that nothing but the passion and the habit of freedom can maintain an advantageous contest with the passion and the habit of physical well being I can conceive nothing better prepared for subjection in case of defeat than a democratic people without free institutions Formerly it was customary to take the field with a small body of troops to fight in small engagements and to make long regular sieges modern tactics consist in fighting decisive battles and as soon as a line of march is open before the army in rushing upon the capital city in order to terminate the war at a single blow Napoleon it is said was the inventor of this new system but the invention of such a system did not depend on any individual man whoever he might be The mode in which Napoleon carried on war was suggested to him by the state of society in his time that mode was successful because it was eminently adapted to that state of society and because he was the first to employ it Napoleon was the first commander who marched at the head of an army from capital to capital but the road was opened for him by the ruin of feudal society It may fairly be believed that if that extraordinary man had been born three hundred years ago he would not have derived the same results from his method of warfare or rather that he would have had a different method I shall add but a few words on civil wars for fear of exhausting the patience of the reader Most of the remarks which I have made respecting foreign wars are applicable a fortiori to civil wars Men living in democracies are not naturally prone to the military character they sometimes assume it when they have been dragged by compulsion to the field but to rise in a body and voluntarily to expose themselves to the horrors of war and especially of civil war is a course which the men of democracies are not apt to adopt None but the most adventurous members of the community consent to run into such risks the bulk of the population remains motionless But even if the population were inclined to act considerable obstacles would stand in their way for they can resort to no old and well established influence which they are willing to obey no well known leaders to rally the discontented as well as to discipline and to lead them no political powers subordinate to the supreme power of the nation which afford an effectual support to the resistance directed against the government In democratic countries the moral power of the majority is immense and the physical resources which it has at its command are out of all proportion to the physical resources which may be combined against it Therefore the party which occupies the seat of the majority which speaks in its name and wields its power triumphs instantaneously and irresistibly over all private resistance it does not even give such opposition time to exist but nips it in the bud Those who in such nations seek to effect a revolution by force of arms have no other resource than suddenly to seize upon the whole engine of government as it stands which can better be done by a single blow than by a war for as soon as there is a regular war the party which represents the State is always certain to conquer The only case in which a civil war could arise is if the army should divide itself into two factions the one raising the standard of rebellion the other remaining true to its allegiance An army constitutes a small community very closely united together endowed with great powers of vitality and able to supply its own wants for some time Such a war might be bloody but it could not be long for either the rebellious army would gain over the government by the sole display of its resources or by its first victory and then the war would be over or the struggle would take place and then that portion of the army which should not be supported by the organized powers of the State would speedily either disband itself or be destroyed It may therefore be admitted as a general truth that in ages of equality civil wars will become much less frequent and less protracted c Footnote c It should be borne in mind that I speak here of sovereign and independent democratic nations not of confederate democracies in confederacies as the preponderating power always resides in spite of all political fictions in the state governments and not in the federal government civil wars are in fact nothing but foreign wars in disguise Book Four Influence Of Democratic Opinions On Political Society Chapter I That Equality Naturally Gives Men A Taste For Free Institutions I should imperfectly fulfil the purpose of this book if after having shown what opinions and sentiments are suggested by the principle of equality I did not point out ere I conclude the general influence which these same opinions and sentiments may exercise upon the government of human societies To succeed in this object I shall frequently have to retrace my steps but I trust the reader will not refuse to follow me through paths already known to him which may lead to some new truth The principle of equality which makes men independent of each other gives them a habit and a taste for following in their private actions no other guide but their own will This complete independence which they constantly enjoy towards their equals and in the intercourse of private life tends to make them look upon all authority with a jealous eye and speedily suggests to them the notion and the love of political freedom Men living at such times have a natural bias to free institutions Take any one of them at a venture and search if you can his most deep seated instincts you will find that of all governments he will soonest conceive and most highly value that government whose head he has himself elected and whose administration he may control Of all the political effects produced by the equality of conditions this love of independence is the first to strike the observing and to alarm the timid nor can it be said that their alarm is wholly misplaced for anarchy has a more formidable aspect in democratic countries than elsewhere As the citizens have no direct influence on each other as soon as the supreme power of the nation fails which kept them all in their several stations it would seem that disorder must instantly reach its utmost pitch and that every man drawing aside in a different direction the fabric of society must at once crumble away I am however persuaded that anarchy is not the principal evil which democratic ages have to fear but the least For the principle of equality begets two tendencies the one leads men straight to independence and may suddenly drive them into anarchy the other conducts them by a longer more secret but more certain road to servitude Nations readily discern the former tendency and are prepared to resist it they are led away by the latter without perceiving its drift hence it is peculiarly important to point it out For myself I am so far from urging as a reproach to the principle of equality that it renders men untractable that this very circumstance principally calls forth my approbation I admire to see how it deposits in the mind and heart of man the dim conception and instinctive love of political independence thus preparing the remedy for the evil which it engenders it is on this very account that I am attached to it Chapter II That The Notions Of Democratic Nations On Government Are Naturally Favorable To The Concentration Of Power The notion of secondary powers placed between the sovereign and his subjects occurred naturally to the imagination of aristocratic nations because those communities contained individuals or families raised above the common level and apparently destined to command by their birth their education and their wealth This same notion is naturally wanting in the minds of men in democratic ages for converse reasons it can only be introduced artificially it can only be kept there with difficulty whereas they conceive as it were without thinking upon the subject the notion of a sole and central power which governs the whole community by its direct influence Moreover in politics as well as in philosophy and in religion the intellect of democratic nations is peculiarly open to simple and general notions Complicated systems are repugnant to it and its favorite conception is that of a great nation composed of citizens all resembling the same pattern and all governed by a single power The very next notion to that of a sole and central power which presents itself to the minds of men in the ages of equality is the notion of uniformity of legislation As every man sees that he differs but little from those about him he cannot understand why a rule which is applicable to one man should not be equally applicable to all others Hence the slightest privileges are repugnant to his reason the faintest dissimilarities in the political institutions of the same people offend him and uniformity of legislation appears to him to be the first condition of good government I find on the contrary that this same notion of a uniform rule equally binding on all the members of the community was almost unknown to the human mind in aristocratic ages it was either never entertained or it was rejected These contrary tendencies of opinion ultimately turn on either side to such blind instincts and such ungovernable habits that they still direct the actions of men in spite of particular exceptions Notwithstanding the immense variety of conditions in the Middle Ages a certain number of persons existed at that period in precisely similar circumstances but this did not prevent the laws then in force from assigning to each of them distinct duties and different rights On the contrary at the present time all the powers of government are exerted to impose the same customs and the same laws on populations which have as yet but few points of resemblance As the conditions of men become equal amongst a people individuals seem of less importance and society of greater dimensions or rather every citizen being assimilated to all the rest is lost in the crowd and nothing stands conspicuous but the great and imposing image of the people at large This naturally gives the men of democratic periods a lofty opinion of the privileges of society and a very humble notion of the rights of individuals they are ready to admit that the interests of the former are everything and those of the latter nothing They are willing to acknowledge that the power which represents the community has far more information and wisdom than any of the members of that community and that it is the duty as well as the right of that power to guide as well as govern each private citizen If we closely scrutinize our contemporaries and penetrate to the root of their political opinions we shall detect some of the notions which I have just pointed out and we shall perhaps be surprised to find so much accordance between men who are so often at variance The Americans hold that in every State the supreme power ought to emanate from the people but when once that power is constituted they can conceive as it were no limits to it and they are ready to admit that it has the right to do whatever it pleases They have not the slightest notion of peculiar privileges granted to cities families or persons their minds appear never to have foreseen that it might be possible not to apply with strict uniformity the same laws to every part and to all the inhabitants These same opinions are more and more diffused in Europe they even insinuate themselves amongst those nations which most vehemently reject the principle of the sovereignty of the people Such nations assign a different origin to the supreme power but they ascribe to that power the same characteristics Amongst them all the idea of intermediate powers is weakened and obliterated the idea of rights inherent in certain individuals is rapidly disappearing from the minds of men the idea of the omnipotence and sole authority of society at large rises to fill its place These ideas take root and spread in proportion as social conditions become more equal and men more alike they are engendered by equality and in turn they hasten the progress of equality In France where the revolution of which I am speaking has gone further than in any other European country these opinions have got complete hold of the public mind If we listen attentively to the language of the various parties in France we shall find that there is not one which has not adopted them Most of these parties censure the conduct of the government but they all hold that the government ought perpetually to act and interfere in everything that is done Even those which are most at variance are nevertheless agreed upon this head The unity the ubiquity the omnipotence of the supreme power and the uniformity of its rules constitute the principal characteristics of all the political systems which have been put forward in our age They recur even in the wildest visions of political regeneration the human mind pursues them in its dreams If these notions spontaneously arise in the minds of private individuals they suggest themselves still more forcibly to the minds of princes Whilst the ancient fabric of European society is altered and dissolved sovereigns acquire new conceptions of their opportunities and their duties they learn for the first time that the central power which they represent may and ought to administer by its own agency and on a uniform plan all the concerns of the whole community This opinion which I will venture to say was never conceived before our time by the monarchs of Europe now sinks deeply into the minds of kings and abides there amidst all the agitation of more unsettled thoughts Our contemporaries are therefore much less divided than is commonly supposed they are constantly disputing as to the hands in which supremacy is to be vested but they readily agree upon the duties and the rights of that supremacy The notion they all form of government is that of a sole simple providential and creative power All secondary opinions in politics are unsettled this one remains fixed invariable and consistent It is adopted by statesmen and political philosophers it is eagerly laid hold of by the multitude those who govern and those who are governed agree to pursue it with equal ardor it is the foremost notion of their minds it seems inborn It originates therefore in no caprice of the human intellect but it is a necessary condition of the present state of mankind Chapter III That The Sentiments Of Democratic Nations Accord With Their Opinions In Leading Them To Concentrate Political Power If it be true that in ages of equality men readily adopt the notion of a great central power it cannot be doubted on the other hand that their habits and sentiments predispose them to recognize such a power and to give it their support This may be demonstrated in a few words as the greater part of the reasons to which the fact may be attributed have been previously stated a As the men who inhabit democratic countries have no superiors no inferiors and no habitual or necessary partners in their undertakings they readily fall back upon themselves and consider themselves as beings apart I had occasion to point this out at considerable length in treating of individualism Hence such men can never without an effort tear themselves from their private affairs to engage in public business their natural bias leads them to abandon the latter to the sole visible and permanent representative of the interests of the community that is to say to the State Not only are they naturally wanting in a taste for public business but they have frequently no time to attend to it Private life is so busy in democratic periods so excited so full of wishes and of work that hardly any energy or leisure remains to each individual for public life I am the last man to contend that these propensities are unconquerable since my chief object in writing this book has been to combat them I only maintain that at the present day a secret power is fostering them in the human heart and that if they are not checked they will wholly overgrow it Footnote a See Appendix W I have also had occasion to show how the increasing love of well being and the fluctuating character of property cause democratic nations to dread all violent disturbance The love of public tranquillity is frequently the only passion which these nations retain and it becomes more active and powerful amongst them in proportion as all other passions droop and die This naturally disposes the members of the community constantly to give or to surrender additional rights to the central power which alone seems to be interested in defending them by the same means that it uses to defend itself As in ages of equality no man is compelled to lend his assistance to his fellow men and none has any right to expect much support from them everyone is at once independent and powerless These two conditions which must never be either separately considered or confounded together inspire the citizen of a democratic country with very contrary propensities His independence fills him with self reliance and pride amongst his equals his debility makes him feel from time to time the want of some outward assistance which he cannot expect from any of them because they are all impotent and unsympathizing In this predicament he naturally turns his eyes to that imposing power which alone rises above the level of universal depression Of that power his wants and especially his desires continually remind him until he ultimately views it as the sole and necessary support of his own weakness b This may more completely explain what frequently takes place in democratic countries where the very men who are so impatient of superiors patiently submit to a master exhibiting at once their pride and their servility Footnote b In democratic communities nothing but the central power has any stability in its position or any permanence in its undertakings All the members of society are in ceaseless stir and transformation Now it is in the nature of all governments to seek constantly to enlarge their sphere of action hence it is almost impossible that such a government should not ultimately succeed because it acts with a fixed principle and a constant will upon men whose position whose notions and whose desires are in continual vacillation It frequently happens that the members of the community promote the influence of the central power without intending it Democratic ages are periods of experiment innovation and adventure At such times there are always a multitude of men engaged in difficult or novel undertakings which they follow alone without caring for their fellowmen Such persons may be ready to admit as a general principle that the public authority ought not to interfere in private concerns but by an exception to that rule each of them craves for its assistance in the particular concern on which he is engaged and seeks to draw upon the influence of the government for his own benefit though he would restrict it on all other occasions If a large number of men apply this particular exception to a great variety of different purposes the sphere of the central power extends insensibly in all directions although each of them wishes it to be circumscribed Thus a democratic government increases its power simply by the fact of its permanence Time is on its side every incident befriends it the passions of individuals unconsciously promote it and it may be asserted that the older a democratic community is the more centralized will its government become The hatred which men bear to privilege increases in proportion as privileges become more scarce and less considerable so that democratic passions would seem to burn most fiercely at the very time when they have least fuel I have already given the reason of this phenomenon When all conditions are unequal no inequality is so great as to offend the eye whereas the slightest dissimilarity is odious in the midst of general uniformity the more complete is this uniformity the more insupportable does the sight of such a difference become Hence it is natural that the love of equality should constantly increase together with equality itself and that it should grow by what it feeds upon This never dying ever kindling hatred which sets a democratic people against the smallest privileges is peculiarly favorable to the gradual concentration of all political rights in the hands of the representative of the State alone The sovereign being necessarily and incontestably above all the citizens excites not their envy and each of them thinks that he strips his equals of the prerogative which he concedes to the crown The man of a democratic age is extremely reluctant to obey his neighbor who is his equal he refuses to acknowledge in such a person ability superior to his own he mistrusts his justice and is jealous of his power he fears and he contemns him and he loves continually to remind him of the common dependence in which both of them stand to the same master Every central power which follows its natural tendencies courts and encourages the principle of equality for equality singularly facilitates extends and secures the influence of a central power In like manner it may be said that every central government worships uniformity uniformity relieves it from inquiry into an infinite number of small details which must be attended to if rules were to be adapted to men instead of indiscriminately subjecting men to rules thus the government likes what the citizens like and naturally hates what they hate These common sentiments which in democratic nations constantly unite the sovereign and every member of the community in one and the same conviction establish a secret and lasting sympathy between them The faults of the government are pardoned for the sake of its tastes public confidence is only reluctantly withdrawn in the midst even of its excesses and its errors and it is restored at the first call Democratic nations often hate those in whose hands the central power is vested but they always love that power itself Thus by two separate paths I have reached the same conclusion I have shown that the principle of equality suggests to men the notion of a sole uniform and strong government I have now shown that the principle of equality imparts to them a taste for it To governments of this kind the nations of our age are therefore tending They are drawn thither by the natural inclination of mind and heart and in order to reach that result it is enough that they do not check themselves in their course I am of opinion that in the democratic ages which are opening upon us individual independence and local liberties will ever be the produce of artificial contrivance that centralization will be the natural form of government c Footnote c See Appendix X Chapter IV Of Certain Peculiar And Accidental Causes Which Either Lead A People To Complete Centralization Of Government Or Which Divert Them From It If all democratic nations are instinctively led to the centralization of government they tend to this result in an unequal manner This depends on the particular circumstances which may promote or prevent the natural consequences of that state of society circumstances which are exceedingly numerous but I shall only advert to a few of them Amongst men who have lived free long before they became equal the tendencies derived from free institutions combat to a certain extent the propensities superinduced by the principle of equality and although the central power may increase its privileges amongst such a people the private members of such a community will never entirely forfeit their independence But when the equality of conditions grows up amongst a people which has never known or has long ceased to know what freedom is and such is the case upon the Continent of Europe as the former habits of the nation are suddenly combined by some sort of natural attraction with the novel habits and principles engendered by the state of society all powers seem spontaneously to rush to the centre These powers accumulate there with astonishing rapidity and the State instantly attains the utmost limits of its strength whilst private persons allow themselves to sink as suddenly to the lowest degree of weakness The English who emigrated three hundred years ago to found a democratic commonwealth on the shores of the New World had all learned to take a part in public affairs in their mother country they were conversant with trial by jury they were accustomed to liberty of speech and of the press to personal freedom to the notion of rights and the practice of asserting them They carried with them to America these free institutions and manly customs and these institutions preserved them against the encroachments of the State Thus amongst the Americans it is freedom which is old equality is of comparatively modern date The reverse is occurring in Europe where equality introduced by absolute power and under the rule of kings was already infused into the habits of nations long before freedom had entered into their conceptions I have said that amongst democratic nations the notion of government naturally presents itself to the mind under the form of a sole and central power and that the notion of intermediate powers is not familiar to them This is peculiarly applicable to the democratic nations which have witnessed the triumph of the principle of equality by means of a violent revolution As the classes which managed local affairs have been suddenly swept away by the storm and as the confused mass which remains has as yet neither the organization nor the habits which fit it to assume the administration of these same affairs the State alone seems capable of taking upon itself all the details of government and centralization becomes as it were the unavoidable state of the country Napoleon deserves neither praise nor censure for having centred in his own hands almost all the administrative power of France for after the abrupt disappearance of the nobility and the higher rank of the middle classes these powers devolved on him of course it would have been almost as difficult for him to reject as to assume them But no necessity of this kind has ever been felt by the Americans who having passed through no revolution and having governed themselves from the first never had to call upon the State to act for a time as their guardian Thus the progress of centralization amongst a democratic people depends not only on the progress of equality but on the manner in which this equality has been established At the commencement of a great democratic revolution when hostilities have but just broken out between the different classes of society the people endeavors to centralize the public administration in the hands of the government in order to wrest the management of local affairs from the aristocracy Towards the close of such a revolution on the contrary it is usually the conquered aristocracy that endeavors to make over the management of all affairs to the State because such an aristocracy dreads the tyranny of a people which has become its equal and not unfrequently its master Thus it is not always the same class of the community which strives to increase the prerogative of the government but as long as the democratic revolution lasts there is always one class in the nation powerful in numbers or in wealth which is induced by peculiar passions or interests to centralize the public administration independently of that hatred of being governed by one s neighbor which is a general and permanent feeling amongst democratic nations It may be remarked that at the present day the lower orders in England are striving with all their might to destroy local independence and to transfer the administration from all points of the circumference to the centre whereas the higher classes are endeavoring to retain this administration within its ancient boundaries I venture to predict that a time will come when the very reverse will happen These observations explain why the supreme power is always stronger and private individuals weaker amongst a democratic people which has passed through a long and arduous struggle to reach a state of equality than amongst a democratic community in which the citizens have been equal from the first The example of the Americans completely demonstrates the fact The inhabitants of the United States were never divided by any privileges they have never known the mutual relation of master and inferior and as they neither dread nor hate each other they have never known the necessity of calling in the supreme power to manage their affairs The lot of the Americans is singular they have derived from the aristocracy of England the notion of private rights and the taste for local freedom and they have been able to retain both the one and the other because they have had no aristocracy to combat If at all times education enables men to defend their independence this is most especially true in democratic ages When all men are alike it is easy to found a sole and all powerful government by the aid of mere instinct But men require much intelligence knowledge and art to organize and to maintain secondary powers under similar circumstances and to create amidst the independence and individual weakness of the citizens such free associations as may be in a condition to struggle against tyranny without destroying public order Hence the concentration of power and the subjection of individuals will increase amongst democratic nations not only in the same proportion as their equality but in the same proportion as their ignorance It is true that in ages of imperfect civilization the government is frequently as wanting in the knowledge required to impose a despotism upon the people as the people are wanting in the knowledge required to shake it off but the effect is not the same on both sides However rude a democratic people may be the central power which rules it is never completely devoid of cultivation because it readily draws to its own uses what little cultivation is to be found in the country and if necessary may seek assistance elsewhere Hence amongst a nation which is ignorant as well as democratic an amazing difference cannot fail speedily to arise between the intellectual capacity of the ruler and that of each of his subjects This completes the easy concentration of all power in his hands the administrative function of the State is perpetually extended because the State alone is competent to administer the affairs of the country Aristocratic nations however unenlightened they may be never afford the same spectacle because in them instruction is nearly equally diffused between the monarch and the leading members of the community The pacha who now rules in Egypt found the population of that country composed of men exceedingly ignorant and equal and he has borrowed the science and ability of Europe to govern that people As the personal attainments of the sovereign are thus combined with the ignorance and democratic weakness of his subjects the utmost centralization has been established without impediment and the pacha has made the country his manufactory and the inhabitants his workmen I think that extreme centralization of government ultimately enervates society and thus after a length of time weakens the government itself but I do not deny that a centralized social power may be able to execute great undertakings with facility in a given time and on a particular point This is more especially true of war in which success depends much more on the means of transferring all the resources of a nation to one single point than on the extent of those resources Hence it is chiefly in war that nations desire and frequently require to increase the powers of the central government All men of military genius are fond of centralization which increases their strength and all men of centralizing genius are fond of war which compels nations to combine all their powers in the hands of the government Thus the democratic tendency which leads men unceasingly to multiply the privileges of the State and to circumscribe the rights of private persons is much more rapid and constant amongst those democratic nations which are exposed by their position to great and frequent wars than amongst all others I have shown how the dread of disturbance and the love of well being insensibly lead democratic nations to increase the functions of central government as the only power which appears to be intrinsically sufficiently strong enlightened and secure to protect them from anarchy I would now add that all the particular circumstances which tend to make the state of a democratic community agitated and precarious enhance this general propensity and lead private persons more and more to sacrifice their rights to their tranquility A people is therefore never so disposed to increase the functions of central government as at the close of a long and bloody revolution which after having wrested property from the hands of its former possessors has shaken all belief and filled the nation with fierce hatreds conflicting interests and contending factions The love of public tranquillity becomes at such times an indiscriminating passion and the members of the community are apt to conceive a most inordinate devotion to order I have already examined several of the incidents which may concur to promote the centralization of power but the principal cause still remains to be noticed The foremost of the incidental causes which may draw the management of all affairs into the hands of the ruler in democratic countries is the origin of that ruler himself and his own propensities Men who live in the ages of equality are naturally fond of central power and are willing to extend its privileges but if it happens that this same power faithfully represents their own interests and exactly copies their own inclinations the confidence they place in it knows no bounds and they think that whatever they bestow upon it is bestowed upon themselves The attraction of administrative powers to the centre will always be less easy and less rapid under the reign of kings who are still in some way connected with the old aristocratic order than under new princes the children of their own achievements whose birth prejudices propensities and habits appear to bind them indissolubly to the cause of equality I do not mean that princes of aristocratic origin who live in democratic ages do not attempt to centralize I believe they apply themselves to that object as diligently as any others For them the sole advantages of equality lie in that direction but their opportunities are less great because the community instead of volunteering compliance with their desires frequently obeys them with reluctance In democratic communities the rule is that centralization must increase in proportion as the sovereign is less aristocratic When an ancient race of kings stands at the head of an aristocracy as the natural prejudices of the sovereign perfectly accord with the natural prejudices of the nobility the vices inherent in aristocratic communities have a free course and meet with no corrective The reverse is the case when the scion of a feudal stock is placed at the head of a democratic people The sovereign is constantly led by his education his habits and his associations to adopt sentiments suggested by the inequality of conditions and the people tend as constantly by their social condition to those manners which are engendered by equality At such times it often happens that the citizens seek to control the central power far less as a tyrannical than as an aristocratical power and that they persist in the firm defence of their independence not only because they would remain free but especially because they are determined to remain equal A revolution which overthrows an ancient regal family in order to place men of more recent growth at the head of a democratic people may temporarily weaken the central power but however anarchical such a revolution may appear at first we need not hesitate to predict that its final and certain consequence will be to extend and to secure the prerogatives of that power The foremost or indeed the sole condition which is required in order to succeed in centralizing the supreme power in a democratic community is to love equality or to get men to believe you love it Thus the science of despotism which was once so complex is simplified and reduced as it were to a single principle Chapter V That Amongst The European Nations Of Our Time The Power Of Governments Is Increasing Although The Persons Who Govern Are Less Stable On reflecting upon what has already been said the reader will be startled and alarmed to find that in Europe everything seems to conduce to the indefinite extension of the prerogatives of government and to render all that enjoyed the rights of private independence more weak more subordinate and more precarious The democratic nations of Europe have all the general and permanent tendencies which urge the Americans to the centralization of government and they are moreover exposed to a number of secondary and incidental causes with which the Americans are unacquainted It would seem as if every step they make towards equality brings them nearer to despotism And indeed if we do but cast our looks around we shall be convinced that such is the fact During the aristocratic ages which preceded the present time the sovereigns of Europe had been deprived of or had relinquished many of the rights inherent in their power Not a hundred years ago amongst the greater part of European nations numerous private persons and corporations were sufficiently independent to administer justice to raise and maintain troops to levy taxes and frequently even to make or interpret the law The State has everywhere resumed to itself alone these natural attributes of sovereign power in all matters of government the State tolerates no intermediate agent between itself and the people and in general business it directs the people by its own immediate influence I am far from blaming this concentration of power I simply point it out At the same period a great number of secondary powers existed in Europe which represented local interests and administered local affairs Most of these local authorities have already disappeared all are speedily tending to disappear or to fall into the most complete dependence From one end of Europe to the other the privileges of the nobility the liberties of cities and the powers of provincial bodies are either destroyed or upon the verge of destruction Europe has endured in the course of the last half century many revolutions and counter revolutions which have agitated it in opposite directions but all these perturbations resemble each other in one respect they have all shaken or destroyed the secondary powers of government The local privileges which the French did not abolish in the countries they conquered have finally succumbed to the policy of the princes who conquered the French Those princes rejected all the innovations of the French Revolution except centralization that is the only principle they consented to receive from such a source My object is to remark that all these various rights which have been successively wrested in our time from classes corporations and individuals have not served to raise new secondary powers on a more democratic basis but have uniformly been concentrated in the hands of the sovereign Everywhere the State acquires more and more direct control over the humblest members of the community and a more exclusive power of governing each of them in his smallest concerns a Almost all the charitable establishments of Europe were formerly in the hands of private persons or of corporations they are now almost all dependent on the supreme government and in many countries are actually administered by that power The State almost exclusively undertakes to supply bread to the hungry assistance and shelter to the sick work to the idle and to act as the sole reliever of all kinds of misery Education as well as charity is become in most countries at the present day a national concern The State receives and often takes the child from the arms of the mother to hand it over to official agents the State undertakes to train the heart and to instruct the mind of each generation Uniformity prevails in the courses of public instruction as in everything else diversity as well as freedom is disappearing day by day Nor do I hesitate to affirm that amongst almost all the Christian nations of our days Catholic as well as Protestant religion is in danger of falling into the hands of the government Not that rulers are over jealous of the right of settling points of doctrine but they get more and more hold upon the will of those by whom doctrines are expounded they deprive the clergy of their property and pay them by salaries they divert to their own use the influence of the priesthood they make them their own ministers often their own servants and by this alliance with religion they reach the inner depths of the soul of man b Footnote a This gradual weakening of individuals in relation to society at large may be traced in a thousand ways I shall select from amongst these examples one derived from the law of wills In aristocracies it is common to profess the greatest reverence for the last testamentary dispositions of a man this feeling sometimes even became superstitious amongst the older nations of Europe the power of the State far from interfering with the caprices of a dying man gave full force to the very least of them and insured to him a perpetual power When all living men are enfeebled the will of the dead is less respected it is circumscribed within a narrow range beyond which it is annulled or checked by the supreme power of the laws In the Middle Ages testamentary power had so to speak no limits amongst the French at the present day a man cannot distribute his fortune amongst his children without the interference of the State after having domineered over a whole life the law insists upon regulating the very last act of it Footnote b In proportion as the duties of the central power are augmented the number of public officers by whom that power is represented must increase also They form a nation in each nation and as they share the stability of the government they more and more fill up the place of an aristocracy In almost every part of Europe the government rules in two ways it rules one portion of the community by the fear which they entertain of its agents and the other by the hope they have of becoming its agents But this is as yet only one side of the picture The authority of government has not only spread as we have just seen throughout the sphere of all existing powers till that sphere can no longer contain it but it goes further and invades the domain heretofore reserved to private independence A multitude of actions which were formerly entirely beyond the control of the public administration have been subjected to that control in our time and the number of them is constantly increasing Amongst aristocratic nations the supreme government usually contented itself with managing and superintending the community in whatever directly and ostensibly concerned the national honor but in all other respects the people were left to work out their own free will Amongst these nations the government often seemed to forget that there is a point at which the faults and the sufferings of private persons involve the general prosperity and that to prevent the ruin of a private individual must sometimes be a matter of public importance The democratic nations of our time lean to the opposite extreme It is evident that most of our rulers will not content themselves with governing the people collectively it would seem as if they thought themselves responsible for the actions and private condition of their subjects as if they had undertaken to guide and to instruct each of them in the various incidents of life and to secure their happiness quite independently of their own consent On the other hand private individuals grow more and more apt to look upon the supreme power in the same light they invoke its assistance in all their necessities and they fix their eyes upon the administration as their mentor or their guide I assert that there is no country in Europe in which the public administration has not become not only more centralized but more inquisitive and more minute it everywhere interferes in private concerns more than it did it regulates more undertakings and undertakings of a lesser kind and it gains a firmer footing every day about above and around all private persons to assist to advise and to coerce them Formerly a sovereign lived upon the income of his lands or the revenue of his taxes this is no longer the case now that his wants have increased as well as his power Under the same circumstances which formerly compelled a prince to put on a new tax he now has recourse to a loan Thus the State gradually becomes the debtor of most of the wealthier members of the community and centralizes the largest amounts of capital in its own hands Small capital is drawn into its keeping by another method As men are intermingled and conditions become more equal the poor have more resources more education and more desires they conceive the notion of bettering their condition and this teaches them to save These savings are daily producing an infinite number of small capitals the slow and gradual produce of labor which are always increasing But the greater part of this money would be unproductive if it remained scattered in the hands of its owners This circumstance has given rise to a philanthropic institution which will soon become if I am not mistaken one of our most important political institutions Some charitable persons conceived the notion of collecting the savings of the poor and placing them out at interest In some countries these benevolent associations are still completely distinct from the State but in almost all they manifestly tend to identify themselves with the government and in some of them the government has superseded them taking upon itself the enormous task of centralizing in one place and putting out at interest on its own responsibility the daily savings of many millions of the working classes Thus the State draws to itself the wealth of the rich by loans and has the poor man s mite at its disposal in the savings banks The wealth of the country is perpetually flowing around the government and passing through its hands the accumulation increases in the same proportion as the equality of conditions for in a democratic country the State alone inspires private individuals with confidence because the State alone appears to be endowed with strength and durability c Thus the sovereign does not confine himself to the management of the public treasury he interferes in private money matters he is the superior and often the master of all the members of the community and in addition to this he assumes the part of their steward and paymaster Footnote c On the one hand the taste for worldly welfare is perpetually increasing and on the other the government gets more and more complete possession of the sources of that welfare Thus men are following two separate roads to servitude the taste for their own welfare withholds them from taking a part in the government and their love of that welfare places them in closer dependence upon those who govern The central power not only fulfils of itself the whole of the duties formerly discharged by various authorities extending those duties and surpassing those authorities but it performs them with more alertness strength and independence than it displayed before All the governments of Europe have in our time singularly improved the science of administration they do more things and they do everything with more order more celerity and at less expense they seem to be constantly enriched by all the experience of which they have stripped private persons From day to day the princes of Europe hold their subordinate officers under stricter control and they invent new methods for guiding them more closely and inspecting them with less trouble Not content with managing everything by their agents they undertake to manage the conduct of their agents in everything so that the public administration not only depends upon one and the same power but it is more and more confined to one spot and concentrated in the same hands The government centralizes its agency whilst it increases its prerogative hence a twofold increase of strength In examining the ancient constitution of the judicial power amongst most European nations two things strike the mind the independence of that power and the extent of its functions Not only did the courts of justice decide almost all differences between private persons but in very many cases they acted as arbiters between private persons and the State I do not here allude to the political and administrative offices which courts of judicature had in some countries usurped but the judicial office common to them all In most of the countries of Europe there were and there still are many private rights connected for the most part with the general right of property which stood under the protection of the courts of justice and which the State could not violate without their sanction It was this semi political power which mainly distinguished the European courts of judicature from all others for all nations have had judges but all have not invested their judges with the same privileges Upon examining what is now occurring amongst the democratic nations of Europe which are called free as well as amongst the others it will be observed that new and more dependent courts are everywhere springing up by the side of the old ones for the express purpose of deciding by an extraordinary jurisdiction such litigated matters as may arise between the government and private persons The elder judicial power retains its independence but its jurisdiction is narrowed and there is a growing tendency to reduce it to be exclusively the arbiter between private interests The number of these special courts of justice is continually increasing and their functions increase likewise Thus the government is more and more absolved from the necessity of subjecting its policy and its rights to the sanction of another power As judges cannot be dispensed with at least the State is to select them and always to hold them under its control so that between the government and private individuals they place the effigy of justice rather than justice itself The State is not satisfied with drawing all concerns to itself but it acquires an ever increasing power of deciding on them all without restriction and without appeal d Footnote d A strange sophism has been made on this head in France When a suit arises between the government and a private person it is not to be tried before an ordinary judge in order they say not to mix the administrative and the judicial powers as if it were not to mix those powers and to mix them in the most dangerous and oppressive manner to invest the government with the office of judging and administering at the same time There exists amongst the modern nations of Europe one great cause independent of all those which have already been pointed out which perpetually contributes to extend the agency or to strengthen the prerogative of the supreme power though it has not been sufficiently attended to I mean the growth of manufactures which is fostered by the progress of social equality Manufactures generally collect a multitude of men of the same spot amongst whom new and complex relations spring up These men are exposed by their calling to great and sudden alternations of plenty and want during which public tranquillity is endangered It may also happen that these employments sacrifice the health and even the life of those who gain by them or of those who live by them Thus the manufacturing classes require more regulation superintendence and restraint than the other classes of society and it is natural that the powers of government should increase in the same proportion as those classes This is a truth of general application what follows more especially concerns the nations of Europe In the centuries which preceded that in which we live the aristocracy was in possession of the soil and was competent to defend it landed property was therefore surrounded by ample securities and its possessors enjoyed great independence This gave rise to laws and customs which have been perpetuated notwithstanding the subdivision of lands and the ruin of the nobility and at the present time landowners and agriculturists are still those amongst the community who must easily escape from the control of the supreme power In these same aristocratic ages in which all the sources of our history are to be traced personal property was of small importance and those who possessed it were despised and weak the manufacturing class formed an exception in the midst of those aristocratic communities as it had no certain patronage it was not outwardly protected and was often unable to protect itself Hence a habit sprung up of considering manufacturing property as something of a peculiar nature not entitled to the same deference and not worthy of the same securities as property in general and manufacturers were looked upon as a small class in the bulk of the people whose independence was of small importance and who might with propriety be abandoned to the disciplinary passions of princes On glancing over the codes of the middle ages one is surprised to see in those periods of personal independence with what incessant royal regulations manufactures were hampered even in their smallest details on this point centralization was as active and as minute as it can ever be Since that time a great revolution has taken place in the world manufacturing property which was then only in the germ has spread till it covers Europe the manufacturing class has been multiplied and enriched by the remnants of all other ranks it has grown and is still perpetually growing in number in importance in wealth Almost all those who do not belong to it are connected with it at least on some one point after having been an exception in society it threatens to become the chief if not the only class nevertheless the notions and political precedents engendered by it of old still cling about it These notions and these precedents remain unchanged because they are old and also because they happen to be in perfect accordance with the new notions and general habits of our contemporaries Manufacturing property then does not extend its rights in the same ratio as its importance The manufacturing classes do not become less dependent whilst they become more numerous but on the contrary it would seem as if despotism lurked within them and naturally grew with their growth e As a nation becomes more engaged in manufactures the want of roads canals harbors and other works of a semi public nature which facilitate the acquisition of wealth is more strongly felt and as a nation becomes more democratic private individuals are less able and the State more able to execute works of such magnitude I do not hesitate to assert that the manifest tendency of all governments at the present time is to take upon themselves alone the execution of these undertakings by which means they daily hold in closer dependence the population which they govern Footnote e I shall quote a few facts in corroboration of this remark Mines are the natural sources of manufacturing wealth as manufactures have grown up in Europe as the produce of mines has become of more general importance and good mining more difficult from the subdivision of property which is a consequence of the equality of conditions most governments have asserted a right of owning the soil in which the mines lie and of inspecting the works which has never been the case with any other kind of property Thus mines which were private property liable to the same obligations and sheltered by the same guarantees as all other landed property have fallen under the control of the State The State either works them or farms them the owners of them are mere tenants deriving their rights from the State and moreover the State almost everywhere claims the power of directing their operations it lays down rules enforces the adoption of particular methods subjects the mining adventurers to constant superintendence and if refractory they are ousted by a government court of justice and the government transfers their contract to other hands so that the government not only possesses the mines but has all the adventurers in its power Nevertheless as manufactures increase the working of old mines increases also new ones are opened the mining population extends and grows up day by day governments augment their subterranean dominions and people them with their agents On the other hand in proportion as the power of a State increases and its necessities are augmented the State consumption of manufactured produce is always growing larger and these commodities are generally made in the arsenals or establishments of the government Thus in every kingdom the ruler becomes the principal manufacturer he collects and retains in his service a vast number of engineers architects mechanics and handicraftsmen Not only is he the principal manufacturer but he tends more and more to become the chief or rather the master of all other manufacturers As private persons become more powerless by becoming more equal they can effect nothing in manufactures without combination but the government naturally seeks to place these combinations under its own control It must be admitted that these collective beings which are called combinations are stronger and more formidable than a private individual can ever be and that they have less of the responsibility of their own actions whence it seems reasonable that they should not be allowed to retain so great an independence of the supreme government as might be conceded to a private individual Rulers are the more apt to follow this line of policy as their own inclinations invite them to it Amongst democratic nations it is only by association that the resistance of the people to the government can ever display itself hence the latter always looks with ill favor on those associations which are not in its own power and it is well worthy of remark that amongst democratic nations the people themselves often entertain a secret feeling of fear and jealousy against these very associations which prevents the citizens from defending the institutions of which they stand so much in need The power and the duration of these small private bodies in the midst of the weakness and instability of the whole community astonish and alarm the people and the free use which each association makes of its natural powers is almost regarded as a dangerous privilege All the associations which spring up in our age are moreover new corporate powers whose rights have not been sanctioned by time they come into existence at a time when the notion of private rights is weak and when the power of government is unbounded hence it is not surprising that they lose their freedom at their birth Amongst all European nations there are some kinds of associations which cannot be formed until the State has examined their by laws and authorized their existence In several others attempts are made to extend this rule to all associations the consequences of such a policy if it were successful may easily be foreseen If once the sovereign had a general right of authorizing associations of all kinds upon certain conditions he would not be long without claiming the right of superintending and managing them in order to prevent them from departing from the rules laid down by himself In this manner the State after having reduced all who are desirous of forming associations into dependence would proceed to reduce into the same condition all who belong to associations already formed that is to say almost all the men who are now in existence Governments thus appropriate to themselves and convert to their own purposes the greater part of this new power which manufacturing interests have in our time brought into the world Manufacturers govern us they govern manufactures I attach so much importance to all that I have just been saying that I am tormented by the fear of having impaired my meaning in seeking to render it more clear If the reader thinks that the examples I have adduced to support my observations are insufficient or ill chosen if he imagines that I have anywhere exaggerated the encroachments of the supreme power and on the other hand that I have underrated the extent of the sphere which still remains open to the exertions of individual independence I entreat him to lay down the book for a moment and to turn his mind to reflect for himself upon the subjects I have attempted to explain Let him attentively examine what is taking place in France and in other countries let him inquire of those about him let him search himself and I am much mistaken if he does not arrive without my guidance and by other paths at the point to which I have sought to lead him He will perceive that for the last half century centralization has everywhere been growing up in a thousand different ways Wars revolutions conquests have served to promote it all men have labored to increase it In the course of the same period during which men have succeeded each other with singular rapidity at the head of affairs their notions interests and passions have been infinitely diversified but all have by some means or other sought to centralize This instinctive centralization has been the only settled point amidst the extreme mutability of their lives and of their thoughts If the reader after having investigated these details of human affairs will seek to survey the wide prospect as a whole he will be struck by the result On the one hand the most settled dynasties shaken or overthrown the people everywhere escaping by violence from the sway of their laws abolishing or limiting the authority of their rulers or their princes the nations which are not in open revolution restless at least and excited all of them animated by the same spirit of revolt and on the other hand at this very period of anarchy and amongst these untractable nations the incessant increase of the prerogative of the supreme government becoming more centralized more adventurous more absolute more extensive the people perpetually falling under the control of the public administration led insensibly to surrender to it some further portion of their individual independence till the very men who from time to time upset a throne and trample on a race of kings bend more and more obsequiously to the slightest dictate of a clerk Thus two contrary revolutions appear in our days to be going on the one continually weakening the supreme power the other as continually strengthening it at no other period in our history has it appeared so weak or so strong But upon a more attentive examination of the state of the world it appears that these two revolutions are intimately connected together that they originate in the same source and that after having followed a separate course they lead men at last to the same result I may venture once more to repeat what I have already said or implied in several parts of this book great care must be taken not to confound the principle of equality itself with the revolution which finally establishes that principle in the social condition and the laws of a nation here lies the reason of almost all the phenomena which occasion our astonishment All the old political powers of Europe the greatest as well as the least were founded in ages of aristocracy and they more or less represented or defended the principles of inequality and of privilege To make the novel wants and interests which the growing principle of equality introduced preponderate in government our contemporaries had to overturn or to coerce the established powers This led them to make revolutions and breathed into many of them that fierce love of disturbance and independence which all revolutions whatever be their object always engender I do not believe that there is a single country in Europe in which the progress of equality has not been preceded or followed by some violent changes in the state of property and persons and almost all these changes have been attended with much anarchy and license because they have been made by the least civilized portion of the nation against that which is most civilized Hence proceeded the two fold contrary tendencies which I have just pointed out As long as the democratic revolution was glowing with heat the men who were bent upon the destruction of old aristocratic powers hostile to that revolution displayed a strong spirit of independence but as the victory or the principle of equality became more complete they gradually surrendered themselves to the propensities natural to that condition of equality and they strengthened and centralized their governments They had sought to be free in order to make themselves equal but in proportion as equality was more established by the aid of freedom freedom itself was thereby rendered of more difficult attainment These two states of a nation have sometimes been contemporaneous the last generation in France showed how a people might organize a stupendous tyranny in the community at the very time when they were baffling the authority of the nobility and braving the power of all kings at once teaching the world the way to win freedom and the way to lose it In our days men see that constituted powers are dilapidated on every side they see all ancient authority gasping away all ancient barriers tottering to their fall and the judgment of the wisest is troubled at the sight they attend only to the amazing revolution which is taking place before their eyes and they imagine that mankind is about to fall into perpetual anarchy if they looked to the final consequences of this revolution their fears would perhaps assume a different shape For myself I confess that I put no trust in the spirit of freedom which appears to animate my contemporaries I see well enough that the nations of this age are turbulent but I do not clearly perceive that they are liberal and I fear lest at the close of those perturbations which rock the base of thrones the domination of sovereigns may prove more powerful than it ever was before Chapter VI What Sort Of Despotism Democratic Nations Have To Fear I had remarked during my stay in the United States that a democratic state of society similar to that of the Americans might offer singular facilities for the establishment of despotism and I perceived upon my return to Europe how much use had already been made by most of our rulers of the notions the sentiments and the wants engendered by this same social condition for the purpose of extending the circle of their power This led me to think that the nations of Christendom would perhaps eventually undergo some sort of oppression like that which hung over several of the nations of the ancient world A more accurate examination of the subject and five years of further meditations have not diminished my apprehensions but they have changed the object of them No sovereign ever lived in former ages so absolute or so powerful as to undertake to administer by his own agency and without the assistance of intermediate powers all the parts of a great empire none ever attempted to subject all his subjects indiscriminately to strict uniformity of regulation and personally to tutor and direct every member of the community The notion of such an undertaking never occurred to the human mind and if any man had conceived it the want of information the imperfection of the administrative system and above all the natural obstacles caused by the inequality of conditions would speedily have checked the execution of so vast a design When the Roman emperors were at the height of their power the different nations of the empire still preserved manners and customs of great diversity although they were subject to the same monarch most of the provinces were separately administered they abounded in powerful and active municipalities and although the whole government of the empire was centred in the hands of the emperor alone and he always remained upon occasions the supreme arbiter in all matters yet the details of social life and private occupations lay for the most part beyond his control The emperors possessed it is true an immense and unchecked power which allowed them to gratify all their whimsical tastes and to employ for that purpose the whole strength of the State They frequently abused that power arbitrarily to deprive their subjects of property or of life their tyranny was extremely onerous to the few but it did not reach the greater number it was fixed to some few main objects and neglected the rest it was violent but its range was limited But it would seem that if despotism were to be established amongst the democratic nations of our days it might assume a different character it would be more extensive and more mild it would degrade men without tormenting them I do not question that in an age of instruction and equality like our own sovereigns might more easily succeed in collecting all political power into their own hands and might interfere more habitually and decidedly within the circle of private interests than any sovereign of antiquity could ever do But this same principle of equality which facilitates despotism tempers its rigor We have seen how the manners of society become more humane and gentle in proportion as men become more equal and alike When no member of the community has much power or much wealth tyranny is as it were without opportunities and a field of action As all fortunes are scanty the passions of men are naturally circumscribed their imagination limited their pleasures simple This universal moderation moderates the sovereign himself and checks within certain limits the inordinate extent of his desires Independently of these reasons drawn from the nature of the state of society itself I might add many others arising from causes beyond my subject but I shall keep within the limits I have laid down to myself Democratic governments may become violent and even cruel at certain periods of extreme effervescence or of great danger but these crises will be rare and brief When I consider the petty passions of our contemporaries the mildness of their manners the extent of their education the purity of their religion the gentleness of their morality their regular and industrious habits and the restraint which they almost all observe in their vices no less than in their virtues I have no fear that they will meet with tyrants in their rulers but rather guardians a I think then that the species of oppression by which democratic nations are menaced is unlike anything which ever before existed in the world our contemporaries will find no prototype of it in their memories I am trying myself to choose an expression which will accurately convey the whole of the idea I have formed of it but in vain the old words despotism and tyranny are inappropriate the thing itself is new and since I cannot name it I must attempt to define it Footnote a See Appendix Y I seek to trace the novel features under which despotism may appear in the world The first thing that strikes the observation is an innumerable multitude of men all equal and alike incessantly endeavoring to procure the petty and paltry pleasures with which they glut their lives Each of them living apart is as a stranger to the fate of all the rest his children and his private friends constitute to him the whole of mankind as for the rest of his fellow citizens he is close to them but he sees them not he touches them but he feels them not he exists but in himself and for himself alone and if his kindred still remain to him he may be said at any rate to have lost his country Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications and to watch over their fate That power is absolute minute regular provident and mild It would be like the authority of a parent if like that authority its object was to prepare men for manhood but it seeks on the contrary to keep them in perpetual childhood it is well content that the people should rejoice provided they think of nothing but rejoicing For their happiness such a government willingly labors but it chooses to be the sole agent and the only arbiter of that happiness it provides for their security foresees and supplies their necessities facilitates their pleasures manages their principal concerns directs their industry regulates the descent of property and subdivides their inheritances what remains but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free agency of man less useful and less frequent it circumscribes the will within a narrower range and gradually robs a man of all the uses of himself The principle of equality has prepared men for these things it has predisposed men to endure them and oftentimes to look on them as benefits After having thus successively taken each member of the community in its powerful grasp and fashioned them at will the supreme power then extends its arm over the whole community It covers the surface of society with a net work of small complicated rules minute and uniform through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate to rise above the crowd The will of man is not shattered but softened bent and guided men are seldom forced by it to act but they are constantly restrained from acting such a power does not destroy but it prevents existence it does not tyrannize but it compresses enervates extinguishes and stupefies a people till each nation is reduced to be nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals of which the government is the shepherd I have always thought that servitude of the regular quiet and gentle kind which I have just described might be combined more easily than is commonly believed with some of the outward forms of freedom and that it might even establish itself under the wing of the sovereignty of the people Our contemporaries are constantly excited by two conflicting passions they want to be led and they wish to remain free as they cannot destroy either one or the other of these contrary propensities they strive to satisfy them both at once They devise a sole tutelary and all powerful form of government but elected by the people They combine the principle of centralization and that of popular sovereignty this gives them a respite they console themselves for being in tutelage by the reflection that they have chosen their own guardians Every man allows himself to be put in leading strings because he sees that it is not a person or a class of persons but the people at large that holds the end of his chain By this system the people shake off their state of dependence just long enough to select their master and then relapse into it again A great many persons at the present day are quite contented with this sort of compromise between administrative despotism and the sovereignty of the people and they think they have done enough for the protection of individual freedom when they have surrendered it to the power of the nation at large This does not satisfy me the nature of him I am to obey signifies less to me than the fact of extorted obedience I do not however deny that a constitution of this kind appears to me to be infinitely preferable to one which after having concentrated all the powers of government should vest them in the hands of an irresponsible person or body of persons Of all the forms which democratic despotism could assume the latter would assuredly be the worst When the sovereign is elective or narrowly watched by a legislature which is really elective and independent the oppression which he exercises over individuals is sometimes greater but it is always less degrading because every man when he is oppressed and disarmed may still imagine that whilst he yields obedience it is to himself he yields it and that it is to one of his own inclinations that all the rest give way In like manner I can understand that when the sovereign represents the nation and is dependent upon the people the rights and the power of which every citizen is deprived not only serve the head of the State but the State itself and that private persons derive some return from the sacrifice of their independence which they have made to the public To create a representation of the people in every centralized country is therefore to diminish the evil which extreme centralization may produce but not to get rid of it I admit that by this means room is left for the intervention of individuals in the more important affairs but it is not the less suppressed in the smaller and more private ones It must not be forgotten that it is especially dangerous to enslave men in the minor details of life For my own part I should be inclined to think freedom less necessary in great things than in little ones if it were possible to be secure of the one without possessing the other Subjection in minor affairs breaks out every day and is felt by the whole community indiscriminately It does not drive men to resistance but it crosses them at every turn till they are led to surrender the exercise of their will Thus their spirit is gradually broken and their character enervated whereas that obedience which is exacted on a few important but rare occasions only exhibits servitude at certain intervals and throws the burden of it upon a small number of men It is in vain to summon a people which has been rendered so dependent on the central power to choose from time to time the representatives of that power this rare and brief exercise of their free choice however important it may be will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties of thinking feeling and acting for themselves and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity b I add that they will soon become incapable of exercising the great and only privilege which remains to them The democratic nations which have introduced freedom into their political constitution at the very time when they were augmenting the despotism of their administrative constitution have been led into strange paradoxes To manage those minor affairs in which good sense is all that is wanted the people are held to be unequal to the task but when the government of the country is at stake the people are invested with immense powers they are alternately made the playthings of their ruler and his masters more than kings and less than men After having exhausted all the different modes of election without finding one to suit their purpose they are still amazed and still bent on seeking further as if the evil they remark did not originate in the constitution of the country far more than in that of the electoral body It is indeed difficult to conceive how men who have entirely given up the habit of self government should succeed in making a proper choice of those by whom they are to be governed and no one will ever believe that a liberal wise and energetic government can spring from the suffrages of a subservient people A constitution which should be republican in its head and ultra monarchical in all its other parts has ever appeared to me to be a short lived monster The vices of rulers and the ineptitude of the people would speedily bring about its ruin and the nation weary of its representatives and of itself would create freer institutions or soon return to stretch itself at the feet of a single master Footnote b See Appendix Z Chapter VII Continuation Of The Preceding Chapters I believe that it is easier to establish an absolute and despotic government amongst a people in which the conditions of society are equal than amongst any other and I think that if such a government were once established amongst such a people it would not only oppress men but would eventually strip each of them of several of the highest qualities of humanity Despotism therefore appears to me peculiarly to be dreaded in democratic ages I should have loved freedom I believe at all times but in the time in which we live I am ready to worship it On the other hand I am persuaded that all who shall attempt in the ages upon which we are entering to base freedom upon aristocratic privilege will fail that all who shall attempt to draw and to retain authority within a single class will fail At the present day no ruler is skilful or strong enough to found a despotism by re establishing permanent distinctions of rank amongst his subjects no legislator is wise or powerful enough to preserve free institutions if he does not take equality for his first principle and his watchword All those of our contemporaries who would establish or secure the independence and the dignity of their fellow men must show themselves the friends of equality and the only worthy means of showing themselves as such is to be so upon this depends the success of their holy enterprise Thus the question is not how to reconstruct aristocratic society but how to make liberty proceed out of that democratic state of society in which God has placed us These two truths appear to me simple clear and fertile in consequences and they naturally lead me to consider what kind of free government can be established amongst a people in which social conditions are equal It results from the very constitution of democratic nations and from their necessities that the power of government amongst them must be more uniform more centralized more extensive more searching and more efficient than in other countries Society at large is naturally stronger and more active individuals more subordinate and weak the former does more the latter less and this is inevitably the case It is not therefore to be expected that the range of private independence will ever be as extensive in democratic as in aristocratic countries nor is this to be desired for amongst aristocratic nations the mass is often sacrificed to the individual and the prosperity of the greater number to the greatness of the few It is both necessary and desirable that the government of a democratic people should be active and powerful and our object should not be to render it weak or indolent but solely to prevent it from abusing its aptitude and its strength The circumstance which most contributed to secure the independence of private persons in aristocratic ages was that the supreme power did not affect to take upon itself alone the government and administration of the community those functions were necessarily partially left to the members of the aristocracy so that as the supreme power was always divided it never weighed with its whole weight and in the same manner on each individual Not only did the government not perform everything by its immediate agency but as most of the agents who discharged its duties derived their power not from the State but from the circumstance of their birth they were not perpetually under its control The government could not make or unmake them in an instant at pleasure nor bend them in strict uniformity to its slightest caprice this was an additional guarantee of private independence I readily admit that recourse cannot be had to the same means at the present time but I discover certain democratic expedients which may be substituted for them Instead of vesting in the government alone all the administrative powers of which corporations and nobles have been deprived a portion of them may be entrusted to secondary public bodies temporarily composed of private citizens thus the liberty of private persons will be more secure and their equality will not be diminished The Americans who care less for words than the French still designate by the name of county the largest of their administrative districts but the duties of the count or lord lieutenant are in part performed by a provincial assembly At a period of equality like our own it would be unjust and unreasonable to institute hereditary officers but there is nothing to prevent us from substituting elective public officers to a certain extent Election is a democratic expedient which insures the independence of the public officer in relation to the government as much and even more than hereditary rank can insure it amongst aristocratic nations Aristocratic countries abound in wealthy and influential persons who are competent to provide for themselves and who cannot be easily or secretly oppressed such persons restrain a government within general habits of moderation and reserve I am very well aware that democratic countries contain no such persons naturally but something analogous to them may be created by artificial means I firmly believe that an aristocracy cannot again be founded in the world but I think that private citizens by combining together may constitute bodies of great wealth influence and strength corresponding to the persons of an aristocracy By this means many of the greatest political advantages of aristocracy would be obtained without its injustice or its dangers An association for political commercial or manufacturing purposes or even for those of science and literature is a powerful and enlightened member of the community which cannot be disposed of at pleasure or oppressed without remonstrance and which by defending its own rights against the encroachments of the government saves the common liberties of the country In periods of aristocracy every man is always bound so closely to many of his fellow citizens that he cannot be assailed without their coming to his assistance In ages of equality every man naturally stands alone he has no hereditary friends whose company operation he may demand no class upon whose sympathy he may rely he is easily got rid of and he is trampled on with impunity At the present time an oppressed member of the community has therefore only one method of self defence he may appeal to the whole nation and if the whole nation is deaf to his complaint he may appeal to mankind the only means he has of making this appeal is by the press Thus the liberty of the press is infinitely more valuable amongst democratic nations than amongst all others it is the only cure for the evils which equality may produce Equality sets men apart and weakens them but the press places a powerful weapon within every man s reach which the weakest and loneliest of them all may use Equality deprives a man of the support of his connections but the press enables him to summon all his fellow countrymen and all his fellow men to his assistance Printing has accelerated the progress of equality and it is also one of its best correctives I think that men living in aristocracies may strictly speaking do without the liberty of the press but such is not the case with those who live in democratic countries To protect their personal independence I trust not to great political assemblies to parliamentary privilege or to the assertion of popular sovereignty All these things may to a certain extent be reconciled with personal servitude but that servitude cannot be complete if the press is free the press is the chiefest democratic instrument of freedom Something analogous may be said of the judicial power It is a part of the essence of judicial power to attend to private interests and to fix itself with predilection on minute objects submitted to its observation another essential quality of judicial power is never to volunteer its assistance to the oppressed but always to be at the disposal of the humblest of those who solicit it their complaint however feeble they may themselves be will force itself upon the ear of justice and claim redress for this is inherent in the very constitution of the courts of justice A power of this kind is therefore peculiarly adapted to the wants of freedom at a time when the eye and finger of the government are constantly intruding into the minutest details of human actions and when private persons are at once too weak to protect themselves and too much isolated for them to reckon upon the assistance of their fellows The strength of the courts of law has ever been the greatest security which can be offered to personal independence but this is more especially the case in democratic ages private rights and interests are in constant danger if the judicial power does not grow more extensive and more strong to keep pace with the growing equality of conditions Equality awakens in men several propensities extremely dangerous to freedom to which the attention of the legislator ought constantly to be directed I shall only remind the reader of the most important amongst them Men living in democratic ages do not readily comprehend the utility of forms they feel an instinctive contempt for them I have elsewhere shown for what reasons Forms excite their contempt and often their hatred as they commonly aspire to none but easy and present gratifications they rush onwards to the object of their desires and the slightest delay exasperates them This same temper carried with them into political life renders them hostile to forms which perpetually retard or arrest them in some of their projects Yet this objection which the men of democracies make to forms is the very thing which renders forms so useful to freedom for their chief merit is to serve as a barrier between the strong and the weak the ruler and the people to retard the one and give the other time to look about him Forms become more necessary in proportion as the government becomes more active and more powerful whilst private persons are becoming more indolent and more feeble Thus democratic nations naturally stand more in need of forms than other nations and they naturally respect them less This deserves most serious attention Nothing is more pitiful than the arrogant disdain of most of our contemporaries for questions of form for the smallest questions of form have acquired in our time an importance which they never had before many of the greatest interests of mankind depend upon them I think that if the statesmen of aristocratic ages could sometimes contemn forms with impunity and frequently rise above them the statesmen to whom the government of nations is now confided ought to treat the very least among them with respect and not neglect them without imperious necessity In aristocracies the observance of forms was superstitious amongst us they ought to be kept with a deliberate and enlightened deference Another tendency which is extremely natural to democratic nations and extremely dangerous is that which leads them ta despise and undervalue the rights of private persons The attachment which men feel to a right and the respect which they display for it is generally proportioned to its importance or to the length of time during which they have enjoyed it The rights of private persons amongst democratic nations are commonly of small importance of recent growth and extremely precarious the consequence is that they are often sacrificed without regret and almost always violated without remorse But it happens that at the same period and amongst the same nations in which men conceive a natural contempt for the rights of private persons the rights of society at large are naturally extended and consolidated in other words men become less attached to private rights at the very time at which it would be most necessary to retain and to defend what little remains of them It is therefore most especially in the present democratic ages that the true friends of the liberty and the greatness of man ought constantly to be on the alert to prevent the power of government from lightly sacrificing the private rights of individuals to the general execution of its designs At such times no citizen is so obscure that it is not very dangerous to allow him to be oppressed no private rights are so unimportant that they can be surrendered with impunity to the caprices of a government The reason is plain if the private right of an individual is violated at a time when the human mind is fully impressed with the importance and the sanctity of such rights the injury done is confined to the individual whose right is infringed but to violate such a right at the present day is deeply to corrupt the manners of the nation and to put the whole community in jeopardy because the very notion of this kind of right constantly tends amongst us to be impaired and lost There are certain habits certain notions and certain vices which are peculiar to a state of revolution and which a protracted revolution cannot fail to engender and to propagate whatever be in other respects its character its purpose and the scene on which it takes place When any nation has within a short space of time repeatedly varied its rulers its opinions and its laws the men of whom it is composed eventually contract a taste for change and grow accustomed to see all changes effected by sudden violence Thus they naturally conceive a contempt for forms which daily prove ineffectual and they do not support without impatience the dominion of rules which they have so often seen infringed As the ordinary notions of equity and morality no longer suffice to explain and justify all the innovations daily begotten by a revolution the principle of public utility is called in the doctrine of political necessity is conjured up and men accustom themselves to sacrifice private interests without scruple and to trample on the rights of individuals in order more speedily to accomplish any public purpose These habits and notions which I shall call revolutionary because all revolutions produce them occur in aristocracies just as much as amongst democratic nations but amongst the former they are often less powerful and always less lasting because there they meet with habits notions defects and impediments which counteract them they consequently disappear as soon as the revolution is terminated and the nation reverts to its former political courses This is not always the case in democratic countries in which it is ever to be feared that revolutionary tendencies becoming more gentle and more regular without entirely disappearing from society will be gradually transformed into habits of subjection to the administrative authority of the government I know of no countries in which revolutions re more dangerous than in democratic countries because independently of the accidental and transient evils which must always attend them they may always create some evils which are permanent and unending I believe that there are such things as justifiable resistance and legitimate rebellion I do not therefore assert as an absolute proposition that the men of democratic ages ought never to make revolutions but I think that they have especial reason to hesitate before they embark in them and that it is far better to endure many grievances in their present condition than to have recourse to so perilous a remedy I shall conclude by one general idea which comprises not only all the particular ideas which have been expressed in the present chapter but also most of those which it is the object of this book to treat of In the ages of aristocracy which preceded our own there were private persons of great power and a social authority of extreme weakness The outline of society itself was not easily discernible and constantly confounded with the different powers by which the community was ruled The principal efforts of the men of those times were required to strengthen aggrandize and secure the supreme power and on the other hand to circumscribe individual independence within narrower limits and to subject private interests to the interests of the public Other perils and other cares await the men of our age Amongst the greater part of modern nations the government whatever may be its origin its constitution or its name has become almost omnipotent and private persons are falling more and more into the lowest stage of weakness and dependence In olden society everything was different unity and uniformity were nowhere to be met with In modern society everything threatens to become so much alike that the peculiar characteristics of each individual will soon be entirely lost in the general aspect of the world Our forefathers were ever prone to make an improper use of the notion that private rights ought to be respected and we are naturally prone on the other hand to exaggerate the idea that the interest of a private individual ought always to bend to the interest of the many The political world is metamorphosed new remedies must henceforth be sought for new disorders To lay down extensive but distinct and settled limits to the action of the government to confer certain rights on private persons and to secure to them the undisputed enjoyment of those rights to enable individual man to maintain whatever independence strength and original power he still possesses to raise him by the side of society at large and uphold him in that position these appear to me the main objects of legislators in the ages upon which we are now entering It would seem as if the rulers of our time sought only to use men in order to make things great I wish that they would try a little more to make great men that they would set less value on the work and more upon the workman that they would never forget that a nation cannot long remain strong when every man belonging to it is individually weak and that no form or combination of social polity has yet been devised to make an energetic people out of a community of pusillanimous and enfeebled citizens I trace amongst our contemporaries two contrary notions which are equally injurious One set of men can perceive nothing in the principle of equality but the anarchical tendencies which it engenders they dread their own free agency they fear themselves Other thinkers less numerous but more enlightened take a different view besides that track which starts from the principle of equality to terminate in anarchy they have at last discovered the road which seems to lead men to inevitable servitude They shape their souls beforehand to this necessary condition and despairing of remaining free they already do obeisance in their hearts to the master who is soon to appear The former abandon freedom because they think it dangerous the latter because they hold it to be impossible If I had entertained the latter conviction I should not have written this book but I should have confined myself to deploring in secret the destiny of mankind I have sought to point out the dangers to which the principle of equality exposes the independence of man because I firmly believe that these dangers are the most formidable as well as the least foreseen of all those which futurity holds in store but I do not think that they are insurmountable The men who live in the democratic ages upon which we are entering have naturally a taste for independence they are naturally impatient of regulation and they are wearied by the permanence even of the condition they themselves prefer They are fond of power but they are prone to despise and hate those who wield it and they easily elude its grasp by their own mobility and insignificance These propensities will always manifest themselves because they originate in the groundwork of society which will undergo no change for a long time they will prevent the establishment of any despotism and they will furnish fresh weapons to each succeeding generation which shall struggle in favor of the liberty of mankind Let us then look forward to the future with that salutary fear which makes men keep watch and ward for freedom not with that faint and idle terror which depresses and enervates the heart Chapter VIII General Survey Of The Subject Before I close forever the theme that has detained me so long I would fain take a parting survey of all the various characteristics of modern society and appreciate at last the general influence to be exercised by the principle of equality upon the fate of mankind but I am stopped by the difficulty of the task and in presence of so great an object my sight is troubled and my reason fails The society of the modern world which I have sought to delineate and which I seek to judge has but just come into existence Time has not yet shaped it into perfect form the great revolution by which it has been created is not yet over and amidst the occurrences of our time it is almost impossible to discern what will pass away with the revolution itself and what will survive its close The world which is rising into existence is still half encumbered by the remains of the world which is waning into decay and amidst the vast perplexity of human affairs none can say how much of ancient institutions and former manners will remain or how much will completely disappear Although the revolution which is taking place in the social condition the laws the opinions and the feelings of men is still very far from being terminated yet its results already admit of no comparison with anything that the world has ever before witnessed I go back from age to age up to the remotest antiquity but I find no parallel to what is occurring before my eyes as the past has ceased to throw its light upon the future the mind of man wanders in obscurity Nevertheless in the midst of a prospect so wide so novel and so confused some of the more prominent characteristics may already be discerned and pointed out The good things and the evils of life are more equally distributed in the world great wealth tends to disappear the number of small fortunes to increase desires and gratifications are multiplied but extraordinary prosperity and irremediable penury are alike unknown The sentiment of ambition is universal but the scope of ambition is seldom vast Each individual stands apart in solitary weakness but society at large is active provident and powerful the performances of private persons are insignificant those of the State immense There is little energy of character but manners are mild and laws humane If there be few instances of exalted heroism or of virtues of the highest brightest and purest temper men s habits are regular violence is rare and cruelty almost unknown Human existence becomes longer and property more secure life is not adorned with brilliant trophies but it is extremely easy and tranquil Few pleasures are either very refined or very coarse and highly polished manners are as uncommon as great brutality of tastes Neither men of great learning nor extremely ignorant communities are to be met with genius becomes more rare information more diffused The human mind is impelled by the small efforts of all mankind combined together not by the strenuous activity of certain men There is less perfection but more abundance in all the productions of the arts The ties of race of rank and of country are relaxed the great bond of humanity is strengthened If I endeavor to find out the most general and the most prominent of all these different characteristics I shall have occasion to perceive that what is taking place in men s fortunes manifests itself under a thousand other forms Almost all extremes are softened or blunted all that was most prominent is superseded by some mean term at once less lofty and less low less brilliant and less obscure than what before existed in the world When I survey this countless multitude of beings shaped in each other s likeness amidst whom nothing rises and nothing falls the sight of such universal uniformity saddens and chills me and I am tempted to regret that state of society which has ceased to be When the world was full of men of great importance and extreme insignificance of great wealth and extreme poverty of great learning and extreme ignorance I turned aside from the latter to fix my observation on the former alone who gratified my sympathies But I admit that this gratification arose from my own weakness it is because I am unable to see at once all that is around me that I am allowed thus to select and separate the objects of my predilection from among so many others Such is not the case with that almighty and eternal Being whose gaze necessarily includes the whole of created things and who surveys distinctly though at once mankind and man We may naturally believe that it is not the singular prosperity of the few but the greater well being of all which is most pleasing in the sight of the Creator and Preserver of men What appears to me to be man s decline is to His eye advancement what afflicts me is acceptable to Him A state of equality is perhaps less elevated but it is more just and its justice constitutes its greatness and its beauty I would strive then to raise myself to this point of the divine contemplation and thence to view and to judge the concerns of men No man upon the earth can as yet affirm absolutely and generally that the new state of the world is better than its former one but it is already easy to perceive that this state is different Some vices and some virtues were so inherent in the constitution of an aristocratic nation and are so opposite to the character of a modern people that they can never be infused into it some good tendencies and some bad propensities which were unknown to the former are natural to the latter some ideas suggest themselves spontaneously to the imagination of the one which are utterly repugnant to the mind of the other They are like two distinct orders of human beings each of which has its own merits and defects its own advantages and its own evils Care must therefore be taken not to judge the state of society which is now coming into existence by notions derived from a state of society which no longer exists for as these states of society are exceedingly different in their structure they cannot be submitted to a just or fair comparison It would be scarcely more reasonable to require of our own contemporaries the peculiar virtues which originated in the social condition of their forefathers since that social condition is itself fallen and has drawn into one promiscuous ruin the good and evil which belonged to it But as yet these things are imperfectly understood I find that a great number of my contemporaries undertake to make a certain selection from amongst the institutions the opinions and the ideas which originated in the aristocratic constitution of society as it was a portion of these elements they would willingly relinquish but they would keep the remainder and transplant them into their new world I apprehend that such men are wasting their time and their strength in virtuous but unprofitable efforts The object is not to retain the peculiar advantages which the inequality of conditions bestows upon mankind but to secure the new benefits which equality may supply We have not to seek to make ourselves like our progenitors but to strive to work out that species of greatness and happiness which is our own For myself who now look back from this extreme limit of my task and discover from afar but at once the various objects which have attracted my more attentive investigation upon my way I am full of apprehensions and of hopes I perceive mighty dangers which it is possible to ward off mighty evils which may be avoided or alleviated and I cling with a firmer hold to the belief that for democratic nations to be virtuous and prosperous they require but to will it I am aware that many of my contemporaries maintain that nations are never their own masters here below and that they necessarily obey some insurmountable and unintelligent power arising from anterior events from their race or from the soil and climate of their country Such principles are false and cowardly such principles can never produce aught but feeble men and pusillanimous nations Providence has not created mankind entirely independent or entirely free It is true that around every man a fatal circle is traced beyond which he cannot pass but within the wide verge of that circle he is powerful and free as it is with man so with communities The nations of our time cannot prevent the conditions of men from becoming equal but it depends upon themselves whether the principle of equality is to lead them to servitude or freedom to knowledge or barbarism to prosperity or to wretchedness Part I Appendix A For information concerning all the countries of the West which have not been visited by Europeans consult the account of two expeditions undertaken at the expense of Congress by Major Long This traveller particularly mentions on the subject of the great American desert that a line may be drawn nearly parallel to the twentieth degree of longitude a meridian of Washington beginning from the Red River and ending at the River Platte From this imaginary line to the Rocky Mountains which bound the valley of the Mississippi on the west lie immense plains which are almost entirely covered with sand incapable of cultivation or scattered over with masses of granite In summer these plains are quite destitute of water and nothing is to be seen on them but herds of buffaloes and wild horses Some hordes of Indians are also found there but in no great numbers Major Long was told that in travelling northwards from the River Platte you find the same desert lying constantly on the left but he was unable to ascertain the truth of this report However worthy of confidence may be the narrative of Major Long it must be remembered that he only passed through the country of which he speaks without deviating widely from the line which he had traced out for his journey Footnote a The twentieth degree of longitude according to the meridian of Washington agrees very nearly with the ninety seventh degree on the meridian of Greenwich Appendix B South America in the region between the tropics produces an incredible profusion of climbing plants of which the flora of the Antilles alone presents us with forty different species Among the most graceful of these shrubs is the passion flower which according to Descourtiz grows with such luxuriance in the Antilles as to climb trees by means of the tendrils with which it is provided and form moving bowers of rich and elegant festoons decorated with blue and purple flowers and fragrant with perfume The Mimosa scandens Acacia a grandes gousses is a creeper of enormous and rapid growth which climbs from tree to tree and sometimes covers more than half a league Appendix C The languages which are spoken by the Indians of America from the Pole to Cape Horn are said to be all formed upon the same model and subject to the same grammatical rules whence it may fairly be concluded that all the Indian nations sprang from the same stock Each tribe of the American continent speaks a different dialect but the number of languages properly so called is very small a fact which tends to prove that the nations of the New World had not a very remote origin Moreover the languages of America have a great degree of regularity from which it seems probable that the tribes which employ them had not undergone any great revolutions or been incorporated voluntarily or by constraint with foreign nations For it is generally the union of several languages into one which produces grammatical irregularities It is not long since the American languages especially those of the North first attracted the serious attention of philologists when the discovery was made that this idiom of a barbarous people was the product of a complicated system of ideas and very learned combinations These languages were found to be very rich and great pains had been taken at their formation to render them agreeable to the ear The grammatical system of the Americans differs from all others in several points but especially in the following Some nations of Europe amongst others the Germans have the power of combining at pleasure different expressions and thus giving a complex sense to certain words The Indians have given a most surprising extension to this power so as to arrive at the means of connecting a great number of ideas with a single term This will be easily understood with the help of an example quoted by mister Duponceau in the Memoirs of the Philosophical Society of America A Delaware woman playing with a cat or a young dog says this writer is heard to pronounce the word kuligatschis which is thus composed k is the sign of the second person and signifies thou or thy uli is a part of the word wulit which signifies beautiful pretty gat is another fragment of the word wichgat which means paw and lastly schis is a diminutive giving the idea of smallness Thus in one word the Indian woman has expressed Thy pretty little paw Take another example of the felicity with which the savages of America have composed their words A young man of Delaware is called pilape This word is formed from pilsit chaste innocent and lenape man viz man in his purity and innocence This facility of combining words is most remarkable in the strange formation of their verbs The most complex action is often expressed by a single verb which serves to convey all the shades of an idea by the modification of its construction Those who may wish to examine more in detail this subject which I have only glanced at superficially should read one The correspondence of mister Duponceau and the reverend mister Hecwelder relative to the Indian languages which is to be found in the first volume of the Memoirs of the Philosophical Society of America published at Philadelphia eighteen nineteen by Abraham Small vol i p three hundred fifty six four hundred sixty four two The Grammar of the Delaware or the Lenape Language by Geiberger and the preface of mister Duponceau All these are in the same collection vol iii three An excellent account of these works which is at the end of the sixth volume of the American Encyclopaedia Appendix D See in Charlevoix vol i p two hundred thirty five the history of the first war which the French inhabitants of Canada carried on in sixteen ten against the Iroquois The latter armed with bows and arrows offered a desperate resistance to the French and their allies Charlevoix is not a great painter yet he exhibits clearly enough in this narrative the contrast between the European manners and those of savages as well as the different way in which the two races of men understood the sense of honor When the French says he seized upon the beaver skins which covered the Indians who had fallen the Hurons their allies were greatly offended at this proceeding but without hesitation they set to work in their usual manner inflicting horrid cruelties upon the prisoners and devouring one of those who had been killed which made the Frenchmen shudder The barbarians prided themselves upon a scrupulousness which they were surprised at not finding in our nation and could not understand that there was less to reprehend in the stripping of dead bodies than in the devouring of their flesh like wild beasts Charlevoix in another place vol i p two hundred thirty thus describes the first torture of which Champlain was an eyewitness and the return of the Hurons into their own village Having proceeded about eight leagues says he our allies halted and having singled out one of their captives they reproached him with all the cruelties which he had practised upon the warriors of their nation who had fallen into his hands and told him that he might expect to be treated in like manner adding that if he had any spirit he would prove it by singing He immediately chanted forth his death song and then his war song and all the songs he knew but in a very mournful strain says Champlain who was not then aware that all savage music has a melancholy character The tortures which succeeded accompanied by all the horrors which we shall mention hereafter terrified the French who made every effort to put a stop to them but in vain The following night one of the Hurons having dreamt that they were pursued the retreat was changed to a real flight and the savages never stopped until they were out of the reach of danger The moment they perceived the cabins of their own village they cut themselves long sticks to which they fastened the scalps which had fallen to their share and carried them in triumph At this sight the women swam to the canoes where they received the bloody scalps from the hands of their husbands and tied them round their necks The warriors offered one of these horrible trophies to Champlain they also presented him with some bows and arrows the only spoils of the Iroquois which they had ventured to seize entreating him to show them to the King of France Champlain lived a whole winter quite alone among these barbarians without being under any alarm for his person or property Appendix E Although the Puritanical strictness which presided over the establishment of the English colonies in America is now much relaxed remarkable traces of it are still found in their habits and their laws In seventeen ninety two at the very time when the anti Christian republic of France began its ephemeral existence the legislative body of Massachusetts promulgated the following law to compel the citizens to observe the Sabbath We give the preamble and the principal articles of this law which is worthy of the reader s attention Whereas says the legislator the observation of the Sunday is an affair of public interest inasmuch as it produces a necessary suspension of labor leads men to reflect upon the duties of life and the errors to which human nature is liable and provides for the public and private worship of God the creator and governor of the universe and for the performance of such acts of charity as are the ornament and comfort of Christian societies Whereas irreligious or light minded persons forgetting the duties which the Sabbath imposes and the benefits which these duties confer on society are known to profane its sanctity by following their pleasures or their affairs this way of acting being contrary to their own interest as Christians and calculated to annoy those who do not follow their example being also of great injury to society at large by spreading a taste for dissipation and dissolute manners Be it enacted and ordained by the Governor Council and Representatives convened in General Court of Assembly that all and every person and persons shall on that day carefully apply themselves to the duties of religion and piety that no tradesman or labourer shall exercise his ordinary calling and that no game or recreation shall be used on the Lord s Day upon pain of forfeiting ten shillings That no one shall travel on that day or any part thereof under pain of forfeiting twenty shillings that no vessel shall leave a harbour of the colony that no persons shall keep outside the meeting house during the time of public worship or profane the time by playing or talking on penalty of five shillings Public houses shall not entertain any other than strangers or lodgers under penalty of five shillings for every person found drinking and abiding therein Any person in health who without sufficient reason shall omit to worship God in public during three months shall be condemned to a fine of ten shillings Any person guilty of misbehaviour in a place of public worship shall be fined from five to forty shillings These laws are to be enforced by the tything men of each township who have authority to visit public houses on the Sunday The innkeeper who shall refuse them admittance shall be fined forty shillings for such offence The tything men are to stop travellers and require of them their reason for being on the road on Sunday anyone refusing to answer shall be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding five pounds sterling If the reason given by the traveller be not deemed by the tything man sufficient he may bring the traveller before the justice of the peace of the district Law of March eight seventeen ninety two General Laws of Massachusetts vol i p four hundred ten On March eleven seventeen ninety seven a new law increased the amount of fines half of which was to be given to the informer Same collection vol ii p five hundred twenty five On February sixteen eighteen sixteen a new law confirmed these same measures Same collection vol ii p four hundred five Similar enactments exist in the laws of the State of New York revised in eighteen twenty seven and eighteen twenty eight See Revised Statutes Part I chapter twenty p six hundred seventy five In these it is declared that no one is allowed on the Sabbath to sport to fish to play at games or to frequent houses where liquor is sold No one can travel except in case of necessity And this is not the only trace which the religious strictness and austere manners of the first emigrants have left behind them in the American laws In the Revised Statutes of the State of New York vol i p six hundred sixty two is the following clause Whoever shall win or lose in the space of twenty four hours by gaming or betting the sum of twenty five dollars shall be found guilty of a misdemeanour and upon conviction shall be condemned to pay a fine equal to at least five times the value of the sum lost or won which shall be paid to the inspector of the poor of the township He that loses twenty five dollars or more may bring an action to recover them and if he neglects to do so the inspector of the poor may prosecute the winner and oblige him to pay into the poor s box both the sum he has gained and three times as much besides The laws we quote from are of recent date but they are unintelligible without going back to the very origin of the colonies I have no doubt that in our days the penal part of these laws is very rarely applied Laws preserve their inflexibility long after the manners of a nation have yielded to the influence of time It is still true however that nothing strikes a foreigner on his arrival in America more forcibly than the regard paid to the Sabbath There is one in particular of the large American cities in which all social movements begin to be suspended even on Saturday evening You traverse its streets at the hour at which you expect men in the middle of life to be engaged in business and young people in pleasure and you meet with solitude and silence Not only have all ceased to work but they appear to have ceased to exist Neither the movements of industry are heard nor the accents of joy nor even the confused murmur which arises from the midst of a great city Chains are hung across the streets in the neighborhood of the churches the half closed shutters of the houses scarcely admit a ray of sun into the dwellings of the citizens Now and then you perceive a solitary individual who glides silently along the deserted streets and lanes Next day at early dawn the rolling of carriages the noise of hammers the cries of the population begin to make themselves heard again The city is awake An eager crowd hastens towards the resort of commerce and industry everything around you bespeaks motion bustle hurry A feverish activity succeeds to the lethargic stupor of yesterday you might almost suppose that they had but one day to acquire wealth and to enjoy it Appendix F It is unnecessary for me to say that in the chapter which has just been read I have not had the intention of giving a history of America My only object was to enable the reader to appreciate the influence which the opinions and manners of the first emigrants had exercised upon the fate of the different colonies and of the Union in general I have therefore confined myself to the quotation of a few detached fragments I do not know whether I am deceived but it appears to me that by pursuing the path which I have merely pointed out it would be easy to present such pictures of the American republics as would not be unworthy the attention of the public and could not fail to suggest to the statesman matter for reflection Not being able to devote myself to this labor I am anxious to render it easy to others and for this purpose I subjoin a short catalogue and analysis of the works which seem to me the most important to consult At the head of the general documents which it would be advantageous to examine I place the work entitled An Historical Collection of State Papers and other authentic Documents intended as Materials for a History of the United States of America by Ebenezer Hasard The first volume of this compilation which was printed at Philadelphia in seventeen ninety two contains a literal copy of all the charters granted by the Crown of England to the emigrants as well as the principal acts of the colonial governments during the commencement of their existence Amongst other authentic documents we here find a great many relating to the affairs of New England and Virginia during this period The second volume is almost entirely devoted to the acts of the Confederation of sixteen forty three This federal compact which was entered into by the colonies of New England with the view of resisting the Indians was the first instance of union afforded by the Anglo Americans There were besides many other confederations of the same nature before the famous one of seventeen seventy six which brought about the independence of the colonies Each colony has besides its own historic monuments some of which are extremely curious beginning with Virginia the State which was first peopled The earliest historian of Virginia was its founder Captain John Smith Captain Smith has left us an octavo volume entitled The generall Historie of Virginia and New England by Captain John Smith sometymes Governor in those Countryes and Admirall of New England printed at London in sixteen twenty seven The work is adorned with curious maps and engravings of the time when it appeared the narrative extends from the year fifteen eighty four to sixteen twenty six Smith s work is highly and deservedly esteemed The author was one of the most celebrated adventurers of a period of remarkable adventure his book breathes that ardor for discovery that spirit of enterprise which characterized the men of his time when the manners of chivalry were united to zeal for commerce and made subservient to the acquisition of wealth But Captain Smith is most remarkable for uniting to the virtues which characterized his contemporaries several qualities to which they were generally strangers his style is simple and concise his narratives bear the stamp of truth and his descriptions are free from false ornament This author throws most valuable light upon the state and condition of the Indians at the time when North America was first discovered The second historian to consult is Beverley who commences his narrative with the year fifteen eighty five and ends it with seventeen hundred The first part of his book contains historical documents properly so called relative to the infancy of the colony The second affords a most curious picture of the state of the Indians at this remote period The third conveys very clear ideas concerning the manners social conditions laws and political customs of the Virginians in the author s lifetime Beverley was a native of Virginia which occasions him to say at the beginning of his book that he entreats his readers not to exercise their critical severity upon it since having been born in the Indies he does not aspire to purity of language Notwithstanding this colonial modesty the author shows throughout his book the impatience with which he endures the supremacy of the mother country In this work of Beverley are also found numerous traces of that spirit of civil liberty which animated the English colonies of America at the time when he wrote He also shows the dissensions which existed among them and retarded their independence Beverley detests his Catholic neighbors of Maryland even more than he hates the English government his style is simple his narrative interesting and apparently trustworthy I saw in America another work which ought to be consulted entitled The History of Virginia by William Stith This book affords some curious details but I thought it long and diffuse The most ancient as well as the best document to be consulted on the history of Carolina is a work in small quarto entitled The History of Carolina by John Lawson printed at London in seventeen eighteen This work contains in the first part a journey of discovery in the west of Carolina the account of which given in the form of a journal is in general confused and superficial but it contains a very striking description of the mortality caused among the savages of that time both by the smallpox and the immoderate use of brandy with a curious picture of the corruption of manners prevalent amongst them which was increased by the presence of Europeans The second part of Lawson s book is taken up with a description of the physical condition of Carolina and its productions In the third part the author gives an interesting account of the manners customs and government of the Indians at that period There is a good deal of talent and originality in this part of the work Lawson concludes his history with a copy of the charter granted to the Carolinas in the reign of Charles II The general tone of this work is light and often licentious forming a perfect contrast to the solemn style of the works published at the same period in New England Lawson s history is extremely scarce in America and cannot be procured in Europe There is however a copy of it in the Royal Library at Paris From the southern extremity of the United States I pass at once to the northern limit as the intermediate space was not peopled till a later period I must first point out a very curious compilation entitled Collection of the Massachusetts Historical Society printed for the first time at Boston in seventeen ninety two and reprinted in eighteen oh six The collection of which I speak and which is continued to the present day contains a great number of very valuable documents relating to the history of the different States in New England Among them are letters which have never been published and authentic pieces which had been buried in provincial archives The whole work of Gookin concerning the Indians is inserted there I have mentioned several times in the chapter to which this note relates the work of Nathaniel Norton entitled New England s Memorial sufficiently perhaps to prove that it deserves the attention of those who would be conversant with the history of New England This book is in octavo and was reprinted at Boston in eighteen twenty six The most valuable and important authority which exists upon the history of New England is the work of the reverend Cotton Mather entitled Magnalia Christi Americana or the Ecclesiastical History of New England sixteen twenty sixteen ninety eight two vols eightvo reprinted at Hartford United States in eighteen twenty b The author divided his work into seven books The first presents the history of the events which prepared and brought about the establishment of New England The second contains the lives of the first governors and chief magistrates who presided over the country The third is devoted to the lives and labors of the evangelical ministers who during the same period had the care of souls In the fourth the author relates the institution and progress of the University of Cambridge Massachusetts In the fifth he describes the principles and the discipline of the Church of New England The sixth is taken up in retracing certain facts which in the opinion of Mather prove the merciful interposition of Providence in behalf of the inhabitants of New England Lastly in the seventh the author gives an account of the heresies and the troubles to which the Church of New England was exposed Cotton Mather was an evangelical minister who was born at Boston and passed his life there His narratives are distinguished by the same ardor and religious zeal which led to the foundation of the colonies of New England Traces of bad taste sometimes occur in his manner of writing but he interests because he is full of enthusiasm He is often intolerant still oftener credulous but he never betrays an intention to deceive Sometimes his book contains fine passages and true and profound reflections such as the following Before the arrival of the Puritans says he vol i chap iv there were more than a few attempts of the English to people and improve the parts of New England which were to the northward of New Plymouth but the designs of those attempts being aimed no higher than the advancement of some worldly interests a constant series of disasters has confounded them until there was a plantation erected upon the nobler designs of Christianity and that plantation though it has had more adversaries than perhaps any one upon earth yet having obtained help from God it continues to this day Mather occasionally relieves the austerity of his descriptions with images full of tender feeling after having spoken of an English lady whose religious ardor had brought her to America with her husband and who soon after sank under the fatigues and privations of exile he adds As for her virtuous husband Isaac Johnson He tryed To live without her liked it not and dyed Footnote b A folio edition of this work was published in London in seventeen oh two Mather s work gives an admirable picture of the time and country which he describes In his account of the motives which led the Puritans to seek an asylum beyond seas he says The God of Heaven served as it were a summons upon the spirits of his people in the English nation stirring up the spirits of thousands which never saw the faces of each other with a most unanimous inclination to leave all the pleasant accommodations of their native country and go over a terrible ocean into a more terrible desert for the pure enjoyment of all his ordinances It is now reasonable that before we pass any further the reasons of his undertaking should be more exactly made known unto posterity especially unto the posterity of those that were the undertakers lest they come at length to forget and neglect the true interest of New England Wherefore I shall now transcribe some of them from a manuscript wherein they were then tendered unto consideration General Considerations for the Plantation of New England First It will be a service unto the Church of great consequence to carry the Gospel unto those parts of the world and raise a bulwark against the kingdom of Antichrist which the Jesuits labour to rear up in all parts of the world Secondly All other Churches of Europe have been brought under desolations and it may be feared that the like judgments are coming upon us and who knows but God hath provided this place to be a refuge for many whom he means to save out of the general destruction Thirdly The land grows weary of her inhabitants insomuch that man which is the most precious of all creatures is here more vile and base than the earth he treads upon children neighbours and friends especially the poor are counted the greatest burdens which if things were right would be the chiefest of earthly blessings Fourthly We are grown to that intemperance in all excess of riot as no mean estate almost will suffice a man to keep sail with his equals and he that fails in it must live in scorn and contempt hence it comes to pass that all arts and trades are carried in that deceitful manner and unrighteous course as it is almost impossible for a good upright man to maintain his constant charge and live comfortably in them Fifthly The schools of learning and religion are so corrupted as besides the unsupportable charge of education most children even the best wittiest and of the fairest hopes are perverted corrupted and utterly overthrown by the multitude of evil examples and licentious behaviours in these seminaries Sixthly The whole earth is the Lord s garden and he hath given it to the sons of Adam to be tilled and improved by them why then should we stand starving here for places of habitation and in the meantime suffer whole countries as profitable for the use of man to lie waste without any improvement Seventhly What can be a better or nobler work and more worthy of a Christian than to erect and support a reformed particular Church in its infancy and unite our forces with such a company of faithful people as by timely assistance may grow stronger and prosper but for want of it may be put to great hazards if not be wholly ruined Eighthly If any such as are known to be godly and live in wealth and prosperity here shall forsake all this to join with this reformed Church and with it run the hazard of an hard and mean condition it will be an example of great use both for the removing of scandal and to give more life unto the faith of God s people in their prayers for the plantation and also to encourage others to join the more willingly in it Further on when he declares the principles of the Church of New England with respect to morals Mather inveighs with violence against the custom of drinking healths at table which he denounces as a pagan and abominable practice He proscribes with the same rigor all ornaments for the hair used by the female sex as well as their custom of having the arms and neck uncovered In another part of his work he relates several instances of witchcraft which had alarmed New England It is plain that the visible action of the devil in the affairs of this world appeared to him an incontestable and evident fact This work of Cotton Mather displays in many places the spirit of civil liberty and political independence which characterized the times in which he lived Their principles respecting government are discoverable at every page Thus for instance the inhabitants of Massachusetts in the year sixteen thirty ten years after the foundation of Plymouth are found to have devoted Pound four hundred sterling to the establishment of the University of Cambridge In passing from the general documents relative to the history of New England to those which describe the several States comprised within its limits I ought first to notice The History of the Colony of Massachusetts by Hutchinson Lieutenant Governor of the Massachusetts Province two vols eightvo The history of Hutchinson which I have several times quoted in the chapter to which this note relates commences in the year sixteen twenty eight and ends in seventeen fifty Throughout the work there is a striking air of truth and the greatest simplicity of style it is full of minute details The best history to consult concerning Connecticut is that of Benjamin Trumbull entitled A Complete History of Connecticut Civil and Ecclesiastical sixteen thirty seventeen sixty four two vols eightvo printed in eighteen eighteen at New Haven This history contains a clear and calm account of all the events which happened in Connecticut during the period given in the title The author drew from the best sources and his narrative bears the stamp of truth All that he says of the early days of Connecticut is extremely curious See especially the Constitution of sixteen thirty nine vol i ch vi p one hundred and also the Penal Laws of Connecticut vol i ch vii p one hundred twenty three The History of New Hampshire by Jeremy Belknap is a work held in merited estimation It was printed at Boston in seventeen ninety two in two vols eightvo The third chapter of the first volume is particularly worthy of attention for the valuable details it affords on the political and religious principles of the Puritans on the causes of their emigration and on their laws The following curious quotation is given from a sermon delivered in sixteen sixty three It concerneth New England always to remember that they are a plantation religious not a plantation of trade The profession of the purity of doctrine worship and discipline is written upon her forehead Let merchants and such as are increasing cent per cent remember this that worldly gain was not the end and design of the people of New England but religion And if any man among us make religion as twelve and the world as thirteen such an one hath not the spirit of a true New Englishman The reader of Belknap will find in his work more general ideas and more strength of thought than are to be met with in the American historians even to the present day Among the Central States which deserve our attention for their remote origin New York and Pennsylvania are the foremost The best history we have of the former is entitled A History of New York by William Smith printed at London in seventeen fifty seven Smith gives us important details of the wars between the French and English in America His is the best account of the famous confederation of the Iroquois With respect to Pennsylvania I cannot do better than point out the work of Proud entitled The History of Pennsylvania from the original Institution and Settlement of that Province under the first Proprietor and Governor William Penn in sixteen eighty one till after the year seventeen forty two by Robert Proud two vols eightvo printed at Philadelphia in seventeen ninety seven This work is deserving of the especial attention of the reader it contains a mass of curious documents concerning Penn the doctrine of the Quakers and the character manners and customs of the first inhabitants of Pennsylvania I need not add that among the most important documents relating to this State are the works of Penn himself and those of Franklin Part II Appendix G We read in Jefferson s Memoirs as follows At the time of the first settlement of the English in Virginia when land was to be had for little or nothing some provident persons having obtained large grants of it and being desirous of maintaining the splendor of their families entailed their property upon their descendants The transmission of these estates from generation to generation to men who bore the same name had the effect of raising up a distinct class of families who possessing by law the privilege of perpetuating their wealth formed by these means a sort of patrician order distinguished by the grandeur and luxury of their establishments From this order it was that the King usually chose his councillors of state c Footnote c This passage is extracted and translated from M Conseil s work upon the life of Jefferson entitled Melanges Politiques et Philosophiques de Jefferson In the United States the principal clauses of the English law respecting descent have been universally rejected The first rule that we follow says mister Kent touching inheritance is the following If a man dies intestate his property goes to his heirs in a direct line If he has but one heir or heiress he or she succeeds to the whole If there are several heirs of the same degree they divide the inheritance equally amongst them without distinction of sex This rule was prescribed for the first time in the State of New York by a statute of February twenty three seventeen eighty six See Revised Statutes vol iii Appendix p forty eight It has since then been adopted in the Revised Statutes of the same State At the present day this law holds good throughout the whole of the United States with the exception of the State of Vermont where the male heir inherits a double portion Kent s Commentaries vol iv p three hundred seventy mister Kent in the same work vol iv p one twenty two gives a historical account of American legislation on the subject of entail by this we learn that previous to the Revolution the colonies followed the English law of entail Estates tail were abolished in Virginia in seventeen seventy six on a motion of mister Jefferson They were suppressed in New York in seventeen eighty six and have since been abolished in North Carolina Kentucky Tennessee Georgia and Missouri In Vermont Indiana Illinois South Carolina and Louisiana entail was never introduced Those States which thought proper to preserve the English law of entail modified it in such a way as to deprive it of its most aristocratic tendencies Our general principles on the subject of government says mister Kent tend to favor the free circulation of property It cannot fail to strike the French reader who studies the law of inheritance that on these questions the French legislation is infinitely more democratic even than the American The American law makes an equal division of the father s property but only in the case of his will not being known for every man says the law in the State of New York Revised Statutes vol iii Appendix p fifty one has entire liberty power and authority to dispose of his property by will to leave it entire or divided in favor of any persons he chooses as his heirs provided he do not leave it to a political body or any corporation The French law obliges the testator to divide his property equally or nearly so among his heirs Most of the American republics still admit of entails under certain restrictions but the French law prohibits entail in all cases If the social condition of the Americans is more democratic than that of the French the laws of the latter are the most democratic of the two This may be explained more easily than at first appears to be the case In France democracy is still occupied in the work of destruction in America it reigns quietly over the ruins it has made Appendix H Summary Of The Qualifications Of Voters In The United States As They Existed In eighteen thirty two All the States agree in granting the right of voting at the age of twenty one In all of them it is necessary to have resided for a certain time in the district where the vote is given This period varies from three months to two years As to the qualification in the State of Massachusetts it is necessary to have an income of Pound three or a capital of Pound sixty In Rhode Island a man must possess landed property to the amount of one hundred thirty three dollars In Connecticut he must have a property which gives an income of seventeen dollars A year of service in the militia also gives the elective privilege In New Jersey an elector must have a property of Pound fifty a year In South Carolina and Maryland the elector must possess fifty acres of land In Tennessee he must possess some property In the States of Mississippi Ohio Georgia Virginia Pennsylvania Delaware New York the only necessary qualification for voting is that of paying the taxes and in most of the States to serve in the militia is equivalent to the payment of taxes In Maine and New Hampshire any man can vote who is not on the pauper list Lastly in the States of Missouri Alabama Illinois Louisiana Indiana Kentucky and Vermont the conditions of voting have no reference to the property of the elector I believe there is no other State besides that of North Carolina in which different conditions are applied to the voting for the Senate and the electing the House of Representatives The electors of the former in this case should possess in property fifty acres of land to vote for the latter nothing more is required than to pay taxes Appendix I The small number of custom house officers employed in the United States compared with the extent of the coast renders smuggling very easy notwithstanding which it is less practised than elsewhere because everybody endeavors to repress it In America there is no police for the prevention of fires and such accidents are more frequent than in Europe but in general they are more speedily extinguished because the surrounding population is prompt in lending assistance Appendix K It is incorrect to assert that centralization was produced by the French Revolution the revolution brought it to perfection but did not create it The mania for centralization and government regulations dates from the time when jurists began to take a share in the government in the time of Philippele Bel ever since which period they have been on the increase In the year seventeen seventy five M de Malesherbes speaking in the name of the Cour des Aides said to Louis XIV d Footnote d See Memoires pour servir a l Histoire du Droit Public de la France en matiere d impots p six hundred fifty four printed at Brussels in seventeen seventy nine Every corporation and every community of citizens retained the right of administering its own affairs a right which not only forms part of the primitive constitution of the kingdom but has a still higher origin for it is the right of nature and of reason Nevertheless your subjects Sire have been deprived of it and we cannot refrain from saying that in this respect your government has fallen into puerile extremes From the time when powerful ministers made it a political principle to prevent the convocation of a national assembly one consequence has succeeded another until the deliberations of the inhabitants of a village are declared null when they have not been authorized by the Intendant Of course if the community has an expensive undertaking to carry through it must remain under the control of the sub delegate of the Intendant and consequently follow the plan he proposes employ his favorite workmen pay them according to his pleasure and if an action at law is deemed necessary the Intendant s permission must be obtained The cause must be pleaded before this first tribunal previous to its being carried into a public court and if the opinion of the Intendant is opposed to that of the inhabitants or if their adversary enjoys his favor the community is deprived of the power of defending its rights Such are the means Sire which have been exerted to extinguish the municipal spirit in France and to stifle if possible the opinions of the citizens The nation may be said to lie under an interdict and to be in wardship under guardians What could be said more to the purpose at the present day when the Revolution has achieved what are called its victories in centralization In seventeen eighty nine Jefferson wrote from Paris to one of his friends There is no country where the mania for over governing has taken deeper root than in France or been the source of greater mischief Letter to Madison August twenty eight seventeen eighty nine The fact is that for several centuries past the central power of France has done everything it could to extend central administration it has acknowledged no other limits than its own strength The central power to which the Revolution gave birth made more rapid advances than any of its predecessors because it was stronger and wiser than they had been Louis XIV committed the welfare of such communities to the caprice of an intendant Napoleon left them to that of the Minister The same principle governed both though its consequences were more or less remote Appendix L The immutability of the constitution of France is a necessary consequence of the laws of that country To begin with the most important of all the laws that which decides the order of succession to the throne what can be more immutable in its principle than a political order founded upon the natural succession of father to son In eighteen fourteen Louis XVIII had established the perpetual law of hereditary succession in favor of his own family The individuals who regulated the consequences of the Revolution of eighteen thirty followed his example they merely established the perpetuity of the law in favor of another family In this respect they imitated the Chancellor Meaupou who when he erected the new Parliament upon the ruins of the old took care to declare in the same ordinance that the rights of the new magistrates should be as inalienable as those of their predecessors had been The laws of eighteen thirty like those of eighteen fourteen point out no way of changing the constitution and it is evident that the ordinary means of legislation are insufficient for this purpose As the King the Peers and the Deputies all derive their authority from the constitution these three powers united cannot alter a law by virtue of which alone they govern Out of the pale of the constitution they are nothing where when could they take their stand to effect a change in its provisions The alternative is clear either their efforts are powerless against the charter which continues to exist in spite of them in which case they only reign in the name of the charter or they succeed in changing the charter and then the law by which they existed being annulled they themselves cease to exist By destroying the charter they destroy themselves This is much more evident in the laws of eighteen thirty than in those of eighteen fourteen In eighteen fourteen the royal prerogative took its stand above and beyond the constitution but in eighteen thirty it was avowedly created by and dependent on the constitution A part therefore of the French constitution is immutable because it is united to the destiny of a family and the body of the constitution is equally immutable because there appear to be no legal means of changing it These remarks are not applicable to England That country having no written constitution who can assert when its constitution is changed Appendix M The most esteemed authors who have written upon the English Constitution agree with each other in establishing the omnipotence of the Parliament Delolme says It is a fundamental principle with the English lawyers that Parliament can do everything except making a woman a man or a man a woman Blackstone expresses himself more in detail if not more energetically than Delolme in the following terms The power and jurisdiction of Parliament says Sir Edward Coke four Inst thirty six is so transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined either for causes or persons within any bounds And of this High Court he adds may be truly said Si antiquitatem spectes est vetustissima si dignitatem est honoratissima si jurisdictionem est capacissima It hath sovereign and uncontrollable authority in the making confirming enlarging restraining abrogating repealing reviving and expounding of laws concerning matters of all possible denominations ecclesiastical or temporal civil military maritime or criminal this being the place where that absolute despotic power which must in all governments reside somewhere is intrusted by the constitution of these kingdoms All mischiefs and grievances operations and remedies that transcend the ordinary course of the laws are within the reach of this extraordinary tribunal It can regulate or new model the succession to the Crown as was done in the reign of Henry VIII and William III It can alter the established religion of the land as was done in a variety of instances in the reigns of King Henry VIII and his three children It can change and create afresh even the constitution of the kingdom and of parliaments themselves as was done by the Act of Union and the several statutes for triennial and septennial elections It can in short do everything that is not naturally impossible to be done and therefore some have not scrupled to call its power by a figure rather too bold the omnipotence of Parliament Appendix N There is no question upon which the American constitutions agree more fully than upon that of political jurisdiction All the constitutions which take cognizance of this matter give to the House of Delegates the exclusive right of impeachment excepting only the constitution of North Carolina which grants the same privilege to grand juries Article twenty three Almost all the constitutions give the exclusive right of pronouncing sentence to the Senate or to the Assembly which occupies its place The only punishments which the political tribunals can inflict are removal or the interdiction of public functions for the future There is no other constitution but that of Virginia p one hundred fifty two which enables them to inflict every kind of punishment The crimes which are subject to political jurisdiction are in the federal constitution Section four Art one in that of Indiana Art three paragraphs twenty three and twenty four of New York Art five of Delaware Art five high treason bribery and other high crimes or offences In the Constitution of Massachusetts Chap I Section two that of North Carolina Art twenty three of Virginia p two hundred fifty two misconduct and maladministration In the constitution of New Hampshire p one hundred five corruption intrigue and maladministration In Vermont Chap two Art twenty four maladministration In South Carolina Art five Kentucky Art five Tennessee Art four Ohio Art one twenty three twenty four Louisiana Art five Mississippi Art five Alabama Art six Pennsylvania Art four crimes committed in the non performance of official duties In the States of Illinois Georgia Maine and Connecticut no particular offences are specified Appendix O It is true that the powers of Europe may carry on maritime wars with the Union but there is always greater facility and less danger in supporting a maritime than a continental war Maritime warfare only requires one species of effort A commercial people which consents to furnish its government with the necessary funds is sure to possess a fleet And it is far easier to induce a nation to part with its money almost unconsciously than to reconcile it to sacrifices of men and personal efforts Moreover defeat by sea rarely compromises the existence or independence of the people which endures it As for continental wars it is evident that the nations of Europe cannot be formidable in this way to the American Union It would be very difficult to transport and maintain in America more than twenty five thousand soldiers an army which may be considered to represent a nation of about two million of men The most populous nation of Europe contending in this way against the Union is in the position of a nation of two million of inhabitants at war with one of twelve million Add to this that America has all its resources within reach whilst the European is at four thousand miles distance from his and that the immensity of the American continent would of itself present an insurmountable obstacle to its conquest Appendix P The first American journal appeared in April seventeen oh four and was published at Boston See Collection of the Historical Society of Massachusetts vol vi p sixty six It would be a mistake to suppose that the periodical press has always been entirely free in the American colonies an attempt was made to establish something analogous to a censorship and preliminary security Consult the Legislative Documents of Massachusetts of January fourteen seventeen twenty two The Committee appointed by the General Assembly the legislative body of the province for the purpose of examining into circumstances connected with a paper entitled The New England Courier expresses its opinion that the tendency of the said journal is to turn religion into derision and bring it into contempt that it mentions the sacred writers in a profane and irreligious manner that it puts malicious interpretations upon the conduct of the ministers of the Gospel and that the Government of his Majesty is insulted and the peace and tranquillity of the province disturbed by the said journal The Committee is consequently of opinion that the printer and publisher James Franklin should be forbidden to print and publish the said journal or any other work in future without having previously submitted it to the Secretary of the province and that the justices of the peace for the county of Suffolk should be commissioned to require bail of the said James Franklin for his good conduct during the ensuing year The suggestion of the Committee was adopted and passed into a law but the effect of it was null for the journal eluded the prohibition by putting the name of Benjamin Franklin instead of James Franklin at the bottom of its columns and this manoeuvre was supported by public opinion Appendix Q The Federal Constitution has introduced the jury into the tribunals of the Union in the same way as the States had introduced it into their own several courts but as it has not established any fixed rules for the choice of jurors the federal courts select them from the ordinary jury list which each State makes for itself The laws of the States must therefore be examined for the theory of the formation of juries See Story s Commentaries on the Constitution B iii chap thirty eight p six hundred fifty four six hundred fifty nine Sergeant s Constitutional Law p one hundred sixty five See also the Federal Laws of the years seventeen eighty nine eighteen hundred and eighteen oh two upon the subject For the purpose of thoroughly understanding the American principles with respect to the formation of juries I examined the laws of States at a distance from one another and the following observations were the result of my inquiries In America all the citizens who exercise the elective franchise have the right of serving upon a jury The great State of New York however has made a slight difference between the two privileges but in a spirit quite contrary to that of the laws of France for in the State of New York there are fewer persons eligible as jurymen than there are electors It may be said in general that the right of forming part of a jury like the right of electing representatives is open to all the citizens the exercise of this right however is not put indiscriminately into any hands Every year a body of municipal or county magistrates called selectmen in New England supervisors in New York trustees in Ohio and sheriffs of the parish in Louisiana choose for each county a certain number of citizens who have the right of serving as jurymen and who are supposed to be capable of exercising their functions These magistrates being themselves elective excite no distrust their powers like those of most republican magistrates are very extensive and very arbitrary and they frequently make use of them to remove unworthy or incompetent jurymen The names of the jurymen thus chosen are transmitted to the County Court and the jury who have to decide any affair are drawn by lot from the whole list of names The Americans have contrived in every way to make the common people eligible to the jury and to render the service as little onerous as possible The sessions are held in the chief town of every county and the jury are indemnified for their attendance either by the State or the parties concerned They receive in general a dollar per day besides their travelling expenses In America the being placed upon the jury is looked upon as a burden but it is a burden which is very supportable See Brevard s Digest of the Public Statute Law of South Carolina vol i pp four hundred forty six and four hundred fifty four vol ii pp two hundred eighteen and three hundred thirty eight The General Laws of Massachusetts revised and published by authority of the Legislature vol ii pp one hundred eighty seven and three hundred thirty one The Revised Statutes of the State of New York vol ii pp four hundred eleven six hundred forty three seven hundred seventeen seven hundred twenty The Statute Law of the State of Tennessee vol i p two hundred nine Acts of the State of Ohio pp ninety five and two hundred ten and Digeste general des Actes de la Legislature de la Louisiane Appendix R If we attentively examine the constitution of the jury as introduced into civil proceedings in England we shall readily perceive that the jurors are under the immediate control of the judge It is true that the verdict of the jury in civil as well as in criminal cases comprises the question of fact and the question of right in the same reply thus a house is claimed by Peter as having been purchased by him this is the fact to be decided The defendant puts in a plea of incompetency on the part of the vendor this is the legal question to be resolved But the jury do not enjoy the same character of infallibility in civil cases according to the practice of the English courts as they do in criminal cases The judge may refuse to receive the verdict and even after the first trial has taken place a second or new trial may be awarded by the Court See Blackstone s Commentaries book iii ch twenty four Appendix S I find in my travelling journal a passage which may serve to convey a more complete notion of the trials to which the women of America who consent to follow their husbands into the wilds are often subjected This description has nothing to recommend it to the reader but its strict accuracy From time to time we come to fresh clearings all these places are alike I shall describe the one at which we have halted to night for it will serve to remind me of all the others The bell which the pioneers hang round the necks of their cattle in order to find them again in the woods announced our approach to a clearing when we were yet a long way off and we soon afterwards heard the stroke of the hatchet hewing down the trees of the forest As we came nearer traces of destruction marked the presence of civilized man the road was strewn with shattered boughs trunks of trees half consumed by fire or cleft by the wedge were still standing in the track we were following We continued to proceed till we reached a wood in which all the trees seemed to have been suddenly struck dead in the height of summer their boughs were as leafless as in winter and upon closer examination we found that a deep circle had been cut round the bark which by stopping the circulation of the sap soon kills the tree We were informed that this is commonly the first thing a pioneer does as he cannot in the first year cut down all the trees which cover his new parcel of land he sows Indian corn under their branches and puts the trees to death in order to prevent them from injuring his crop Beyond this field at present imperfectly traced out we suddenly came upon the cabin of its owner situated in the centre of a plot of ground more carefully cultivated than the rest but where man was still waging unequal warfare with the forest there the trees were cut down but their roots were not removed and the trunks still encumbered the ground which they so recently shaded Around these dry blocks wheat suckers of trees and plants of every kind grow and intertwine in all the luxuriance of wild untutored nature Amidst this vigorous and various vegetation stands the house of the pioneer or as they call it the log house Like the ground about it this rustic dwelling bore marks of recent and hasty labor its length seemed not to exceed thirty feet its height fifteen the walls as well as the roof were formed of rough trunks of trees between which a little moss and clay had been inserted to keep out the cold and rain As night was coming on we determined to ask the master of the log house for a lodging At the sound of our footsteps the children who were playing amongst the scattered branches sprang up and ran towards the house as if they were frightened at the sight of man whilst two large dogs almost wild with ears erect and outstretched nose came growling out of their hut to cover the retreat of their young masters The pioneer himself made his appearance at the door of his dwelling he looked at us with a rapid and inquisitive glance made a sign to the dogs to go into the house and set them the example without betraying either curiosity or apprehension at our arrival We entered the log house the inside is quite unlike that of the cottages of the peasantry of Europe it contains more than is superfluous less than is necessary A single window with a muslin blind on a hearth of trodden clay an immense fire which lights the whole structure above the hearth a good rifle a deer s skin and plumes of eagles feathers on the right hand of the chimney a map of the United States raised and shaken by the wind through the crannies in the wall near the map upon a shelf formed of a roughly hewn plank a few volumes of books a Bible the six first books of Milton and two of Shakespeare s plays along the wall trunks instead of closets in the centre of the room a rude table with legs of green wood and with the bark still upon them looking as if they grew out of the ground on which they stood but on this table a tea pot of British ware silver spoons cracked tea cups and some newspapers The master of this dwelling has the strong angular features and lank limbs peculiar to the native of New England It is evident that this man was not born in the solitude in which we have met with him his physical constitution suffices to show that his earlier years were spent in the midst of civilized society and that he belongs to that restless calculating and adventurous race of men who do with the utmost coolness things only to be accounted for by the ardor of the passions and who endure the life of savages for a time in order to conquer and civilize the backwoods When the pioneer perceived that we were crossing his threshold he came to meet us and shake hands as is their custom but his face was quite unmoved he opened the conversation by inquiring what was going on in the world and when his curiosity was satisfied he held his peace as if he were tired by the noise and importunity of mankind When we questioned him in our turn he gave us all the information we required he then attended sedulously but without eagerness to our personal wants Whilst he was engaged in providing thus kindly for us how came it that in spit of ourselves we felt our gratitude die upon our lips It is that our host whilst he performs the duties of hospitality seems to be obeying an irksome necessity of his condition he treats it as a duty imposed upon him by his situation not as a pleasure By the side of the hearth sits a woman with a baby on her lap she nods to us without disturbing herself Like the pioneer this woman is in the prime of life her appearance would seem superior to her condition and her apparel even betrays a lingering taste for dress but her delicate limbs appear shrunken her features are drawn in her eye is mild and melancholy her whole physiognomy bears marks of a degree of religious resignation a deep quiet of all passions and some sort of natural and tranquil firmness ready to meet all the ills of life without fearing and without braving them Her children cluster about her full of health turbulence and energy they are true children of the wilderness their mother watches them from time to time with mingled melancholy and joy to look at their strength and her languor one might imagine that the life she has given them has exhausted her own and still she regrets not what they have cost her The house inhabited by these emigrants has no internal partition or loft In the one chamber of which it consists the whole family is gathered for the night The dwelling is itself a little world an ark of civilization amidst an ocean of foliage a hundred steps beyond it the primeval forest spreads its shades and solitude resumes its sway Appendix T It is not the equality of conditions which makes men immoral and irreligious but when men being equal are at the same time immoral and irreligious the effects of immorality and irreligion easily manifest themselves outwardly because men have but little influence upon each other and no class exists which can undertake to keep society in order Equality of conditions never engenders profligacy of morals but it sometimes allows that profligacy to show itself Appendix U Setting aside all those who do not think at all and those who dare not say what they think the immense majority of the Americans will still be found to appear satisfied with the political institutions by which they are governed and I believe really to be so I look upon this state of public opinion as an indication but not as a demonstration of the absolute excellence of American laws The pride of a nation the gratification of certain ruling passions by the law a concourse of circumstances defects which escape notice and more than all the rest the influence of a majority which shuts the mouth of all cavillers may long perpetuate the delusions of a people as well as those of a man Look at England throughout the eighteenth century No nation was ever more prodigal of self applause no people was ever more self satisfied then every part of its constitution was right everything even to its most obvious defects was irreproachable at the present day a vast number of Englishmen seem to have nothing better to do than to prove that this constitution was faulty in many respects Which was right the English people of the last century or the English people of the present day The same thing has occurred in France It is certain that during the reign of Louis XIV the great bulk of the nation was devotedly attached to the form of government which at that time governed the community But it is a vast error to suppose that there was anything degraded in the character of the French of that age There might be some sort of servitude in France at that time but assuredly there was no servile spirit among the people The writers of that age felt a species of genuine enthusiasm in extolling the power of their king and there was no peasant so obscure in his hovel as not to take a pride in the glory of his sovereign and to die cheerfully with the cry Vive le Roi upon his lips These very same forms of loyalty are now odious to the French people Which are wrong the French of the age of Louis XIV or their descendants of the present day Our judgment of the laws of a people must not then be founded Future Condition Of Three Races In The United States exclusively upon its inclinations since those inclinations change from age to age but upon more elevated principles and a more general experience The love which a people may show for its law proves only this that we should not be in too great a hurry to change them Appendix V In the chapter to which this note relates I have pointed out one source of danger I am now about to point out another kind of peril more rare indeed but far more formidable if it were ever to make its appearance If the love of physical gratification and the taste for well being which are naturally suggested to men by a state of equality were to get entire possession of the mind of a democratic people and to fill it completely the manners of the nation would become so totally opposed to military tastes that perhaps even the army would eventually acquire a love of peace in spite of the peculiar interest which leads it to desire war Living in the midst of a state of general relaxation the troops would ultimately think it better to rise without efforts by the slow but commodious advancement of a peace establishment than to purchase more rapid promotion at the cost of all the toils and privations of the field With these feelings they would take up arms without enthusiasm and use them without energy they would allow themselves to be led to meet the foe instead of marching to attack him It must not be supposed that this pacific state of the army would render it adverse to revolutions for revolutions and especially military revolutions which are generally very rapid are attended indeed with great dangers but not with protracted toil they gratify ambition at less cost than war life only is at stake and the men of democracies care less for their lives than for their comforts Nothing is more dangerous for the freedom and the tranquillity of a people than an army afraid of war because as such an army no longer seeks to maintain its importance and its influence on the field of battle it seeks to assert them elsewhere Thus it might happen that the men of whom a democratic army consists should lose the interests of citizens without acquiring the virtues of soldiers and that the army should cease to be fit for war without ceasing to be turbulent I shall here repeat what I have said in the text the remedy for these dangers is not to be found in the army but in the country a democratic people which has preserved the manliness of its character will never be at a loss for military prowess in its soldiers Appendix W Men connect the greatness of their idea of unity with means God with ends hence this idea of greatness as men conceive it leads us into infinite littleness To compel all men to follow the same course towards the same object is a human notion to introduce infinite variety of action but so combined that all these acts lead by a multitude of different courses to the accomplishment of one great design is a conception of the Deity The human idea of unity is almost always barren the divine idea pregnant with abundant results Men think they manifest their greatness by simplifying the means they use but it is the purpose of God which is simple his means are infinitely varied Appendix X A democratic people is not only led by its own tastes to centralize its government but the passions of all the men by whom it is governed constantly urge it in the same direction It may easily be foreseen that almost all the able and ambitious members of a democratic community will labor without two ceasing to extend the powers of government because they all hope at some time or other to wield those powers It is a waste of time to attempt to prove to them that extreme centralization may be injurious to the State since they are centralizing for their own benefit Amongst the public men of democracies there are hardly any but men of great disinterestedness or extreme mediocrity who seek to oppose the centralization of government the former are scarce the latter powerless Appendix Y I have often asked myself what would happen if amidst the relaxation of democratic manners and as a consequence of the restless spirit of the army a military government were ever to be founded amongst any of the nations of the present age I think that even such a government would not differ very much from the outline I have drawn in the chapter to which this note belongs and that it would retain none of the fierce characteristics of a military oligarchy I am persuaded that in such a case a sort of fusion would take place between the habits of official men and those of the military service The administration would assume something of a military character and the army some of the usages of the civil administration The result would be a regular clear exact and absolute system of government the people would become the reflection of the army and the community be drilled like a garrison Appendix Z It cannot be absolutely or generally affirmed that the greatest danger of the present age is license or tyranny anarchy or despotism Both are equally to be feared and the one may as easily proceed as the other from the selfsame cause namely that general apathy which is the consequence of what I have termed individualism it is because this apathy exists that the executive government having mustered a few troops is able to commit acts of oppression one day and the next day a party which has mustered some thirty men in its ranks can also commit acts of oppression Neither one nor the other can found anything to last and the causes which enable them to succeed easily prevent them from succeeding long they rise because nothing opposes them and they sink because nothing supports them The proper object therefore of our most strenuous resistance is far less either anarchy or despotism than the apathy which may almost indifferently beget either the one or the other Constitution Of The United States Of America We The People of the United States in Order to form a more perfect Union establish Justice insure domestic Tranquillity provide for
