three hundred twenty Index three hundred twenty nine PREFACE There were four of us pilgrims my Wife our Boy of ten and a half years the Doctor and I My object in going the others went for the outing was to gather local color for work in Western history The Ohio River was an important factor in the development of the West I wished to know the great waterway intimately in its various phases to see with my own eyes what the borderers saw in imagination to redress the pioneer stage and repeople it A motley company have here performed their parts Savages of the mound building age rearing upon these banks curious earthworks for archaeologists of the nineteenth century to puzzle over Iroquois war parties silently swooping upon sleeping villages of the Shawanese and in noisy glee returning to the New York lakes laden with spoils and captives La Salle prince of French explorers and coureurs de bois standing at the Falls of the Ohio and seeking to fathom the geographical mysteries of the continent French and English fur traders in bitter contention for the patronage of the red man borderers of the rival nations shedding each other s blood in protracted partisan wars surveyors like Washington and Boone and the McAfees clad in fringed hunting shirts and leathern leggings mapping out future states hardy frontiersmen fighting hunting or farming as occasion demanded George Rogers Clark descending the river with his handful of heroic Virginians to win for the United States the great Northwest and for himself the laurels of fame the Marietta pilgrims beating Revolutionary swords into Ohio plowshares and all that succeeding tide of immigrants from our own Atlantic coast and every corner of Europe pouring down the great valley to plant powerful commonwealths beyond the mountains A richly varied panorama of life passes before us as we contemplate the glowing story of the Ohio In making our historical pilgrimage we might more easily have steamboated the river to use a verb in local vogue but from the deck of a steamer scenes take on a different aspect than when viewed from near the level of the flood for a passenger by such a craft the vistas of a winding stream change so rapidly that he does not realize how it seemed to the canoeist or flatboatman of old and there are too many modern distractions about such a mode of progress To our minds the manner of our going should as nearly as possible be that of the pioneer himself hence our skiff and our nightly camp in primitive fashion The trip was successful whatever the point of view Physically those six weeks Afloat on the Ohio were a model outing at times rough to be sure but exhilarating health giving brain inspiring The Log of the Pilgrim seeks faintly to outline our experiences but no words can adequately describe the wooded hill slopes which day by day girt us in the romantic ravines which corrugate the rim of the Ohio s basin the beautiful islands which stud the glistening tide the great affluents which winding down for a thousand miles from the Blue Ridge the Cumberland and the Great Smoky pour their floods into the central stream the giant trees sycamores pawpaws cork elms catalpas walnuts and what not which everywhere are in view in this woodland world the strange and lovely flowers we saw the curious people we met black and white and the varieties of dialect which caught our ear the details of our charming gypsy life ashore and afloat during which we were conscious of the red blood tingling through our veins and alert to the whisperings of Nature were careless of the workaday world so far away simply glad to be alive For the better understanding of the numerous historical references in the Log I have thought it well to present in the Appendix a brief sketch of the settlement of the Ohio Valley To this Appendix as a preliminary reading I invite those who may care to follow Pilgrim and her crew upon their long journey from historic Redstone down to the Father of Waters A selected list of Journals of previous travelers down the Ohio has been added for the benefit of students of the social and economic history of this important gateway to the continental interior R G T Madison Wis October eighteen ninety seven AFLOAT ON THE OHIO CHAPTER I On the Monongahela The over mountain path Redstone Old Fort The Youghiogheny Braddock s defeat In camp near Charleroi Pa Friday May four Pilgrim built for the glassy lakes and smooth flowing rivers of Wisconsin had suffered unwonted indignities in her rough journey of a thousand miles in a box car But beyond a leaky seam or two which the Doctor had righted with clouts and putty and some ugly scratches which were only paint deep she was in fair trim as she gracefully lay at the foot of the Brownsville shipyard this morning and received her lading There were spectators in abundance Brownsville in the olden day had seen many an expedition set out from this spot for the grand tour of the Ohio but not in the personal recollection of any in this throng of idlers for the era of the flatboat and pirogue now belongs to history Our expedition is a revival and therein lies novelty However the historic spirit was not evident among our visitors railway men coal miners loafing out the duration of a strike shipyard hands lying in wait for busier times small boys blessed with as much leisure as curiosity and that wonder of wonders a bashful newspaper reporter Their chief concern centered in the query how Pilgrim could hold that goodly heap of luggage and still have room to spare for four passengers It became evident that her capacity is akin to that of the magician s bag A dandy skiff gents said the foreman of the shipyard as we settled into our seats the Doctor bow I stroke with W and the Boy in the stern sheets Having in silence critically watched us for a half hour seated on a capstan his red flannel shirt rolled up to his elbows and well corded chest and throat bared to wind and weather this remark of the foreman was evidently the studied judgment of an expert It was taken as such by the good natured crowd which as we pushed off into the stream lustily joined in a chorus of Good bye and Good luck to yees an ye don t git th missus drowndid fore ye git to Cairo The current is slight on these lower reaches of the Monongahela It comes down gayly enough from the West Virginia hills over many a rapid and through swirls and eddies in plenty until Morgantown is reached and then settling into a more sedate course is at Brownsville finally converted into a mere mill pond by the back set of the four slack water dams between there and Pittsburg This means solid rowing for the first sixty miles of our journey with a current scarcely perceptible The thought of it suggests lunch At the mouth of Redstone Creek a mile below Dunlap Creek our port of departure we turn in to a shaly beach at the foot of a wooded slope in semi rusticity and fortify the inner man A famous spot this Redstone Creek Between its mouth and that of Dunlap s was made upon the site of extensive Indian fortification mounds the first English agricultural settlement west of the Alleghanies It is unsafe to establish dates for first discoveries or for first settlements The wanderers who first of all white men penetrated the fastnesses of the wilderness were mostly of the sort who left no documentary traces behind them It is probable however that the first Redstone settlement was made as early as seventeen fifty the year following the establishment of the Ohio Company which had been chartered by the English crown and given a half million acres of land west of the mountains and south of the Ohio River provided it established thereon a hundred families within seven years Redstone Old Fort the name had reference to the aboriginal earthworks played a part in the Fort Necessity and Braddock campaigns and in later frontier wars and being the western terminus of the over mountain road known at various historic periods as Nemacolin s Path Braddock s Road and Cumberland Pike was for many years the chief point of departure for Virginia expeditions down the Ohio River Washington who had large landed interests on the Ohio knew Redstone well and here George Rogers Clark set out seventeen seventy eight upon flatboats with his rough and ready Virginia volunteers to capture the country north of the Ohio for the American arms one of the least known but most momentous conquests in history Early in the nineteenth century Redstone became Brownsville But whether as Redstone or Brownsville it was in its day like most jumping off places on the edge of civilization a veritable Sodom Wrote good old John Pope in his Journal of seventeen ninety and in the same strain scores of other veracious chroniclers At this Place we were detained about a Week experiencing every Disgust which Rooks and Harpies could excite Here thrived extensive yards in which were built flatboats arks keel boats and all that miscellaneous collection of water craft which with their roisterly crews were the life of the Ohio before the introduction of steam rendered vessels of deeper draught essential whereupon much of the shipping business went down the river to better stages of water first to Pittsburg thence to Wheeling and to Steubenville All that is of the past Brownsville is still a busy corner of the world though of a different sort with all its romance gone To the student of Western history Brownsville will always be a shrine albeit a smoky dusty shrine with the smell of lubricators and the clang of hammers and much talk thereabout of the glories of Mammon The Monongahela is a characteristic mountain trough From an altitude of four or five hundred feet the country falls in sharp steeps to a narrow alluvial bench and then a broad beach of shale and pebble the slopes are broken here and there where deep shadowy ravines come winding down bearing muddy contributions to the greater flood The higher hills are crowned with forest trees the lower ofttimes checkered with brown fields recently planted and rows of vines trimmed low to stakes as in the fashion of the Rhine The stream though still majestic in its sweep is henceforth a commercial slack water lined with noisy grimy matter of fact manufacturing towns for the most part literally abutting one upon the other all of the way down to Pittsburg and fast defiling the once picturesque banks with the gruesome offal of coal mines and iron plants Surprising is the density of settlement along the river Often four or five full fledged cities are at once in view from our boat the air is thick with sooty smoke belched from hundreds of stacks the ear is almost deafened with the whirr and roar and bang of milling industries Tipples of bituminous coal shafts are ever in sight begrimed scaffolds of wood and iron arranged for dumping the product of the mines into both barges and railway cars Either bank is lined with railways in sight of which we shall almost continually float all the way down to Cairo nearly eleven hundred miles away At each tipple is a miners hamlet a row of cottages or huts cast in a common mold either unpainted or bedaubed with that cheap ugly red with which one is familiar in railway bridges and rural barns Sometimes these huts though in the mass dreary enough are kept in neat repair but often are they sadly out of elbows pigs and children promiscuously at their doors paneless sash stuffed with rags unsightly litter strewn around misery stamped on every feature of the homeless tenements Dreariest of all is a deserted mining village and there are many such the shaft having been worked out or an unquenchable subterranean fire left to smolder in neglect Here the tipple has fallen into creaking decrepitude the cabins are without windows or doors these having been taken to some newer hamlet ridge poles are sunken chimneys tottering soot covers the gaunt bones which for all the world are like a row of skeletons perched high and grinning down at you in their misery while the black offal of the pit covering deep the original beauty of the once green slope is in its turn being veiled with climbing weeds such is Nature s haste when untrammeled to heal the scars wrought by man A mile or two below Charleroi is Lock No four the first of the quartet of obstructions between Brownsville and Pittsburg We are encamped a mile below the dam in a cozy little willowed nook a rod behind our ample tent rises the face of an alluvial terrace occupied by a grain field running back for an hundred yards to the hills at the base of which is a railway track Across the river here some two hundred and fifty yards wide the dark rocky bluffs slashed with numerous ravines ascend sharply from the flood at the quarried base a wagon road and the customary railway and upon the stony beach two or three rough shelter tents housing the Black Diamond Brass Band of Monongahela City out on a week s picnic to while away the period of the strike It was seven o clock when we struck camp and our frugal repast was finished by lantern light The sun sets early in this narrow trough through the foothills of the Laurel range McKeesport Pa Saturday May fifth Out there on the beach near Charleroi with the sail for an awning Pilgrim had been converted into a boudoir for the Doctor who snuggled in his sleeping bag emitted an occasional snore echoes from the Land of Nod W and our Boy of ten summers on their canvas folding cots were peacefully oblivious of the noises of the night and needed the kiss of dawn to rouse them But for me always a light sleeper and as yet unused to our airy bedroom the crickets chirruped through the long watches Two or three freighters passed in the night with monotonous swish swish and swelling wake It arouses something akin to awe this passage of a steamer s wake upon the beach a dozen feet from the door of one s tent First the water is sucked down leaving for a moment a wet streak of sand or gravel a dozen feet in width in quick succession come heavy booming waves running at an acute angle with the shore breaking at once into angry foam and wasting themselves far up on the strand for a few moments making bedlam with any driftwood which chances to have made lodgment there When suddenly awakened by this boisterous turmoil the first thought is that a dam has broken and a flood is at hand but by the time you rise upon your elbow the scurrying uproar lessens and gradually dies away along a more distant shore We were slow in getting off this morning But the dense fog had been loath to lift and at first the stove smoked badly until we discovered and removed the source of trouble This stove is an ingenious contrivance of the Doctor s a box of sheet iron of slight weight so arranged as to be folded into an incredibly small space a vast improvement for cooking purposes over an open camp fire which Pilgrim s crew know from long experience in far distant fields to be a vexation to eyes and soul Coaling hamlets more or less deserted were frequent this morning unpainted windowless ragged wrecks At the inhabited mining villages either close to the strand or well up on hillside ledges idle men were everywhere about Women and boys and girls were stockingless and shoeless and often dirty to a degree But when conversed with we found them independent respectful and self respecting folk Occasionally I would for the mere sake of meeting these workaday brothers of ours with canteen slung on shoulder climb the steep flight of stairs cut in the clay bank and on reaching the terrace inquire for drinking water talking familiarly with the folk who came to meet me at the well curb There are old fashioned Dutch ovens in nearly every yard a few chickens and often a shed for the cow that is off on her daily climb over the neighboring hills Through the black pall of shale a few vegetables struggle feebly to the light in the corners of the palings are hollyhocks and four o clocks and on window sills rows of battered tin cans resplendent in blue and yellow labels are the homes of verbenas and geraniums in sickly bloom Now and then a back door in the dreary block is distinguished by an arbored trellis bearing a grape vine and furnishing for the weary housewife a shady kitchen al fresco As a rule however there is little attempt to better the homeless shelter furnished by the corporation We restocked with provisions at Monongahela City a smart newish town and at Elizabeth old and dingy It was at Elizabeth then Elizabethtown that travelers from the Eastern States over the old Philadelphia Road chiefly took boat for the Ohio the Virginians still clinging to Redstone as the terminus of the Braddock Road Elizabethtown in flatboat days was the seat of a considerable boat building industry its yards in time turning out steamboats for the New Orleans trade and even sea going sailing craft but to day coal barges are the principal output of her decaying shipyards By this time the duties of our little ship s company are well defined W supervises the cuisine most important of all offices the Doctor is chief navigator assistant cook and hewer of wood it falls to my lot to purchase supplies to be carrier of water to pitch tent and make beds and while breakfast is being cooked to dismantle the camp and so far as may be to repack Pilgrim the Boy collects driftwood wipes dishes and helps at what he can while all hands row or paddle through the livelong day as whim or need dictates Lock No three at Walton necessitated a portage of the load over the left bank It is a steep rocky climb and the descent on the lower side strewn with stone chips destructive to shoe leather The Doctor and I let Pilgrim herself down with a long rope over a shallow spot in the apron of the dam At six o clock a camping ground for the night became desirable We were fortunate last evening to find a bit of rustic country in which to pitch our tent but all through this afternoon both banks of the river were lined with village after village city after city scarcely a garden patch between them Wilson Coal Valley Lostock Glassport Dravosburg and a dozen others not recorded on our map which bears date of eighteen eighty two The sun was setting behind the rim of the river basin when we reached the broad mouth of the Youghiogheny pr Yock i o gai ny which is implanted with a cluster of iron mill towns of which McKeesport is the center So far as we could see down the Monongahela the air was thick with the smoke of glowing chimneys and the pulsating whang of steel making plants and rolling mills made the air tremble The view up the Yough was more inviting so with oars and paddle firmly set we turned off our course and lustily pulled against the strong current of the tributary A score or two of house boats lay tied to the McKeesport shore or were bolstered high upon the beach a fleet of Yough steamers had their noses to the wharf a half dozen fishermen were setting nets and high over all with lofty spans of iron cobweb several railway and wagon bridges spanned the gliding stream It was a mile and a half up the Yough before we reached the open country and then only the rapidly gathering dusk drove us ashore for on near approach the prospect was not pleasing Finally settling into this damp shallow pocket in the shelving bank we find broad girthed elms and maples screening us from all save the river front the high bank in the rear fringed with blue violets which emit a delicious odor backed by a field of waving corn stretching off toward heavily wooded hills Our supper cooked and eaten by lantern light we vote ourselves as after all serenely content out here in the starlight at peace with the world and very close to Nature s heart There come to us on the cool evening breeze faint echoes of the never ceasing clang of McKeesport iron mills down on the Monongahela shore But it is not of these we talk lounging in the welcome warmth of the camp fire it is of the age of romance a hundred and forty odd years ago when Major Washington and Christopher Gist with famished horses floundered in the ice hereabout upon their famous midwinter trip to Fort Le Boeuf when the Forks of the Yough became the extreme outpost of Western advance with all the accompanying horrors of frontier war and later when McKeesport for a time rivaled Redstone and Elizabethtown as a center for boat building and a point of departure for the Ohio Pittsburg Sunday May sixth Many of the trees are already in full leaf The trillium is fading We are in the full tide of early summer up here in the mountains and our long journey of six weeks is southward and toward the plain The lower Ohio may soon be a bake oven and the middle of June will be upon us before far away Cairo is reached It behooves us to be up and doing The river flowing by our door is an ever pressing invitation to be onward it stops not for Sunday nor ever stops and why should we mere drift upon the passing tide There was a smart thunder shower during breakfast followed by a cool cloudy morning At eleven o clock Pilgrim was laden A south eastern breeze ruffled the waters of the Yough and for the first time the Doctor ordered up the sail with W at the sheet It was not long before Pilgrim had the water singing at her prow With a rush we flew past the factories the house boats and the shabby street ends of McKeesport out into the Monongahela where luckily the wind still held At McKeesport the hills on the right are of a relatively low altitude smooth and well rounded It was here that Braddock in his slow progress toward Fort Duquesne first crossed the Monongahela to the wide level bottom on the left bank He had found the inner country to the right of the river and below the Yough too rough and hilly for his march hence had turned back toward the Monongahela fording the river to take advantage of the less difficult bottom Some four miles below this first crossing hills reapproach the left bank till the bottom ceases the right thenceforth becomes the more favorable side for marching With great pomp he recrossed the Monongahela just below the point where Turtle Creek enters from the east Within a hillside ravine but a hundred yards inland the brilliant column fell into an ambuscade of Indians and French half breeds suffering that heart sickening defeat which will ever live as one of the most tragic events in American history The noisy iron manufacturing town of Braddock now occupies the site of Braddock s defeat Not far from the old ford stretches the great dam of Lock No two which we portaged with the usual difficulties of steep stony banks Braddock is but eight miles across country from Pittsburg although twelve by river We have all the way down an almost constant succession of iron and steel making towns chief among them Homestead on the left bank seven miles above Pittsburg The great strike of July eighteen ninety two with its attendant horrors is a lurid chapter in the story of American industry With shuddering interest we view the famous great bank of ugly slag at the base of the steel mills where the barges housing the Pinkerton guards were burned by the mob To day the Homesteaders are enjoying their Sunday afternoon outing along the town shore nurses pushing baby carriages self absorbed lovers holding hands upon riverside benches merry makers rowing in skiffs or crossing the river in crowded ferries the electric cars following either side of the stream as far down as Pittsburg crowded to suffocation with gayly attired folk They look little like rioters yet it seems but the other day when Homestead men and women and children were hysterically reveling in atrocities akin to those of the Paris commune Approaching Pittsburg the high steeps are everywhere crowded with houses great masses of smoke color dotted all over with white shades and sparkling windows which seem in the gray afternoon to be ten thousand eyes coldly staring down at Pilgrim and her crew from all over the flanking hillsides Lock No one the last barrier between us and the Ohio is a mile or two up the Monongahela with warehouses and manufacturing plants closely hemming it in on either side A portage unaided appears to be impossible here and we resolve to lock through But it is Sunday and the lock is closed Above a dozen down going steamboats are moored to the shore waiting for midnight and the resumption of business while below a similar line of ascending boats is awaiting the close of the day of rest Pilgrim however cannot hang up at the levee with any comfort to her crew it is necessary with evening at hand and a thunder storm angrily rising over the Pittsburg hills to get out of this grimy pool flanked about with iron and coal yards chimney stacks and a forest of shipping and to quickly seek the open country lower down on the Ohio The lock keepers appreciated our situation Two or three sturdy courteous men helped us carry our cargo by an intricate official route over coils of rope and chains over lines of shafting and along dizzy walks overhanging the yawning basin while the Doctor directed to a certain chute in midstream took unladen Pilgrim over the great dam with a wild swoop which made our eyes swim to witness from the lock We had laboriously been rowing on slack water all the way from Brownsville with the help of an hour s sail this morning whereas now that we were in the strong current below the dam we had but to gently paddle to glide swiftly on our way A hundred steamers more or less lay closely packed with their bows upon the right or principal city wharf It was raining at last and we donned our storm wraps No doubt yellow Pilgrim thought hereabout to be a frail craft for these waters her crew all poncho clad slipping silently through the dark water swishing at their sterns was a novelty to the steamboat men for they leaned lazily over their railings the officers on the upper deck engineers and roustabouts on the lower and watched us curiously Our period of elation was brief Black storm clouds jagged and portentous were scurrying across the sky and by the time we had reached the forks where the Monongahela in the heart of the city joins forces with the Alleghany Pilgrim was being buffeted about on a chop sea produced by cross currents and a northwest gale She can weather an ordinary storm but this experience was too much for her When a passing steamer threw out long lines of frothy waves to add to the disturbance they broke over our gunwales and W with the coffee pot and the Boy with a tin basin were hard pushed to keep the water below the thwarts Seeking the friendly shelter of a house boat of which there were scores tied to the left bank we trusted our drenched luggage to the care of its proprietor placed Pilgrim in a snug harbor hard by and hurrying up a steep flight of steps leading from the levee to the terrace above found a suburban hotel just as its office clock struck eight Across the Ohio through the blinding storm the dark outlines of Pittsburg and Allegheny City are spangled with electric lamps which throw toward us long shimmering lances of light in which the mighty stream gray mysterious tempest tossed is seen to be surging onward with majestic sweep Upon its bosom we are to be borne for a thousand miles Our introduction has been unpropitious it is to be hoped that on further acquaintance we may be better pleased with La Belle Riviere CHAPTER II First day on the Ohio At Logstown Beaver River Monday May seventh We have to day rowed and paddled under a cloudless sky but in the teeth of frequent squalls with heavy waves freely dashing their spray upon us At such times a goodly current aided by numerous wing dams appears of little avail for when we rested upon our oars Pilgrim would be unmercifully driven up stream Thus it has been an almost continual fight to make progress and our five and twenty miles represent a hard day s work We were overloaded that was certain so we stopped at Chartier three miles down the river from Pittsburg and sent on our portly bag of conventional traveling clothes by express to Cincinnati where we intend stopping for a day This leaves us in our rough boating costumes for all the smaller towns en route What we may lose in possible social embarrassments we gain in lightened cargo Here at the mouth of Chartier s Creek was Chartier s Old Town of a century and a third ago a straggling unkempt Indian village then but at least the banks were lovely and the rolling distances clothed with majestic trees To day these creek banks connected with numerous iron bridges are the dumping ground for cinders slag rubbish of every degree of foulness the bare hillsides are crowded with the ugly dwellings of iron workers the atmosphere is thick with smoke Washington one of the greatest land speculators of his time owned over thirty two thousand acres along the Ohio He held a patent from Lord Dunmore dated July five seventeen seventy five for nearly three thousand acres lying about the mouth of this stream In accordance with the free and easy habit of trans Alleghany pioneers ten men squatted on the tract greatly to the indignation of the Father of his Country who in seventeen eighty four brought against them a successful suit for ejectment Twelve years later more familiar with this than with most of his land grants he sold it to a friend for twelve thousand dollars Just below Chartier are the picturesque McKee s Rocks where is the first riffle in the Ohio We take it with a swoop the white capped waves dancing about us in a miniature rapid Then we are in the open country and for the first time find what the great river is like The character of the banks for some distance below Pittsburg differs from that of the Monongahela The hills are lower less precipitous more graceful There is a delightful roundness of mass and shade Beautiful villas occupy commanding situations on hillsides and hilltops we catch glimpses of spires and cupolas singly or in groups peeping above the trees and now and then a pretty suburban railway station The railways upon either bank are built on neat terraces and far from marring the scene agreeably give life to it now and then three such terraces are to be traced one above the other against the dark background of wood and field the lower and upper devoted to rival railway lines the central one to the common way The mouths of the beautiful tributary ravines are crossed either by graceful iron spans which frame charming undercut glimpses of sparkling waterfalls and deep tangles of moss and fern or by graceful stone arches draped with vines There are terraced vineyards after the fashion of the Rhineland and the gentle arts of the florist and the truck gardener are much in evidence The winding river frequently sweeps at the base of rocky escarpments but upon one side or the other there are now invariably bottom lands narrow on these upper reaches but we shall find them gradually widen and lengthen as we descend The reaches are from four to seven miles in length but these too are to lengthen in the middle waters Islands are frequent all day The largest is Neville s five miles long and thickly strewn with villas and market gardens still others are but long sandbars grown to willows and but temporarily in sight for the stage of water is low just now not over seven feet in the channel Emerging from the immediate suburbs of Pittsburg the fields broaden farmsteads are occasionally to be seen nestled in the undulations of the hills woodlands become more dense There are however small rustic towns in plenty we are seldom out of sight of these Climbing a steep clay slope on the left bank we visited one of them Shousetown fourteen miles below the city A sad eyed shabby place with the pipe line for natural gas sprawling hither and yon upon the surface of the ground except at the street crossings where a few inches of protecting earth have been laid upon it The tariff levied by the gas company is ten cents per month for each light and a dollar and a half for a cook stove We passed this afternoon one of the most interesting historic points upon the river the picturesque site of ancient Logstown upon the summit of a low steep ridge on the right bank just below Economy and eighteen miles from Pittsburg Logstown was a Shawanese village as early as seventeen twenty seven thirty and already a notable fur trading post when Conrad Weiser visited it in seventeen forty eight Washington and Gist stopped at Loggestown for five days on their visit to the French at Fort Le Boeuf and several famous Indian treaties were signed there A short distance below Anthony Wayne s Western army was encamped during the winter of seventeen ninety two ninety three the place being then styled Legionville In eighteen twenty four George Rapp founded in the neighborhood a German socialist community and this later settlement survives to the present day in the thriving little rustic town of Economy At four o clock we struck camp on a heavily willowed shore at the apex of the great northern bend of the Ohio twenty five miles A Across the river on a broad level bottom are the manufacturing towns of Rochester and Beaver divided by the Beaver River in their rear well rounded hills rise gracefully checkered with brown fields and woods in many shades of green in the midst of which the flowering white dogwood rears its stately spray Our sloping willowed sand beach of a hundred feet in width is thick strewn with driftwood back of this a clay bank eight feet sheer and a narrow bottom cut up with small fruit and vegetable patches the gardeners neat frame houses peeping from groves of apple pear and cherry upon the flanking hillsides A lofty oil well derrick surmounts the edge of the terrace a hundred yards below our camp The bushes and the ground round about the well are black and slimy with crude petroleum that has escaped during the boring process and the air is heavy with its odor We are upon the edge of the far stretching oil and gas well region and shall soon become familiar enough with such sights and smells in the neighborhood of our nightly camps No sooner had Pilgrim been turned up against a tree to dry and a smooth sandy open chosen for the camp than the proprietor of the soil appeared a middling sized lanky man with a red face and a sandy goatee surmounting a collarless white shirt all bestained with tobacco juice He inquired rather sharply concerning us but when informed of our innocent errand and that we should stay with him but the night he promptly softened explaining that the presence of marauding fishermen and house boat folk was incompatible with gardening for profit and he would have none of them touch upon his shore As to us we were welcome to stop throughout our pleasure an invitation he reinforced by sitting upon a stump whittling vigorously meanwhile and glibly gossiping with the Doctor and me for a half hour on crop

7247_94108_000003_000002	train-clean-360	But the smaller sister town of Beaver on the lower side of the mouth or rather the western outskirts of Beaver a mile below the mouth has the most ancient history 
7247_94108_000003_000003	train-clean-360	On account of a ford across the Beaver about where is now a slack water dam the neighborhood became of early importance to the French as a fur trading center 
none	none	With customary liberality toward the Indians whom they assiduously cultivated the French in seventeen fifty six built for them on this site a substantial town which the English indifferently called Sarikonk Sohkon King Beaver s Town or Shingis Old Town 
7247_94108_000003_000005	train-clean-360	During the French and Indian War the place was prominent as a rendezvous for the enemies of American borderers numerous bloody forays were planned here and hither were brought to be adopted into the tribes or to be cruelly tortured according to savage whim many of the captives whose tales have made lurid the history of the Ohio Valley 
none	none	Passing Beaver River the Ohio enters upon its grand sweep to the southwest 
7247_94108_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The wide uplands at once become more rustic especially those of the left bank which no longer is threaded by a railway as heretofore all the way from Brownsville 
7247_94108_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The two ranges of undulating hills some three hundred and fifty feet high forming the rim of the basin are about a half mile apart while the river itself is perhaps a third of a mile in width leaving narrow bottoms on alternate sides as the stream in gentle curves rebounds from the rocky base of one hill to that of another 
7247_94108_000004_000003	train-clean-360	When winding about such a base there is at this stage of the water a sloping stony beach some ten to twenty yards in width from which ascends the sharp steep for the most part heavily tree clad maples birches elms and oaks of goodly girth the latter as yet in but half leaf 
7247_94108_000004_000004	train-clean-360	On the bottom side of the river the alluvial terrace presents a sheer wall of clay rising from eight to a dozen feet above the beach which is often thick grown with willows whose roots hold the soil from becoming too easy a prey to the encroaching current 
7247_94108_000004_000005	train-clean-360	Sycamores now begin to appear in the bottoms although of less size than we shall meet below 
7247_94108_000004_000006	train-clean-360	Sometimes the little towns we see occupy a narrow and more or less rocky bench upon the hill side of the stream but settlement is chiefly found upon the bottoms 
7247_94108_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Shippingsport thirty two miles on the left bank where we stopped this noon for eggs butter and fresh water is on a narrow hill bench a dry woe begone hamlet side tracked from the path of the world s progress While I was on shore negotiating with the sleepy storekeeper Pilgrim and her crew waited alongside the flatboat which serves as the town ferry 
none	none	There they were visited by a breezy red faced young man in a blue flannel shirt and a black slouch hat who was soon enough at his ease to lie flat upon the ferry gunwale his cheeks supported by his hands and talk to W and the Doctor as if they were old friends He was a dealer in nitroglycerin cartridges he said and pointed to a long rakish looking skiff hard by which bore a red flag at its prow Ye see that Thet there red flag Well thet s the law on us glyser een fellers over five hundred poun s two flags un er five hundred one flag I ve two hundred and fifty I have I tell yer th steamboats steer clear o me an don yer fergit it neither they jist give me a wide berth they do yew bet n th railroads they don carry no glyser een cartridge they don t all uv it by skiff like yer see me goin 
7247_94108_000006_000000	train-clean-360	These cartridges he explained are dropped into oil or gas wells whose owners are desirous of accelerating the flow 
7247_94108_000006_000001	train-clean-360	The cartridge in exploding enlarges the hole and often the output of the well is at once increased by several hundred per cent 
7247_94108_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The young fellow had the air of a self confident rustic with little experience in the world Indeed it seemed from his elated manner as if this might be his first trip from home and the blowing of oil wells an incidental speculation 
none	none	The Boy quick at inventive nomenclature and fresh from a reading of Robert Louis Stevenson called our visitor the Dynamiter and by that title I suppose we shall always remember him The Dynamiter confided to his listeners that he was going down the river for a clean hundred miles and that s right smart fur ain t it How fur down be yees goin The Doctor replied that we were going nine hundred whereat the man of explosives gave vent to his feelings in a prolonged whistle then a horse laugh and Oh come now Don be givin us taffy Say hones Injun how fur down air yew fellers goin anyhow 
7247_94108_000007_000005	train-clean-360	It was with some difficulty that he could comprehend the fact 
7247_94108_000007_000006	train-clean-360	A hundred miles on the river was a great outing for this village lad nine hundred was rather beyond his comprehension although he finally compromised by allowing that we might be going as far as Cincinnati 
7247_94108_000007_000007	train-clean-360	Wouldn t the Doctor go into partnership with him 
none	none	He had no caps for his cartridges and if the Doctor would buy caps and stan in with him on the cost of the glyser een they would regardless of Ohio statutes blow up the fish in unfrequented portions of the river and make two hundred dollars apiece by carrying the spoils in to Wheeling The Doctor as a law abiding citizen good naturedly declined and upon my return to the flat the Dynamiter was handing the Boy a huge stick of barber pole candy saying Well yew fellers we ll part friends anyhow but sorry yew won t go in on this spec there s right smart money in t n don yer fergit it 
7247_94108_000008_000000	train-clean-360	By the middle of the afternoon we reached the boundary line forty miles between Pennsylvania on the east and Ohio and West Virginia on the west 
none	none	The last Pennsylvania settlements are a half mile above the boundary Smith s Ferry right an old and somewhat decayed village on a broad low bottom at the mouth of the picturesque Little Beaver Creek A and Georgetown left a prosperous looking sedate town with tidy lawns running down to the edge of the terrace below which is a shelving stone beach of generous width 
7247_94108_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Two high iron towers supporting the cable of a current ferry add dignity to the twin settlements 
7247_94108_000008_000003	train-clean-360	A stone monument six feet high just observable through the willows on the right shore marks the boundary while upon the left bank surmounting a high rock strewn beach is the dilapidated frame house of a West Virginia cracker through whose garden patch the line takes its way unobserved and unthought of by pigs chickens and children which in hopeless promiscuity swarm the interstate premises 
7247_94108_000009_000000	train-clean-360	For many days to come we are to have Ohio on the right bank and West Virginia on the left 
7247_94108_000009_000001	train-clean-360	There is no perceptible change of course in the contour of the rugged hills which hem us in yet somehow it stirs the blood to reflect that quite within the recollection of all of us in Pilgrim s crew save the Boy that left bank was the house of bondage and that right the land of freedom and this river of ours the highway between 
7247_94108_000010_000000	train-clean-360	East Liverpool forty four miles and Wellsville forty eight miles are long stretches of pottery and tile making works both of them on the Ohio shore There is nothing there to lure us however and we determined to camp on the banks of Yellow Creek fifty one miles a peaceful little Ohio stream some two rods in width its mouth crossed by two great iron spans for railway and highway 
7247_94108_000010_000001	train-clean-360	But although Yellow Creek winds most gracefully and is altogether a charming bit of rustic water deep set amid picturesque slopes of field and wood we fail to find upon its banks an appropriate camping place 
none	none	Upon one side a country road closely skirts the shore and on the other a railway while for the mile or more we pushed along small farmsteads almost abutted Hence we retrace our path to the great river and dropping down stream for two miles find what we seek upon the lower end of the chief of Kneistly s Cluster two islands on the West Virginia side of the channel

7247_94108_000011_000002	train-clean-360	The tragedy is interwoven with the history of the trans Alleghany border and schoolboys have in many lands and tongues recited the pathetic defense of the poor Mingo who more sinned against than sinning was crushed in the inevitable struggle between savagery and civilization Who is there to mourn for Logan

7247_94108_000012_000004	train-clean-360	There is a gentle tinkling of cowbells on the Ohio shore and on both are human voices confused by distance

Meadows seventeen fifty four CHAPTER IV An industrial region Steubenville Mingo Bottom In a steel mill Indian character Mingo Junction Ohio Wednesday May ninth We had a cold night upon our island Upon arising this morning a heavy fog enveloped us at first completely veiling the sun soon it became faintly visible a great ball of burnished copper reflected in the dimpled flood which poured between us and the Ohio shore Weeds and willows were sopping wet as was also our wash and the breakfast fire was a comfortable companion But by the time we were off the cloud had lifted and the sun gushed out with promise of a warm day Throughout the morning Pilgrim glided through a thickly settled district reminding us of the Monongahela Sewer pipe and vitrified brick works and iron and steel plants abound on the narrow bottoms The factories and mills themselves generally wear a prosperous look but the dependent towns vary in appearance from clusters of shabby down at the heel cabins to lines of neat and well painted houses and shops We visited the vitrified brick works at New Cumberland W Va fifty six miles where the proprietor kindly explained his methods and talked freely of his business It was the old story too close a competition for profit although the use of brick pavements is fast spreading Fire clay available for the purpose is abundant on the banks of the Ohio all the way from Pittsburg to Kingston sixty miles A few miles below New Cumberland on the Ohio shore we inspected the tile works at Freeman and admired the dexterity which the workmen had attained But what interested us most of all was the appalling havoc which these clay and iron industries are making with the once beautiful banks of the river Each of them has a large daily output of debris which is dumped unmercifully upon the water s edge in heaps from fifty to a hundred feet high Sometimes for nearly a mile in length the natural bank is deep buried out of sight and we have from our canoe naught but a dismal wall of rubbish crowding upon the river to the uttermost limit of governmental allowance Fifty years hence if these enterprises multiply at the present ratio and continue their present methods the Upper Ohio will roll between continuous banks of clay and iron offal down to Wheeling and beyond Before noon we had left behind us this industrial region and were again in rustic surroundings The wind had gone down the atmosphere was oppressively warm the sun s reflection from the glassy stream came with almost scalding effect upon our faces We had rigged an awning over some willow hoops but it could not protect us from this reflection For an hour or two one may as well be honest we fairly sweltered upon our pilgrimage until at last a light breeze ruffled the water and brought blessed relief The hills are not as high as hitherto and are more broken Yet they have a certain majestic sweep and for the most part are forest mantled from base to summit Between them the river winds with noble grace continually giving us fresh vistas often of surpassing loveliness The bottoms are broader now and frequently semicircular with fine farms upon them and prosperous villages nestled in generous groves Many of the houses betoken age or what passes for it in this relatively new country being of the colonial pattern with fan shaped windows above the doors Grecian pillars flanking the front porch and wearing the air of comfortable respectability Beautiful islands lend variety to the scene some of them mere willowed tow heads largely submerged in times of flood while others are of a permanent character often occupied by farms We have with us a copy of Cuming s Western Pilot Cincinnati eighteen thirty four which is still a practicable guide for the Ohio as the river s shore lines are not subject to so rapid changes as those of the Mississippi but many of the islands in Cuming s are not now to be found having been swept away in floods and we encounter few new ones It is clear that the islands are not so numerous as sixty years ago The present works of the United States Corps of Engineers tend to permanency in the status quo doubtless the government map of eighteen eighty one will remain an authoritative chart for a half century or more to come W s enthusiasm for botany frequently takes us ashore Landing at the foot of some eroded steep which with ragged charm rises sharply from the gravelly beach we fasten Pilgrim s painter to a stone and go scrambling over the hillside in search of flowers bearing in mind the Boy s constant plea to Get only one of a kind and leave the rest for seed for other travelers may come this way and tis a sin indeed to exterminate a botanical rarity But we find no rarities to day only solomon s seal trillium wild ginger cranebill jack in the pulpit wild columbine Poison ivy is on every hand in these tangled woods with ferns of many varieties chiefly maidenhair walking leaf and bladder The view from projecting rocks in these lofty places is ever inspiring the country spread out below us as in a relief map the great glistening river winding through its hilly trough a rumpled country for a few miles on either side gradually trending into broad plains checkered with fields on which farmsteads and rustic villages are the chessmen At one o clock we were at Steubenville Ohio sixty seven miles where the broad stoned wharf leads sharply up to the smart well built substantial town of some sixteen thousand inhabitants W and I had some shopping to do there while the Doctor and the Boy remained down at the inevitable wharf boat and gossiped with the philosophical agent who bemoaned the decadence of steamboat traffic in general and the rapidly falling stage of water in particular Three miles below Steubenville is Mingo Junction where we are the guests of a friend who is superintendent of the iron and steel works here The population of Mingo is twenty five hundred From seven to twelve hundred are employed in the works according to the exigencies of business Ten per cent of them are Hungarians and Slavonians a larger proportion would be dangerous our host avers because of the tendency of these people to run the town when sufficiently numerous to make it possible The Slavs in the iron towns come to America for a few years intent solely on saving every dollar within reach They are willing to work for wages which from the American standard seem low but to them almost fabulous herd together in surprising promiscuity maintain a low scale of clothing and diet often to the ruin of health and eventually return to Eastern Europe where their savings constitute a little fortune upon which they can end their days in ease This sort of competition is fast degrading legitimate American labor Its regulation ought not to be thought impossible A visit to a great steel making plant in full operation is an event in a man s life Particularly remarkable is the weird spectacle presented at night with the furnaces fiercely gleaming the fresh ingots smoking hot the Bessemer converter blowing off the great cranes moving about like things of life bearing giant kettles of molten steel and amidst it all human life held so cheaply Nearer to mediaeval notions of hell comes this fiery scene than anything imagined by Dante The working life of one of these men is not over ten years B says A decade of this intense heat compared to which a breath of outdoor air in the close mill yard with the midsummer sun in the nineties seems chilly wears a man out only fit for the boneyard then sir was the laconic estimate of an intelligent boss whom I questioned on the subject Wages run from ninety cents to five dollars a day with far more at the former rate than the latter A ninety cent man working in a place so hot that were water from a hose turned upon him it would at once be resolved into scalding steam deserves our sympathy It is pleasing to find in our friend the superintendent a strong fellow feeling for his men and a desire to do all in his power to alleviate their condition He has accomplished much in improving the morale of the town but deep seated inexorable economic conditions apparently beyond present control render nugatory any attempts to better the financial condition of the underpaid majority Mingo Junction Mingo Bottom of old was an interesting locality in frontier days On this fertile river beach was long one of the strongest of the Mingo villages During the last week of May seventeen eighty two Crawford s little army rendezvoused here en route to Sandusky a hundred and fifty miles distant and intent on the destruction of the Wyandot towns But the Indians had not been surprised and the army was driven back with slaughter reaching Mingo the middle of June bereft of its commander Crawford who was a warm friend of Washington suffered almost unprecedented torture at the stake his fate sending a thrill of horror through all the Western settlements Let us not be too harsh in our judgment of these red Indians At first the white colonists from Europe were regarded by them as of supernatural origin and hospitality veneration and confidence were displayed toward the new comers But the mortality of the Europeans was soon made painfully evident to them When the early Spaniards and afterward the English kidnaped tribesmen for sale into slavery or for use as captive guides and even murdered them on slight provocation distrust and hatred naturally succeeded to the sentiment of awe Like many savage races like the earlier Romans the Indian looked upon the member of every tribe with which he had not made a formal peace as a public enemy hence he felt justified in wreaking his vengeance on the race whenever he failed to find individual offenders He was exceptionally cruel his mode of warfare was skulking he could not easily be reached in the forest fastnesses which he alone knew well and his strokes fell heaviest on women and children so that whites came to fear and unspeakably to loathe the savage and often added greatly to the bitterness of the struggle by retaliation in kind The white borderers themselves were frequently brutal reckless lawless and under such conditions clashing was inevitable But worse agents of discord than the agricultural colonists were the itinerants who traveled through the woods visiting the tribes exchanging goods for furs these often cheated and robbed the Indian taught him the use of intoxicants bullied and browbeat him appropriated his women and in general introduced serious demoralization into the native camps The bulk of the whites doubtless intended to treat the Indian honorably but the forest traders were beyond the pale of law and news of the details of their transactions seldom reached the coast settlements As a neighbor the Indian was difficult to deal with whether in the negotiation of treaties of amity or in the purchase of lands Having but a loose system of government there was no really responsible head and no compact was secure from the interference of malcontents who would not be bound by treaties made by the chiefs The English felt that the red men were not putting the land to its full use that much of the territory was growing up as a waste that they were best entitled to it who could make it the most productive On the other hand the earlier cessions of land were made under a total misconception the Indians supposed that the new comers would after a few years of occupancy pass on and leave the tract again to the natives There was no compromise possible between races with precisely opposite views of property in land The struggle was inevitable civilization against savagery No sentimental notions could prevent it It was in the nature of things that the weaker must give way The Indian was a formidable antagonist and there were times when the result of the struggle seemed uncertain but in the end he went to the wall In judging the vanquished enemy of our civilization let us not underestimate his intellect or the many good qualities which were mingled with his savage vices or fail to credit him with sublime courage and a tribal patriotism which no disaster could cool CHAPTER V Houseboat life Decadence of steamboat traffic Wheeling and Wheeling Creek Above Moundsville W Va Thursday May tenth Our friends saw us off at the gravelly beach just below the works There was a slight breeze ahead but the atmosphere was agreeable and Pilgrim bore a happy crew now as brown as gypsies the first painful effects of sunburn are over and we are hardened in skin and muscle to any vicissitudes which are likely to be met upon our voyage Rough weather river mud and all the other exigencies of a moving camp are beginning to tell upon clothing we are becoming like gypsies in raiment as well as color But what a soul satisfying life is this gypsying We possess the world while afloat on the Ohio There are in the course of the summer so many sorts of people traveling by the river steamboat passengers campers fishers house boat folk and what not that we attract little attention of ourselves but Pilgrim is indeed a curiosity hereabout What remarks we overhear are about her Honey skiff that Right smart skiff Good skiff for her place but no good for this yere river and so on She is a lap streak square sterned craft of white cedar three eighths of an inch thick fifteen feet in length and four of beam weighs just a hundred pounds comfortably holds us and our luggage with plenty of spare room to move about in is easily propelled and as stanch as can be made Upon these waters we meet nothing like her Not counting the curious floating boxes and punts which are knocked together out of driftwood by boys and poor whites and are numerous all along shore the regulation Ohio river skiff is built on graceful lines but of inch boards heavily ribbed and is a sorry weight to handle The contention is that to withstand the swash of steamboat wakes breaking upon the shore and the rush of drift in times of flood a heavy skiff is necessary there is a tendency to decry Pilgrim as a plaything unadapted to the great river A reasonable degree of care at all times however and keeping the boat drawn high on the beach when not in use such care as we are familiar with upon our Wisconsin inland lakes would render the employment of such as she quite practicable and greatly lessen the labor of rowing on this waterway The houseboats dozens of which we see daily interest us greatly They are scows or flats greatly differing in size with low ceilinged cabins built upon them sometimes of one room sometimes of half a dozen and varying in character from a mere shanty to a well appointed cottage Perhaps the greater number of these craft are afloat in the river and moored to the bank with a gang plank running to shore others are beached having found a comfortable nook in some higher stage of water and been fastened there propped level with timbers and driftwood Among the houseboat folk are young working couples starting out in life and hoping ultimately to gain a foothold on land unfortunate people who are making a fresh start men regularly employed in riverside factories and mills invalids who at small expense are trying the fresh air cure others who drift up and down the Ohio seeking casual work and legitimate fishermen who find it convenient to be near their nets and to move about according to the needs of their calling But a goodly proportion of these boats are inhabited by the lowest class of the population poor crackers who have managed to scrape together enough money to buy or enough energy and driftwood to build such a craft and near or at the towns many are occupied by gamblers illicit liquor dealers and others who while plying nefarious trades make a pretense of following the occupation of the Apostles Houseboat people whether beached or afloat pay no rent and heretofore have paid no taxes Kentucky has recently passed more as a police regulation than as a means of revenue an act levying a State tax of twenty five dollars upon each craft of this character and the other commonwealths abutting upon the river are considering the policy of doing likewise The houseboat men have however recently formed a protective association and propose to fight the new laws on constitutional grounds the contention being that the Ohio is a national highway and that commerce upon it cannot be hampered by State taxes This view does not however affect the taxability of beached boats which are clearly squatters on State soil Both in town and country the riffraff of the houseboat element are in disfavor It is not uncommon for them beached or tied up to remain unmolested in one spot for years with their pigs chickens and little garden patch about them mayhap a swarm or two of bees and a cow enjoying free pasturage along the weedy bank or on neighboring hills Occasionally however as the result of spasmodic local agitation they are by wholesale ordered to betake themselves to some more hospitable shore and not a few farmers like our friend at Beaver River are quick to pattern after the city police and order their visitors to move on the moment they seek a mooring For the truth is the majority of those who live on the river as the phrase goes have the reputation of being pilferers farmers tell sad tales of despoiled chicken roosts and vegetable gardens From fishing shooting collecting chance driftwood and leading a desultory life along shore like the wreckers of old they naturally fall into this thieving habit Having neither rent nor taxes to pay and for the most part not voting and having no share in the political or social life of landsmen they are in the State yet not of it a class unto themselves whose condition is well worthy the study of economists Interspersed with the houseboat folk although of different character are those whose business leads them to dwell as nomads upon the river merchant peddlers who spend a day or two at some rustic landing while scouring the neighborhood for oil barrels and junk which they load in great heaps upon the flat roofs of their cabins giving therefor at goodly prices groceries crockery and notions often bartering their wares for eggs and dairy products to be disposed of to passing steamers whose clerks in turn pack them for the largest market on their route blacksmiths who moor their floating shops to country beach or village levee wherever business can be had floating theaters and opera companies with large barges built as play houses towed from town to town by their gaudily painted tugs on which may occasionally be perched the vociferous steam piano of our circus days whose soul stirring music can be heard for four miles traveling sawyers with old steamboats made over into sawmills employed by farmers to work up into lumber such logs as they can from time to time bring down to the shore the product being oftenest used in the neighborhood but occasionally rafted and floated to the nearest large town and a miscellaneous lot of traveling craftsmen who live and work afloat chairmakers upholsterers feather and mattress renovators photographers who land at the villages scatter abroad their advertising cards and stay so long as the ensuing patronage warrants A motley assortment these neighbors of ours an uncultivated field for the fiction writers We have struck up acquaintance with many of them and they are not bad fellows as the world goes Philosophers all and loquacious to a degree But they cannot for the life of them fathom the mystery of our cruise We are not in trade we are not fishing we are not canvassers we are not show people What n tarnation air ye anny way Oh come now No fellers is do n th river fur fun that s sartin ye re jist gov m nt agints That s my way o think n Well f ye kin find fun in t then done go ahead I say But all same we ll be friends won t we Yew bet strangers Ye re welcome t all in this yere shanty boat ain t no bakky bout yer close yew fellers We meet with abundant courtesy of this rude sort and weaponless sleep well o nights fearing naught from our comrades for the nonce We again have railways on either bank The iron horse has almost eclipsed the fire canoe as the Indians picturesquely styled the steamboat We occasionally see boats tied up to the wharves evidently not in commission but in actual operation we seldom meet or pass over one or two daily To be sure the low stage of water from six to eight feet thus far and falling daily and the coal strike militate against navigation interests But the truth is there is very little business now left for steamboats beyond the movement of coal stone bricks and other bulky material some way freight and a light passenger traffic The railroads are quicker and surer and of course competition lowers the charges The heavy manufacturing interests along the river now depend little upon the steamers although originally established here because of them I asked our friend the superintendent at Mingo what advantage was gained by having his plant upon the river He replied We can get all the water we want and we use a great deal of it and it is convenient to empty our slag upon the banks but our chief interest here is in the fact that Mingo is a railway junction By rail he gets his coal and ore and ships away his product Were the coal to come a considerable distance the river would be the cheaper road but it is obtained from neighboring hill mines that are practically owned by the railways This coal by the way costs one dollar ten cents at the shaft mouth and one dollar seventy five cents landed at the Mingo works As for the sewer pipe brick and pottery works they are along stream because of the great beds of clay exposed by the erosion of the river It is fortunate for the stability of these towns that the Ohio flows along the transcontinental pathway westward so that the great railway lines may serve them without deflection from their natural course Had the great stream flowed south instead of west the industries of the valley doubtless would gradually have been removed to the transverse highways of the new commerce save where these latter crossed the river and thus have left scores of once thriving communities mere longshore wrecks of their former selves This is not possible now The steamboat traffic may still further waste until the river is no longer serviceable save as a continental drainage ditch but chiefly because of its railways the Ohio Valley will continue to be the seat of an industrial population which shall wax fat upon the growth of the nation s needs By the middle of the afternoon we were at Wheeling ninety one miles The town has fifty thousand inhabitants is substantially built of a distinctly Southern aspect well stretched out along the river but narrow with gaunt treeless gully washed hills of clay rising abruptly behind giving the place a most forbidding appearance from the water There are several fine bridges spanning the Ohio and Wheeling Creek which empties on the lower edge of town is crossed by a maze of steel spans and stone arches the well paved wharf sloping upward from the Ohio is nearly as broad and imposing as that of Pittsburg A houseboats are here by the score some of them the haunts of fishing clubs as we judge from the names emblazoned on their sides Mystic Crew South Side Club and the like For the first time upon our tour negroes are abundant upon the streets and lounging along the river front They vary in color

eyed Wheeling Island three hundred acres up to thirty years ago mentioned in travelers journals as a rare beauty spot is to day thick set with cottages of factory hands and small villas and commonplace while smoky Bridgeport opposite on the Ohio side was from our vantage point a mere smudge upon the landscape Wheeling Creek is famous in Western history The three Zane brothers Ebenezer Jonathan and Silas typical old fashioned names these bespeaking the God fearing Bible loving Scotch Presbyterian stock from which sprang so large a proportion of trans Alleghany pioneers explored this region as early as seventeen sixty nine built cabins and made improvements Silas at the forks of the creek and Ebenezer and Jonathan at the mouth During three or four years it was a hard fight between them and the Indians but though several times driven from the scene the Zane brothers stubbornly reappeared and rebuilt their burned habitations Before the Revolutionary War broke out the fortified home of the Zanes at the creek mouth was a favorite stopping stage in the savage haunted wilderness and many a traveler in those early days has left us in his journal a thankful account of his tarrying here The Zane stockade developed into Fort Fincastle in Lord Dunmore s time then Fort Henry during the Revolution and everyone who knows his Western history at all has read of the three famous sieges of Wheeling seventeen seventy seven seventeen eighty one and seventeen eighty two and the daring deeds of its men and women which help illumine the pages of border annals Finally by seventeen eighty four the fort at Wheeling that had never surrendered was demolished as no longer necessary for the wall of savage resistance was now pushed far westward Wheeling had become the western end of a wagon road across the Panhandle from Redstone and here were fitted out many flatboat expeditions for the lower Ohio later in steamboat days the shallow water of the upper river caused Wheeling to be in midsummer the highest port attainable and to this day it holds its ground as the upper terminus of several steamboat lines Below Wheeling are several miles of factory towns nestled by the strand and numerous coal tipples with their begrimed villages Fishermen have been frequent to day in houseboats of high and low degree and in land camps composed of tents and board shanties with rows of seines and tarred pound nets stretched in the sun to dry tow headed children abound almost as nude as the pigs and dogs and chickens amongst which they waddle and roll women folk busy themselves with the multifarious cares of home keeping while their lords are in shady nooks mending nets or listlessly examining trout lines which appear to yield but empty hooks they tell us that when the river is falling fish bite not and yet they serenely angle on dreaming their lives away A half mile above Big Grave Creek one hundred one miles we too hurry into camp on a shelving bank of sand deep fringed with willows for over the western hills thunder clouds are rising with wind gusts Level fields stretch back of us for a quarter of a mile to the hills which bound the bottom at our front door majestically rolls the growing river perhaps a third of a mile in width black with the reflection of the sky and wrinkled now and then with squalls which scurry over its bubbling surface B The storm does not break but the bending tree tops crone and toads innumerable rend the air with their screaming whistles We had great ado during the cooking of dinner to prevent them from hopping into our little stove as it gleamed brightly in the early dusk and have adopted special precautions to keep them from the tent as they jump about in the tall grass appeasing their insectivorous appetites Footnote A Upon the Ohio and kindred rivers the term wharf applies to the river beach when graded and paved ready for the reception of steamers Such a wharf must not be confounded with a lake or seaside wharf a staging projected into the water Footnote B It was in this neighborhood a mile or two above our camp where the bottom is narrower that captain William Foreman and twenty other Virginia militiamen were killed in an Indian ambuscade Sept twenty seven seventeen seventy seven An inscribed stone monument was erected on the spot in eighteen thirty five but we could not find it CHAPTER VI The Big Grave Washington and Round Bottom A lazy man s Paradise Captina Creek George Rogers Clark at Fish Creek Southern types Near Fishing Creek Friday May eleventh There had been rain during the night with fierce wind gusts but during breakfast the atmosphere quieted and we had a genial semi cloudy morning Off at eight o clock Pilgrim s crew were soon exploring Moundsville There are five thousand people in this old faded countrified town They show you with pride the State Penitentiary of West Virginia a solemn looking pile of dark gray stone with the feeble battlements and towers common to American prison architecture But the chief feature of the place is the great Indian mound the Big Grave of early chroniclers This earthwork is one of the largest now remaining in the United States being sixty eight feet high and a hundred in diameter at the base and has for over a century attracted the attention of travelers and archaeologists We found it at the end of a straggling street on the edge of the town a quarter of a mile back from the river Around the mound has been left a narrow plat of ground utilized as a cornfield and the stout picket fence which encloses it bears peremptory notice that admission is forbidden However as the proprietor was not easily accessible we exercised the privilege of historical pilgrims and letting ourselves in through the gate picked our way through rows of corn and ascended the great cone It is covered with a heavy growth of white oaks some of them three feet in diameter among which the path picturesquely zigzags The summit is fifty five feet in diameter and the center somewhat depressed like a basin From the middle of this basin a shaft some twenty five feet in diameter has been sunk by explorers for a distance of perhaps fifty feet at one time a level tunnel connected the bottom of this shaft with the side of the cone but it has been mostly obliterated A score of years ago tunnel and shaft were utilized as the leading attractions of a beer garden to such base uses may a great historical landmark descend Dickens who apparently wrote the greater part of his American Notes while suffering from dyspepsia has a note of appreciation for the Big Grave the host of Indians who lie buried in a great mound yonder so old that mighty oaks and other forest trees have struck their roots into its earth and so high that it is a hill even among the hills that Nature planted around it The very river as though it shared one s feelings of compassion for the extinct tribes who lived so pleasantly here in their blessed ignorance of white existence hundreds of years ago steals out of its way to ripple near this mound and there are few places where the Ohio sparkles more brightly than in the Big Grave Creek There is a sharp bend in the river just below Moundsville with Dillon s Bottom stretching long and wide at the apex on the Ohio shore flat green fields dotted with little white farmsteads each set low in its apple grove and a convoluted wall of dark hills hemming them in along the northern horizon Then below this comes Round Bottom its counterpart on the West Virginia side and coursing through it a pretty meadow creek Butler s Run Writes Washington in seventeen eighty one to a correspondent who is thinking of renting lands in this region I have a small tract called the round bottom containing about six hundred Acres which would also let It lyes on the Ohio opposite to pipe Creek and a little above Capteening Across the half mile of river are the little levels and great slopes of the Ohio hills through which breaks this same Pipe Creek and hereabout Cresap s band murdered a number of inoffensive Shawanese a tragedy which was one of the inciting causes of Lord Dunmore s War seventeen seventy four We crossed over into Ohio and pulled up on the gravelly spit at the mouth of Pipe While the others were botanizing high on the mountain side I went along a beach path toward a group of whitewashed cabins intent on replenishing the canteen Upon opening the gate of one of them two grizzly dogs came bounding out threatening to test the strength of my corduroy trousers The proprietor cautiously peered from a window and much to my relief called off the animals Satisfied apparently that I was not the visitor he expected the fellow lounged out and sat upon the steps where I joined him He was a tall raw boned loose jointed young man with a dirty buttonless flannel shirt which revealed a hairy breast upon his trousers hung a variety of patches in many stages of grease and decrepitude a gray slouch hat shaded his little fishy eyes and hollow yellow cheeks and the snaky ends of his yellow mustache were stiff with accumulations of dried tobacco juice His fat waddling wife in a greasy black gown followed with bare feet and arms akimbo listened in the open door A coal company owns the rocky river front here and at many places below and lets these cabins to the poor white element so numerous on the Ohio s banks The renter is privileged to cultivate whatever land he can clear on the rocky precipitous slopes which is seldom more than half an acre to the cabin and he may if he can afford a cow let her run wild in the scrub The coal vein a few rods back of the house is only a few inches thick and poor in quality but is freely resorted to by the cotters He worked whenever he could find a job my host said in the coal mines and quarries or on the bottom farms or the railroad which skirts the bank at his feet But I tell ye sir th I talians and Hungarians is spoil n this yere country fur white men n I do n see no prospect for hits be n better till they get shoved out uv t Yet he said that life wasn t so hard here as it was in some parts he had heard tell of the climate was mild that he lowed a fellow could go out and get a free bucket of coal from the hillside back yon he might get all the light wood n patchin stuff he wanted from the river drift could when he hankered after em catch fish off his own front door yard and pick up a dollar now and then at odd jobs when the rent was to be paid or the ol woman wanted a dress or he a new coat This is clearly the lazy man s Paradise I do not remember to have heard that the South Sea Islanders in the ante missionary days had an easier time of it than this What new fortune will befall my friend when he gets the Italians and Hungarians shoved out and things pick up a bit I cannot conceive A pleasing panorama he has from his doorway across the river the fertile fields of Round Bottom once Washington s Captina Island just below long and thickly willowed dreamily afloat in a glassy sea reflecting every change of light the whole girt about with the wide uplands of the winding valley and overhead the march of sunny clouds Captina Creek one hundred eight miles is not far down on the Ohio bank and beside it the little hamlet of Powhattan Point with the West Virginia hills thereabout exceptionally high and steep and wooded to the very top Washington who knew the Ohio well down to the Great Kanawha wrote of this creek in seventeen seventy A pretty large creek on the west side called by Nicholson his interpreter Fox Grape Vine by others Captema creek on which eight miles up is the town called Grape Vine Town Captina village is its white successor But there were also Indians at the mouth of the creek for when George Rogers Clark and his missionary companion Jones two years later camped opposite on the Virginia shore they went over to make a morning call on the natives who repaid it in the evening doubtless each time receiving freely from the white men s bounty The next day was Sunday and the travelers remained in camp Jones recording in his journal that he instructed what Indians came over In the course of his prayer the missionary was particularly impressed by the attitude of the chief of Grape Vine Town named Frank Stephens who professed to believe in the Christian God and he naively writes I was informed that all the time the Indians looked very seriously at me Jones appears to have been impressed also with the hardness of the beach where they camped in the open doubtless to avoid surprises Instead of feathers my bed was gravel stones by the river side which at first seemed not to suit me but afterward it became more natural In those days traveling was beset with difficulties both ashore and afloat Eight years later spring of seventeen eighty three flatboats were descending the Ohio laden with families intending to settle in Kentucky when they suffered a common fate being attacked by Indians off Captina Creek Several men and a child were killed and twenty one persons were carried into captivity among them Catherine Malott a girl in her teens who subsequently became the wife of that most notorious of border renegades Simon Girty On the West Virginia shore not over a third of a mile below Captina Creek empties Grave Yard Run a modest rivulet It would of itself not be noticeable amid the crowd of minor creeks and runs coursing down to the great river through rugged ravines which corrugate the banks But it has a history Here late in October or early in November seventeen seventy two young George Rogers Clark made his first stake west of the Alleghanies rudely cultivating a few acres of forest land on what is now called Cresap s Bottom surveying for the neighbors and in the evenings teaching their children in the little log cabin of his friend Yates Conwell at the mouth of Fish Creek a few miles below Fish Creek was in itself famous as one of the sections of the great Indian trail The Warrior Branch which starting in Tennessee came northward through Kentucky and Southern Ohio and proceeding by way of this creek crossed over to Dunkard Creek thence to the mouth of Redstone Washington stopped at Conwell s in March or April seventeen seventy four but Clark was away from home at the time and the Father of his Country never met the man who has been dubbed the Washington of the West Lord Dunmore s War was hatching and a few months later the Fish Creek surveyor and schoolmaster had entered upon his life work as an Indian fighter At Bearsville one hundred twenty six miles we first meet a phenomenon common to the Ohio the edges of the alluvial bottom being higher than the fields back of them forming a natural levee above which curiously rise to our view the spires and chimneys of the village Harris Journal eighteen oh three made early note of this and advanced an acceptable theory We frequently remarked that the banks are higher at the margin than at a little distance back I account for it in this manner Large trees which are brought down the river by the inundations are lodged upon the borders of the bank but cannot be floated far upon the champaign because obstructed by the growth of wood Retaining their situation when the waters subside they obstruct and detain the leaves and mud which would else recoil into the stream and thus in process of time form a bank higher than the interior flats Tied up to Bearsville landing is a gayly painted barge the home of Price s Floating Opera Company and in front its towing steamer Troubadour A steam calliope is part of the visible furniture of the establishment and its praises as a noise maker are sung in large type in the handbills which with numerous colored lithographs of the performers adorn the shop windows in the neighboring river towns Two miles farther down on a high bank at the mouth of Fishing Creek lies New Martinsville West Va one hundred twenty seven miles a rather shabby town of fifteen hundred souls As W and I passed up the main street seeking for a grocery we noticed that the public hall was being decorated for a dance to come off to night and placards advertising the event were everywhere rivaling the gaudy prints of the floating opera Meanwhile a talkative native was interviewing the Doctor down at the river side It required some good natured fencing on the part of our skipper to prevent the Virginian from learning all about our respective families away back to the third generation He was a short chubby man with a Dixie goatee his flannel shirt negligee and a wide brimmed straw hat jauntily set on the back of his head He was sociable and sat astride of our beached prow punctuating his remarks with squirts of tobacco juice and a bit of lath with which he meditatively tapped the gunwale the meantime with some skill casting pebbles into the water with his bare toes Ax n yer pardon ma m he said scrambling from his perch upon W s appearance and then pushing us off he bowed with much Southern gallantry and hat in hand begged we would come again to New Martinsville and stay longer The hills lining these reaches are lower than above yet graceful in their sweeping lines Conical mounds sometimes surmount them relics of the prehistoric time when our Indians held to the curious fashion of building earthworks We no longer entertain the notion that a separate and a prouder race of wild men than we know erected these tumuli That pleasant fiction has departed from us but the works are none the less interesting now that more is known of their origin Two miles below New Martinsville on the West Virginia shore we pitch camp just as the light begins to sink over the Ohio hills The atmosphere is sweet with the odor of wild grape blossoms and the willow also is in bloom Poison ivy to whose baneful touch fortunately none of us appear susceptible grows everywhere about From the farmhouse on the narrow bottom to our rear comes the melodious tinkle tinkle of cow bells The operatic calliope is in full blast at Bearsville its shrieks and snorts coming down to us through four miles of space all too plainly borne by the northern breeze and now and then we hear the squeak of the New Martinsville fiddles There are no mosquitoes as yet but burly May chafers come stupidly dashing against our tent and the toads are piping merrily CHAPTER VII In Dixie Oil and natural gas at Witten s Bottom The Long Reach Photographing crackers Visitors in camp Above Marietta Saturday May twelfth Since the middle of yesterday afternoon we have been in Dixie that is when we are on the West Virginia shore The famous Mason and Dixon Line lat thirty nine deg forty three twenty six touches the Ohio at the mouth of Proctor s Run one hundred twenty one one two miles There was a heavy fog this morning on land and river But through shifting rifts made by the morning breeze we had kaleidoscopic cloud framed pictures of the dark jutting headlands which hem us in of little white cabins clustered by the country road which on either bank crawls along narrow terraces between overtopping steeps and sprawling beach or winds through fertile bottoms according to whether the river approaches or recedes from its inclosing bluffs of hillside fields tipped at various angles of ascent sometimes green with springing grain but oftenest gray or brown or yellow freshly planted charming patches of color in this somber hued world of sloping woodland At Williamson s Island one hundred thirty four miles the fog lifted The air was heavy with the odor of petroleum All about us were the ugly towering derricks of oil and natural gas wells Witten s Bottom on the right with its abutting hills the West Virginia woods across the river and the maple strewn island between all covered with scaffolds The country looks like a rumpled fox and geese board with pegs stuck all over it A mile and a half below lies Sistersville W Va the emporium of this greasy neighborhood great red oil tanks and smoky refineries its chiefest glory crude and raw like the product it handles We landed at Witten s Bottom W the Boy and I while the Doctor philosophically preferring to take the oily elephant for granted piloted Pilgrim to the rendezvous a mile below Oil was struck here two or three years ago and now within a distance of a few miles there are hundreds of wells two hun rd in this yere gravel alone sir I was told by a red headed man in a red shirt who lived with his numerous family in a twelve foot square box at the rear of a pumping engine An engine serves several wells the tumbling rods rudely boxed in stretching off through the fields and over the hills to wherever needed The operatives dwell in little shanties scattered conveniently about in front of each is a vertical half inch pipe six or eight feet high bearing a half bushel of natural gas flame which burns and tosses night and day winter and summer making the Bottom a warm corner of the earth when the unassisted temperature is in the eighties It is a bewildering scene with all these derricks thickly scattered around engines noisily puffing walking beams forever rearing and plunging the country cobwebbed with tumbling rods and pipe lines the shanties of the operatives with their rude lamp posts and the face of Nature so besmeared with the crude output of the wells that every twig and leaf is thick with grease Just above Witten s commences the Long Reach of the Ohio a charming panorama for sixteen and a half miles in a nearly straight line to the southwest Little towns line the alternating bottoms and farmsteads are numerous on the slopes But they are rocky and narrow these gentle shoulders of the hills and a poor class of folk occupy them half fishers half farmers a cross between my Round Bottom friend and the houseboat nomads A picturesquely dilapidated log house with whitewashed porch in front and a vine arbor at the rear attracted our attention at the foot of the reach near Grape Island I clambered up to photograph it The ice was broken by asking for a drink of water A gaunt girl of eighteen the elder of two with bare feet her snaky hair streaming unkempt about a smirking face went with a broken nosed pitcher to a run which could be heard splashing over its rocky bed near by The meanwhile I took a seat in the customary arcade between the living room and kitchen and talked with her fat greasy red nosed father who confided to me that he was a pi neer from way back He occupied his own land a rare circumstance among these riverside crackers had a hundred and thirty acres worth twenty dollars the acre jist yon ways back of the house in the cliff side there was a coal vein two feet thick as yet only worked for his own fuel and lately he had struck a bank of firebrick clay which might some day be a good thing for th gals On leaving I casually mentioned my desire to photograph the family on the porch where the light was good While I walked around the house outside they passed through the front room which seemed to be the common dormitory as well as parlor To my surprise and chagrin the girls and their dowdy mother had in those brief moments of transition contrived to arrange their hair and dress to a degree which took from them all those picturesque qualities with which they had been invested at the time of my arrival The father was being reproved as he emerged upon the porch for not slick n his ha r and wash n and fix n up afore hay n his pictur taken but the old fellow was obdurate and joined me in remonstrance against this transformation to the commonplace on the part of his women folk However there was no profit in arguing with them and I took my snap shot with a conviction that the film was being wasted We were in several small towns to day in pursuance of the policy of distributing our shopping so as to see as much of the shore life as practicable Chief among them have been New Matamoras one hundred forty one miles and saint Mary s one hundred fifty four miles in West Virginia and Newport in Ohio one hundred fifty five miles Rather dingy villages these each after their kind with a stone wharf thick grown with weeds a flouring mill at the head of the landing a few cheap looking battlemented stores boys and men lounging about with that air of comfortable idling which impresses one as the main characteristic of rustic hamlets where nobody seems ever to have anything to do a ferry running to the opposite shore for cattle and wagons a heavy flat with railings made to drift with the current and for foot passengers a lumbering skiff with oars chucking noisily in their roomy locks Every now and then we run across bunches of oil and gas wells and great signs like those advertising boards which greet railway travelers approaching our large cities are here and there perched upon the banks notifying steamboat pilots in letters a foot high that a pipe line here crosses the river the vicinity being consequently unsafe for mooring Our camp to night is on a bit of grassy ledge at the summit of a rocky bank ten miles above Marietta on the Ohio side A rod or so back of us is the country road which winds along at the foot of a precipitous steep It is narrow quarters here and too near the highway for comfort but nothing better seemed to offer at the time we needed it and the outlook is pleasant through the fringing oaks and elms across the broad river into West Virginia We had not yet pitched tent and all hands were still clambering over the rocks with Pilgrim s cargo rather glad that there was no more of it when our first camp bore appeared a middling sized man florid as to complexion with a mustache and goatee and in a suit of seedy black surmounted by a crushed in Derby hat and after the fashion of the country giving evidence on his collarless white shirt of a free use of chewing tobacco I have seldom met a fellow with better staying qualities He was a strawberry grower he said and having been into Newport a half dozen miles up river was walking to his home which was a mile or two off in the hills Would we object if for a few moments he tarried here by the roadside and perhaps we could accommodate him with a drink of water Patiently did he watch the preparation of dinner and spice each dish with commendations of W s skill at making the most of her few utensils Right glibly he chattered on now about the decadence of womankind now about strawberry growing upon these Ohio hills with the crop just coming on and berries selling at a shilling to day in Marietta when they ought to be worth twenty cents now on politics and of course he was a Populist now on the hard times and did we believe in free silver He would take no bite with us but sat and talked and talked despite plain hints growing plainer with the progress of time that his family needed him at nightfall Dinner was eaten and dishes washed the others left on a botanical round up and I produced my writing materials with remarks upon the lateness of the hour At last our guest arose shook the grass from his clothes with a shake of hands bade me good night wishing me to convey his good bye to the rest of our party and as politely as possible expressed the great pleasure which the visit had given him Some farmer boys came down the hillside to fish at the bank and talked pleasantly of their work and of the ever changing phases of the river Other farmers passed our roadside door in wagons on buckboards by horseback and on foot in neighborly tone but with ill disguised curiosity in their eyes wishing me good evening When the long twilight was almost gone and the moon an hour high over the purple dusk of the West Virginia hills the botanists returned aglow with their exercise and rich with trophies of blue and dwarf larkspur pink and white stone crop trailing arbutus and great laurel And then as we were preparing to retire a sleek and dapper fellow though with clothes rather the worse for wear came trudging along the road toward Marietta Seeing our camp he asked for a drink Being apparently disposed to tarry the Doctor to get him started offered to walk a piece with him Our comrade staid out so long that at last I went down the road in search of him and found the pair sitting on a moonlit bank as cozily as if they had been always friends The stranger had revealed to the Doctor that he was a street fakir by perfesh and had struck it rich in Chicago during the World s Fair but somehow had lost the greater part of his gains and was now associated with his brother who had a junk boat the brother was well heeled and staid and kept store at the boat while the fakir as the walking partner rustled round mong th grangers to stir up trade The Doctor had in their talk let slip something about certain Florida experiences and when I arrived on the scene was being skillfully questioned by his companion as to the probabilities of a feller o my perfesh ketch n on down thar The result of this pumping process must have been satisfactory for when we parted with him the fakir declared he was go n try t on thar next winter f I bust me bottom dollar CHAPTER VIII Life ashore and afloat Marietta the Plymouth Rock of the West The Little Kanawha The story of Blennerhassett s Island Blennerhassett s Island Sunday May thirteenth The day broke without fog at our camp on the rocky steep above Marietta The eastern sky was veiled with summer clouds all gayly flushed by the rising sun and in the serene silence of the morning there hung the scent of dew and earth and trees In the east the distant edges of the West Virginia hills were aglow with the mounting light before it had yet peeped over into the river trough where a silvery haze lent peculiar charm to flood and bank Up river one of the Three Brothers isles dark and heavily forested seemed in the middle ground to float on air A bewitching picture this until at last the sun sprang clear and strong above the fringing hills and the spell was broken The steamboat traffic is improving as we get lower down Last evening between landing and bedtime a half dozen passed us up and down breathing heavily as dragons might and leaving behind them foamy wakes which loudly broke upon the shore Before morning I was at intervals awakened by as many more A striking spectacle the passage of a big river steamer in the night you hear fast approaching a labored pant suddenly around the bend or emerging from behind an island the long white monster glides into view lanterns gleaming on two lines of deck her electric searchlight uneasily flitting to and fro first on one landmark then on another her engine bell sharply clanging the measured pant developing into a burly all pervading roar which gradually declines into a pant again and then she disappears as she came her swelling wake rudely ruffling the moonlit stream We caught up with a large lumber raft this morning descending from Pittsburg to Cincinnati The half dozen men in charge were housed midway in a rude little shanty and relieved each other at the sweeps two at bow and two astern It is an easy lounging life most of the way with some difficulties in the shallows and in passing beneath the great bridges They travel night and day except in the not infrequent wind storms blowing up stream and it will take them another week to cover the three hundred miles between this and their destination Far different fellows these commonplace raftsmen of to day from the lumber boys of a half century or more ago when the river towns were regularly painted red by the men who followed the Ohio by raft or flatboat Life along shore was then more picturesque than comfortable Later we stopped on the Ohio shore to chat with a group of farmers having a Sunday talk their seat a drift log in the shade of a willowed bank They proved to be market gardeners and fruit growers well to do men of their class and intelligent in conversation all of them descendants of the sturdy New Englanders who settled these parts While the others were discussing small fruits with these transplanted Yankees who proved quite as full of curiosity about us as we concerning them I went down shore a hundred yards struggling through the dense fringe of willows to photograph a junk boat just putting off into the stream The two rough bearded merry eyed fellows at the sweeps were setting their craft broadside to the stream that the current might have more holt of her the chief explained They were interested in the kodak and readily posed as I wished but wanted to see what had been taken having the common notion that it is like a tintype camera with results at once attainable They offered our party a ride for the rest of the day if we would row alongside and come aboard but I thanked them saying their craft was too slow for our needs at which they laughed heartily and lowed we might be traders too anxious to get in ahead of them but there s plenty o room o th river for yew an we stranger Well good luck to yees We ll see yer down below somewhar I reckon Just before lunch we were at Marietta at the mouth of the Muskingum one hundred seventy one miles a fine stream here two hundred and fifty yards wide A storied river this Muskingum We first definitely hear of it in seventeen forty eight the year the original Ohio Company was formed Celoron was here the year following with his little band of French soldiers and Indians vainly endeavoring to turn English traders out of the Ohio Valley Christopher Gist came some months later then the trader Croghan for Old Wyandot Town the Indian village at the mouth was a noted center in Western forest traffic Moravian missionaries appeared in due time establishing on the banks of the Muskingum the ill fated convert villages of Schoenbrunn Gnadenhuetten and Salem In seventeen eighty five Fort Harmar was reared on the site of Wyandot Town Lastly in the early spring of seventeen eighty eight came in Ohio river flatboats that famous body of New England veterans of the Revolution under general Rufus Putnam and planted Marietta the Plymouth Rock of the West We smile at these Ohio pilgrims for dignifying the hills which girt in the Marietta bottom with the names of the seven on which Rome is said to be built for having a Campus Martius and a Sacra Via and all that out here among the sycamore stumps and the wild Indians But a classical revival was just then vigorously affecting American thought and it would have been strange if these sturdy New Englanders had not felt its influence fresh as they were from out the shadows of Harvard and Yale and in the awesome presence of crowds of huge monumental earthworks whose age in their day was believed to far outdate the foundations of the Eternal City itself They loved learning for learning s sake and here in the log cabins of Marietta eight hundred miles west of their beloved Boston among many another good thing they did for posterity they established the principle of public education at public cost as a national principle They were soldier colonists Washington out of a full heart for he dearly loved the West said of them No colony in America was ever settled under such favorable auspices as that which has just commenced at the Muskingum Information property and strength will be its characteristics I know many of the settlers personally and there never were men better calculated to promote the welfare of such a community And when in eighteen twenty five La Fayette had read to him the list of Marietta pioneers nearly fifty military officers among them he cried I know them all I saw them at Brandywine Yorktown and Rhode Island They were the bravest of the brave Yet for a long time Marietta met with small measure of success Miasma Indian ravages and the conservative temperament of the people combined to render slow the growth of this Western Plymouth There were for a time extensive ship building yards here but that industry gradually declined with the growth of railway systems In our day Marietta with its ten thousand inhabitants prospers chiefly as a market town and an educational center with some manufacturing interests We were struck to day as we tarried there for an hour or two with the remarkable resemblance it has in public and private architecture and in general tone to a typical New England town say for example Burlington Vt Omitting its river front and its Mound Cemetery Marietta might be set bodily down almost anywhere in Massachusetts or Vermont or Connecticut and the chance traveler would see little in the place to remind him of the West I know of no other town out of New England of which the same might be said Below Marietta the river bottoms are for miles together edged with broad stretches of sloping beach either deep with sand or naturally paved with pebbles sometimes treeless but often strewn with clumps of willow and maple and scrub sycamore The hills now rounder less ambitious and more widely separated are checkered with fields and forests and the bottom lands are of more generous breadth Pleasant islands stud the peaceful stream The sylvan foliage has by this time attained very nearly its fullest size The horse chestnut the pawpaw the grape and the willow are in bloom A gentle pastoral scene is this through which we glide It is evident that it would be a scalding day but for the gentle breeze astern setting sail we gladly drop our oars and with the water rippling at our prow sweep blithely down the long southern reach to Parkersburg W Va at the mouth of the Little Kanawha one hundred eighty three miles In the full glare of the scorching sun Parkersburg looks harsh and dry But it is well built and as seen from the river apparently prosperous The Ohio is here crossed by the once famous million dollar bridge of the Baltimore Ohio railway The wharf is at the junction of the two streams but chiefly on the shore of the unattractive Little Kanawha which is spanned by several bridges and abounds in steamers and houseboats moored to the land Clark and Jones did not think well of Little Kanawha lands yet there were several families on the river as early as seventeen sixty three and Trent Croghan and other Fort Pitt fur traders had posts here There were only half a dozen houses in eighteen hundred and Parkersburg itself was not laid out until ten years later Blennerhassett s Island lies two miles below a broad dark mass of forest at the head joined by a dam to the West Virginia shore from which it is separated by a slender channel Blennerhassett s is some three and a half miles long of its five hundred acres four hundred are under cultivation in three separate tenant farms We landed at the upper end where Blennerhassett had his wharf facing the Ohio shore and found that we were trespassing upon The Blennerhassett Pleasure Grounds A seedy looking man who represented himself to be the proprietor promptly accosted us and levied a landing fee of ten cents per head which included the right to remain over night A little questioning developed the fact that thirty acres at the head of the island belong to this man who rents the ground to a market gardener together with the comfortable farmhouse which occupies the site of Blennerhassett s mansion but reserves to himself the privilege of levying toll on visitors He declared to me that fifteen thousand people came to the island each summer generally in large railway and steamboat excursions which gives him an easily acquired income sufficient for his needs It is a pity that so famous a place is not a public park The touching story of the Blennerhassetts is one of the best known in Western annals Rich in culture and worldly possessions but wildly impracticable Harman Blennerhassett and his beautiful wife came to America in seventeen ninety eight Buying this lovely island in the Ohio six hundred miles west of tidewater they built a large mansion which they furnished luxuriously adorning it with fine pictures and statuary Here in the midst of beautiful grounds while Blennerhassett studied astronomy chemistry and galvanism his brilliant spouse dispensed rare hospitality to their many distinguished guests for in those days it was part of a rich young man s education to take a journey down the Ohio into the Western parts and on returning home to write a book about it But there came a serpent to this Eden Aaron Burr was among their visitors eighteen oh five while upon his journey to New Orleans where he hoped to set on foot a scheme to seize either Texas or Mexico and set up a republic with himself at the head He interested the susceptible Blennerhassetts in his plans the import of which they probably little understood but the fantastic Englishman had suffered a considerable reduction of fortune and was anxious to recoup and Burr s representations were aglow with the promise of such rewards in the golden southwest as Cortes and Coronado sought Blennerhassett s purse was opened to the enterprise of Burr large sums were spent in boats and munitions which were tradition says for a time hid in the bayou which close by our camp runs deep into the island forest It has been filled in by the present proprietor but its bold shore lines all hung with giant sycamores are still in evidence President Jefferson s proclamation October eighteen oh six shattered the plot and Blennerhassett fled to join Burr at the mouth of the Cumberland Both were finally arrested eighteen oh seven and tried for treason but acquitted on technical grounds In the meantime people from the neighboring country sacked Blennerhassett s house then came creditors and with great waste seized his property the beautiful place was still further pillaged by lawless ruffians and turned into ignoble uses later the mansion itself was burned through the carelessness of negroes and now all they can show us are the old well and the noble trees which once graced the lawn As for the Blennerhassetts themselves they wandered far and wide everywhere the victims of misfortune He died on the Island of Guernsey eighteen thirty one a disappointed office seeker she returning to America to seek redress from Congress for the spoliation of her home passed away in New York before the claim was allowed and was buried by the Sisters of Charity CHAPTER IX Poor whites First library in the West An hour at Hockingport A hermit fisher Long Bottom Monday May fourteenth Pushing up stream for two miles this morning the commissary department replenished the day s stores at Parkersburg Forepaugh s circus was in town and crowds of rustics were coming in by wagon road railway trains and steamers and ferries on both rivers The streets of the quaint dingy Southern town were teeming with humanity mainly negroes and poor whites Among the latter flat pallid faces either flabby or too lean were under the swarms of blue white and yellow sunbonnets sad faces with lack luster eyes coarse hair of undecided hue and coarser speech These Audreys of Dixie land are the product of centuries of ill treatment on our soil indented white servants to the early coast colonists were in the main their ancestors with slave competition the white laborer in the South lost caste until even the negro despised him and ill nurture has done the rest Then too in these bottoms malaria has wrought its work especially among the underfed you see it in the yellow skin and nerveless tone of these lanky rustics who are in town to enjoy the one bright holiday of their weary year Across the river in Ohio is Belpre short for Belle Prairie and now locally pronounced Bel pry settled by Revolutionary soldiers on the Marietta grant in seventeen eighty nine ninety I always think well of Belpre because here was established the first circulating library in the Northwest Old Israel Putnam he of the wolf den and Bunker Hill amassed many books His son Israel on moving to Belpre in seventeen ninety six carried a considerable part of the collection with him no small undertaking this at a time when goods had to be carted all the way from Connecticut over rivers and mountains to the Ohio and then floated down river by flatboat with a high tariff for every pound of freight Young Israel was public spirited and having been at so great cost and trouble to get this library out to the wilderness desired his fellow colonists to enjoy it with him It would have been unfair not to distribute the expense so a stock company was formed and shares were sold at ten dollars each Of the blessings wrought in this rude frontier community by the books which the elder Israel had collected for his Connecticut fireside there can be no more eloquent testimony than that borne by an old settler who in eighteen oh two writes to an Eastern friend In order to make the long winter evenings pass more smoothly by great exertion I purchased a share in the Belpre library six miles distant Many a night have I passed using pine knots instead of candles reading to my wife while she sat hatcheling carding or spinning The association was dissolved in eighteen fifteen or eighteen sixteen and the books distributed among the shareholders many of these volumes are still extant in this vicinity and several are in the college museum at Marietta There are few descendants hereabout of the original New England settlers and they live miles apart on the Ohio shore We went up to visit one living opposite Blennerhassett s Island Notice of our coming had preceded us and we were warmly welcomed at a substantial farmhouse in the outskirts of Belpre with every evidence about of abundant prosperity The maternal great grandfather of our host for an hour was Rufus Putnam an ancestor to be proud of Five acres of gooseberries are grown on the place and other small fruits in proportion all for the Parkersburg market whence much is shipped north to Cleveland Our host confessed to a little malaria even on this upper terrace or second bottom as they style it but the land is good though with many stones natural conditions you know for New Englanders It was pleasant for a New England man not long removed from his native soil to find these people who are a century away from home still claiming kinship At the Big Hockhocking River one hundred ninety seven miles on a high semicircular bottom is Hockingport a hamlet with a population of three hundred Here on a still higher bench a quarter of a mile back from the river Lord Dunmore built Fort Gower one of a chain of posts along his march against the Northwest Indians seventeen seventy four It was from here that he marched to the Pickaway Plains on the Scioto near Circleville O and concluded that treaty of peace to which Chief Logan refused his consent There are some remains yet left of this palisaded earthwork of a century and a quarter ago but the greater part has been obliterated by plowing and a dwelling occupies a portion of the site It had been very warm and we had needed an awning as far down as Hockingport where we cooled off by lying on the grass in the shade of the village blacksmith s shop which is as well the ferry house with the bell hung between two tall posts at the top of the bank its rope dangling down for public use The smith ferryman came out with his wife a burly good natured couple and joined us in our lounging for it is not every day that river travelers put in at this dreamy far away port The wife had camped with her husband when he was boss of a railway construction gang and both of them frankly envied us our trip So did a neighboring storekeeper a tall lean grave young man clean shaven coatless and vestless with a blue glass stud on his collarless white shirt Apparently there was no danger of customers walking away with his goods for he left his store door open to all comers not once glancing thitherward in the half hour he sat with us on a stick of timber in which he pensively carved his name Life goes easily in Hockingport Years ago there was some business up the Big Hocking short for Big Hockhocking a stream of a half dozen rods width but now no steamer ventures up the railroads do it all as for the Ohio well the steamers now and then put off a box or bale for the four shop keepers and once in a while a passenger patronizes the landing There is still a little country traffic and formerly a sawmill was in operation here you see its ruins down there below Hockingport is a type of several rustic hamlets we have seen to day they are often in pairs one either side of the river for companionship s sake We are idling despite the knowledge that on turning every big bend we are getting farther and farther south and mid June on the Lower Ohio is apt to be sub tropical But the sinking sun gives us a shadowy right bank and that is most welcome The current is only spasmodically good Every night the river falls from three to six inches and there are long stretches of slack water The steamers pick their way carefully we do not give them as wide a berth as formerly for the wakes they turn are no longer savage but wakes even when sent out by stern wheelers at full speed now give us little trouble it did not take long to learn the knack of taking them Whether you meet them at right angles or in the trough there is the same delicious sensation of rising and falling on the long swells there is no danger so long as you are outside the line of foaming breakers within those you may ship water which is not desirable when there is a cargo But the boys at the towns sometimes put out in their rude punts into the very vortex of disturbance being dashed about in the white roar at the base of the ponderous paddle wheels like a Fiji Islander in his surf boat We heard the other day of a boatload of daring youngsters being caught by the wheel their craft smashed into kindling wood and they themselves all drowned but one The hills to day sometimes break sharply off leaving an eroded often vine festooned palisade some fifty feet in height at the base of which is a long tree clad slope of debris then a narrow level terrace from fifty to a hundred yards in width which drops suddenly to a rocky beach this in turn is often lined along the water s edge with irregularly shaped boulders from the size of Pilgrim to fifteen or twenty feet in height and worn smooth with the grinding action of the river The effect is highly picturesque We shall have much of this below At the foot of one of these palisades lay a shanty boat with nets sprawled over the roof to dry and a live box anchored hard by Hello the boat brought to the window the head of the lone fisherman who dreamily peered at us as we announced our wish to become his customers A sort of poor white Neptune this tall lean lantern jawed old fellow with great round iron rimmed spectacles over his fishy eyes his hair and beard in long snaky locks and clothing in dirty tatters As he put out in his skiff to reach the live box he continuously spewed tobacco juice about him and in an undertone growled garrulously as though used to soliloquize in his hermitage where he lay at outs with the world He had been in this spot for two years he said and sold fish to the daily Parkersburg steamer when there were any fish But for six months past he hadn t made enough to keep him in grub and had now and then to go up to the city and earn something For forty years had he followed the apostles calling on this yere Ohio and the fishing was never so poor as now yes sir hard times had struck his business just like other folks He thought the oil wells were tainting the water and the fish wouldn t breed and the iron slag too was spoiling the river and he knew it He finally produced for us out of his box a three pound fish white perch calico bass and catfish formed his stock in trade but before handing it over demanded the requisite fifteen cents Evidently he had had dealings with a dishonest world this hermit fisher and had learned a thing or two Perfect camping places are not to be found every day There are so many things to think of a good landing place good height above the water level in case of a sudden rise a dry shady level spot for the tent plenty of wood and if possible a spring and not too close proximity to a house Occasionally we meet with what we want when we want it but quite as often ideal camping places while abundant half the day are not to be found at five o clock our usual hour for homeseeking The Doctor is our agent for this task for being bow oar he can clamber out most easily This evening he ranged both shores for a considerable distance with ill success so that we are settled on a narrow Ohio sand beach in the midst of a sparse willow copse only two feet above the river Dinner was had at the very water s edge After a time a wind storm arose and flapped the tent right vigorously causing us to pin down tightly and weight the sod cloth while amid distant thundering every preparation was made for a speedy embarkation in the event of flood The bellow of the frogs all about us the scream of toads and the heavy swash of passing steamers dangerously near our door will be a sufficient lullaby to night CHAPTER X Cliff dwellers on Long Bottom Pomeroy Bend Letart s Island and Rapids Game in the early day Rainy weather In a cracker home Letart s Island Tuesday May fifteenth After we had gone to bed last night we in the tent the Doctor and Pilgrim under the fly which serves as a porch roof the heavenly floodgates lifted the rain coming in sheets beat a fierce tattoo on the tightly stretched canvas and visions of a sudden rise in the fickle river were uppermost in our dreams Everything about us was sopping at daybreak but the sun rose clear and warm from a bed of eastern clouds and the midnight gale had softened to a gentle breeze Palisades were frequent to day We stopped just below camp at an especially picturesque Ohio hamlet Long Bottom two hundred seven miles where the dozen or so cottages are built close against the bald rock Clambering over great water worn boulders at the river s brink the Doctor and I made our way up through a dense tangle of willows and poison ivy and grape vines emerging upon the country road which passes at the foot of this row of modern cliff dwellings For the most part little gardens with neat palings run down from the cottages to the road One sprawling log house fairly embowered in vines and overtopped by the palisade rising sheer for thirty feet above its back door looked in this setting for all the world like an Alpine chalet lacking only stones on the roof to complete the picture I took a kodak shot at this also at a group of tousle headed children at the door of a decrepit shanty built entirely within a crevice of the rock their Hibernian mother with one hand holding an apron over her head and the other shielding her eyes shrilly crying to a neighboring cliff dweller Miss McCarthy Miss McCarthy There s a feller here a photergraph n all the people in the Bottom Come quick Then they eagerly pressed around me Germans and Irish big and little women and children mostly asking for a view of the picture which I gave all in turn by letting them peep into the ground glass finder a pretty picture they said it was with the colors all in and wonderfully like though a wee bit small Speaking of color we are daily struck with the brilliant hues in the workaday dresses of women and children seen along the river Red calico predominates but blues and yellows and even greens are seen brightly splashing the somber landscape After Long Bottom we enter upon the south sweeping Pomeroy Bend of the Ohio commencing at Murraysville two hundred eight miles and ending at Pomeroy two hundred forty seven miles It is of itself a series of smaller bends and as we twist about upon our course the wind strikes us successively on all quarters sometimes giving the Doctor a chance to try his sail which he raises on the slightest provocation but at all times agreeably ruffling the surface that would otherwise reflect the glowing sun like a mirror The sloping margins of the rich bottoms are now often cultivated almost to the very edge of the stream with a line of willow trees left as a protecting fringe Farmers doing this take a gambling risk of a summer rise Where the margins have been left untouched by the plow there is a dense mass of vegetation sycamores big of girth and towering to a hundred feet or more abound on every hand the willows are phenomenally rapid growers and in all available space is the rank thick standing growth of an annual locally styled horse weed which rears a cane like stalk full eighteen or twenty feet high it has now attained but four or five feet but the dry stalks of last year s growth are everywhere about showing what a formidable barrier to landing these giant weeds must be in midsummer We chose for a camping place Letart s Island two hundred thirty two miles on the West Virginia side not far below Milwood From the head where our tent is pitched on a sandy knoll thick grown to willows a long gravel spit runs far over toward the Ohio shore The West Virginia channel is narrow slow and shallow that between us and Ohio has been lessened by the island to half its usual width and the current sweeps by at a six mile gait in which the Doctor and I found it difficult to keep our footing while having our customary evening dip Our island is two long forested humps of sand connected by a stretch of gravel beach giving every evidence of being submerged in times of flood everywhere are chaotic heaps of driftwood many cords in extent derelict trees are lodged in the tops of the highest willows and maples ghostly giants sprawling in the moonlight there is an abandon of vegetable debris layer after layer laid down in sandy coverlids Wild grasses which flourish on all these flooded lands here attain enormous size Dispensing with our cots for the nonce we have spread our blankets over heaps of dried grass pulled from the monster tufts of last year s growth The Ohio is capable of raising giant floods it is still falling with us but there are signs at hand beyond the slight sprinkle which cooled the air for us at bedtime of rainy weather after the long drouth When the feeders in the Alleghanies begin to swell we shall perch high o nights Near Cheshire O Wednesday May sixteenth The fine current at the island gave us a noble start this morning The river soon widens but Letart s Falls a mile or two below continue the movement and we went fairly spinning on our way These so called falls rapids rather long possessed the imagination of early travelers Some of the chroniclers have while describing them indulged in flights of fancy A They are of slight consequence however even at this low stage of water save to the careless canoeist who has had no experience in rapid water well strewn with sunken boulders The scenery of the locality is wild and somewhat impressive The Ohio bank is steep and rugged abounding in narrow little terraces of red clay deeply gullied and dotted with rough mean shanties It all had a forbidding aspect when viewed in the blinding sun but before we had passed an intervening cloud cast a deep shadow over the scene and softening the effect made the picture more pleasing Croghan was at Letart seventeen sixty five on one of his land viewing trips for the Ohio Company and tells us that he saw a vast migrating herd of buffalo cross the river here In the beginning of colonization in this valley buffalo and elk were to be seen in herds of astonishing size traces of their well beaten paths through the hills and toward the salt licks of Kentucky and Illinois were observable until within recent years Gordon an early traveler down the Ohio seventeen sixty six speaks of great herds of buffalo we observed on the beaches of the river and islands into which they come for air and coolness in the heat of the day he commenced his raids on them a hundred miles below Pittsburg Hutchins seventeen seventy eight says the whole country abounds in Bears Elks Buffaloe Deer Turkies c B Bears panthers wolves eagles and wild turkeys were indeed very plenty at first but soon became extinct The theory is advanced by doctor Doddridge in his Notes on Virginia that hunters dogs introduced hydrophobia among the wolves and this ridded the country of them sooner than they would naturally have gone but they were still so numerous in eighteen seventeen that the traveler Palmer heard them nightly barking on both banks Venomous serpents were also numerous in pioneer days and stayed longer The story is told of a tumulus up toward Moundsville that abounded in snakes particularly rattlers The settlers thought to dig them out but they came to such a mass of human bones that that plan was abandoned Then they instituted a blockade by erecting a tight board fence around the mound and thus entrapping the reptiles extirpated the colony in a few days Paroquets were once abundant west of the Alleghanies up to the southern shore of the Great Lakes and great flocks haunted the salt springs but to day they may be found only in the middle Southern states There were in a state of nature no crows blackbirds or song birds in this valley they followed in the wake of the colonist The honey bee came with the white man or rather just preceded him Rats followed the first settlers then opossums and fox squirrels still later It is thought too that the sand hill and whooping cranes and the great blue herons which we daily see in their stately flight are birds of these later days when the neighborhood of man has frightened away the enemies which once kept them from thriving in the valley Turkey buzzards appear to remain alone of the ancient birds the earliest travelers note their presence in great flocks and to day there are few vistas open to us without from one to dozens of them wheeling about in mid air seeking what they may devour Public opinion in the valley is opposed to the wanton killing of these scavengers so useful in a climate as warm as this Three miles below Letart s Rapids is the motley settlement of Antiquity O a long row of cabins and cottages nestled at the base of a high vine clad palisade similar to that which yesterday we visited at Long Bottom Some of these cliff dwellings are picturesque some exhibit the prosperity of their owners but many are squalid At the water s edge is that which has given its name to the locality an ancient rock which once bore some curious Indian carving Hall eighteen twenty found only one figure remaining a man in a sitting posture making a pipe to day even thus much has been largely obliterated by the elements But Antiquity itself is not quite dead There is a ship yard here and a sawmill in active operation besides the ruins of two others We also passed Racine two hundred forty miles another Ohio town a considerable place no doubt although only the tops of the buildings were from the river level to be seen above the high bank these and an enticing view up the wharf street Of more immediate interest just then were the heavens now black and threatening Putting in hurriedly to the West Virginia shore we pitched tent on a shelving clay beach shielded by the ever present willows and in five minutes had everything under shelter With a rumble and bang and a great flurry of wind the thunder storm broke upon us in full fury There had been no time to run a ditch around the tent so we spread our cargo atop of the cots The Boy engineered riverward the streams of water which flowed in beneath the canvas W ever practical caught rain from the dripping fly and did the family washing while the Doctor and I prepared a rather pasty lunch An hour later we bailed out Pilgrim and once more ventured upon our way It is a busy district between Racine and Sheffield two hundred fifty one miles For eleven miles upon the Ohio bank there are few breaks between the towns Racine Syracuse Minersville Pomeroy Coalport Middleport and Sheffield Coal mines and salt works abound with other industries interspersed and the neighborhood appears highly prosperous Its metropolis is Pomeroy in shape a shoe string town much of it not over two blocks wide and stretching along for two miles at the foot of high palisades West Virginia is not far behind in enterprise with the salt work towns of New Haven Hartford and Mason City bespeaking in their names a Connecticut ancestry The afternoon sun gushed out and the face of Nature was cleanly beautiful as leaving the convolutions of the Pomeroy Bend we entered upon that long river sweep to the south by southwest which extends from Pomeroy to the Big Sandy a distance of sixty eight miles A mile or two below Cheshire O two hundred fifty six miles we put in for the night on the West Virginia shore There is a natural pier of rocky ledge above that a sloping beach of jagged stone and then the little grassy terrace which we have made our home Searching for milk and eggs I walked along a railway track and then up through a cornfield to a little log farm house whose broad porch was shingled with shakes and shaded by a lusty grape vine Fences house and outbuildings had been newly whitewashed and there was all about an uncommon air of neatness A stout little girl of eleven or twelve met me at the narrow gate opening through the garden palings It may be because a gypsying trip like this roughens one in many ways for man with long living near to Nature s heart becomes of the earth earthy that she at first regarded me with suspicious eyes and with one hand resting gracefully on her hip parleyed over the gate as to what price I was paying in cash for eggs and milk and where I hailed from With her wealth of blond hair done up in a saucy knot behind her round honest face her lips thick and parted over pearly teeth her nose saucily retrousse and her flashing outspoken blue eyes this barefooted child of Nature had a certain air of authority a consciousness of power which made her womanly beyond her years She must have seen that I admired her this little cracker queen in her clean but tattered calico frock for her mood soon melted and with much grace she ushered me within the house Calling Sam an eight year old to keep the general lem n comp ny she prettily excused herself and scampered off up the hillside in search of the cows A barefooted loose jointed gaunt sandy haired freckled open eyed youngster is Sam He came lounging into the room and taking my hat hung it on a peg above the fireplace then dropping into a big rocking chair with his muddy legs hanging over an arm at once with a curious old fashioned air began keeping company by telling me of the new litter of pigs with as little diffidence as though I were an old neighbor who had dropped in on the way to the cross roads And thet thar new Shanghai rooster mister ain t he a beauty He cost a dollar he did a dollar in silver sir There was no difficulty in drawing Sam out He is frankness itself What was he going to make of himself Well he lowed he wanted to be either a locomotive engineer or a steamboat captain hadn t made up his mind which But whatever a boy wants to be he will be said Sam with the decided tone of a man of the world who had seen things I asked Sam what the attractions were in the life of an engine driver He lowed they went so fast through the world and saw so many different people and in their lifetime served on different roads maybe and surely they must meet with some excitement And in that of a steamboat captain Oh now yew re talk n mister A right smart business thet A boss n o people round a seein o th world and noth n t all to do Now that s right smart I take it It was plain where his heart lay He saw the steamers pass the farm daily and once he had watched one unload at Point Pleasant well that was the life for him Sam will have to be up and doing if he is to be the monarch of a stern wheeler on the Ohio but many another cracker boy has attained this exalted station and Sam is of the sort to win his way Soon the kine came lowing into the yard and my piquant young friend who had met me at the gate stood in the doorway talking with us both while their brother Charley an awkward self conscious lad of ten took my pail and milked into it the required two quarts It is a large square room where I was so agreeably entertained The well chinked logs are scrupulously whitewashed the parental bed with gay pillow shams bought from a peddler occupies one corner a huge brick fireplace opens black and yawning into the base of a great cobblestone chimney reared against the house without after the fashion of the country on pegs about hang the best clothes of the family while a sewing machine a deal table a cheap little mirror as big as my palm a few unframed chromos and a gaudy Family Record chart hung in an old looking glass frame with appropriate holes for tintypes of father mother and children complete the furnishings of the apartment which is parlor sitting room dining room and bedroom all in one My little queen was evidently proud of her throne room and noted with satisfaction my interest in the Family Record When I had paid her for butter and eggs at retail rates she threw in an extra egg and despite my protests would have Charley take the pail out to the cow for an extra squirt or two for good measure I was bidding them all good bye and the queen was pressing me to come again in the morning fer more stuff ef ye lowed yew wanted any when the mother of the little brood appeared from over the fields where she had been to carry water to her lord A fair intelligent rather fine looking woman but barefooted like the rest from her neck behind dangled a red sunbonnet and a sunny haired child of five was in her arms sort o weak in her lungs poor thing she sadly said as I snapped my fingers at the smiling tot I tarried a moment with the good mother as sitting upon the porch she serenely smiled upon her children whose eyes were now lit with responsive love and I wondered if there were not some romance hidden here whereby a dash of gentler blood had through this sweet tempered woman been infused into the coarse clay of the bottom Footnote A Notably Ashe s Travels but Palmer while saying that they are the only obstruction to the navigation of the Ohio except the rapids at Louisville declares them to be of slight difficulty and referring to Ashe s account says Like great part of his book it is all romance Footnote B The last buffalo on record in the Upper Ohio region was killed in the Great Kanawha Valley a dozen miles from Charleston W Va in eighteen fifteen Five years later in the same vicinity was killed probably the last elk seen east of the Ohio CHAPTER XI Battle of Point Pleasant The story of Gallipolis Rosebud Huntington The genesis of a house boater Near Glenwood W Va Thursday May seventeenth By eight o clock this morning we were in Point Pleasant W Va at the mouth of the Great Kanawha River two hundred sixty three miles Celoron was here the eighteenth of August seventeen forty nine and on the east bank of the river the site of the present village buried at the foot of an elm one of his leaden plates asserting the claim of France to the Ohio basin Ninety seven years later a boy unearthed this interesting but futile proclamation and it rests to day in the museum of the Virginia Historical Society The Great Kanawha Valley long had a romantic interest for Englishmen concerned in Western lands It was in the grant to the old Ohio Company but that corporation handicapped in many ways was practically dead by the time of Lord Dunmore s war It had many rivals more or less ephemeral among them the scheme of George Mercer seventeen seventy three to have the territory between the Alleghanies and the Ohio the West Virginia of to day erected into the Province of Vandalia with himself as governor and his capital at the mouth of the Great Kanawha Washington owned a ten thousand acre tract on both sides of the river commencing a short distance above the mouth which he surveyed in person in October seventeen seventy and in seventeen seventy three we find him advertising to sell or lease it among the inducements he offered was the scheme for establishing a new government on the Ohio and the contiguity of his lands to the seat of government which it is more than probable will be fixed at the mouth of the Great Kanawha Had not the Revolution broken out and nipped this and many another budding plan for Western colonization there is little doubt that what we call West Virginia would have been established as a state a century earlier than it was A A few days ago we were at Mingo Bottom where lived Chief Logan whose family were treacherously slaughtered by border ruffians seventeen seventy four The Mingos ablaze with the fire of vengeance carried the war pipe through the neighboring villages runners were sent in every direction to rouse the tribes tomahawks were unearthed war posts were planted messages of defiance sent to the Virginians and in a few days Lord Dunmore s war was in full swing from Cumberland Gap to Fort Pitt from the Alleghanies to the Wabash His lordship then governor of Virginia was full of energy and proved himself a competent military manager The settlers were organized the rude log forts were garrisoned forays were made against the Indian villages as far away as Muskingum and an army of nearly three thousand backwoodsmen armed with smooth bores and clad in fringed buckskin hunting shirts was put in the field One division of this army eleven hundred strong under general Andrew Lewis descended the Great Kanawha River and on Point Pleasant met Cornstalk a famous Shawnee chief who while at first peaceful had by the Logan tragedy been made a fierce enemy of the whites and was now the leader of a thousand picked warriors gathered from all parts of the Northwest On the tenth of October from dawn until dusk was here waged in a gloomy forest one of the most bloody and stubborn hand to hand battles ever fought between Indians and whites especially notable too because for the first time the rivals were about equal in number The combatants stood behind trees in Indian fashion and it is hard to say who displayed the best generalship Cornstalk or Lewis B When the pall of night covered the hideous contest the whites had lost one fifth of their number while the savages had sustained but half as many casualties Cornstalk s followers had had enough however and withdrew before daylight leaving the field to the Americans A few days later General Lewis joined Lord Dunmore who headed the other wing of the army which had proceeded by the way of Forts Pitt and Gower on the Pickaway plains in Ohio and there a treaty was made with the Indians who assented to every proposition made them They surrendered all claim to lands south of the Ohio River returned their white prisoners and stolen horses and gave hostages for future good behavior Here at Point Pleasant a year later Fort Randolph was built and garrisoned by a hundred men for despite the treaty the Indians were still troublesome For a long time Pittsburg Redstone and Randolph were the only garrisoned forts on the frontier The Point Pleasant of to day is a dull sleepy town of twenty five hundred inhabitants with that unkempt air and preponderance of lounging negroes so common to small Southern communities The bottom is rolling fringed with large hills and on the Ohio side drops suddenly for fifty feet to a shelving beach of gravel and clay Crooked Creek in whose narrow winding valley some of the severest fighting was had empties into the Kanawha a half mile up the stream at the back of the town It was painful to meet several men of intelligence who had long been engaged in trade here to whom the Battle of Point Pleasant was a shadowy event whose date they could not fix nor whose importance understand it seemed to be little more a part of their lives than an obscure contest between Matabeles and whites in far off Africa It is time that our Western and Southern folk were awakened to an appreciation of the fact that they have a history at their doors quite as significant in the annals of civilization as that which induces pilgrimages to Ticonderoga and Bunker Hill Four miles below Pilgrim was beached for a time at Gallipolis O two hundred sixty seven miles which has a story all its own The district belonged a century ago to the Scioto Company an offshoot of the Marietta enterprise Joel Barlow the poet of the Revolution was sent to Paris May seventeen eighty eight as agent for the sale of lands As the result of his personal popularity there and his flaming immigration circulars and maps he disposed of a hundred thousand acres to settle on which six hundred French emigrants sailed for America in February seventeen ninety They were peculiarly unsuited for colonization even under the most favorable conditions being in the main physicians jewelers and other artisans a few mechanics and noblemen s servants while many were without trade or profession Upon arrival in Alexandria Va they found that their deeds were valueless the land never having been paid for by the Scioto speculators moreover the tract was filled with hostile Indians However five hundred of them pushed on to the region by way of Redstone and reached here by flatboat in a destitute condition The Marietta neighbors were as kind as circumstances would allow and cabins were built for them on what is now the Public Square of Gallipolis But they were ignorant of the first principles of forestry or gardening the initial winter was exceptionally severe Indian forays sapped the life of the colony yellow fever decimated the survivors and altogether the little settlement suffered a series of disasters almost unparalleled in the story of American colonization Although finally reimbursed by Congress with a special land grant the emigrants gradually died off until now so at least we were assured but three families of descendants of the original Gauls are now living here It was the American element aided by sturdy Germans who in time took hold of the decayed French settlement and built up the prosperous little town of six thousand inhabitants which we find to day It is a conservative town with little perceptible increase in population but there are many fine brick blocks the stores have large stocks attractively displayed and there is in general a comfortable tone about the place which pleases a stranger The Public Square where the first Gauls had their little forted town appears to occupy the space of three or four city blocks there is the customary band stand in the center and seats plentifully provided along the graveled walks which divide neat plots of grass Over the riverward entrance to the square is an arch of gas pipe perforated for illumination and bearing the dates seventeen ninety eighteen ninety a relic this of the centennial which Gallipolis celebrated in the last named year It was with some difficulty that we found a camping place this evening For several miles the approaches were nearly knee deep in mud for a dozen feet back from the water s edge or else the banks were too steep or the farmers had cultivated so closely to the brink as to leave us no room for the tent In one gruesome spot on the Ohio bank where a projecting log fortunately served as a pier the Doctor landed for a prospecting tour while I ascended a zigzag path through steep and rugged land to a nest of squalid cabins perched by a shabby hillside road A vicious dog came down to meet me half way and might have succeeded in carrying off a portion of my clothing had not his owner whistled him back A queer dingy human wasp nest this dirty little shanty hamlet of Rosebud Pigs and children wallowed in comradeship and as every cabin on the precipitous slope necessarily has a basement this is used as the common barn for chickens goats pigs and cow It was pleasant to find that there was no sweet milk to be had in Rosebud for it is kept in open pans in these fetid rooms and soon sours and the cows had not yet come down from the hills Water too was at a premium There was none to be had save what had fallen from the clouds and been stored in a foul cistern which seemed common property I drew a pailful of it not to displease the disheveled group which surrounded me full of questions but on the first turning in the lane emptied the vessel upon the back of a pig which was darting by with murderous squeal The long twilight was well nigh spent when on the Ohio side a mile or two above Glenwood W Va two hundred eighty seven miles we came upon a wide level beach of gravel below a sloping willowed terrace above which sharply rose the second bottom Ascending an angling farm roadway while the others pitched camp I walked over the undulating bottom to the nearest of a group of small neat farmhouses and applied for milk While a buxom maid went out and milked a Jersey that had chanced to come home ahead of her fellows I sat on the rear porch gossiping with the farm wife a Pennsylvania Dutch dame of ample proportions attired in light blue calico and with huge spectacles over her broad flat nose She and her man own a hundred and fifty acres on the bottom with three cows and other stock in proportion and sell butter to those neighbors who have no cows and to houseboat people As for these latter though they were her customers she had none too good an opinion of them they pretended to fish but in reality only picked up a living from the farmers nevertheless she did know of some weakly delicate people who had taken to boat life for economy s sake and because an invalid could at least fish and his family help him at it Near Huntington W Va Friday May eighteenth Backed by ravine grooved hills and edged at the waterside with great picturesque boulders planed and polished by the ever rushing river the little bottom farms along our path to day are pretty bits But the houses are the reverse of this having much the aspect of slave cabins of the olden time small one story log and frame shanties roof and gables shingled with shakes and little vegetable gardens inclosed by palings The majority of these small farmers whose tracts seldom exceed a hundred acres rent their land rather than own it The plan seems to be half and half as to crops with a rental fee for house and pasturage One man having a hundred and twenty acres told me he paid three dollars a month for his house and for pasturage a dollar a month per head We were in several of the small towns to day At Millersport O two hundred ninety three miles while W and the Doctor were up town the Boy and I remained at the wharf boat to talk with the owner The wharf boat is a conspicuous object at every landing of importance being a covered barge used as a storehouse for coming and going steamboat freight It is a private enterprise for public convenience with certain monopolistic privileges at the incorporated towns This Millersport boat cost twelve hundred dollars the proprietor charges twenty per cent of each freight bill for handling and storing goods a fee of twenty five cents for each steamer that lands and certain special fees for live stock Athalia Haskellville and Guyandotte were other representative towns Stave making appears to be the chief industry and as timber is getting scarce the communities show signs of decay We had been told above that Huntington W Va three hundred six miles was a right smart chunk of a town And it is There are sixteen thousand people here in a finely built city spread over a broad flat plain Brick and stone business buildings abound the broad streets are paved with brick and an electric car line runs out along the bottom through the suburb of Ceredo W Va to Catlettsburg Ky nine miles away Huntington is the center of a large group of riverside towns supported by iron making and other industries Guyandotte and Ceredo in West Virginia Catlettsburg just over the border in Kentucky and Proctorville Broderickville Frampton Burlington and South Point on the opposite shore We are camping to night in the dense willow grove which lines the West Virginia beach from Huntington to the Big Sandy Above us on the wide terrace are fields and orchards beyond which we occasionally hear the gong of electric cars A public path runs by the tent leading from the lower settlements into Huntington Among our visitors have been two houseboat men whose craft is moored a quarter of a mile below One of them is tall thick set forty with a round florid face and huge mustaches evidently a jolly fellow at his best despite a certain dubious piratical air a jaunty narrow brimmed straw hat is perched over one ear to add to the general effect and between his teeth a corn cob pipe His younger companion is medium sized slim and loose jointed with a baggy gait his cap thrown over his head with the visor in the rear a rustic clown not yet outgrown his freckles But three weeks from the parental farm in Putnam County Ky the world is as yet a romance to him The fellow is interesting because in him can be seen the genesis of a considerable element of the houseboat fraternity I wonder how long it will be before his partner has him broken in as a river pirate of the first water Footnote A Washington was much interested in a plan to connect by a canal the James and Great Kanawha Rivers separated at their sources by a portage of but a few miles in length The distance from Point Pleasant to Richmond is four hundred eighty five miles In seventeen eighty five Virginia incorporated the James River Company of which Washington was the first president The project hung fire because of party spirit and sectional jealousies until eighteen thirty two when a new company was incorporated under which the James was improved eighteen thirty six fifty three but the Kanawha was untouched In eighteen seventy four United States engineers presented a plan calling for an expenditure of sixty millions but there the matter rests The Kanawha is navigable by large steamers for sixty miles up to the falls at Charleston and beyond almost to its source by light craft Footnote B Hall in Romance of Western History eighteen twenty says that when Washington was tendered command of the Revolutionary army he replied that it should rather be given to general Andrew Lewis of whose military abilities he had a high opinion Lewis was a captain in the Little Meadows affair seventeen fifty two and a companion of Washington in Braddock s defeat seventeen fifty five CHAPTER XII In a fog The Big Sandy Rainy weather Operatic gypsies An ancient tavern Ironton O Saturday May nineteenth When we turned in last night it was refreshingly cool Heavy clouds were scurrying across the face of the moon By midnight a copious rain was falling wind gusts were flapping our roof and a sudden drop in temperature rendered sadly inadequate all the clothing we could muster into service We slept late in consequence and after rigging a wind break with the rubber blankets during breakfast huddled around the stove which had been brought in to replace Pilgrim under the fly When at half past nine we pushed off our houseboat neighbors thrust their heads from the window and waved us farewell A dense fog hung like a cloud over land and river There was a stiff north east wind which we avoided by seeking the Ohio shore where the high hills formed a break there too the current was swift and carried us down right merrily Shattered by the wind great banks of fog rolled up stream sometimes enveloping us so as to narrow our view to a radius of a dozen rods again through the rifts giving us momentary glimpses on the right of rich green hills towering dark and steep above us iridescent with browns and grays and many shades of green of whitewashed cabins single or in groups standing out with startling distinctness from sombre backgrounds of houseboats many hued moored to willowed banks or bolstered high upon shaly beaches of the opposite bottom with its corrugated cliff of clay and now and then a slowly puffing steamboat cautiously feeling its way through the chilling gloom a monster to be avoided by little Pilgrim and her crew for the possibility of being run down in a fog is not pleasant to contemplate On board one of these steamers was a sorry company apparently a Sunday school excursion Children in gala dress huddled in swarms on the lee of the great smoke stacks and in imagination we heard their teeth chatter as they glided by us and in another moment were engulfed in the mist We catch sight for a moment through a cloud crevasse of Ceredo the last town in West Virginia a small saw milling community stuck upon the edge of the clay cliff with the broad level bottom stretching out behind like a prairie A giant railway bridge here spans the Ohio a weird impressive thing as we sweep under it in the swirling current and crane our necks to see the great stone piers lose themselves in the cloud But the Big Sandy River three hundred fifteen miles which divides West Virginia and Kentucky was wholly lost to view In an opening a few moments later however we had a glimpse of the dark line of her valley below which the hills again descend to the Ohio s bank Catlettsburg the first Kentucky town is at the junction and extends along the foot of the ridge for a mile or two apparently not over two blocks wide with a few outlying shanties on the shoulders of the uplands Washington was surveying here on the Big Sandy in seventeen seventy and entered for one John Fry twenty eighty four acres round the site of Louisa a dozen miles up the river this was the first survey made in Kentucky but a few months later than Boone s first advent as a hunter on the dark and bloody ground and five years before the first permanent settlement in the State Washington deserves to be remembered as a Kentucky pioneer We have not only steamers to avoid they appear to be unusually numerous about here but snags as well With care the whereabouts of a steamer can be distinguished as it steals upon us from the superior whiteness of its column of exhaust penetrating the bank of dark gray fog and occasionally the echoes are awakened by the burly roar of its whistle which in times like this acts as a fog horn But the snag is an insidious enemy not revealing itself until we are within a rod or two and then there is a quick cry of warning from the stern sheets Hard a port or Starboard quick and only a strong side pull aided by W s paddle sends us free from the jagged branching mass which might readily have swamped poor Pilgrim had she taken it at full tilt At Ashland Ky three hundred twenty miles we stopped for supplies There are six thousand inhabitants here with some good buildings and a fine broad stone wharf but it is rather a dingy place The steamer Bonanza had just landed On the double row of flaggings leading up to the summit of the bank were two ant like processions of Kentucky folk one leisurely climbing townward with their bags and bundles the other hurrying down with theirs to the boat which was ringing its bell blowing off steam and in other ways creating an uproar which seemed to turn the heads of the negro roustabouts and draymen who bustled around with a great chatter and much false motion The railway may be doing the bulk of the business but it does it unostentatiously the steamboat makes far more disturbance in the world and is a finer spectacle Dozens of boys are lounging at the wharf foot watching the lively scene with fascinated eyes probably every one of them stoutly possessed of an ambition akin to that of my young friend in the Cheshire Bottom A rain storm broke the fog a cold raw miserable rain No clothing we could don appeared to suffice against the chill and so at last we pitched camp upon the Ohio shore three miles above the Ironton wharf three hundred twenty five miles It is a muddy dreary nest up here among the dripping willows Just behind us on the slope is the inclined track of the Norfolk Western railway transfer down which trains are slid to a huge slip and thence ferried over the river into Kentucky above that on a narrow terrace is an ordinary railway line and still higher up a slippery clay bank lies the cottage strewn bottom which stretches on into Ironton thirteen thousand inhabitants We were a sorry looking party at lunch this noon hovering over the smoking stove which was set in the tent door with a wind screen in front and moist bedding hung all about in the vain hope of drying it in the feeble heat And sorrier still through the long afternoon as each encased in a sleeping bag we sat upon our cots circling around the stove W reading to us between chattering teeth from Barrie s When a Man s Single Tis good Scottish weather we re having but somehow our thoughts could not rest on Thrums and we were for the nonce a wee bit miserable Dinner degenerated into a smoky bite and then at dusk there was a council of war The air hangs thick with moisture our possessions are in various stages from damp to sopping wet and efforts at drying over the little stove are futile under such conditions It was demonstrated that there was not bed clothing enough in such an emergency as this indeed an inspection of that which was merely damp revealed the fact that but one person could be made comfortable to night Our bachelor Doctor volunteered to be that one So we bade him God speed and with toilet bag in hand I led my little family up a tortuous path so slippery in the rain that we were obliged in our muddy climb to cling to grass clumps and bushes And thus wet and bedraggled did we sally forth upon the Ironton Bottom seeking shelter for the night Fortunately we had not far to seek A kindly family took us in despite our gruesome aspect and our unlikely story for what manner of folk are we that go trapesing about in a skiff in such weather as this coming from nobody knows where and camping o nights in the muddy river bottoms Instead of sending us on in the drenching rain to a hotel three miles down the road or offering us a ticket on the Associated Charities these blessed people open their hearts and their beds to us without question and what more can weary pilgrims pray for Sciotoville O Sunday May twentieth After breakfast and settling our modest score we rejoined the Doctor and at ten o clock pulled out again being bidden good bye at the landing by the children of our hostess who had sent us by them a bottle of fresh milk as a parting gift It had rained almost continuously throughout the night To day we have a dark gray sky with fickle winds A charming color study all along our path the reds and grays and yellows of the high clay banks which edge the reciprocating bottoms the browns and yellows of hillside fields the deep greens of forest verdure the vivid white of bankside cabins and in the background of each new vista bold headlands veiled in blue W and the Boy are in the stern sheets wrapped in blankets for there is a smart chill in the air and we at the oars pull lively for warmth In our twisting course sometimes we have a favoring breeze and the Doctor rears the sail but it is a brief delight for the next turn brings the wind in our teeth and we set to the blades with renewed energy In the main we make good time The sugar loaf hills with their castellated escarpments go marching by with stately sweep Greenup Court House three hundred thirty four miles is a bright little Kentucky county seat well built at the feet of thickly forested uplands At the lower end of the village the Little Sandy enters through a wooded dale which near the mouth opens into a broad meadow Not many miles below is a high sloping beach picturesquely bestrewn with gigantic boulders which have in ages past rolled down from the hill tops above Here among the rocks we again set up a rude screen from the still piercing wind and each wrapped in a gay blanket lunch as operatic gypsies might in a romantic glen enjoying mightily our steaming chocolate and the warmth of our friendly stove for dessert taking a merry scamper for flowers over the ragged ascent from whence the boulders came Everywhere about is the trumpet creeper but not yet in bloom The Indian turnip is in blossom here and so the smaller Solomon s seal yellow spikes of toad flax blue and pink phlox glossy May apple high up on the hillside the fire pink and wintergreen and down by the sandy shore great beds of blue wild lupin and occasionally stately spikes of the familiar moth mullein With the temperature falling rapidly and a drizzling rain taking the starch out of our enthusiasm we early sought a camping ground For miles along here springs ooze from the base of the high clay bank walling in the wide and rocky Ohio beach and dry spots are few and far between We found one however a half mile above Little Scioto River three hundred forty six miles A with drift wood enough to furnish us for years and the beach thick strewn with fossils of a considerable variety of small bivalves which latter greatly delighted the Doctor and the Boy who have brought enough specimens to the tent door to stock a college museum Dinner over the crew hauled Pilgrim under cover and within prepared for her sailing master a cosy bed with the entire ship s stock of sleeping bags and blankets W the Boy and I then started off to find quarters in Sciotoville one thousand inhabitants which lies just below the river s mouth here a dozen rods wide Scrambling up the slimy bank through a maze of thorn trees brambles and sycamore scrubs we gained the fertile bottom above all luscious with tall grasses bespangled with wild red roses and the showy pentstemon The country road leading into the village is some distance inland but at last we found it just beyond a patch of Indian corn waist high and followed it through a covered bridge and down to a little hotel at the lower end of town A quaint old fashioned house the Sciotoville tavern with an inner gallery looking out into a small garden of peaches apples pears plums and grapes a famous grape country this by the way In our room opening from the gallery is an antique high post bedstead everywhere about are similar relics of an early day In keeping with the air of serene old age which pervades the hostelry is the white haired landlady herself In well starched apron white cap and gold rimmed glasses she benignly sits rocking by the office stove her feet on the fender reading Wallace s Prince of India and looking for all the world as if she had just stepped out of some old portrait of well of a tavern keeping Martha Washington Footnote A Two miles up the Little Scioto Pine Creek enters Perhaps a mile and a half up this creek was in seventeen seventy one a Mingo town called Horse Head Bottom which cuts some figure in border history as a nest of Indian marauders CHAPTER XIII The Scioto and the Shawanese A night at Rome Limestone Keels flats and boatmen of the olden time Rome O Monday May twenty first At intervals through the night rain fell and the temperature was but forty six deg at sunrise However by the time we were afloat the sun was fitfully gleaming through masses of gray cloud for a time giving promise of a warmer day Dark shadows rested on the romantic ravines and on the deep hollows of the hills but elsewhere over this gentle landscape of wooded amphitheatres broad green meadows rocky escarpments and many colored fields light and shade gayly chased each other Never were the vistas of the widening river more beautiful than to day There are saw mill and fire brick industries in the little towns which would be shabby enough in the full glare of day But they are all glorified in this changing light which brings out the rich yellows and reds in sharp relief against the gloomy background of the hills and mellows into loveliness the soft grays of unpainted wood At the mouth of the Scioto three hundred fifty four miles is Portsmouth O fifteen thousand inhabitants a well built substantial town with good shops It lies on a hill backed terrace some forty feet above the level of the neighboring bottoms which give evidence of being victims of the high floods periodically covering the low lands about the junction of the rivers Just across the Scioto is Alexandria and on the Kentucky side of the Ohio can be seen the white hamlet of Springville at the feet of the dentated hills which here closely approach the river The country about the mouth of the Scioto has long figured in Western annals Being a favorite rendezvous for the Shawanese it naturally became a resort for French and English fur traders The principal part of the first Shawanese village Shannoah Town in the old journals was below the Scioto s mouth on the site of Alexandria it was the chief town of this considerable tribe and here Gist was warned back when in March seventeen fifty one he ventured thus far while inspecting lands for the Ohio Company Two years later there was a great perhaps an unprecedented flood in the Ohio the water rising fifty feet above the ordinary level and destroying the larger part of the Shawanese village Some of the Indians moved to the Little Miami and others up the Scioto where they built successively Old and New Chillicothe but the majority remained and rebuilt their town on the higher land north of the Scioto where Portsmouth now stands An outlying band had had from before Gist s day a small town across the Ohio the site of Springville and it was here that George Croghan had his stone trading house which was doubtless after the manner of the times a frontier fortress In the French and Indian war seventeen fifty eight the Shawanese tiring of continual conflict withdrew from their Ohio River settlements to Old or Upper Chillicothe and thus closed the once important fur trade at the mouth of the Scioto It was while the Indian town at Portsmouth was still new seventeen fifty five that a party of Shawanese brought here a missus Mary Inglis whom they had captured while upon a scalping foray into Southwestern Virginia The story of the remarkable escape of this woman at Big Bone Lick of her long and terrible flight through the wilderness along the southern bank of the Ohio and up the Great Kanawha Valley and her final return to home and kindred who viewed her as one delivered from the grave is one of the most thrilling in Western history A Although the Shawanese had removed from their villages on the Ohio they still lived in new towns in the north within easy striking distance of the great river and until the close of the eighteenth century were a continual source of alarm to those whose business led them to follow this otherwise inviting highway to the continental interior Flatboats bearing traders immigrants and travelers were frequently waylaid by the savages who exhausted a fertile ingenuity in luring their victims to an ambuscade ashore and when not successful in this would in narrow channels or when the current swept the craft near land subject the voyagers to a fierce fusilade of bullets against which even stout plank barricades proved of small avail Vanceburgh Ky three hundred seventy five miles is a little town at the bottom of a pretty amphitheatre of hills There was a floating photographer there as we passed with a gang plank run out to the shore and framed specimens of his work hung along the town side of his ample barge Men with teams were getting wagon loads of sand from the beach for building purposes And a mile or two down a floating saw and planing mill the Clipper which we had seen before up river was busied upon logs which were being rolled down the beach from the bank above There are several such mills upon the river all seemingly occupied with tramp work for there is a deal of logging carried on in a small and careful way by farmers living on these wooded hills Vanceburgh was for the time bathed in sunlight but as we continued on our way a heavy rain cloud came creeping up over the dark Ohio hills and descending cut off our view at last lustily pelting us as we sat encased in rubber We had been in our ponchos most of the day as much for warmth as for shelter for there was an all pervading chill which the fickle sun breaking its early promise had failed to dissipate Thus amid showers alternating with sunbeams we proceeded unto Rome three hundred eighty one miles An Ohio village this Rome and so fallen from its once proud estate that its postoffice no longer bears the name it is simply Stout s if in these degenerate days you would send a letter hither It was smartly raining when we put in on the stony beach above Rome The tent went up in a hurry and under it the cargo but by the time all was housed the sun gushed out again and stretching a line we soon had our bedding hung to dry It is a charming situation in this melting atmosphere we have perhaps the most striking effects of cloud hill bottom islands and glancing river which have yet been vouchsafed us The Romans like most rural folk along the river below Wheeling chiefly drink cistern water Earlier in our pilgrimage we stoutly declined to patronize these rain water reservoirs and I would daily go far afield in search of a well but lately necessity has driven us to accept the cistern and often we find it even preferable to the well on those rare occasions when the latter can be found at villages or farm houses But there are cisterns and cisterns foul holes like that at Rosebud others that are neatness itself with all manner of grades between As for river water ever yellow with clay and thick as to motes much of it is used in the country parts This morning a bevy of negroes came down the bank from a Kentucky field and each in turn creeping out on a drift log for the ground is usually muddy a few feet up from the water s edge lay flat on his stomach and drank greedily from the roily mess At dusk there was again a damp chill and for the third time we left the Doctor to keep bachelor s hall upon the beach It was raining smartly by the time the tavern was reached nearly a mile down the bank Our advent caused a rare scurrying to and fro for two commercial drummers who were to depart by the early morning boat occupied the reg lar spar room the landlady informed us and a bit of a cubby hole off the back stairs had to be arranged for us Guests are rarities at the hostelry in Rome Near Ripley O Tuesday May twenty second There was an inch of snow last night on the hills about and a morning Cincinnati paper records a heavy fall in the Pennsylvania mountains The storm is general and the river rose two feet over night When we set off in mid morning it was raining heavily but in less than an hour the clouds broke and the rest of the day has been an alternation of chilling showers and bursts of warm sunshine with the same succession of alluring vistas over which play broad bands of changing light and shade and overhead the storm clouds torn and tossed in the upper currents Our landlord at Rome asserted at breakfast that Kentucky was fifty years behind the Ohio side in improvements of every sort Thus far we have not ourselves noticed differences of that degree Doubtless before the late civil war all the ante bellum travelers agree in this when the blight of slavery was resting on Virginia and Kentucky the south shore of the Ohio was as another country but to day so far as we can ascertain from a surface view the little villages on either side are equally dingy and woe begone and large Southern towns like Wheeling Parkersburg Point Pleasant and Maysville are very nearly an offset to Steubenville Marietta Pomeroy Ironton and Portsmouth North shore towns of wealth and prominence are more numerous than on the Dixie bank and are as a rule larger and somewhat better kept with the negro element less conspicuous but to say that the difference is anywhere near as marked as the landlord averred or as my own previous reading on the subject led me to expect is grossly to exaggerate After leaving Manchester O three hundred ninety four miles with a beautiful island at its door there are spasmodic evidences of the nearness of a great city market A large proportion of the hills are completely denuded of their timber and patched with rectangular fields of green brown and yellow upon the bottoms there are frequent truck farms now and then are stone quarries upon the banks with capacious barges moored in front and upon one or two rocky ledges were stone crushers getting out material for concrete pavements When we ask the bargemen in passing whither their loads are destined the invariable reply is The city meaning Cincinnati still seventy miles away Limestone Creek four hundred five miles occupies a large space in Western story for so insignificant a stream It is now not over a rod in width and at no season can it be over two or three One finds it with difficulty along the mill strewn shore of Maysville Ky the modern outgrowth of the Limestone village of pioneer days Limestone settled four years before Marietta or Cincinnati was long Kentucky s chief port of entry on the Ohio immigrants to the new state who came down the Ohio almost invariably booked for this point thence taking stage to Lexington and travelers in the early day seldom passed it by unvisited But years before there was any settlement here the valley of Limestone Creek which comes gently down from low lying hills was regarded as a convenient doorway into Kentucky When seventeen seventy six George Rogers Clark was coming down the river from Pittsburg with powder given by Patrick Henry then governor of Virginia for the defence of Kentucky settlers from British incited savages he was chased by the latter and putting into this creek hastily buried the precious cargo on its banks From here it was cautiously taken overland to the little forts by relays of pioneers through a gauntlet of murderous fire About twenty five miles from Limestone too was another attraction of the early time the great Blue Lick sulphur spring here in a valley surrounded by wooded hills formerly congregated great herds of buffalo and deer which licked the salty earth and hunters soon learned that this was a royal ground for game The Battle of the Blue Lick seventeen eighty two will ever be famous in the annals of Kentucky The Ohio was a mighty waterway into the continental interior in the olden days of Limestone Its only compeer was the so called Wilderness Road overland through Cumberland Gap the successor of Boone s trail just as Braddock s Road was the outgrowth of Nemacolin s path Until several years after the Revolutionary War the country north of the Ohio was still Indian land and settlement was restricted to the region south of the river so that practically all West going roads from the coast colonies centered either on Fort Pitt or Redstone or on Cumberland Gap On the out going trip the Wilderness Road was the more toilsome of the two but it was safer for the Ohio s banks were beset with thieving and often murdering savages In returning east many who had descended the river preferred going overland through the Gap to painfully pulling up stream through the shallows with the danger of Indians many times greater than when gliding down the deep current The distance over the two routes from Philadelphia was nearly equal when the windings of the river were taken into account but the Carolinians and the Georgians found Boone s Wilderness Road the shorter of the two in their migrations to the promised land of Ol Kaintuck And we should not overlook the fact that of much importance was still a third route up the James and down the Great Kanawha a route whose advantage to Virginia Washington early saw and tried in vain to have improved by a canal connecting the two rivers B Even before the opening of the Revolution the Ohio was the path of a considerable emigration We have seen Washington going down to the Great Kanawha with his surveying party in seventeen seventy and finding that settlers were hurrying into the country for a hundred miles below Fort Pitt By the close of the Revolution the Ohio was a familiar stream Pittsburg from a small trading hamlet and fording place had grown by seventeen eighty five to have a thousand inhabitants chiefly supported by boat building and the Kentucky carrying trade and boat yards were common up both the Monongahela and the Youghiogheny for a distance of sixty miles Nevertheless it was not until seventeen ninety two that there were regular conveniences for carrying passengers and freight down the Ohio the emigrant or trader on arrival at Pittsburg or Redstone had generally to wait until he could either charter a boat or have one built for him although sometimes he found a chance passenger flat going down C This difficulty in securing river transportation was one of the reasons why the majority chose the Wilderness Road The first thing that strikes a stranger from the Atlantic says Flint eighteen fourteen is the singular whimsical and amusing spectacle of the varieties of water craft of all shapes and structures These Flint who knew the river well separates into seven classes one Stately barges the size of an Atlantic schooner with a raised and outlandish looking deck one of these required a crew of twenty five to work it up stream two Keel boats long slender and graceful in form carrying from fifteen to thirty tons easily propelled over the shallows and much used in low water and in hunting trips to Missouri Arkansas and the Red River country three Kentucky flats or broad horns a species of ark very nearly resembling a New England pig stye these were from forty to a hundred feet in length fifteen feet in beam and carried from twenty to seventy tons Some of these flats were not unlike the house boats of to day It is no uncommon spectacle to see a large family old and young servants cattle hogs horses sheep fowls and animals of all kinds all embarked on one such bottom four Covered sleds ferry flats or Alleghany skiffs carrying from eight to twelve tons five Pirogues of from two to four tons burthen sometimes hollowed from one big tree or the trunks of two trees united and a plank rim fitted to the upper part six Common skiffs and dug outs seven Monstrous anomalies not classifiable and often whimsical in design To these might be added the floating shops or stores with a small flag out to indicate their character so frequently seen by Palmer eighteen seventeen and thriftily surviving unto this day minus the flag And Hall eighteen twenty eight speaks of a flat bottomed row boat twelve feet long with high sides and roof carrying an aged couple down the river they cared not where so long as they could find a comfortable home in the West for their declining and now childless years The first four classes here enumerated were allowed to drift down stream with the current being steered by long sweeps hung on pivots The average speed was about three miles an hour but the distances made were considerable from the fact that in the earliest days they were from fear of Indians usually kept on the move through day and night the crew taking turns at the sweeps that the craft might not be hung up on shore or entangled in the numerous snags and sawyers In going up stream the sweeps served as oars and in the shallows long pushing poles were used As for the boatmen who professionally propelled the keels and flats of the Ohio they were a class unto themselves half horse half alligator a contemporary styled them Rough fellows much given to fighting and drunkenness and ribaldry with a genius for coarse drollery and stinging repartee The river towns suffered sadly at the hands of this lawless dissolute element Each boat carried from thirty to forty boatmen and a number of such boats frequently traveled in company After the Indian scare was over they generally stopped over night in the settlements and the arrival of a squadron was certain to be followed by a disturbance akin to those so familiar a few years ago in our Southwest when the cowboys would undertake to paint a town red The boatmen were reckless of life limb and reputation and were often more numerous than those of the villagers who cared to enforce the laws while there was always present an element which abetted and throve on the vice of the river men The result was that mischief debauchery and outrage ran riot and in the inevitable fights the citizens were generally beaten The introduction of steamboats eighteen fourteen soon effected a revolution A steamer could carry ten times as much as a barge could go five times as fast and required fewer men it traveled at night quickly passing from one port to another pausing only to discharge or receive cargo its owners and officers were men of character and responsibility with much wealth in their charge and insisted on discipline and correct deportment The flatboat and the keel boat were soon laid up to rot on the banks and the boatmen either became respectable steamboat hands and farmers or went into the Far West where wild life was still possible Shipment on the river in the flatboat days was only during the spring and autumnal floods although an occasional summer rise such as we are now getting would cause a general activity In the autumn of eighteen eighteen Hall reports that three millions of dollars worth of merchandise were lying on the shores of the Monongahela waiting for a rise of water to float them to their destination The Western merchants were lounging discontentedly about the streets of Pittsburg or moping idly in its taverns like the victims of an ague The steamers did something to alleviate this condition of affairs but it was not until the coming of railways to carry goods quickly and cheaply across country to deep water ports like Wheeling that permanent relief was felt But what of the Maysville of to day It extends on both sides of Limestone Creek for about two miles along the Kentucky shore at no point apparently over five squares wide and for the most part but two or three for back of it forested hills rise sharply There is a variety of industries the business quarter is substantially built and there are numerous comfortable homes with pretty lawns On the opposite shore is Aberdeen where Kentucky swains and lasses who for one reason or another fail to get a license at home find marriage made easy a peaceful pleasant white village with trees a plenty and romantic hills shutting out the north wind We are camped to night on a picturesque sand slope at the foot of a willow edged bottom and some seven feet above the river level We need to perch high for the storm has been general through the basin and the Ohio is rising steadily Footnote A See Shaler s Kentucky Amer Commonwealth series Collins s History of Kentucky and Hale s Trans Alleghany Pioneers Shaler gives the date as seventeen fifty six but Hale a specialist in border annals makes it seventeen fifty five Footnote B See ante p one hundred twenty six Footnote C Palmer eighteen seventeen paid five dollars for his passage from Pittsburg to Cincinnati four hundred sixty five miles without food and fifty cents per hundred pounds for freight to Marietta Imlay seventeen ninety two says the rate in his time from Pittsburg to Limestone was twenty five cents per hundred In eighteen oh three Harris paid four dollars and a half per hundred for freight by wagon from Baltimore to Pittsburg CHAPTER XIV Produce boats A dead town On the Great Bend Grant s birthplace The Little Miami The genesis of Cincinnati Point Pleasant O Wednesday May twenty third The river rose three feet during the night Steamers go now at full speed no longer fearing the bars and the swash upon shore was so violent that I was more than once awakened each time to find the water line creeping nearer and nearer to the tent door As we sweep onward to day upon an accelerated current the fringing willows whose roots before the rise were many feet up the slopes of sand and gravel are gracefully dipping their boughs in the rushing flood With the rise come the sweepings of the beaches bits of lumber fallen trees barrels boxes longshore rubbish of every sort sometimes it hangs in ragged rafts and we steer clear of such for Pilgrim s progress is greater than that of these unwelcome companions of the voyage and we wish no entangling alliances Much tobacco is raised on the rounded gently sloping hills below Maysville Away up on the acclivities in sheltered spots near the fields in which they are to be transplanted or in fence corners in the ever broadening bottoms we note white patches of thin cloth pinned down over the young plants to protect them from untoward frosts There are many tobacco warehouses to be seen along the banks apparently farmers cooperate in maintaining such and in front of each a roadway leads down to the water s edge indicating a steamboat landing On the town wharves are often seen portly barrels locally puncheons filled with the weed awaiting shipment by boat most of the product goes to Louisville but there are also large buyers in the smaller Kentucky towns Occasionally to day we have seen moored to some rustic landing a great covered barge quite of the fashion of the golden age of Ohio boating At one end a room is partitioned off to serve as cabin and the sweeps are operated from the roof These are produce boats which are laden with coarse vegetables and sometimes live stock and floated down to Cincinnati or Louisville and even to saint Louis and New Orleans In ante bellum days produce boats were common enough and much money was made by speculative buyers who would dispose of their cargo in the most favorable port sell the barge and then return by rail or steamer just as in still earlier days the keel or flatboat owner would sell both freight and vessel on the Lower Mississippi or abandon the craft if he could not sell it and hoof it home as a contemporary chronicler puts it Ripley Levanna four hundred seventeen miles Higginsport four hundred twenty one miles Chilo four hundred thirty one miles Neville four hundred thirty five miles and Point Pleasant four hundred forty two miles are the Ohio towns to day and Dover four hundred seventeen miles Augusta four hundred twenty four miles and Foster four hundred thirty five miles their rivals on the Kentucky shore Sawmills and distilleries are the leading industries and there are broad paved wharves but a listless air pervades them all as if once they basked in the light of better days Foster is rather the shabbiest of the lot As I passed through to find the postoffice at the upper edge of town where the hills come down to meet the bottom I saw that half of the store buildings still intact were closed many dwellings and warehouses were in ruins and numerous open cellars were grown to grass and weeds Few people were in sight and they loafing at the corners The postoffice occupied a vacated store evidently not swept these six months past The youthful master with chair tilted back and his feet on an old washstand which did duty as office table was listlessly whittling a finger ring from a peach stone but shoving his feet along he made room for me to write a postal card which I had brought for the purpose What is the matter with this town I asked as I scratched away Daid I reck n and he blew away the peach stone dust which had accumulated in the folds of his greasy vest Yes I see it is dead What killed it Oh just gone daid sort o nat ral daith I reck n We had a pretty view this morning three or four miles below Augusta from the top of a tree denuded Kentucky hill some two hundred and fifty feet high Hauling Pilgrim into the willows we set out over a low cultivated bottom whose edges were being lapped by the rising river to the detriment of the springing corn then scrambling up the terrace on which the Chesapeake Ohio railway runs we crawled under a barb wire fence and ascended through a pasture our right of way contested for a moment by a gigantic Berkshire boar which was not easily vanquished When at last we gained the top by dint of clambering over rail fences and up steep slopes bestrewn with mulleins and boulders and over patches of freshly plowed hardscrabble the sight was well worth the rough climb The broad Ohio bottom opposite was thick dotted with orchard clumps from which rose the white houses and barns of small tillers On the generous slopes of the Kentucky hills all corrugated with wooded ravines were scores of fertile farmsteads each with its ample tobacco shed the better class of farmers on the hilltops their buildings often silhouetted against the western sky and the meaner sort down low on the river s bank Through this pastoral scene the broad river winds with noble sweep until both above and below it loses itself in the purple mist of the distant hills We are now upon the Great Bend of the Ohio beginning at Neville four hundred thirty five miles and ending at Harris s Landing five hundred nineteen miles with North Bend four hundred eighty two miles at the apex The bend is itself a series of convolutions and our point of view is ever changing so that we have kaleidoscopic vistas and with each new setting good humoredly dispute with each other we at the oars and the others in the stern sheets as to which is the more beautiful the unfolding or the dissolving view Our camp to night is beside a little hillside torrent on the lower edge of Point Pleasant We are well up on the rocky slope an abandoned stone quarry lies back of us up the hill a bit and leading into the village half a mile away is a picturesque country road overhung with sumacs and honey locusts overtopped on one side by a precipitous pasture and on the other dropping suddenly to a beach thick grown to willows maples and scrub sycamores The Boy and I made an expedition into the town for milk and water but were obliged to climb one of the sharpest ascents hereabout before our search was rewarded A pretty little farmstead it is up there on the lofty hill above us with a wealth of chickens and an ample dairy and fat fields and woods gently sloping backward into the interior The good farm wife was surprised that I was willing to pack commodities so plentiful with her down so steep a path but canoeing pilgrims must not falter at trifles such as this Point Pleasant is the birthplace of General Grant Not every hamlet has its hero hereabout Everyone we met this evening seeing we were strangers the Boy and I told us of this halo which crowns their home Cincinnati Thursday May twenty fourth During the night there were frequent heavy downpours during which the swollen torrent by our side roared among its boulders right lustily and occasionally a heavy farm wagon crossed the country bridge which spans the ravine just above us its rumblings echoing in the quarried glen for all the world like distant thunder Before turning in each built a cairn upon the beach at the point which he thought the water might reach by morning The Boy more venturesome than the rest piled his cairn highest up the slope and when daylight revealed the fact that the river in its four feet rise had crept nearest his goal there was much juvenile rejoicing There is a gray sky this morning With a cold headwind on the starboard quarter we hug the lee of the Ohio shore The river is well up in the willows now Crowding Pilgrim as closely as we may within the narrow belt of unruffled water our oars are swept by their bending boughs which lightly tremble on the surface of the flood The numerous rock cumbered ravines coursing down the hills or through the bottom lands a few days since held but slender streams or were the most of them wholly dry but now they are brimming with noisy currents all flecked with foam pretty pictures these yawning gullies overhung with cottonwoods and sycamores with thick undergrowth of green brier and wild columbine and the yellow buds of the celandine poppy The hills are showing better cultivation as we approach the great city The farm houses are in better style the market gardens larger prosperity more evident Among the pleasing sights are frequent farmsteads at the summits of the slopes with orchards and vineyards and gardens and fields stretching down almost to the river quite indeed on the Ohio side but in Kentucky flanked at the base by the railway terrace Numerous ferries connect the Kentucky railway stations with the eastern bank one which we saw just above New Richmond O four hundred forty six miles was run by horse power a weary nag in a tread mill above each side paddle Although Kentucky has the railway there is just here apparent a greater degree of thrift in Ohio the towns more numerous fields and truck gardens more ample on the whole a better class of farm houses and frequently along the country road which closely skirts the shore comfortable little broad balconied inns dependent on the trade of fishing and outing parties Just below the Newport waterworks are several coal barge harbors mooring grounds where barges lie in waiting until hauled off by tugs to the storage wharves In the rear of one of these fleets at the base of a market garden we found a sunny nook for lunch for here on the Kentucky side the cold wind has full sweep and we are glad of shelter when at rest Across the river is a broad low bottom given up to market gardeners who jealously cultivate down to the water s edge leaving the merest fringe of willows to protect their domain At the foot of this fertile plain the Little Miami River four hundred sixty miles pours its muddy contribution into the Ohio and beyond this rises the amphitheater of hills on which Cincinnati four hundred sixty six miles is mainly built We see but the outskirts here for two miles below us there is a sharp bend in the river and only a dark pall of smoke marks where the city lies But these outlying slopes are well dotted with gray and white groups of settlement separated by stretches of woodland over which play changing lights for cloud masses are sweeping the Ohio hills while we are still basking in the sun Above us crowning the Kentucky ascents or nestled on their wooded shoulders are many beautiful villas evidently the homes of the ultra wealthy Close at hand we have the pleasant chink chink of caulking hammers for barges are built and repaired in this snug harbor Now and then a river tug comes with noisy bluster of smoke and steam and amid much tightening and slackening of rope and wild profanity takes captive a laden barge as a cowboy might a refractory steer in the midst of a herd and hauls it off to be disgorged down stream And just as we conclude our lunch German women come with hoes to practice the gentle art of horticulture a characteristic conglomeration in the heart of our busy West the millionaire on the hill top the tiller on the slope shipwright on the beach and grimy Commerce master of the flood Setting afloat on a boiling current thick with driftwood we soon were coursing between city lined shores on the Kentucky side Newport and Covington respectively above and below Licking River and in an hour were making our way through the labyrinth of steamers thickly moored with their noses to land and cautiously creeping around to a quiet spot at the stern of a giant wharf boat no slight task this with the river on the jump and a false move liable to swamp us if we strike an obstruction at full gait No doubt we all breathed freer when Pilgrim too was beached although it be only confessed in the privacy of the log With her and her cargo safely stored in the wharf boat we sought a hotel and regaining our bag of clothing shipped ahead of us from McKee s Rocks donned urban attire for an inspection of the city And a noble city it is that has grown out of the two block houses which George Rogers Clark planted here in seventeen eighty on his raid against the Indians of Chillicothe In seventeen eighty eight John Cleves Symmes the first United States judge of the Northwest Territory purchased from Congress a million acres of land lying on the Ohio between the two Miami Rivers Matthias Denman bought from him a square mile at the eastern end of the grant on a most delightful high bank opposite the Licking and on a cash valuation for the land of two hundred dollars took in with him as partners Robert Patterson and John Filson Filson was a schoolmaster had written the first history of Kentucky and seems to have enjoyed much local distinction To him was entrusted the task of inventing a name for the settlement which the company proposed to plant here The outcome was Losantiville a pedagogical hash of Greek Latin and French L for Licking os mouth anti opposite ville city Licking opposite City or City opposite Licking whichever is preferred This was in August The Fates work quickly for in October poor Filson was scalped by the Indians in the neighborhood of the Big Miami before a settler had yet been enticed to Losantiville But the survivors knew how to boom a town lots were given away by lottery to intending actual settlers and in a few months Symmes was able to write that It populates considerably A few weeks previous to the planting of Losantiville a party of men from Redstone had settled Columbia at the mouth of the Little Miami about where the suburb of California now is and a few weeks later a third colony was started by Symmes himself at North Bend near the Big Miami at the western extremity of his grant and this the judge wished to make the capital of the new Northwest Territory At first it was a race between these three colonies A few miles below North Bend Fort Finney had been built in seventeen eighty five eighty six hence the Bend had at first the start but a high flood dampened its prospects the troops were withdrawn from this neighborhood to Louisville and in the winter of seventeen eighty nine ninety Fort Washington was built at Losantiville by General Harmar The neighborhood of the new fortress became in the ensuing Indian war the center of the district To Losantiville with its fort came Arthur saint Clair the new governor of the Northwest Territory January seventeen ninety and making his headquarters here laid violent hands on Filson s invention at once changing the name to Cincinnati in honor of the Society of the Cincinnati of which the new official was a prominent member so that Symmes sorrowfully writes Losantiville will become extinct Five years of Indian campaigning followed the features of which were the crushing defeats of Harmar and saint Clair and the final victory of Mad Anthony Wayne at Fallen Timbers It was not until the Treaty of Greenville seventeen ninety five the result of Wayne s brilliant dash into the wilderness that the Revolutionary War may properly be said to have ended in the West Those were stirring times on the Ohio both ashore and afloat but amidst them all Cincinnati grew apace Ellicott in seventeen ninety six speaks of it as a very respectable place and in eighteen fourteen Flint found it the only port that could be called a town from Steubenville to Natchez a distance of fifteen hundred miles in eighteen twenty five he reports it greatly grown and crowded with immigrants from Europe and from our own Eastern states The impetus thus early gained has never lessened and Cincinnati is to day one of the best built and most substantial cities in the Union CHAPTER XV The story of North Bend The shakes Driftwood Rabbit Hash A side trip To Big Bone Lick Near Petersburg Ky Friday May twenty fifth This morning an hour before noon as we looked upon the river from the top of the Cincinnati wharf a wild scene presented itself The shore up and down as far as could be seen was densely lined with packets and freighters beyond them the great stream here half a mile wide was rushing past like a mill race and black with all manner of drift some of it formed into great rafts from each of which sprawled a network of huge branches Had we been strangers to this offscouring of a thousand miles of beach swirling past us at a six mile gait we might well have doubted the prudence of launching little Pilgrim upon such a sea But for two days past we had been amidst something of the sort and knew that to cautious canoeists it was less dangerous than it appeared A strong head wind meeting this surging tide is lashing it into a white capped fury But lying to with paddle and oars and dodging ferries and towing tugs as best we may Pilgrim bears us swiftly past the long line of steamers at the wharf past Newport and Covington and the insignificant Licking A and out under great railway bridges which cobweb the sky Soon Cincinnati shrouded in smoke has disappeared around the bend and we are in the fast thinning suburbs homes of beer gardens and excursion barges havens for freight flats and villas of low and high degree When we are out here in the swim the drift strewn stream has a more peaceful aspect than when looked at from the shore Instead of rushing past as if dooming to destruction everything else afloat the debris falls behind when we row for our progress is then the greater Dropping our oars our gruesome companions on the river pass us slowly for they catch less wind than we and then so silent the steady march of all we seem to be drifting up stream until on glancing at the shore the hills appear to be swiftly going down and the willow fringes up until the sight makes us dizzy and we are content to be at quits with these optical delusions We no longer have the beach of gravel or sand or strip of clay knee deep in mud The water now twelve feet higher than before the rise has covered all it is indeed swaying the branches of sycamores and willows and meeting the edges of the corn fields of venturesome farmers who have cultivated far down taking the risk of a June fresh Often could we if we wished row quite within the bulwark of willows where a week ago we would have ventured to camp The Kentucky side to day from Covington out has been thoroughly rustic seldom broken by settlement while Ohio has given us a succession of suburban towns all the way out to North Bend four hundred eighty two miles which is a small manufacturing place lying on a narrow bottom at the base of a convolution of gentle wooded hills One sees that Cincinnati has a better and a broader base North Bend was handicapped by nature in its early race When Ohio came into the Union eighteen oh three it was specified that the boundary between her and Indiana should be a line running due north from the mouth of the Big Miami But the latter an erratic stream frequently the victim of floods comes wriggling down to the Ohio through a broad bottom grown thick to willows and in times of high water its mouth is a changeable locality The boundary monument is planted on the meridian of what was the mouth ninety odd years ago but to day the Miami breaks through an opening in the quivering line of willow forest a hundred yards eastward four hundred eighty seven miles Garrison Creek is a modest Kentucky affluent just above the Miami s mouth At the point a group of rustics sat on a log at the bank top watching us approach Landing in search of milk and water I was taken by one of them in a lumbersome skiff a short distance up the creek and presented to his family They are genuine crackers of the coarsest type tall lean sallow fishy eyed with tow colored hair an ungainly gait barefooted and in nondescript clothing all patches and tatters The tousle headed woman surrounded by her copies in miniature keeps the milk neatly in an outer dairy perhaps because of market requirements but in the crazy old log house pigs and chickens are free comers and the cistern from which they drink is foul Here in this damp low pocket of a bottom annually flooded to the door sill in the midst of vegetation of the rankest order and quite unheedful of the simplest of sanitary laws these yellow skinned crackers are cradled wedded and biered And there are thousands like unto them for we are now in the heart of the shake country and shall hear enough of the plague through the remainder of our pilgrimage As for ourselves we fear not for it is not until autumn that danger is imminent and we are taking due precaution under the Doctor s guidance Two miles beyond is the Indiana town of Lawrenceburg with the unkempt aspect so common to the small river places and two miles still farther on a Kentucky bottom Petersburg whose chiefest building as viewed from the stream is a huge distillery On a high sandy terrace a mile or so below we pitch our nightly camp All about are willows rustling musically in the evening breeze and soaring far aloft the now familiar sycamores Nearly opposite in Indiana the little city of Aurora is sparkling with points of light strains of dance music reach us over the way and occasional shouts and gay laughter while now and then in the thickening dusk of the long day we hear skiffs go chucking by from Petersburg way and the gleeful voices of men and women doubtless being ferried to the ball Near Warsaw Ky Saturday May twenty sixth Our first mosquito appeared last night but he was easily slaughtered It has been a comfort to be free thus far from these pests of camp life We had prepared for them by laying in a bolt of black tarlatan at Wheeling greatly superior this to ordinary white mosquito bar but thus far it has remained in the shopman s wrapper The fog this morning was of the heaviest At four o clock we were awakened by the sharp clanging of a pilot s signal bell and there poking her nose in among our willows a dozen feet from the tent was the Big Sandy one of the saint Louis Cincinnati packet line She had evidently lost her bearings in the mist but with a deal of ringing and a noisy churning of the water by the reversed paddle wheel pulled out and disappeared into the gloom The river still rising is sweeping down an ever increasing body of rubbish Islands and beaches away back to the Alleghanies on the main stream and on thousands of miles of affluents are yielding up those vast rafts of drift wood and fallen timber which have continually impressed us on our way with a sense of the enormous wastage everywhere in progress necessary of course in view of the prohibitive cost of transportation Nevertheless one thinks pitifully of the tens of thousands who in congested districts each winter suffer unto death for want of fuel and here is this wealth of forest debris the useless plaything of the river But not only wreckage of this character is borne upon the flood The thievish river has picked up valuable saw logs that have run astray lumber of many sorts boxes barrels and now and then the body of a cow or horse that has tumbled to its death from some treacherous clay cliff or rocky terrace The beaches have been swept clean by the rushing flood of whatever lay upon them be it good or bad for the great scavenger exercises no discretion The bulk of the matter now follows the current in an almost solid raft as it caroms from shore to shore Having swift water everywhere at this stage for the most part we avoid entangling Pilgrim in the procession but row upon the outskirts interested in the curious medley and observant of the many birds which perch upon the branches of the floating trees and sing blithely on their way The current bears hard upon the Aurora beach and townsfolk by scores are out in skiffs or are standing by the water s edge engaged with boat hooks in spearing choice morsels from the debris rushing by their door heaping it upon the shore to dry or gathering it in little rafts which they moor to the bank It is a busy scene the wreckers men women and children alike are so engaged in their grab bag game that they have no eyes for us unobserved we watch them at close range and speculate upon their respective chances Rabbit Hash Ky five hundred two miles is a crude hamlet of a hundred souls lying nestled in a green amphitheater A horse power ferry runs over to the larger village of Rising Sun its Indiana neighbor There is a small general store in Rabbit Hash with postoffice and paint shop attachment and near by a tobacco warehouse and a blacksmith shop with a few cottages scattered at intervals over the bottom The postmaster who is also the storekeeper and painter greeted me with joy as I deposited with him mail matter bearing eighteen cents worth of stamps for his is one of those offices where the salary is the value of the stamps cancelled It is not every day that so liberal a patron comes along Jemimi Bill but guv m nt business s look n up there ll be some o th rest o us a want n this yere off c a ter nex lection I reck n It was the blacksmith who is also the ferryman who thus bantered the delighted postmaster a broad faced big chested brown armed man with his neck muscles standing out like cords and his mild blue eyes dancing with fun this rustic disciple of Tubal Cain He sat just without the door leather apron on and his red shirt sleeves rolled up playing checkers on an upturned soap box with a jolly fat farmer from the hill country whose broad straw hat was cocked on the back of his bald head The merry laughter of the two was infectious The half dozen spectators small farmers whose teams and saddle horses were hitched to the postoffice railing were themselves hilarious over the game and a saffron skinned hollow cheeked woman in a blue sunbonnet and with a market basket over her arm stopped for a moment at the threshold to look on and then passed within the store her eyes having caught the merriment although her facial muscles had apparently lost their power of smiling Joining the little company I found that the farmer was a blundering player but made up in fun what he lacked in science I tried to ascertain the origin of the name Rabbit Hash as applied to the hamlet Every one had a different opinion evidently invented on the spur of the moment but all lowed that none but the tobacco agent could tell and he was off in the country for the day as for themselves they had they confessed never thought of it before It always had been Rabbit Hash and like enough would be to the end of time We are on the lookout for Big Bone Creek wishing to make a side trip to the famous Big Bone Lick but among the many openings through the willows of the Kentucky shore we may well miss it hence make constant inquiry as we proceed There was a houseboat in the mouth of one goodly affluent As we hove in sight a fat woman whose gunny sack apron was her chief attire hurried up the gang plank and disappeared within Hello the boat one of us hailed The woman s fuzzy head appeared at the window What creek is this Gunpowder I reck n in a deep man like voice How far below is Big Bone Jist a piece How many miles Two I reck n Big Bone Creek five hundred twelve miles some fifty or sixty feet wide at the mouth opens through a willow patch between pretty sloping hills A houseboat lay just within a favorite situation for them these creek mouths for here they are undisturbed by steamer wakes and the fishing is usually good The proprietor a rather distinguished looking mulatto despite his old clothes and plantation straw hat was sitting in a chair at his cabin door angling his white wife was leaning over him lovingly as we shot into the scene but at once withdrew inside This man with his side whiskers and fine air may have been a head waiter or a dance fiddler in better days but his soft plaintive voice and hacking cough bespoke the invalid He told us what he knew about the creek which was little enough as he had but recently come to these parts At an ordinary stage in the Ohio the Big Bone cannot be ascended in a skiff for more than half a mile now upon the backset we are able to proceed for two miles leaving but another two miles of walking to the Lick itself The creek curves gracefully around the bases of the sugar loaf hills of the interior Under the swaying arch of willows and of ragged sprawling sycamores their bark all patched with green and gray and buff and white we have charming vistas the quiet water thick grown with aquatic plants the winding banks bearing green dragons and many another flower loving damp shade the frequent rocky palisades oozing with springs and great blue herons stretching their long necks in wonder and then setting off with a stately flight which reminds one of the cranes on Japanese ware Through the dense fringe of vegetation we have occasional glimpses of the hillside farms their sloping fields sprinkled with stones their often barren pastures numerous abandoned tracts overgrown with weeds and blue grass lush in the meadows Along the edges of the Creek and in little pocket bottoms the varied vegetation has a sub tropical luxuriance and in this now close warm air there is a rank smell suggestive of malaria These bottoms are annually overflowed so that the crude little farmsteads are on the rising ground whitewashed cabins many of them of logs serve as houses for stock there are the veriest shanties affording practically no shelter best of all the rude tobacco drying sheds in many of which some of last year s crop can still be seen hanging on the strips We are out of the world here and barefooted men and boys who with listless air are fishing from the banks gaze at us in dull wonder as we thread our tortuous way Finally we learned that we could with profit go no higher Before us were two miles of what was described as the roughest sort of hill road and the afternoon sun was powerful so W accepted the invitation of a rustic fisherman to rest with his women folks in a little cabin up the hill a bit Seeing her safely housed with the good natured cracker farm wife the Doctor the Boy and I trudged off toward Big Bone Lick The waxy clay of the roadbed had recently been wetted by a shower the walking consequently was none of the best But we were repaid with charming views of hill and vale a softly rolling scene dotted with little gray and brown fields clumps of woodland rail fenced pastures and cabins of the crudest sort for in the autumn tide the curse of malaria haunts the basin of the Big Bone and none but he of fortune spurned would care here in this beauty spot to plant his vine and fig tree Now and then our path leads us across the winding creek which in these upper reaches tumbles noisily over ledges of jagged rock above which luxuriant sycamores and elms and maples arch gracefully At each picturesque fording place with its inevitable watering pool are stepping stones for foot pilgrims often a flock of geese are sailing in the pool with craned necks and flapping wings hissing defiance to disturbers of their sylvan peace The travelers we meet are on horseback most of them the yellow skinned hollow cheeked folk with lack luster eyes whom we note in the cabin doors or dawdling about their daily routine On nearing the Lick two young horsewomen out of the common look interestedly at us and I stop to inquire the way although the village spire is peering above the tree tops yonder Pretty buxom sweet faced lassies these with soft pleasant voices each with her market basket over her arm going homeward from shopping It would be interesting to know their story what it is that brings these daughters of a brighter world here into this valley of the living death Two hundred yards farther where the road forks and the one at the right hand ascends to the small hamlet of Big Bone Lick there is an interesting picture beneath the way post a girl in a blue calico gown her face deep hidden in her red sunbonnet sits upon a chestnut mount with a laden market basket before her while by her side astride a coal black pony which fretfully paws to be on his way is a roughly dressed youth his face shaded by a broad slouched hat of the cowboy order They have evidently met there by appointment and are so earnestly conversing she with her hand resting lovingly perhaps deprecatingly upon his bridle arm and his free hand nervously stroking her horse s mane while his eyes are far afield that they do not observe us as we pass and we are free to weave from the incident any sort of cracker romance which fancy may dictate The source of Big Bone Creek is a marshy basin some fifty acres in extent rimmed with gently sloping hills and freely pitted with copious springs of a water strongly sulphurous in taste with a suggestion of salt The odor is so powerful as to be all pervading a quarter of a mile away and to be readily detected at twice that distance This collection of springs constitutes Big Bone Lick probably the most famous of the many similar licks in Kentucky Indiana and Illinois The salt licks of the Ohio basin were from the earliest times resorted to in great numbers by wild beasts and were favorite camping grounds for Indians and for white hunters and explorers This one was first visited by the French as early as seventeen twenty nine and became famous because of the great quantities of remains of animals which lay all over the marsh particularly noticeable being the gigantic bones of the extinct mammoth hence the name adopted by the earliest American hunters Big Bone These monsters had evidently been mired in the swamp while seeking to lick the salty mud and died in their tracks Pioneer chronicles abound in references to the Lick and we read frequently of hunting parties using the ribs of the mammoth for tent poles and sections of the vertebrae as camp stools and tables But in our own day there are no surface evidences of this once rich treasure of giant fossils although occasionally a find is made by enterprising excavators several bones having thus been unearthed only a week ago They are now on exhibition in the neighboring village preparatory to being shipped to an Eastern museum As we hurried back over the rolling highway thunder clouds grandly rose out of the west and great drops of rain gave us moist warning of the coming storm W was watching us from the cabin door as we made the last turning in the road and accompanied by the farm wife and her two daughters came tripping down to the landing She had been entertained in the one down stairs room as royally as these honest cracker women folk knew how seated in the family rocking chair she had heard in those two hours the social gossip of a wide neighborhood learned too that the cold wet weather of the last fortnight had killed turkey chicks and goslings by the score heard of the damage being done to corn and tobacco by the prevalent high water was told how Bess and Brindle fared off in the rocky pasture which yields little else than mulleins and how far back Towser had to go to claim relationship to a collie And weren t we really show people going down the river this way in a skiff or if we weren t show people had we an agency for something or were we only in trade It seems a difficult task to make these people on the bottoms believe that we are skiffing it for pleasure it is a sort of pleasure so far removed from their notions of the fitness of things and so at last we have given up trying and let them think of our pilgrimage what they will The entire family now assembled on the muddy bank and bade us a really affectionate farewell as if we had been in this isolated corner of the world most welcome guests who were going all too soon In a few strokes of the oars we were rounding the bend and waving our hands at the little knot of watchers went forth from their lives doubtless forever The storm soon burst upon us in full fury Clad in rubber we rested under giant trees or beneath projecting rock ledges taking advantage of occasional lulls to push on for a few rods to some new shelter The numerous little hillside runs which in our journey up were but dry gullies choked with leaves and boulders were now brimming with muddy torrents rushing all foam flecked and with deafening roar into the central stream At last the cloud curtain rolled away the sun gushed out with fiery rays the arch of foliage sparkled with splendor in meadow and on hillside the face of Nature was cleanly beautiful At the creek mouth the distinguished mulatto still was fishing from his chair and standing by his side was his wife throwing a spoon They nodded to us pleasantly as old friends returned Gliding by their boat Pilgrim was soon once more in the full current of the swift flowing Ohio We are high up to night on a little grass terrace in Kentucky two miles above Warsaw The usual country road lies back of us a rod or two and then a slender field surmounted by a woodland hill Fortune favors us almost nightly with beautiful abiding places In no place could we sleep more comfortably than in our cotton home Footnote A So called from the Big Buffalo Lick upon its banks CHAPTER XVI New Switzerland An old time river pilot Houseboat life on the lower reaches A philosopher in rags Wooded solitudes Arrival at Louisville Near Madison Ind Sunday May twenty seventh At supper last night a houseboat fisherman going by in his skiff parted the willows fringing our beach and offered to sell us some of his wares We bought from him a two pound catfish which he tethered to a bush overhanging the water until we were ready to dress it giving us warning that meanwhile it would be best to have an eye on our purchase or the turtles would devour it Hungry thieves these turtles the fisherman said you could leave nothing edible in water or on land unprotected without constant fear of the reptiles which reminds me that yesterday the Doctor and the Boy found on the beach a beautiful box tortoise Our fish was swimming around finely at the end of his cord when the executioner arrived and when finally hung up in a tree was safe from the marauders This morning the fisherman was around again hoping to obtain another dime from the commissariat but though we had breakfasted creditably from the little cat we had no thought of stocking our larder with his kind So the grizzly man of nets took a fresh chew of tobacco and sat a while in his boat pass n th time o day with us punctuating his remarks with frequent expectorations The new Kentucky houseboat law taxes each craft of this sort seven and a half dollars he said five dollars going to the State and the remainder to the collector There was to be a patrol boat to see that th fellers done step to th cap n s office an settle But the houseboaters were going to combine and fight the law on constitutional grounds for they had been told that it was clearly an interference with commerce on a national highway As for the houseboaters voting well some of them did but the most of them didn t The Indiana registry law requires a six months residence and in Kentucky it is a full year so that a houseboat man who moves about any jes isn t in it sir thet s all However our visitor was not much disturbed over the practical disfranchisement of his class it seemed rather to amuse him he was much more concerned in the new tax which he thought an outrageous imposition In bidding us a cheery good bye he noticed my kodak Yees be one o them photygraph parties hey and laughed knowingly as though he had caught me in a familiar trick No child of nature so simple in these days as not to recognize a kodak Warsaw Ky five hundred twenty four miles just below has some bankside evidences of manufacturing but on the whole is rather down at the heel A contrast this to Vevay five hundred thirty three miles on the Indiana shore which though a small town on a low lying bottom is neat and apparently prosperous Vevay was settled in eighteen oh three by John James Dufour and several associates from the District of Vevay in Switzerland who purchased from Congress four square miles hereabout and christening it New Switzerland sought to establish extensive vineyards in the heart of this middle West The Swiss prospered The colony has had sufficient vitality to preserve many of its original characteristics unto the present day Much of the land in the neighborhood is still owned by the descendants of Dufour and his fellows but the vineyards are not much in evidence In fact the grape growing industry on the banks of the Ohio although commenced at different points with great promise by French Swiss Germans and Americans alike has not realized their expectations The Ohio has proved to be unlike the Rhine in this respect In the long run the vine in America appears to fare better in a more northern latitude Three miles above Vevay near Plum Creek I was interested in the Indiana farm upon which Heathcoat Picket settled in seventeen ninety five some say in seventeen ninety In his day Picket was a notable flatboat pilot He was credited with having conducted more craft down the river to New Orleans than any other man of his time going down on the boat and returning on foot It is said that he made over twenty trips of this character which is certainly a marvelous record at a time when there were only Indian trails through the more than a thousand miles of dense forest between Vevay and New Orleans and when a savage enemy might be expected to lurk behind any tree ready to slay the rash pale face Picket s must have been a life of continuous adventure as thrilling as the career of Daniel Boone himself yet he is now known to but a local antiquarian or two and one stumbles across him only in foot notes The border annals of the West abound with incidents as romantic as any which have been applauded by men Daniel Boone is not the only hero of the frontier he is not even the chief hero he is but a type whom an accident of literature has made conspicuous The Kentucky River five hundred forty one miles enters at Carrollton Ky a well to do town with busy looking wharves upon both streams through a wide and rather uninteresting bottom But over beyond this one sees that it has come down through a deep cut valley rimmed with dark rolling hills which speak eloquently of a diversified landscape along its banks The Indian Kentucky a small stream but half a dozen rods wide enters from the north five miles below Injun Kaintuck it was called by a jovial junk boat man stationed at the mouth of the tributary There are on the Ohio several examples of this peculiar nomenclature a river enters from the south and another affluent coming in from the north nearly opposite will have the same name with the prefix Indian The reason is obvious the land north of the Ohio remained Indian territory many years after Kentucky and Virginia were recognized as white man s country hence the convenient distinction the river coming in from the north near the Kentucky for instance became Indian Kentucky and so on through the list Houseboats are less frequent in these reaches of the river The towns are fewer and smaller than above consequently there is less demand for fish or for desultory labor Yet we seldom pass a day in the most rustic sections without seeing from half a dozen to a dozen of these craft Sometimes they are a few rods up the mouths of tributaries half hidden by willows and overhanging sycamores or in picturesque little openings of the willow fringe along the main shore or boldly planted at the base of some rocky ledge At the towns they are variously situated in the water up the beach a way or high upon the bottom whither some great flood has carried them in years gone by Occasionally when high and dry upon the land they have a bit of vegetable garden about them rented for a time from the farmer but even with the floaters chickens are commonly kept generally in a coop on the roof connected with the shore by a special gang plank for the fowls and the other day we saw a thrifty houseboater who had several colonies of bees There was a rise of only two feet last night evidently the flood is nearly at its greatest We are now twenty feet above the level of ten days ago and are frequently swirling along over what were then sharp stony slopes and brushing the topmost boughs of the lower lines of willows and scrub sycamores Thus we have a better view of the country and approaching closely to the banks can from our seats at any time pluck blue lupine by the armful It thrives mightily on these gravelled shores and so do the bignonia vine the poison ivy and the Virginia creeper The hills are steeper now especially in Indiana many of them although stony worked out and almost worthless are still in patches cultivated to the very top but for the most part they are clothed in restful green Overhead in the summer haze turkey buzzards wheel gracefully occasionally chased by audacious hawks and in the woods we hear the warble of song birds Shadowy idle scenes these rustic reaches of the lower Ohio through which man may dream in Nature s lap all regardless of the workaday world It was early evening when we passed Madison Ind five hundred fifty three miles a fairly prosperous factory town of about twelve thousand souls Scores of the inhabitants were out in boats collecting driftwood and upon the wharf was a great crowd of people waiting for an excursion boat which was to return them to Louisville whence they had come for a day s outing It was a lifeless melancholy party as excursion folk are apt to be at the close of a gala day and they wearily stared at us as we paddled past Just below on the Kentucky shore on my usual search for milk and water I landed at a cluster of rude cottages set in pleasant market gardens While the others drifted by with Pilgrim I had a goodly walk before finding milk for a cow is considered a luxury among these small riverside cultivators the man who owns one sells milk to his poorer neighbors Such a nabob was at last found The animal was called down from the rocky hills by her barefooted owner who lank and malaria skinned leaned wearily against the well curb while his wife also guiltless of hose and shoes milked into my pail direct from the lean and hungry brindle By the time the crew were reunited storm clouds thick and black were fast rising in the west Scudding down shore for a mile with oars and paddle aiding the swift current we failed to find a proper camping place on the muddy bank of the far stretching bottom Rain drops were now pattering on our rubber spreads and it was evident that a blow was coming but despite this we bent to the work with renewed vigor and shot across to the lee shore of Indiana finally landing in the midst of a heavy shower and hurriedly pitching tent on a rocky slope at the base of a vertical bank of clay Above us a government beacon shines brightly through the persistent storm with the keeper s neat little house and garden a hundred yards away In the tree tops up a heavily forested hill beyond the wind moans right dismally In this sheltered nook we shall be but lulled to sleep with the ceaseless pelting of the rain Louisville Monday May twenty eighth At midnight the heavens cleared with a cold north wind the early morning atmosphere was nipping and we were glad of the shelter of the tent during breakfast The river fell eight inches during the night and on either bank is a muddy strip which will rapidly widen as the water goes down Below us twenty rods or so moored to the boulder strewn shore was a shanty boat In the bustle of landing last night we had not noticed this neighbor and it was pitch dark before we had time to get our bearings I think it is the most dilapidated affair we have seen on the river the frame of the cabin is out of plumb old clothes serve for sides and flap loudly in the wind while two little boys who peered at us through slits in the airy walls looked fairly miserable with cold The proprietor of the craft came up to visit us while breakfast was being prepared and remained until we were ready to depart a tall slouchy fellow clothed in shreds and patches he was in the prime of life with a depressed nose set in a battered though not unpleasant countenance None of our party had ever before seen such garments on a human being old bits of flannel frayed strips of bagging stuff and other curious odds and ends of fabrics in all the primitive colors the whole roughly basted together with sack thread He was a philosopher was this rag tag and bob tail of a man a philosopher with some mother wit about him For an hour he sat on his haunches crouching over our little stove and following with cat like care W s every movement in the culinary art she felt she was under the eye of a critic who though not voicing his opinions looked as if he knew a thing or two As a conversationist our visitor was fluent to a fault It required but slight urging to draw him out His history and that of his fathers for three generations back he recited in much detail He himself had in his best days been a sub contractor in railway construction but fate had gone against him and he had fallen to the low estate of a shanty boatman His wife had gone back on him and he was left with two little boys whom he proposed to bring up as gentlemen yaas sir r general lem n yew hear me ef I is only a shanty boat feller I thote I d come to visit uv ye he had said by way of introduction ye re frum a city ain t yer Yaas I jist thote hit City folks is a more com dat n n country folks Why Waal yew fellers jist go back ere in th hills away n them thar country folks they d hardly answer ye they re thet selfish like Give me city folks I say fer get n long with And then in a rambling monologue while chewing a straw he discussed humanity in general and the professions in particular I ain t got no use fer lawyers mighty hard show them fellers has fer get n to heaven As fer doctors waal they ll hev hard sledd n too but them fellers has to do piles o dis gree bl work they do I d jist rather fish fer a liv n then be a doctor Still sir r give me an eddicated man every time says I Waal sir r n ye hear me one o th

this philosopher and had studied human nature to some purpose He described the condition of the poor farmers along the river as being pitiful they had no money to hire help and were an odd lot anyway the farther back in the hills you get the worse they are He loved to talk about himself and his lowly condition in contrast with his former glory as a sub contractor on the railway When a man was down he said he lost all his friends and to illustrate this familiar phase of life told two stories which he had often read in a book that he owned They were curious old fashioned tales of feudal days evidently written in a former century he did not know the title of the volume and he related them in what evidently were the actual words of the author a curious recitation in the pedantic literary style of the ancient story teller but in the dialect of an Ohio river cracker His greatest ambition he told us was to own a floating sawmill although he carefully inquired about the laws regulating peddlers in our State and intimated that sometime he might look us up in that capacity in our Northern home As we approach Louisville to day the settlements somewhat increase in number although none of the villages are of great size and especially in Kentucky they are from ten to twenty miles apart The fine hills continue close upon our path until a few miles above Louisville when they recede leaving on the Kentucky side a broad flat plain several miles square for the city s growth For the most part these stony slopes are well wooded with elm buckeye maple ash oak locust hickory sycamore cotton wood a few cedars and here and there a catalpa and a pawpaw giving a touch of tropical luxuriance to the hillside forest while blackberry bushes bignonia vines and poison ivy are everywhere abundant otherwise there is little of interest to the botanist Redbirds catbirds bluebirds blackbirds and crows are chattering noisily in the trees and turkey buzzards everywhere swirl and swoop in mid air The narrow little bottoms are sandy and on lowland as well as highland there is much poor rock bewitched soil The little whitewashed farmsteads look pretty enough in the morning haze lying half hid in forest clumps but upon approach they invariably prove unkempt and dirty and swarming with shiftless barefooted unhealthy folk whom no imagination can invest with picturesque qualities Their ragged unpainted tobacco sheds are straggling about over the hills and here and there a white patch in the corner of a gray field indicates a nursery of tobacco plants soon to be transplanted into ampler soil It is not uncommon to find upon a hillside a freshly built log cabin set in the midst of a clearing with bristling stumps all around reminding one of the homes of new settlers on the far away logging streams of Northern Wisconsin or Minnesota the resemblance is the closer for such notches cut in the edge of the Indiana and Kentucky wilderness are often found after a row of many miles through a winding forest solitude apparently but little changed from primeval conditions Now and then we come across quarries where stone is slid down great chutes to barges which lie moored by the rocky bank and frequently is the stream lined with great boulders which stand knee deep in the flood that eddies and gurgles around them On the upper edge of the great Louisville plain we pitched tent in the middle of the afternoon and having brought our bag of land clothes with us in the skiff from Cincinnati took turns under the canvas in effecting what transformation was desirable preparatory to a visit in the city In the early twilight we were floating past Towhead Island with its almost solid flank of houseboats threading our way through a little fleet of pleasure yachts and at last shooting into the snug harbor of the Boat Club The good natured captain of the U S Life Saving Station took Pilgrim and her cargo in charge for the night and by dusk we were bowling over metropolitan pavements en route to the house of our friend strange contrast this lap of luxury to the soldier like simplicity of our canvas home We have been roughing it for so long less than a month although it seems a year that all these conveniences of civilization these social conventionalities have to us a sort of foreign air Thus easily may man descend into the savage state CHAPTER XVII Storied Louisville Red Indians and white A night on Sand Island New Albany Riverside hermits The river falling A deserted village An ideal camp Sand Island Tuesday May twenty ninth Our Louisville host is the best living authority on the annals of his town It was a delight and an inspiration to go with him to day the rounds of the historic places Much that was to me heretofore foggy in Louisville story was made clear upon becoming familiar with the setting The contention is made that La Salle was here at the Falls of the Ohio during the closing months of sixteen sixty nine but it was over a century later under British domination before a settlement was thought of doctor John Connolly entertained a scheme for founding a town at the Falls but Lord Dunmore s War seventeen seventy four and the Revolution quickly following combined to put an end to it so that when George Rogers Clark arrived on the scene with his little band of Virginian volunteers May seventeen seventy eight en route to capture the Northwest for the State of Virginia he found naught but a savage haunted wilderness His log fort on Corn Island in the midst of the rapids served as a base of military operations and was the nucleus of American settlement although later the inhabitants moved to the mainland and founded Louisville The falls at Louisville are the only considerable obstruction to Ohio River navigation At an average stage the descent is but twenty seven feet in two and a half miles in high flood the rapids degenerate into merely swift water without danger to descending craft At ordinary height it was the custom of pioneer boatmen in descending to lighten their craft of at least a third of the cargo and thus pass them down to the foot of the north side portage Clarksville Ind which is three quarters of a mile in length going up lightened boats were towed against the stream With the advent of larger craft a canal with locks became necessary the Louisville and Portland Canal of to day which is operated by the general government The action of the water hastened by the destruction of trees whose roots originally bound the loose soil has greatly worn the islands in the rapids Little is now left of historic Corn Island and that little is at low water being blasted and ground into cement by a mill hard by on the main shore To day with a flood of nearly twenty feet above the normal stage of the season not much of the island is visible clumps of willows and sycamores swayed by the rushing current giving a general idea of the contour Goose Island although much smaller than in Clark s day is a considerable tract of wooded land with a rock foundation Clark was once its owner his home being opposite on the Indiana shore where he had a fine view of the river the rapids and the several islands As for Clarksville somewhat lower down and back from the river a half mile it is now but a cluster of dwellings on the outskirts of New Albany a manufacturing town which is rapidly absorbing all the neighboring territory Feeling obliged to make an early start we concluded to pass the night just below the canal on Sand Island lying between New Albany and Louisville s noisy manufacturing suburb Portland An historic spot is this insular home of ours At the treaty of Fort Charlotte Cornstalk told Lord Dunmore the legend familiar among Ohio River savages that here in ages past occurred the last great battle between the white and the red Indians It is one of the puzzles of the antiquarians this tradition that white Indians once lived in the land but were swept away by the reds Cornstalk had used it to spur his followers to mighty deeds it was a precedent which Pontiac dwelt upon when organizing his conspiracy and King Philip is said to have been inspired by it But this is no place to discuss the genesis of the tale Suffice it that on Sand Island have been discovered great quantities of ancient remains No doubt in its day it was an over filled burying ground Noises far different from the clash of savage arms are in the air to night Far above our heads a great iron bridge crosses the Ohio some of its piers resting on the island a busy combination thoroughfare for steam and electric railways for pedestrians and for vehicles plying between New Albany and Portland The whirr of the trolley the scream and rumble of locomotives the rattle of wagons and just above the island head the burly roar of steamboats signaling the locks these are the sounds which are prevalent Through all this hubbub electric lamps are flashing and just now a steamer s search light swept our island shore lingering for a moment upon the little camp doubtless while the pilot satisfied his curiosity Let us hope that savage warriors never o nights walk the earth above their graves for such scenes as this might well cause those whose bones lie here to doubt their senses Near Brandenburg Ky Wednesday thirtieth We stopped at New Albany Ind six hundred three miles this morning to stock the larder and to forward our shore clothes by express to Cairo It is a neat and busy manufacturing town with an excellent public market A gala aspect was prevalent for it is Memorial Day the shops and principal buildings were gay with bunting and men in Grand Army uniforms stood in knots at the street corners The broad fertile plain on both sides of the river upon which Louisville and New Albany are the principal towns extends for eight or nine miles below the rapids The first hills to approach the stream are those in Indiana Salt River some ten or twelve rods wide enters from the south twenty one miles below New Albany between uninteresting high clay banks with the lazy looking little village of West Point Ky occupying a small rise of ground just below the mouth The Kentucky hills come close to the bank a mile or two farther down and then the familiar characteristics of the reaches above Louisville are resumed hills and bottoms sparsely settled with ragged farmsteads regularly alternating At five o clock we put in at a rocky ledge on the Indiana side a mile and a half above Brandenburg Behind us rises a precipitous hill tree clad to the summit The Doctor found up there a new phlox and a pretty pink stone crop to add to our herbarium while here as elsewhere the bignonia grows profusely in every crevice of the rock At dark two ragged and ill smelling young shanty boat men who are moored hard by came up to see us and by our camp fire to whittle chips and drone about hard times But at last we tired of their idle gossip which had in it no element of the picturesque and got rid of them by hinting our desire to turn in The towns were few to day and small Brandenburg with eight hundred souls was the largest a sleepy ill paved shambling place with apparently nobody engaged in any serious calling its chief distinction is an architectural monstrosity which we were told is the court house The little white hamlet of New Amsterdam Ind six hundred fifty miles looked trim and bright in the midst of a green thicket Richardson s Landing Ky is a disheveled row of old deserted houses once used by lime burners with a great barge wrecked upon the beach At the small characterless Indiana village of Leavenworth six hundred fifty eight miles I sought a traveling photographer of whom I had been told at Brandenburg My quest was for a dark room where I might recharge my exhausted kodak but the man of plates had packed up his tent and moved on I would no doubt find him in Alton Ind fifteen miles lower down We have had stately eroded hills and broad fertile bottoms hemming us in all day and marvelous ox bows in the erratic stream The hillsides are heavily wooded sometimes the slopes coming straight down to the stony beach without intervening terrace where there are such terraces they are narrow and rocky and the homes of shanty men but upon the bottoms are whitewashed dwellings of frame or log tenanted by a better class who sometimes have goodly orchards and extensive corn cribs The villages are generally in the deep cut notches of the hills where the interior can be conveniently reached by a wagon road a country rumpled like this they say for ten or twelve miles back and then stretching off into level plains of fertility Now and then a deserted cabin on the terraces windowless and gaunt tells the story of some cracker family that malaria had killed off or that has pulled up stakes and gone to seek a better land At Leavenworth the river which has been flowing northwest for thirty miles takes a sudden sweep to the southwest and thenceforward we have a rapid current However we need still to ply our blades for there is a stiff head wind with an eager nip in it to escape which we seek the lee as often as may be and bask in the undisturbed sunlight Right glad we were at luncheon time to find a sheltered nook amidst a heap of boulders on the Kentucky shore and to sit on the sun warmed sand and drink hot tea by the side of a camp fire rejoicing in the kindness of Providence There are few houseboats since leaving Louisville to day we have seen but three or four one of them merrily going up stream under full sail Islands too are few the Upper and Lower Blue River a pretty pair being the first we have met since Sunday The water is falling it now being three or four feet below the stage of a few days since as can readily be seen from the broad dado of mud left on the leaves of willows and sycamores while the drift recently an ever present feature of the current is rapidly lodging in the branches of the willows and piling up against the sand spits and scrawling snags and bobbing sawyers are catching on the bars and being held for the next fresh There is little life along shore in these lower waters There are two lines of ever widening willowed beach of rock and sand or mud above them perpendicular walls of clay which edge either rocky terraces backed by grand sweeps of convoluted hills sometimes wooded to the top and sometimes eroded into palisades or wide stretching bottoms given over to small farms or maybe dense tangles of forest In the midst of this world of shade nestle the whitewashed cabins of the small tillers but though they swarm with children it is not often that the inhabitants appear by the riverside We catch a glimpse of them when landing on our petty errands we now and then see a houseboater at his nets and in the villages a few lackadaisical folk are lounging by the wharf but as a rule in these closing days of our pilgrimage we glide through what is almost a solitude The imagination has not to go far afield to rehabilitate the river as it appeared to the earliest voyagers Late in the afternoon as usual wishing water and milk we put ashore in Indiana where a rustic landing indicated a settlement of some sort although our view was confined to a pretty wooded bank and an unpainted warehouse at the top of the path It was a fertile bottom a half mile wide and stretching a mile or two along the river Three neat houses one of them of logs constituted the village and all about were grain fields rippled into waves by the northwest breeze The first house a quarter of a mile inland I reached by a country roadway it proved to be the postoffice of Point Sandy Chickens clucked around me a spaniel came fawning for attention a tethered cow mooed plaintively but no human being was visible At last I discovered a penciled notice pinned to the horse block to the effect that the postmaster had gone into Alton five miles distant for the day and should William Askins call in his absence the said Askins was to remember that he promised to call yesterday but never came and now would he be kind enough to come without fail to morrow before sundown or the postmaster would be obliged to write that letter they had spoken about It was quite evident that Askins had not called for he surely would not have left that mysterious notice sticking there for all Point Sandy to read and gossip over It is to be hoped that there will be no bloodshed over this affair across the way in Kentucky there would be no doubt as to the outcome I looked at Boss and wondered whether in Indiana it were felony to milk another man s cow in his absence with no ginger jar at hand into which to drop a compensatory dime Then I saw that she was dry and concluded that to attempt it might be thought a violation of ethics The postmaster s well too proved to be a cistern pardon the Hibernicism and so I went farther The other frame house also turned out to be deserted but evidently only for the day for the lilac bushes in the front yard were hung with men s flannel shirts drying in the sun A buck goat came bleating toward me with many a flourish of his horns from which it was plain to be seen why the family wash was not spread upon the grass From here I followed a narrow path through a wheat field the grain up to my shoulders toward the log dwelling A mangy little cur disputed my right to knock at the door but flourishing my two tin pails at him he flew yelping to take refuge in the hen coop To my summons at the portal there came no response save the mewing of the cat within It was clear that the people of Point Sandy were not at home to day I would have retreated to the boat but chancing to glance up at the overhanging hills which edge in the bottom saw two men sitting on a boulder in front of a rude log hut on the brink of a cliff curiously watching my movements on the plain Thankful now that the postmaster s cow had gone dry and that these observant mountaineers had not had an opportunity to misinterpret my conduct I at once hurried toward the hill hopeful that at the top some bovine might be housed whose product could lawfully be acquired But after a long and laborious climb over shifting stones and ragged ledges I was met with the discouraging information that the only cow in these parts was Hawkins cow and Hawkins was the postmaster down yon whar yew were a read n th notices on th hoss block Neither had they any water up there on the cliff top don use very much stranger n what we do we done git at Smithfield s in th log house down yon n I reck n their cistern s done gone dry anyhow But what is the matter down there I asked of the old man they were father and son this lounging pair who thus loftily sat in judgment on the little world at their feet why are all the folks away from home He looked surprised and took a fresh chew while cogitating on my alarming ignorance of Point Sandy affairs Why ain ye heared I thote ev ry feller on th river knew thet yere why ol Hawkins his wife s brother s buried in Alton to day n th neighbors done gwine t th fun ral Whar your shanty boat been beached thet ye ain heared thet yere As the sun neared the horizon we tried other places below with no better success and two miles above Alton Ind six hundred seventy three miles struck camp at sundown without milk for our coffee for water being obliged to settle and boil the roily element which bears us onward through the lengthening days Were there no hardships this would be no pilgrimage worthy of the name We are out philosophically to take the world as it is he who is not content to do so had best not stir from home But our camping place to night is ideal We are upon a narrow grassy ledge below us the sloping beach astrewn with jagged rocks behind us rises steeply a grand hillside forest in which lie mantled with moss and lichens and deep buried in undergrowth boulders as large as a cracker s hut romantic glens abound and a little run comes noisily down a ravine hard by it is a witching back door filled with surprises at every turn Beeches elms maples lindens pawpaws tulip trees here attain a monster growth with grape vines their fruit now set hanging in great festoons from the branches and all about are the flowers which thrive best in shady solitudes wild licorice a small green brier and although not yet in bloom the sessile trillium We are thoroughly isolated a half mile above us faintly gleams a government beacon and we noticed on landing that three quarters of a mile below is a small cabin flanking the hill Naught disturbs our quiet save the calls of the birds at roosting time and now and then the hoarse bellow of a passing packet with its legacy of boisterous wake CHAPTER XVIII Village life A traveling photographer On a country road Studies in color Again among colliers In sweet content A ferry romance Near Troy Ind Friday June first Below Alton the hills are not so high as above We have however the same thoroughly rustic landscape the same small farms on the bottoms and wretched cabins on the slopes the same frontier like clearings thick with stumps the same shabby little villages and frequent ox bow windings of the generous stream with lovely vistas unfolding and dissolving with panoramic regularity It is not a region where houseboaters flourish there is but one every ten miles or so as for steamboats we see on an average one a day while two or three usually pass us in the night A dry unpainted little place is Alton Ind with three down at the heel shops a tavern a saloon and a few dwellings there was no bread obtainable here for love or money and we were fain to be content with a bag of crackers from the postoffice grocery The promised photographer who appears to be a rapid traveler was said to have gone on to Concordia eight miles below Deep Water Landing Ind six hundred seventy six miles is a short row of new whitewashed houses with a great board sign displaying the name of the hamlet doubtless to attract the attention of pilots A rude little show case nailed up beside the door of the house at the head of the landing path contains tempting samples of crockery and tinware Apparently some enterprising soul is trying to grow a town here on this narrow ledge of clay with his landing and his shop as a nucleus But it is an unlikely spot and I doubt if his boom will develop to the corner lot stage Rono Ind a mile below with its limewashed buildings set in a bower of trees at the base of a bald bluff is a rather pretty study in gray and green and white The most notable feature is a little school house like Masonic hall set high on a stone foundation with a steep outer stairway which gives one an impression that Rono is a victim of floods and that the brethren occasionally come in boats to lodge meetings Concordia Ky six hundred eighty one miles rests on the summit of a steep clay bank from which men were loading a barge with bark Great piles of blocks for staves ornamented the crest of the rise a considerable industry for these parts we were told But the photographer whom we were chasing had taken every Concordian who wished his services and moved on to Derby another Kentucky village which at last we found six miles father down the river The principal occupation of the people of Derby is getting out timber from the hillside forests six to ten miles in the interior Oak elm and sycamore railway ties are the specialty these being worth twenty cents each when landed upon the wharf A few months ago Derby was completely destroyed by fire but although the timber business is on the wane here much of the place was rebuilt on the old foundations hence the fresh unpainted buildings with battlement fronts which with the prevalence of open door saloons and a woodsy swagger on the part of the inhabitants give the place a breezy frontier aspect now seldom to be met with this side of the Rockies Here at last was the traveling photographer His tent flapping loudly in the wind occupied an empty lot in the heart of the village a saloon on either side and a lumberman s boarding house across the way where the artist was at dinner pending which I waited for him at the door of his canvas gallery He evidently seeks to magnify his calling does this raw youth of the camera by affecting what he conceives to be the traditional garb of the artistic Bohemian but which resembles more closely the costume of the minstrel stage a battered silk hat surmounting flowing locks glistening with hair oil a loose velveteen jacket over a gay figured vest and a great brass watch chain from which dangle silver coins As this grotesque dandy evidently not long from his native village came mincing across the road in patent leather slippers smoking a cigarette with one thumb in an arm hole of his vest and the other hand twirling an incipient mustache he was plainly conscious of creating something of a swell in Derby It was a crazy little dark room to which I was shown a portable affair much like a coffin case which I expected momentarily to upset as I stood within and be smothered in a cloud of ill smelling chemicals However with care I finally emerged without accident and sufficiently compensated the artist who seemed not over favorable to amateur competition although he chatted freely enough about his business It generally took him ten days he said to finish a town of five or six hundred inhabitants like Derby He traveled on steamers with his tenting outfit but next season hoped to have money enough to do the thing in style in a houseboat of his own an establishment which would cost say four hundred dollars then in the winter he could beach himself at some fair sized town and perhaps make his board by running a local gallery taking to the water again on the earliest spring fresh I could live like a fight n cock then cap n yew jist bet yer bottom dollar The temperature mounted with the progress of the day and the wind dying down the atmosphere was oppressive By the time Stephensport Ky six hundred ninety five miles was reached in the middle of the afternoon the sun was beating fiercely upon the glassy flood and our awning came again into play although it could not save us from the annoyance of the reflection The barren clay bank at the mouth of Sinking Creek upon which lies Stephensport seemed fairly ablaze with heat as I went up into the straggling hamlet to seek for supplies There were no eggs to be had here but at last milk was found in the farther end of the village at a modest little cottage quite embowered in roses with two century plants in tubs in the back yard and a trim fruit and vegetable garden to the rear of that enclosed in palings I remained a few minutes to chat with the little housewife who knows her roses well and is versed in the gentle art of horticulture But her horizon is painfully narrow first and dearest the plants about her which is not so bad in a larger way Stephensport and its petty affairs but beyond that very little and that little vague It is ever thus in such far away side tracked villages as this the world lies in the basin of the hills which these people see from their doors if they have something to love and do for as this good woman has in her bushes seeds and bulbs then may they dwell happily in rustic obscurity but where as is more common the small beer of neighborhood gossip is their meat and drink there are no folk on the footstool more wretched than the denizens of a dead little hamlet like Stephensport We are housed this night on the Kentucky side a mile and a half above Cloverport whose half dozen lights are glimmering in the stream In the gloaming while dinner was being prepared a ragged but sturdy wanderer came into camp He was he said a mountaineer looking for work on the bottom farms heretofore he had when he wanted it always found it but this season no one appeared to have any money to expend for labor and it seemed likely he would be obliged to return home without receiving an offer We made the stranger no offer of a seat at our humble board having no desire that he pass the night in our neighborhood for darkness was coming on apace and if he long tarried the woodland road would be as black as a pocket before he could reach Cloverport his alleged destination So starting him off with a biscuit or two he was soon on his way toward the village whistling a lively tune Crooked Creek Ind Saturday twod We had but fairly got to bed last night after our late dinner when the heavens suddenly darkened fierce gusts of wind shook the tent violently and then rain fell in blinding sheets For a time it was lively work for the Doctor and me tightening guy ropes and ditching in the soft sand for we were in an exposed position catching the full force of the storm At last everything secured we in serenity slept it out awakening to find a beautiful morning the grape perfumed air as clear as crystal the outlines of woods and hills and streams standing out with sharp definition and over all a hushed charm most soothing to the spirit Cloverport seven hundred five miles is a typical Kentucky town of somewhat less than four thousand inhabitants The wharf boat which runs up and down an iron tramway according to the height of the flood was swarming with negroes watching with keen delight the departure of the E D Rogan as she noisily backed out into the river and scattered the crowd with great showers of spray from her gigantic stern wheel It was a busy scene on board negro roustabouts shipping the gang plank and singing in a low pitch an old time plantation melody stokers stripped to the waist shoveling coal into the gaping furnaces chambermaids hanging the ship s linen out to dry passengers crowded by the shore rail on the main deck the bustling mate shouting orders apparently for the benefit of landsmen for no one on board appeared to heed him and high up in front of the pilot house the spruce captain in gold laced cap and glass in hand as immovable as the Sphinx At the head of the slope were a picturesque medley of colored folk of true Southern plantation types so seldom seen north of Dixie Two wee picaninnies drawn in an express cart by a half dozen other sable elfs attracted our attention as W and I went up town for our day s marketing We stopped to take a snap shot at them to the intense satisfaction of the little kink haired mother of the twins who barring her blue calico gown looked as if she might have just stepped out of a Zulu group Cloverport has brick works gas wells a flouring mill and other industries The streets are unkempt as in most Kentucky towns and mules attached to crazy little carts are the chief beasts of burden but the shops are well stocked there were many farmers in town on horse and mule back doing their Saturday shopping and an air of business confidence prevails In this district coal mines again appear with their riverside tipples and their offal defiling the banks In general these reaches have many of the aspects of the Monongahela although the hills are lower and mining is on a smaller scale Cannelton Ind seven hundred seventeen miles is the headquarters of the American Cannel Coal company there are also woolen and cotton mills sewer pipe factories and potteries W and I went up into the town on an errand for supplies we distribute our small patronage for the sake of frequently going ashore and were interested in noting the cheery tone of the business men who reported that the financial depression noticeable elsewhere in the Ohio Valley has practically been unfelt here Hawesville Ky just across the river has a similarly prosperous look but we did not row across to inspect it at close range Tell City Ind three miles below is another flourishing factory town whose wharf boat was the scene of much bustle Four miles still lower down lies the sleepy little Indiana village of Troy which appears to have profited nothing from having lively neighbors From the neighborhood of Derby the environing hills had as we proceeded been lessening in height although still ruggedly beautiful A mile or two below Troy both ranges suddenly roll back into the interior leaving broad bottoms on either hand occasionally edged with high clay banks through which the river has cut its devious way At other times these bottoms slope gently to the beach and everywhere are cultivated with such care that often no room is left for the willow fringe which heretofore has been an ever present feature of the landscape Hereafter to the mouth we shall for the most part row between parallel walls of clay with here and there a bankside ledge of rock and shale and now and then a cragged spur running out to meet the river We have now entered the great corn and tobacco belt of the Lower Ohio the region of annual overflow where the towns seek the highlands and the bottom farmers erect their few crude buildings on posts prepared in case of exceptional flood to take to boats The prevalent eagerness on the part of farmers to obtain the utmost from their land made it difficult this evening to find a proper camping place We finally found a narrow triangle of clay terrace in Indiana at the mouth of Crooked Creek seven hundred twenty seven miles where not long since had tarried a houseboater engaged in making rustic furniture It is a pretty little bit in a group of big willows and sycamores and would be comfortable but for the sand flies which for the first time give us annoyance The creek itself some four rods wide and overhung with stately trees winds gracefully through the rich bottom we have found it a charming water to explore being able to proceed for nearly a mile through lovely little wide spreads abounding in lilies and sweet with the odor of grape blossoms Across the river at Emmerick s Landing a little cluster of unpainted cabins lies the white barge of a photographer just such a home as the Derby artist covets The Ohio is here about half a mile wide but high pitched voices of people on the opposite bank are plainly heard across the smooth sounding board and in the quiet evening air comes to us the chuck chuck of oars nearly a mile away Following a torrid afternoon with exasperating headwinds this cool fresh atmosphere in the long twilight is inspiring Overhead is the slender streak of the moon s first quarter its reflection shimmering in the broad and placid stream rushing noiselessly by us to the sea In blissful content we sit upon the bank and drink in the glories of the night The days of our pilgrimage are nearing their end but our enthusiasm for this al fresco life is in no measure abating That we might ever thus dream and drift upon the river of life far from the labored strivings of the world is our secret wish to night We had long been sitting thus having silent communion with our thoughts when the Boy his little head resting on W s shoulder broke the spell by murmuring from the fullness of his heart Mother why cannot we keep on doing this always Yellowbank Island Sunday June threed Pilgrim still attracts more attention than her passengers When we stop at the village wharfs or grate our keel upon some rustic landing it is not long before the Doctor who now always remains with the boat no matter who goes ashore is surrounded by an admiring group who rap Pilgrim on the ribs try to lift her by the bow and study her graceful lines with the air of connoisseurs Barefooted men fishing on the shores in broad straw hats and blue jeans invariably pass the time o day with us as we glide by crying out as a parting salute Ye ve a honey skiff thar or Right smart skiff thet yere We have many long dreary reaches to day Clay banks twelve to twenty feet in height and growing taller as the water recedes rise sheer on either side Fringing the top of each is often a row of locusts whose roots in a feeble way hold the soil but the river cuts in at the base wherever the changing current impinges on the shore and at low water great slices with a gurgling splash fall into the stream which now is of the color of dull gold from the clay held in solution Often ruins of buildings may be seen upon the brink that have collapsed from this undercut of the fickle flood and many others still inhabited are in dangerous proximity to the edge only biding their time This morning we passed the Indiana hamlets of Lewisport seven hundred thirty one miles and Grand View seven hundred thirty six miles and by noon were at Rockport seven hundred forty one miles a smart little city of three thousand souls romantically perched upon a great rock which on the right bank rises abruptly from the wide expanse of bottom From the river there is little to be seen of Rockport save two wharves one above the other below the bold cliff which springs sheer for a hundred feet above the stream two angling roads leading up into the town a house or two on the edge of the hill and a huge water tower crowning all A few miles below we ran through a narrow channel a few rods wide separating an elongated island from the Indiana shore It much resembles the small tributary streams with a lush undergrowth of weeds down to the water s edge and arched with monster sycamores elms maples and persimmons Frequently had we seen skiffs upon the shore arranged with stern paddle wheels turned by levers operated by men standing or sitting in the boat But we had seen none in operation until shooting down this side channel we met such a craft coming up manned by two fellows who seemed to be having a treadmill task of it they assured us however that when a man was used to manipulating the levers he found it easier than rowing especially in ascending stream Yellowbank Island our camp to night lies nearest the Indiana shore with Owensboro Ky seven hundred forty nine miles just across the way We have had no more beautiful home on our long pilgrimage than this sandy islet heavily grown to stately willows While the others were preparing dinner I pulled across the rapid current to an Indiana ferry landing where there is a row of mean frame cabins like the negro quarters of a Southern farm all elevated on posts some four feet above the level A half dozen families live there all of them small tenant farmers save the ferryman a strapping good natured fellow who appears to be the nabob of the community Several hollow sycamore stumps house sows and their litters but the only cow in the neighborhood is owned by a young man who when I came up was watering some refractory mules at a pump trough He paused long enough to summon Boss and milk a half gallon into my pail accepting my dime with a degree of thankfulness which was quite unnecessary considering that it was quid pro quo Tobacco is a more important crop than corn hereabout he said farmers are rather impatiently waiting for rain to set out the young plants His only outbuilding is a monster corn crib set high on posts the airy basement no better than an open shed serving for a stable during the few weeks of severe winter weather horses and cow are removed to the main floor and canvas nailed around the sides to keep out the wind Even this slight protection is not vouchsafed stock by all planters the majority of them appear to provide only rain shelters and even these can be of slight avail in a driving storm Later in the failing light W and I pulled together over to the cracker settlement seeking drinking water A stout young man was seated on the end of the ferry barge talking earnestly with the ferryman s daughter a not unattractive girl but pale and thin as these women are apt to be Evidently they are lovers and not ashamed of it for they gave us a friendly smile as we knotted our painter to the barge rail and expressed great interest in Pilgrim she being of a pattern new to them We are in a noisy corner of the world Over on the Indiana bottom a squeaky fiddle is grinding out dance tunes hymns and ballads with charming indifference We thought we detected in a high pitched Annie Laurie the voice of the ferryman s daughter There seems too to be a deal of rowing on the river evidently Owensboro folk getting back to town from a day in the country and country folk hieing home after a day in the city The ferryman is in much demand judging from the frequent ringing of his bell one on either bank set between two tall posts with a rope dangling from the arm At early dusk the cracked bell of the Owensboro Bethel resounded harshly in our ears as it advertised an evening service for the floating population and now the wheezy strains of a melodeon tell us that although we stayed away doubtless others have been attracted thither The sepulchral roars of passing steamers echo along the wooded shore the night wind rustles the tree tops Owensboro dogs are much awake and the electric lamps of the city throw upon our canvas screen the fantastic shadows of leaves and dancing boughs CHAPTER XIX Fishermen s tales Skiff nomenclature Green River Evansville Henderson Audubon and Rafinesque Floating trade The Wabash Green River Towhead Monday June fourth We were shopping in Owensboro this morning soon after seven o clock The business quarter was just stirring into life and the negroes who were lounging about on every hand were still drowsy as if they had passed the night there and were reluctant to be up and doing There is a pretty court house in a green park the streets are well paved and the shops clean and bright with their wares mostly under the awnings on the sidewalk for people appear to live much out of doors here and well they may with the temperature seventy three deg at this early hour and every promise of a scorching day I wonder if a fisherman could if he tried be exact in his statements One of them below Owensboro who kept us company for a mile or two down stream declared that at this stage of the water he made forty and fifty dollars a week n I reck n I ote to be contint A few miles farther on another complained that when the river was falling the water was so muddy the fish would not bite and even in the best of seasons a fisherman had a hard pull uv it hit ain t no business fer a decent man The other day when the river was rising a Cincinnati follower of the apostle s calling averred that there was no use fishing when the water was coming up As the variable Ohio is like the ocean tide ever rising or falling it would seem that the thousands in this valley who make fishing their livelihood must be playing a losing game There are many beautiful islands on these lower reaches of the river We followed the narrow channel between Little Hurricane and the Kentucky shore a charming run of two or three miles with both banks a dense tangle of drift wood weeds and vines Between Three Mile Island and Indiana is another interesting cut short where the shores are undisturbed by the work of the main stream and trees and undergrowth come down to the water s edge the air is quivering with the songs of birds and resonant with sweet smells while over stumps and dead and fallen trees grape vines luxuriantly festoon and cluster Near the pretty group of French Islands two government dredges with their boarding barges were moored to the Kentucky shore waiting for coal we were told before resuming operations in the planting of a dike I took a snap shot at the fleet and heard one man shout to another Bill did yer notice they ve a photograph gallery aboard They appear to be a jolly lot these dredgers and inclined to take life easily in accordance with the traditions of government employ We frequently see skiffs hauled upon the beach or moored between two protecting posts to prevent their being swamped by steamer wakes The names they bear interest us as betokening perhaps the proclivities of their owners Little Joe Little Jim Little Maggie and like diminutives are common here as upon the towing tugs and steam ferries of broader waters and now and then we have by contrast Xerxes Achilles Hercules Sometimes the skiff is named after its owner s wife or sweetheart as Maggie G Polly H or from the rustic goddesses Pomona Flora Ceres on the Kentucky shore we have noted Stonewall Jackson and Robert E Lee and one Ohio boat was labeled Little Phil Literature we found represented to day by Octave Thanet the only case on record for the Ohio River cracker is not greatly given to books Slang claims for its own many of these knockabout craft U Bet Git Thair Go it Eli Whoa Emma and nondescripts like Two Doves Poker Chip and Game Chicken are not infrequent In these stately solitudes towns are far between Enterprise Ind seven hundred fifty five miles is an unpainted village with a dismal view back of and around it wide bottom lands with hills in the far distance up and down the river precipitous banks of clay with willow fringes on that portion of the shore which is not being cut by the impinging current Scuffletown Ky seven hundred sixty seven miles is uninviting Newburgh on the edge of a bluff across the river in Indiana is a ragged little place that has seen better days but the backward view of Newburgh from below Three Mile Island made a pretty picture the whites and reds of the town standing out in sharp relief against the dark background of the hill Green River seven hundred seventy five miles a gentle rustic stream enters through the wide bottoms of Kentucky We had difficulty in finding it in the wilderness of willows might not have succeeded indeed had not the red smokestack of a small steamer suddenly appeared above the bushes Soon the puffing craft debouched upon the Ohio and quickly overtaking us passed down toward Evansville Green River Towhead two miles below claimed us for the night There is a shanty midway on the island and at the lower end the landing of a railway transfer We have our camp at the upper end in a bed of spotless white sand thick grown to dwarf willows Entangled drift wood lies about in monster heaps lodged in depressions of the land or against stout tree trunks a low bar of gravel connects our home with Green River Island lying close against the Indiana bank sand flies freely joined us at dinner and I hear as I write the drone of a solitary mosquito the first in many days while upon the bar at sunset a score of turkey buzzards held silent council some of them occasionally rising and wheeling about in mid air then slowly lighting and stretching their necks and flapping their wings most solemnly before rejoining the conference Cypress Bend Tuesday fifth The temperature had materially fallen during the night and the morning opened gray and hazy Evansville Ind seven hundred eighty three miles made a charming Turneresque study as her steeples and factory chimneys developed through the mist It is a fine well built town of some fifty thousand inhabitants with a beautiful little postoffice in the Gothic style a refutation this of the well worn assertion that there are no creditable government buildings in our small American cities A railway bridge here crosses the Ohio numerous sawmills line the bank altogether there is business bustle the like of which we have not seen since leaving Louisville Henderson seven hundred ninety five miles is a substantial Kentucky town of nine thousand souls with large tobacco interests we are told ranking next to Louisville in this regard Through the morning the mist had been thickening While we were passing beneath the railway bridge at Henderson thunder sounded and the western sky suddenly blackened Pulling rapidly in to the town shore shelter was found beneath the overhanging deck of a deserted wharf boat We had just completed preparations with the rubber blankets and ponchos when the deluge came But the sheltering deck was not water tight soon the rain came pouring in upon us through the uncaulked cracks and we were nearly as badly off in our close smelling quarters as in the open However we were a merry party under there with the Doctor giving us a touch of Br er Rabbit and the boy relating a fantastic dream he had had on the Towhead last night while I told them the story of Audubon whose name will ever be associated with Henderson The great naturalist was in business at Louisville early in the century but in eighteen twelve he failed in this venture and moved to Henderson where his neighbors thought him a trifle daft and certainly he was a ne er do well wandering around the woods with hair hanging down on his shoulders a far away look in his eyes and communing with the birds In eighteen eighteen the botanist Rafinesque on the first of his several tramps down the Ohio valley he had a favorite saying that the only way for a botanist to travel was to walk stopped over at Henderson to visit this crazy fellow of whom he had heard Rafinesque had a hope that Audubon might buy some of his colored drawings but when he saw the wonderful pictures which Audubon had made he acknowledged that his own were inferior a sore confession for Rafinesque who was an egotist of the first water Audubon had but humble quarters for it was hard work in those days for him to keep the wolf from the door nevertheless he entertained the distinguished traveler whom he was himself destined to far eclipse One night a bat flew into Rafinesque s bedroom and in driving it out he used his host s fine Cremona as a club thus making kindling wood of it Two years later still steeped in poverty Audubon left Henderson It was eighteen twenty six before he became known to the world of science when little of his life was left in which to enjoy the fame at last awarded him We had lunch on Henderson Island three miles down and for warmth walked briskly about on the strand among the willow clumps It rained again after we had taken our seats in the boat and the head wind which sprang up was not unwelcome for it necessitated a right lively pull to make headway W and the Boy in the stern sheets were not uncomfortable when swathed to the chin in the blankets which ordinarily serve us as cushions Ten miles below Henderson was a little fleet of houseboats lying in a thicket of willows along the Indiana beach We stopped at one of them and bought a small catfish for dinner The fishermen seemed a happy company in this isolated spot The women were engaged in household work but the men were spending the afternoon collected in the cabin of one of their number who had recently arrived from Green River While waiting for the fish to be caught in a live box I visited with the little band It was a comfortable room furnished rather better than the average shore cabin and the Green River man s family of half a dozen were well kept pleasant faced and polite Altogether it was a much more respectable houseboat company than any we have yet seen on the river But the fish stories which that Green River man tells with an honest like open eyed sobriety would do credit to Munchausen The rain at first spasmodic became at last persistent Two miles farther down at Cypress Bend eight hundred six miles we ran into an Indiana hill where on a steep slope of yellow shale all strewn with rocks our tent was hurriedly pitched There was no driving of pegs into this stony base so we weighted down the canvas with round heads and fastened our guys to bushes and boulders as best we might Huddled around the little stove under the fly the crew dined sumptuously en course from canned soup down to strawberries for dessert for Evansville is a good market It is not always we pilgrims fare thus high the resources of Rome Thebes Bethlehem Herculaneum and the other classic towns with which the Ohio s banks are dotted being none of the best Some days we are fortunate to have aught in our larder Brown s Island Wednesday sixth This morning s camp fire was welcome for its warmth The sky has been clear but a sharp cold wind has prevailed throughout the day quite counteracting the sun s rays we noticed townsfolk going about in overcoats their hands in their pockets In the ox bow curves the breeze came in turn from every quarter sometimes dead ahead and again pushing us swiftly on In seeking the lee shore Pilgrim pursued a zigzag course back and forth between the States now under the brow of towering clay banks corrugated by the flood and honeycombed by swallows which in flocks screamed and circled over our heads again closely brushing the fringe of willows and sycamores and maples on low lying shores Thus did we for the most part paddle in placid water while above us the wind whistled in the tree tops rustled the blooming elders and the tall grasses of the plain and out in the open river caused white caps to dance right merrily We met at intervals to day several houseboats the most of them bearing the inscription prescribed by the new Kentucky license law which is now being enforced the essential features of which inscription are the home and name of the owner and the date at which the license expires The standard of education among houseboaters is evinced by the legend borne by a trader s craft which we boarded near Slim Island Lisens exp rs Maye the twenty four eighteen ninety five The young woman in charge a slender creature in a brilliant red calico gown with blue ribbons at the corsage had been but recently married to her lord who was back in the country stirring up trade She had few notions of business and allowed us to put our own prices on such articles as we purchased The stock was a curious medley a few staple groceries bacon and dried beef candies crockery hardware tobacco a small line of patent medicines in which blood purifiers chiefly prevailed bitters ginger beer and a glass case in which were displayed two or three women s straw hats gaudily trimmed The woman said their custom was to tie up to some convenient shore and buy a little stuff o the farmers n in that way trade springs up and thus become known Two or three weeks would exhaust any neighborhood whereupon they would move on for a dozen miles or so Late in the autumn they select a comfortable beach and lie by for the winter Mt Vernon Ind eight hundred nineteen miles is on a high rolling plain with a rather pretty little court house set in a park of grass some good business buildings and huge flouring mills which appear to be the leading industry Another flouring mill town with the addition of the characteristic Kentucky distillery is Uniontown eight hundred thirty three miles on the southern shore a bright neat little city backed by smooth picturesque green hills The feature of the day was the entrance through a dreary stretch of clay banks of the Wabash River eight hundred thirty eight miles which divides Indiana from Illinois Three hundred and sixty yards wide at the mouth about half the width of the Ohio it is the most important of the latter s northern affluents and pours into the main stream a swift rushing body of clear green water which at first boldly pushes over to the heavily willowed Kentucky shore the roily mess of the Ohio and for several miles exerts a considerable influence in clarification The Lower Wabash flowing through a soft clay bottom runs an erratic course and its mouth is a variable location so that the bounds of Illinois and Indiana hereabout fluctuate east and west according to the exigencies of the floods The far reaching bottom itself however is apparently of slight value giving evidence in the dreary clumps of dead timber of being frequently inundated An interesting stream is the Wabash from an historical point of view La Salle knew of it in sixteen seventy seven and was planning to prosecute his fur trade over the Maumee and the Wabash but the Iroquois held the portage and for nearly forty years thereafter forbade its use by whites Joliet thought the Wabash the headwaters of what we know as the Lower Ohio and in his map sixteen seventy three styled the latter the Wabash down to its mouth Vincennes an old Wabash town was one of the posts captured so heroically for the Americans by George Rogers Clark during the Revolutionary War In eighteen fourteen there was established at New Harmony also on the Wabash the communistic seat of the Harmonists who had moved thither from Pennsylvania to which dissatisfied with the West they returned ten years later Numerous islands have to day beautified the Ohio Despite their inartistic names Diamond and Slim are tipped at head and foot with charming banks and willowed sand and each center is clothed in a luxurious forest rimmed by a gravelly beach piled high with drift and gnarled roots the whole with startling clearness inversely reflected in the mirrored flood Wabash Island opposite the mouth of the great tributary is an insular woodland several miles in length Among the prettiest of these jewels studding our silvery path is the upmost of the little group known as Brown s Islands on which we are passing the night It was an easy landing on the hard sand and a comfortable carry to a level opening in the willows where we have a model camp with a great round sycamore block for a table an Evansville newspaper does duty as a tablecloth and two logs rolled alongside make seats Four miles below the smoke of Shawneetown eight hundred forty eight miles rises lazily above the dark level line of woods while across the river in Kentucky there is an unbroken forest fringe without sign of life as far as the eye can reach A long glistening bar of sand connects our little island home with the Illinois mainland upon it was being held in the long twilight that evening council of turkey buzzards which we so often witness when in an island camp Sand pipers went fearlessly about among them bobbing their little tails with nervous vehemence redbirds trilled their good nights in the tree tops and daintily wading in the sandy shallows object lessons in patience were great blue herons carefully peering for the prey which never seems to be found As night closed in upon us owls dismally hooted in the mainland woods buzzards betook themselves to inland roosts herons winged their stately flight to I know not where and over on the Kentucky shore could faintly be heard the barking of dogs at the little cracker farmsteads hid deep in the lowland forest CHAPTER XX Shawneetown Farm houses on stilts Cave in Rock An island night Half Moon Bar Thursday June seventh A head breeze prevailed all day strong enough to fan us into a sense of coolness but leaving the water as unruffled as a mill pond thus did we seem in the vivid reflections of the early morning to be sailing between double lines of shore lovely in their groupings of luxuriant trees and tangled heaps of vine clad drift It was a hazy mirage producing atmosphere the river appearing to melt away in space and the ever charming island heads looming unsupported in mid air From the woods the piercing note of locusts filled the air as with the ceaseless rattle of pebbles against innumerable window panes At a distance Shawneetown appears as if built upon higher land than the neighboring bottom but this proves on approach to be an optical illusion for the town is walled in by a levee some thirty feet in height above the top of which loom its chimneys and spires Shawneetown laid out in eighteen oh eight soon became an important post on the Lower Ohio and indeed ranked with Kaskaskia as one of the principal Illinois towns although in eighteen seventeen it still only contained from thirty to forty log dwellings During the reign of the Ohio River bargemen A it was notorious as the headquarters of the roughest elements in that boisterous class and frequently the scene of most barbarous outrages the odious receptacle says a chronicler of the time of filth and villany In those lively days which lasted with more or less vigor until about eighteen thirty by which time steamboats had finally overcome popular prejudice and gained the upper hand in river transportation the people of Shawneetown were largely dependent on the trade of the salt works of the neighboring Saline Reserve The salt licks at which in early days the bones of the mammoth were found as at Big Bone Lick commenced a few miles below the town and embraced a district of about ninety thousand acres While Illinois was still a Territory these salines were rented by the United States to individuals but were granted to the new State eighteen eighteen in perpetuity The trade in time decreased with the decadence of river traffic and Shawneetown has since had but slow growth it now being a dreary little place of three thousand inhabitants with unmistakable evidences of having long since seen its best days The farmers upon the wide bottoms of the lower reaches now invariably have their dwellings corn cribs and tobacco sheds set upon posts varying from five to ten feet high according to the surrounding elevation above the normal river level At present we are as a rule hemmed in by banks full thirty or forty feet in height above the present stage After a hard climb up the steps which are frequently found cut into the clay to facilitate access to the river it is with something akin to awe that we look upon these buildings on stilts for they bespeak in times of great flood a rise in the river of between fifty and sixty feet Three miles above Saline River I scrambled up to photograph a farm house of this character In order to get the building within the field of the camera it was necessary to mount a cob house of loose rails which did duty as a pig pen A young woman of eighteen or twenty years attired in a dazzling red calico gown came out on the front balcony to see the operation and for a touch of life I held her in talk until the picture was taken She was not at all averse to thus posing and chatted as familiarly as though we were old friends The water my model said came at least once a year to the main floor of the house some ten feet above the level of the land and forty feet above the normal river stage every few years it rose to the eaves of this story and a half dwelling when the family would embark in boats hieing off to the back lying hills a mile and a half away An event of this sort seemed quite commonplace to the girl and not at all to be viewed as a calamity As in other houses of the bottom farmers of this district there is no wall paper no plaster upon the walls and little or nothing else to be injured by water Their few household possessions can readily be packed into a scow together with the live stock and behold the family is ready if need be to float away to the ends of the world As a matter of fact if they carry food enough with them and a rain proof tent their season on the hills is but a prolonged picnic When the waters sufficiently subside they float back again to their home the river mud is scraped out of the rooms the kitchen stove rubbed up a bit and soon everything is again at rights with a fresh layer of alluvial deposit to fertilize the fields Few of these small farmers own the lands they till from Pittsburg down the great majority of Ohio River planters are but tenants The old families that once owned the soil are living in the neighboring towns or in other parts of the country and renting out their acres to these cultivators We were told that the rental fee around Owensboro is usually in kind fourteen bushels of good salable corn being the rate per acre In Egypt as Southern Illinois is called the average rent is four or five dollars in money except in years when the water remains long upon the ground and thus shortens the season then the fee is correspondingly reduced The girl on the balcony averred that in eighteen ninety three it amounted to one third the value of the average yield The numerous huge stilted corn cribs we see are constructed so that wagons can drive up into them and after unloading in bins on either side descend another incline at the far end Sometimes a portion of the crib is boarded up for a residence with windows and a little balcony which does double duty as a porch and a landing stage for the boats in time of high water Scattered about on the level are loosely built sheds of rails for stock which practically live al fresco so far as actual storm shelter goes Usually the flooded bottoms are denuded of trees save perhaps a narrow fringe along the bank and a few dead trunks scattered here and there while back a third or a half mile from the river lies a dense line of forest far beyond which rises the low rim of the basin But just below Saline River eight hundred fifty seven miles a lazy little stream of a few rods width the hills now perhaps eighty or a hundred feet in height again approach to the water s edge and henceforth to the mouth we are to have alternating semi circular wooded bottoms and shaly often palisaded uplands grown to scrub and vines much in the fashion of some of the middle reaches A trading boat was moored just within the Saline where we stopped for lunch under a clump of sycamores The owner obtains butter and eggs from the farmers in exchange for his varied wares and sells them at a goodly profit to passing steamers which will always stop when flagged Approaching Cave in Rock Ill eight hundred sixty nine miles the right bank is for several miles an almost continuous palisade of lime stone thick studded with black and brown flints In the breaking down of this escarpment popularly styled Battery Rocks numerous caves have been formed the largest of which gave the place its name It is a rather low opening into the rock perhaps two hundred feet deep and the floor some twenty feet above the present level of the river in times of flood it is frequently so filled with water that boats enter and thousands of silly people have in two or three generations past carved or painted their names upon the vaulted roof B From this large entrance hall a chimney like hole in the roof leads to other chambers said to be imposing and widely ramified not unlike a Gothic cathedral said Ashe an early English traveler eighteen oh six who appears to have everywhere in these Western wilds sought the marvellous and found it About eighteen oh one a band of robbers made these inner recesses their home and frequently sallied thence to rob passing boats and incidentally to murder the crews As for the little hamlet of Cave in Rock nestled in a break in the palisade a few hundred yards below it was between eighteen oh one and eighteen oh five the seat of another species of brigandage a land speculation wherein schemers waxed rich from the confusion engendered by conflicting claims of settlers the outgrowth of carelessly phrased Indian treaties and overlapping French and English patents From eighteen oh four to eighteen ten a Congressional committee was engaged in straightening out this weary tangle and its decisions ratified by Congress are to day the foundation of many land titles in Indiana and Illinois We are in camp to night upon the Illinois shore opposite Half Moon Bar eight hundred seventy two miles and a mile above Hurricane Island Towering above us are great sycamores cypress maples and elms and all about a dense jungle of grasses vines and monster weeds the rank horse weed being now some ten feet high with a stem an inch in diameter the dead stalks of last year s growth in the broad rolling fields to our rear indicate a possibility of sixteen feet and an apparent desire to out rival the corn Cane brake too is prevalent hereabout with stalks two inches or more thick The mulberries are reddening the Doctor reports on his return with the Boy from a botanizing expedition and black caps are turning while bergamot and vervain are among the plants newly added to the herbarium Stewart s Island Friday eighth We arose this morning to find the tent as wet from dew and fog as if there had been a shower and the bushes by the landing were sparkling with great beads of moisture The bold black head of Hurricane Island stood out with startling distinctness framed in rolling fog through a cloud bank on the horizon the sun was bursting with the dull glow of burnished copper By the time of starting the fog had lifted and the sun swung clear in a steel blue sky but there was still a soft haze on land and river which dreamily closed the ever changing vistas and we seemed to float through an enchanted land The approach to Elizabethtown Ill eight hundred seventy seven miles is picturesque but of the dry little town of seven hundred souls with its rocky undulating streets set in a break in the line of palisades very little is to be seen from the river Quarrying for paving stones appears to be the chief pursuit of the Elizabethans At Rose Clare Ill a string of shanties three miles below are two idle plants of the Argyle Lead and Fluor Spar Mining company Carrsville Ky is another arid hillside hamlet with striking escarpments stretching above and below for several miles Mammoth boulders a dozen or more feet in height relics doubtless of once formidable cliffs here line the riverside The palisaded hills reappear in Illinois commencing at Parkinson s Landing a dreary little settlement on a waste of barren stony slope flanking the perpendicular wall Just above Golconda Island eight hundred ninety miles on the Illinois side we were witness to a meet of farmers for a squirrel hunt a favorite amusement in these parts There were five men upon a side all carrying guns as we passed they were shaking hands preparatory to separating for the battue Upon the bank above in a grove of cypress pawpaw and sycamore their horses were standing unhitched from the poles of the wagons in which they had been driven and tied to trees feeding from boxes set upon the ground It was pleasant to see that these people who must lead dreary lives upon the malaria stricken and flood washed bottoms occasionally take a holiday with a spice of rational adventure in it although there is the probability that this squirrel hunt may be followed to night by a roystering at the village tavern the losing side paying the score We reached Stewart s Island nine hundred one miles at five o clock and went into camp upon the landing beach of hard white sand facing Kentucky The island is two miles long the owner living in Bird s Point Landing Ky just below us a rather shabby but picturesquely situated little village at the base of pretty wooded hills A hundred and fifty acres of the island are planted to corn and the owner s laborers a white overseer and five blacks are

none	none	 doubtless the first English exploration of waters flowing into the latter river The Great Kanawha was by Wood himself called New River but the geographers of the time styled it Wood s The last title was finally dropped the stream above the mouth of the Gauley is however still known as New These several adventurers had now demonstrated that while the waters beyond the mountains were not the Western Ocean they possibly led to such a sea and it came to be recognized too that the continent was not as narrow as had up to this time been supposed Meanwhile the French of Canada were casting eager eyes toward the Ohio as a gateway to the continental interior But the French hating Iroquois held fast the upper waters of the Mohawk Delaware and Susquehanna and the long but narrow watershed sloping northerly to the Great Lakes so that the westering Ohio was for many years sealed to New France An important factor in American history this for it left the great valley practically free from whites while the English settlements were strengthening on the seaboard when at last the French were ready aggressively to enter upon the coveted field they had in the English colonists formidable and finally successful rivals It is believed by many and the theory is not unreasonable that the great French fur trader and explorer La Salle was at the Falls of the Ohio site of Louisville in the autumn or early winter of sixteen sixty nine How he got there is another question Some antiquarians believe that he reached the Alleghany by way of the Chautauqua portage and descended the Ohio to the Falls others that he ascended the Maumee from Lake Erie and descending the Wabash thus discovered the Ohio It was reserved for the geographer Franquelin to give in his map of sixteen eighty eight the first fairly accurate idea of the Ohio s path and Father Hennepin s large map of sixteen ninety seven showed that much had meanwhile been learned about the river No doubt by this time the great waterway was well known to many of the most adventurous French and English 
7357-94127-0004	train-other-500	fur traders possibly better to the latter than to the former
none	none	 unfortunately these men left few records behind them by which to trace their discoveries As early as sixteen eighty four we incidentally hear of the Ohio as a principal route for the Iroquois who brought peltries from the direction of the Illinois to the English at Albany and the French at Quebec Two years after this ten English trading canoes loaded with goods were seen on Lake Erie by French agents who in great alarm wrote home to Quebec about them Writes De Nonville to Seignelay I consider it a matter of importance to preclude the English from this trade as they doubtless would entirely ruin ours as well by the cheaper bargains they would give the Indians as by attracting to themselves the French of our colony who are in the habit of resorting to the woods Herein lay the gist of the whole matter 
7357-94127-0005	train-other-500	The legalized monopoly granted to the great fur trade companies of New France with the official corruption necessary to create and perpetuate that monopoly made the French trade an expensive business consequently goods were dear
none	none	 On the other hand the trade of the English was untrammeled and a lively competition lowered prices The French cajoled the Indians and fraternized with them in their camps whereas the English despised the savages and made little attempt to disguise their sentiments The French while claiming all the country west of the Alleghanies cared little for agricultural colonization they would keep the wilderness intact for the fostering of wild animals upon the trade in whose furs depended the welfare of New France and this too was the policy of the savage By English statesmen at home our continental interior was also chiefly prized for its forest trade which yielded rich returns for the merchant adventurers of London The policies of the English colonists and of their general government were ever clashing 
7357-94127-0006	train-other-500	The latter looked upon the Indian trade as an entering wedge they thought of the West as a place for growth
7357-94127-0007	train-other-500	Close upon the heels of the path breaking trader went the cattle raiser and following him the agricultural settler looking for cheap fresh and broader lands No edicts of the Board of Trade could repress these backwoodsmen
none	none	 savages could and did beat them back for a time but the annals of the border are lurid with the bloody struggle of the borderers for a clearing in the Western forest The greater part of them were Scotch Irish from Pennsylvania Virginia the Carolinas a hardy race who knew not defeat Steadily they pushed back the rampart of savagery and won the Ohio valley for civilization The Indian early recognized the land grabbing temper of the English and felt that a struggle to the death was impending The French 
7357-94127-0008	train-other-500	browbeat their savage allies and easily inflaming their passions kept the body of them almost continually at war with the English the Iroquois excepted
7357-94127-0009	train-other-500	not because the latter were English lovers or did not understand the aim of English colonization but because the earliest French had won their undying enmity
7357-94127-0010	train-other-500	Amidst all this weary strife the Indian a born trader who dearly loved a bargain never failed to recognize that the goods of his French
none	none	 friends were dear and that those of his enemies the English were cheap We find frequent evidences that for a hundred years the tribesmen of the Upper Lakes carried on an illicit trade with the hated English whenever the usually wary French were thought to be napping It is certain that English forest traders were upon the Ohio in the year seventeen hundred In seventeen fifteen the year before Governor Spotswood of Virginia with much feasting and parade made his famous expedition over the Blue Ridge there was a complaint that traders from Carolina had reached the villages on the Wabash and were poaching on the French preserves French military officers built little log stockades along that stream and tried in vain to induce the Indians of the valley to remove to saint Joseph s River out of the sphere of English influence Everywhere did French traders meet English competitors who were not to be frightened by orders to move off the field New France therefore determined to connect Canada and Louisiana by a chain of forts throughout the length of the Mississippi basin which should not only secure untrammeled communication between these far separated colonies but aid in maintaining French supremacy throughout the region Yet in seventeen twenty five we still hear of the English from Carolina busily trading with the Miamis under the very shadow of the guns of Fort Ouiatanon near Lafayette Ind and the French still vainly scolding thereat What was going on upon the Wabash was true elsewhere in the Ohio basin as far south as the Creek towns on the sources of the Tennessee About this time Pennsylvania and Virginia began to exhibit interest in their own overlapping claims to lands in the country northwest of the Ohio Those colonies were now settled close to the base of the mountains and there was heard a popular clamor for pastures new French ownership of the over mountain region was denied and in seventeen twenty eight Pennsylvania viewed with alarm the encroachments of the French The issue was now joined both sides claimed the field but as usual the contest was at first among the rival forest traders In the Virginia and Pennsylvania capitals the transmontane country was still a misty region In seventeen twenty nine colonel William Byrd an authority on things Virginian was able to write that nothing was then known in that colony of the sources of the Potomac Roanoke and Shenandoah It was not until seventeen thirty six that colonel William Mayo in laying out the boundaries of Lord Fairfax s generous estate discovered in the Alleghanies the head spring of the Potomac where ten years later was planted the famous Fairfax Stone the southwest point of the boundary between Virginia and Maryland That very same year seventeen forty six M de Lery chief engineer of New France went with a detachment of troops from Lake Erie to Chautauqua Lake and proceeded thence by Conewango Creek and Alleghany River to the Ohio which he carefully surveyed down to the mouth of the Great Miami Affairs moved slowly in those days New France was corrupt and weak and the English colonists unaided by the home government were not strong For many years nothing of importance came out of this rivalry of French and English in the Ohio Valley save the petty quarrels of fur traders and the occasional adventure of some Englishman taken prisoner by Indians in a border foray and carried far into the wilderness to meet with experiences the horror of which as preserved in their published narratives to this day causes the blood of the reader to curdle Now and then there were voluntary adventurers into these strange lands Such were John Howard John Peter Salling and two other Virginians who the story goes went overland seventeen forty or seventeen forty one under commission of their inquisitive governor to explore the country to the Mississippi They went down Coal and Wood s Rivers to the Ohio which in Salling s journal is called the Alleghany Finally a party of French negroes and Indians took them prisoners and carried them to New Orleans where on meager fare they were held in prison for eighteen months They escaped at last and had many curious adventures by land and sea until they reached home from which they had been absent two years and three months There are now few countries on the globe where a party of travelers could meet with adventures such as these At last the plot thickened the tragedy was hastened to a close France now formally asserted her right to all countries drained by streams emptying into the saint Lawrence the Great Lakes and the Mississippi This vast empire would have extended from the comb of the Rockies on the west discovered in seventeen forty three by the brothers La Verendrye to the crest of the Appalachians on the east thus including the western part of New York and New England The narrow strip of the Atlantic coast alone would have been left to the domination of Great Britain The demand made by France if acceded to meant the death blow to English colonization on the American mainland and yet it was made not without reason French explorers missionaries and fur traders had with great enterprise and fortitude swarmed over the entire region carrying the flag the religion and the commerce of France into the farthest forest wilds while the colonists of their rival busy in solidly welding their industrial commonwealths had as yet scarcely peeped over the Alleghany barrier It was asserted on behalf of Great Britain that the charters of her coast colonies carried their bounds far into the West further that as by the treaty of Utrecht seventeen thirteen France had acknowledged the suzerainty of the British king over the Iroquois confederacy the English were entitled to all lands conquered by those Indians whose war paths had extended from the Ottawa River on the north to the Carolinas on the south and whose forays reached alike to the Mississippi and to New England In this view was made in seventeen forty four the famous treaty at Lancaster Pa whereat the Iroquois impelled by rum and presents pretended to give to the English entire control of the Ohio Valley under the claim that the former had in various encounters conquered the Shawanese of that region and were therefore entitled to it It is obvious that a country occasionally raided by marauding bands of savages whose homes are far away cannot properly be considered theirs by conquest Meanwhile both sides were preparing to occupy and hold the contested field New France already had a weak chain of waterside forts and commercial stations the rendezvous of fur traders priests travelers and friendly Indians extending with long intervening stretches of savage haunted wilderness through the heart of the continent from Lower Canada to her outlying post of New Orleans It is not necessary here to enter into the details of the ensuing French and Indian War the story of which Parkman has told us so well Suffice it briefly to mention a few only of its features so far as they affect the Ohio itself The Iroquois although concluding with the English this treaty of Lancaster on which as a corner stone lay the claim of the colonists to the West were by this time as the result of wily French diplomacy growing suspicious of their English protectors at the same time having on several occasions been severely punished by the French they were less rancorous in their opposition to New France For this reason just as the English were getting ready to make good their claim to the Ohio by actual colonization the Iroquois began to let in the French at the back door In seventeen forty nine Galissoniere then governor of New France dispatched to the great valley a party of soldiers under Celoron de Bienville with directions to conduct a thorough exploration to bury at the mouths of principal streams lead plates graven with the French claim a custom of those days and to drive out English traders Celoron proceeded over the Lake Chautauqua route from Lake Erie to the Alleghany River and thence down the Ohio to the Miami returning to Lake Erie over the old Maumee portage English traders who could not be driven out were found swarming into the country and his report was discouraging The French realized that they could not maintain connection between New Orleans and their settlements on the saint Lawrence if driven from the Ohio valley The governor sent home a plea for the shipment of ten thousand French peasants to settle the region but the government at Paris was just then as indifferent to New France as was King George to his colonies and the settlers were not sent Meanwhile the English were not idle The first settlement they made west of the mountains was on New River a branch of the Kanawha seventeen forty eight in the same season several adventurous Virginians hunted and made land claims in Kentucky and Tennessee Before the close of the following year seventeen forty nine there had been formed for fur trading and colonizing purposes the Ohio Company composed of wealthy Virginians among whom were two brothers of Washington King George granted the company five hundred thousand acres south of and along the Ohio River on which they were to plant a hundred families and build and maintain a fort As a base of supplies they built a fortified trading house at Will s Creek now Cumberland Md near the head of the Potomac and developed a trail Nemacolin s Path sixty miles long across the Laurel Hills to the mouth of Redstone Creek on the Monongahela where was built another stockade seventeen fifty two Christopher Gist a famous backwoodsman was sent seventeen fifty the year after Celoron s expedition to explore the country as far down as the falls of the Ohio and select lands for the new company Gist s favorable report greatly stimulated interest in the Western country In his travels he met many Scotch Irish fur traders who had passed into the West through the mountain valleys of Pennsylvania Virginia and the Carolinas His negotiations with the natives were of great value to the English cause It was early seen by English and French alike that an immense advantage would accrue to the nation first in possession of what is now the site of Pittsburg the meeting place of the Monongahela and Alleghany rivers to form the Ohio the Forks of the Ohio as it was then called In the spring of seventeen fifty three a French force occupied the new fifteen mile portage route between Presque Isle Erie Pa and French Creek a tributary of the Alleghany On the banks of French Creek they built Fort Le Boeuf a stout log stockade It had been planned to erect another fort at the Forks of the Ohio one hundred and twenty miles below but disease in the camp prevented the completion of the scheme What followed is familiar to all who have taken any interest whatever in Western history In November Governor Dinwiddie of Virginia sent one of his major generals young George Washington with Gist as a companion to remonstrate with the French at Le Boeuf for occupying land so notoriously known to be the property of the Crown of Great Britain The French politely turned the messengers back In the following April seventeen fifty four Washington set out with a small command by the way of Will s Creek to forcibly occupy the Forks His advance party were building a fort there when the French appeared and easily drove them off Then followed Washington s defeat at Great Meadows July four The French were now supreme at their new Fort Duquesne The following year General Braddock set out from Virginia also by Nemacolin s Path but on that fateful ninth of July fell in the slaughter pen which had been set for him at Turtle Creek by the Indians of the Upper Lakes under the leadership of a French fur trader from far off Wisconsin From the time of Braddock s defeat until the close of the war French traders with savage allies poured the vials of their wrath upon the encroaching settlements of the English backwoodsmen Nemacolin s Path now known as Braddock s Road made for the Indians of the Ohio an easy pathway to the English borders of Pennsylvania Virginia and Maryland In the parallel valleys of the Alleghanies was waged a partisan warfare which in bitterness has probably not had its equal in all the long history of the efforts of expanding civilization to beat down the encircling walls of barbarism In seventeen fifty eight Canada was attacked by several English expeditions the most of which were successful One of these was headed by General John Forbes and directed against Fort Duquesne After a remarkable forest march overcoming mighty obstacles Forbes arrived at his destination to find that the French had blown up the fortifications some of the troops retreating to Lake Erie and others to rehabilitate Fort Massac on the Lower Ohio Thus England gained possession of the valley New France had been cut in twain The English Fort Pitt commanded the Forks of the Ohio and French rule in America was now doomed The fall of Quebec soon followed seventeen fifty nine then of Montreal seventeen sixty and in seventeen sixty three was signed the Treaty of Paris by which England obtained possession of all the territory east of the Mississippi River except the city of New Orleans and a small outlying district In order to please the savages of the interior and to cultivate the fur trade perhaps also to act as a check upon the westward growth of the too ambitious coast colonies King George III took early occasion to command his loving subjects in America not to purchase or settle lands beyond the mountains without our especial leave and license It is needless to say that this injunction was not obeyed The expansion of the English colonies in America was irresistible the Great West was theirs and they proceeded in due time to occupy it Long before the close of the French and Indian War English colonists whom we will now for convenience call Americans had made agricultural settlements in the Ohio basin As early as seventeen fifty two we have seen the Redstone fort was built In seventeen fifty three the French forces on retiring from Great Meadows burned several log cabins on the Monongahela The interesting story of the colonizing of the Redstone district at the western end of Braddock s Road has been outlined in Chapter I of the text and it has been shown in the course of the narrative of the pilgrimage how other districts were slowly settled in the face of savage opposition Although driven back in numerous Indian wars these American borderers had come to the Ohio valley to stay We have seen the early attempt of the Ohio Company to settle the valley Its agents blazed the way but the French and Indian War and the Revolution soon following tended to discourage the aspirations of the adventurers and the organization finally lapsed Western land speculators were as active in those days as now and Washington was chief among them We find him first interested in the valley through broad acres acquired on land grants issued for military services in the French and Indian War Revolutionary bounty claims made him a still larger landholder on Western waters and to the close of the century he was actively interested in schemes to develop the region We are not in the habit of so regarding him but both by frequent personal presence in the Ohio valley and extensive interests at stake there the Father of his Country was the most conspicuous of Western pioneers Dearly did Washington love the West which he knew so well when the Revolutionary cause looked dark and it seemed possible that England might seize the coast settlements he is said to have cried We will retire beyond the mountains and be free and in his declining years he seemed to regret that he was too old to join his former comrades of the camp in their colony at Marietta As early as seventeen fifty four Franklin in his famous Albany Plan of Union for the colonies had a device for establishing new states in the West upon lands purchased from the Indians In seventeen seventy three he displayed interest in the Walpole plan for another colony variously called Pittsylvania Vandalia and New Barataria with its proposed capital at the mouth of the Great Kanawha There were too several other Western colonial schemes among them the Henderson colony of Transylvania between the Cumberland and the Tennessee the seat of which was Boonesborough Readers of Roosevelt well know its brief but brilliant career intimately connected with the development of Tennessee and Kentucky But the most of these hopeful enterprises came to grief with the political secession of the colonies and when the coast States ceded their Western land claims to the new general government and the Ordinance of seventeen eighty seven provided for the organization of the Territory Northwest of the River Ohio there was no room for further enterprises of this character A The story of the Ohio is the story of the West With the close of the Revolution came a rush of travel down the great river It was more or less checked by border warfare which lasted until seventeen ninety four but in that year Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers broke the backbone of savagery east of the Mississippi the Tecumseh uprising eighteen twelve thirteen came too late seriously to affect the dwellers on the Ohio There were two great over mountain highways thither one of them being Braddock s Road with Redstone now Brownsville Pa and Pittsburg as its termini the other was Boone s old trail or Cumberland Gap With the latter this sketch has naught to do By the close of the Revolution Pittsburg in Gist s day but a squalid Indian village and a fording place was still only a distant out post merely a foothold in the Far West By seventeen eighty five there were a thousand people there chiefly engaged in the fur trade and in forwarding emigrants and goods to the rapidly growing settlements on the middle and lower reaches of the river The population had doubled by eighteen oh three By eighteen twelve there was to be seen here just the sort of bustling vicious frontier town with battlement fronts and ragged streets which Buffalo and then Detroit became in after years Cincinnati and Chicago saint Louis and Kansas City had still later each in turn their share of this experience and not many years ago Bismarck Omaha and Leadville From Philadelphia and Baltimore and Richmond there were running to Pittsburg or Redstone regular lines of stages for the better class of passengers freight wagons laden with immense bales of goods were to be seen in great caravans which frequently were stalled in the mud of the mountain roads emigrants from all parts of the Eastern States and many countries of Europe often toiled painfully on foot over these execrable highways with their bundles on their backs or following scrawny cattle harnessed to makeshift vehicles and now and then came a well to do equestrian with his pack horses generally an Englishman who was out to see the country and upon his return to write a book about it At Pittsburg and points on the Alleghany Youghiogheny and Monongahela were boat building yards which turned out to order a curious medley of craft arks flat and keel boats barges pirogues and schooners of every design conceivable to fertile brain Upon these travelers took passage for the then Far West down the swift rolling Ohio There have descended to us a swarm of published journals by English and Americans alike giving pictures more or less graphic of the men and manners of the frontier none is without interest even if in its pages the priggish author but unconsciously shows himself and fails to hold the mirror up to the rest of nature With the introduction of steamboats the first was in eighteen eleven but they were slow to gain headway against popular prejudice the old river life with its picturesque but rowdy boatmen its unwieldy flats and keels and arks began to pass away and water traffic to approach the prosaic stage the crossing of the mountains by the railway did away with the boisterous freighters the stages and the coaching taverns and when at last the river became paralleled by the iron way the glory of the steamboat epoch itself faded riverside towns adjusted themselves to the new highways of commerce new centers arose and side tracked ports fell into decay Footnote A See Turner s Western State Making in the Revolutionary Era in Amer Hist reverend Vol I
