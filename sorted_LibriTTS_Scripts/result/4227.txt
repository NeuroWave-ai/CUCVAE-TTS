airship and glanced down the road He saw a cloud of dust which effectually concealed whatever was causing it Some one must be in a hurry this morning the lad remarked Looks like a motor speeding along MY but we certainly do need rain he added as he looked up toward the sky It s very dusty Well I may as well get back to work I ll take the airship out for a flight this afternoon if the wind dies down a bit The young inventor for Tom Swift himself had built the airship as well as several other crafts for swift locomotion turned to re enter the shop Something about the approaching cloud of dust however held his attention He glanced more intently at it If it s an automobile coming along he murmured it s moving very slowly to make so much fuss And I never saw a motor cycle that would kick up as much sand and not speed along more It ought to be here by now I wonder what it can be The cloud of highway dirt rolled along making some progress toward Tom s house and the group of shops and other buildings surrounding it But as the lad had said the dust did not move at all quickly in comparison to any of the speedy machines that might be causing it And the cloud seemed momentarily to grow thicker and thicker I wonder if it could be a miniature tornado or a cyclone or whirlwind and Tom spoke aloud a habit of his when he was thinking and had no one to talk to Yet it can hardly be that he went on Guess I ll watch and see what it is Nearer and nearer came the dust cloud Tom peered anxiously ahead a puzzled look on his face A few seconds later there came from the midst of the obscuring cloud a voice exclaiming G lang there now Boomerang Keep to feet a movin an we sho will make a record Tain t laik we was a autermobiler er a electricity car but we sho hab been goin sence we started Yo sho done yo se f proud t day Boomerang an I se gwine t keep mah promise an gib yo de bestest oats I kin find Ah reckon Massa Tom Swift will done say we brought dis yeah message t him as quick as anybody could Then there followed the sound of hoofbeats on the dusty road and the rattle of some many jointed vehicle with loose springs and looser wheels Eradicate Sampson exclaimed Tom But who would ever think that the colored man s mule could get up such speed as that cloud of dust indicates His mule s feet must be working overtime but he goes backward about as often as he moves forward That accounts for it There s lots of dust but not much motion Once more from the midst of the ball like cloud of dirt came the voice of the colored man Now behave yo se f Boomerang We m almost dere an den yo kin sit down an rest if yo laik Jest keep it up a little longer an we ll gib Massa Tom his telephone G lang now Boomerang The tattoo of hoofbeats was slowing up now and the cloud of dust was not so heavy It was gradually blowing away Tom Swift walked down to the fence that separated the house grounds and shops from the road As he got there the sounds of the mule s progress and the rattle of the wagon suddenly ceased G lang G lang Don t yo dare t stop now when we am most dere cried Eradicate Sampson Keep a movin Boomerang It s all right Eradicate I m here called Tom and when the last of the dust had blown away the lad waved his hand to an aged colored man who sat upon the seat of perhaps the most dilapidated wagon that was ever dignified by such a name It was held together with bits of wire rope and strings and each of the four wheels leaned out at a different angle It was drawn by a big mule whose bones seemed protruding through his skin but that fact evidently worried him but little for now the animal was placidly sleeping while standing up his long ears moving slowly to and fro Am dat yo Massa Tom asked Eradicate ceasing his task of jerking on the lines to which operation the mule paid not the least attention Yes I m here Rad replied Tom smiling I came out of my shop to see what all the excitement was about How did you ever get your mule to make so much dust I done promise him an extra helpin ob oats ef he make good time said the colored man An he done it too Did yo see de dust we made I sure did but you didn t do much else And you didn t make very good time I watched you and you came along like an ice wagon after a day s work on the Fourth of July You were going fast but moving slow I spects we was Massa Tom was the colored man s answer But Boomerang done better dan I spected he would I done tole him yo d be in a hurry t git yo telephone an he sho did trot along My telephone repeated Tom wonderingly What have you and your mule Boomerang to do with my telephone That s up in the house No it ain t it s right yeah in mah pocket chuckled Eradicate opening a ragged coat and reaching for something I got yo telephone right yeah he went on De agent at de station see me dribin ober dis way an he done ast he t deliber it He said as how he ain t got no messenger boy now cause de one he done hab went on a strike fo five cents mo a day So I done took de telephone and with that the colored man pulled out a crumpled yellow envelope Oh you mean a telegram said Tom with a laugh as he took the message from the odd colored man Well maybe it s telegraf but I done understood de agent t say telephone Anyhow dere it is An I s pects we d better git along Boomerang The mule never moved though Eradicate yanked on the reins and used a splintered whip with energy I said as how we d better git along Boomerang went on the darkey raising his voice Dinnah am mos ready an I m goin t giv yo an extra helpin ob oats The effect of these words seemed magical The mule suddenly came to life and was about to start off I done thought dat would cotch yo Boomerang chuckled Eradicate Wait a minute Rad called Tom who was tearing open the envelope of the telegram I might want to send an answer back by you I wonder who is wiring me now He read the message slowly and Eradicate remarked Taint no kind ob use Massa Tom fo t send a message back wif me

none	none	asked the young inventor looking up from the sheet of yellow paper Case as how I done promised Boomerang his airman an he won t do nothin till he has it Ef I started him back t town now he would jest lay down in de road I ll take de answer back fo you dis arternoon All right perhaps that will do assented Tom I haven t quite got the hang of this yet Drop around this afternoon Rad and as the colored man who with his mule Boomerang did odd jobs around the village started off down the highway in another cloud of dust Tom Swift resumed the reading of the message Hum this is rather queer he mused when having read it once he began at it again It must have cost him something to send all this over the wire He could just as well have written it So he wants my help eh Well I never heard of him and he may be all right but I had other plans and I don t know whether I can spare the time to go to Philadelphia or not I ll have to think it over An electric airship eh He s sort of following along the lines of my inventions Wants my aid hum well I don t know Tom s musings were suddenly cut short by the approach of an elderly gentleman who was walking slowly down the path that led from the house to the country highway which ran in front of it A telegram Tom asked the newcomer Yes dad was the reply I was just coming in to ask your advice about it Eradicate brought it to me What with his mule Boomerang and the gentleman seemed much amused How did he ever get up speed enough to deliver a telegram Oh Eradicate has some special means he uses on his mule when he s in a hurry But listen to this message dad It s from a mister Hosmer Fenwick of Philadelphia He says Tom Swift Can you come on to Philadelphia at once and aid me in perfecting my new electric airship I want to get it ready for a flight before some government experts who have promised to purchase several if it works well I am in trouble and

none	none	get it to rise off the ground I need help I have heard about your airship and the other inventions you and your father have perfected and I am sure you can aid me I am stuck Can you hurry to the Quaker City I will pay you well Answer at once Well remarked mister Swift questioningly as his son finished reading the telegram What are you going to do about it Tom I don t exactly know dad I was going to ask your advice What would you do Who is this mister Fenwick Well he is an inventor of some note but he has had many failures I have not heard of him in some years until now He is a gentleman of wealth and can be relied upon to do just as he says We are slightly acquainted Perhaps it would be well to aid him if you can spare the time Not that you need the money but inventors should be mutually helpful If you feel like going to Philadelphia and aiding him in getting his electric airship in shape you have my permission I don t know answered Tom doubtfully I was just getting my monoplane in shape for a little flight It was nothing particular though Dad I think I WILL take a run to Philadelphia and see if I can help mister Fenwick I ll wire him that I am coming to morrow or next day Very well assented mister Swift and then he and his son went into one of the shops talking of a new invention which they were about to patent Tom little knew what a strange series of adventures were to follow his decision to go to the Quaker City nor the danger involved in aiding mister Fenwick to operate his electric airship CHAPTER II MISS NESTOR S NEWS When do you think you will go to Philadelphia Tom asked mister Swift a little later as the aged inventor and his son were looking over some blueprints which Garret Jackson an engineer employed by them had spread out on a table I don t exactly know was the answer It s quite a little run from Shopton because I can t get a through train But I think I ll start tomorrow Why do you go by train asked mister Jackson Why er because was Tom s rather hesitating reply How else would I go Your monoplane would be a good deal quicker and you wouldn t have to change cars said the engineer That is if you don t want to take out the big airship Why don t you go in the monoplane By Jove I believe I will exclaimed Tom I never thought of that though it s a wonder I didn t I ll not take the RED CLOUD as she s too hard to handle alone But the BUTTERFLY will be just the thing and Tom looked over to where a new monoplane rested on the three bicycle wheels which formed part of its landing frame I haven t had it out since I mended the left wing tip he went on and it will also be a good chance to test my new rudder I believe I WILL go to Philadelphia by the BUTTERFLY Well as long as that s settled suppose you give us your views on this new form of storage battery suggested mister Swift with a fond glance at his son for Tom s opinion was considered valuable in matters electrical as those of you who have read the previous books in this series well know The little group in the machine shop was soon deep in the discussion of ohms amperes volts and currents and for a time Tom almost forgot the message calling him to Philadelphia Taking advantage of the momentary lull in the activities of the young inventor I will tell my readers something about him so that those who have no previous introduction to him may feel that he is a friend Tom Swift lived with his father Barton Swift a widower in the village of Shopton New York There was also in the household missus Baggert the aged housekeeper who looked after Tom almost like a mother Garret Jackson an engineer and general helper also lived with the Swifts Eradicate Sampson might also be called a retainer of the family for though the aged colored man and his mule Boomerang did odd work about the village they were more often employed by Tom and his father than by any one else Eradicate was so called because as he said he eradicated the dirt He did whitewashing made gardens and did anything else that was needed Boomerang was thus named by his owner because as Eradicate said yo nebber know jest what dat mule am goin t do next He may go forward or he may go backward jest laik them Australian boomerangs There was another valued friend of the family Wakefield Damon by name to whom the reader will be introduced in due course And then there was Mary Nestor about whom I prefer to let Tom tell you himself for he might be jealous if I talked too much about her In the first book of this series called Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle there was told how he became possessed of the machine after it had nearly killed mister Damon who was learning to ride it mister Damon who had a habit of blessing everything from his collar button to his shoe laces did not bless the motor cycle after it tried to climb a tree with him and he sold it to Tom very cheaply Tom repaired it invented some new attachments for it and had a number of adventures on it Not the least of these was trailing after a gang of scoundrels who tried to get possession of a valuable patent model belonging to mister Swift Our second book called Tom Swift and His Motor Boat related some exciting times following the acquisition by the young inventor of a speedy craft which the thieves of the patent model had stolen In the boat Tom raced with Andy Foger a town bully and beat him Tom also took out on pleasure trips his chum Ned Newton who worked in a Shopton bank and the two had fine times together Need I also say that Mary Nestor also had trips in the motor boat Besides some other stirring adventures in his speedy craft Tom rescued from a burning balloon that fell into the lake the aeronaut John Sharp Later mister Sharp and Tom built an airship called the RED CLOUD in which they had some strenuous times Their adventures in this craft of the air form the basis for the third book of the series entitled Tom Swift and His Airship In the RED CLOUD Tom and his friends including mister Damon started to make a record flight They left Shopton the night when the bank vault was blown open and seventy five thousand dollars stolen Because of evidence given by Andy Foger and his father suspicion pointed to Tom and his friends as the robbers and they were pursued But they turned the tables by capturing the real burglars and defeating the mean plans of the Fogers Not satisfied with having mastered the air Tom and his father turned their attention to the water mister Swift perfected a new type of craft and in the fourth book of the series called Tom Swift and His Submarine you may read how he went after a sunken treasure The party had many adventures and were in no little danger from their enemies before they reached the wreck with its store of gold The fifth book of the series named Tom Swift and His Electrical Runabout told how Tom built the speediest car on the road and won a prize with it and also saved a bank from ruin Tom had to struggle against odds not only in his inventive work but because of the meanness of jealous enemies including Andy Foger who seemed to bear our hero a grudge of long standing Even though Tom had more than once thrashed Andy well the bully was always seeking a chance to play some mean trick on the young inventor Sometimes he succeeded but more often the tables were effectually turned It was now some time since Tom had won the prize in his electric car and in the meanwhile he had built himself a smaller airship or rather monoplane named the BUTTERFLY In it he made several successful trips about the country and gave exhibitions at numerous aviation meets once winning a valuable prize for an altitude flight In one trip he had met with a slight accident and the monoplane had only just been repaired after this when he received the message summoning him to Philadelphia Well Tom remarked his father that afternoon if you are going to the Quaker City to see mister Fenwick to morrow you d better be getting ready Have you wired him that you will come No I haven t dad was the reply I ll get a message ready at once and when Eradicate comes back I ll have him take it to the telegraph office I wouldn t do that Tom Do what Trust it to Eradicate He means all right but there s no telling when that mule of his may lie down in the road and go to sleep Then your message won t get off and mister Fenwick may be anxiously waiting for it I wouldn t like to offend him for though he and I have not met in some years yet I would be glad if you could do him a favor Why not take the message yourself Guess I will dad I ll run over to Mansburg in my electric car and send the message from there It will go quicker and besides I want to get some piano wire to strengthen the wings of my monoplane All right Tom and when you telegraph to mister Fenwick give him my regards and say that I hope his airship will be a success So it s an electric one eh I wonder how it works But you can tell me when you come back I will dad mister Jackson will you help me charge the batteries of my car I think they need replenishing Then I ll get right along to Mansburg Mansburg was a good sized city some miles from the village of Shopton and Tom and his father had frequent business there The young inventor and the engineer soon had the electric car in readiness for a swift run for the charging of the batteries could be done in much less than the time usual for such an operation owing to a new system perfected by Tom The latter was soon speeding along the road wondering what sort of an airship mister Fenwick would prove to have and whether or not it could be made to fly It s easy enough to build an airship mused Tom but the difficulty is to get them off the ground and keep them there He knew for there had been several failures with his monoplane before it rose like a bird and sailed over the tree tops The lad was just entering the town and had turned around a corner twisting about to pass a milk wagon when he suddenly saw darting out directly in the path of his car a young lady Look out yelled Tom ringing his electric gong at the same time shutting off the current and jamming on the powerful brakes There was a momentary scream of terror from the girl and then as she looked at Tom she exclaimed Why Tom Swift What are you trying to do Run me down Mary Miss Nestor ejaculated our hero in some confusion He had brought his car to a stop and had thrown open the door alighting on the crossing while a little knot of curious people gathered about I didn t see you went on the lad I came from behind the milk wagon and It was my fault Miss Nestor hastened to add I too was waiting for the milk wagon to pass and when it got out of my way I darted around the end of it without looking to see if anything else was coming I should have been more careful but I m so excited that I hardly know what I m doing Excited What s the matter asked Tom for he saw that his friend was not her usual calm self Has anything happened Mary Oh I ve such news to tell you she exclaimed Then get in here and we ll go on advised Tom We are collecting a crowd Come and take a ride that is if you have time Of course I have the girl said with a little blush which Tom thought made her look all the prettier Then we can talk But
8176_115047_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 where are you 
none	none	going To send a message to a gentleman in Philadelphia saying that I will help him out of some difficulties with his new electric airship I m going to take a run down there in my monoplane BUTTERFLY to morrow and My to hear you tell it one would think it wasn t any more to make an airship flight than it was to go shopping interrupted Mary as she entered the electric car followed by Tom who quickly sent the vehicle down the street Oh I m getting used to the upper air he said But what is the news you were to tell me Did you know mamma and papa had gone to the West Indies asked the girl No I should say that WAS news When did they go I didn t know they intended to make a trip Neither did they nor I either It was very sudden They sailed from New York yesterday mister George Hosbrook a business friend of papa s offered to take them on his steam yacht RESOLUTE He is making a little pleasure trip with a party of friends and he thought papa and mamma might like to go He wired to them they got ready in a rush caught the express to New York and went off in such a hurry that I can hardly realize it yet I m left all alone and I m in such trouble Well I should say that was news spoke Tom Oh you haven t heard the worst yet went on Mary I don t call the fact that papa and mamma went off so suddenly much news But the cook just left unexpectedly and I have invited a lot of girl friends to come and stay with me while mamma and papa are away and now what shall I do without a cook I was on my way down to an intelligence office to get another servant when you nearly ran me down Now isn t that news I should say it was two kinds admitted Tom with a smile Well I ll help you all I can I ll take you to the intelligence office and if you can get a cook by hook or by crook I ll bundle her into this car and get her to your house before she can change her mind And so your people have gone to the West Indies Yes and I wish I had the chance to go So do I spoke Tom little realizing how soon his wish might be granted But is there any particular intelligence office you wish to visit There s not much choice replied Mary Nestor with a smile as there s only one in town Oh I do hope I can get a cook It would be dreadful to have nothing to eat after I d asked the girls to spend a month with me wouldn t it Tom agreed that it certainly would and they soon after arrived at the intelligence office CHAPTER III TOM KNOCKS OUT ANDY Do you want me to come in and help you asked the young inventor of Miss Nestor Do you know anything about hiring a cook she inquired with an arch smile I m afraid I don t the lad was obliged to confess Then I m a little doubtful of your ability to help me But I m ever so much obliged to you I ll see if I can engage one The cook who just left went away because I asked her to make some apple turnovers Some of the girls who are coming are very fond of them So am I spoke Tom with a smile Are you indeed Then if the cook I hope to get now will make them I ll invite you over to have some and also meet my friends I d rather come when just you and the turnovers and the cook are there declared Tom boldly and Mary with a blush made ready to leave the electric car Thank you she said in a low voice If I can t help you select a cook went on Tom at least let me call and take you home when you have engaged one Oh it will be too much trouble protested Miss Nestor Not at all I have only to send a message and get some piano wire and then I ll call back here for you I ll take you and the new cook back home flying All right but don t fly so fast The cook may get frightened and leave before she has a chance to make an apple turnover I ll go slower I ll be back in fifteen minutes called Tom as he swung the car out away from the curb while Mary Nestor went into the intelligence office Tom wrote and sent this message to mister Hostner Fenwick of Philadelphia Will come on to morrow in my aeroplane and aid you all I can Will not promise to make your electric airship fly though Father sends regards Just rush that please he said to the telegraph agent and the latter after reading it over remarked It ll rush itself I reckon being all about airships and things like that and he laughed as Tom paid him Selecting several sizes of piano wire of great strength to use as extra guy braces on the Butterfly Tom re entered his electric car and hastened back to the intelligence office where he had left his friend He saw her standing at the front door and before he could alight and go to her Miss Nestor came out to meet him Oh Tom she exclaimed with a little tragic gesture what do you think I don t know he answered good naturedly Does the new cook refuse to come unless you do away with apple turnovers No it isn t that I have engaged a real treasure I m sure but as soon as I mentioned that you would take us home in the electric automobile she flatly refused to come She said walking was the only way she would go She hasn t been in this country long But the worst of it is that a rich woman has just telephoned in for a cook and if I don t get this one away the rich lady may induce her to come to her house and I ll be without one Oh what shall I do and poor Mary looked quite distressed Humph So she s afraid of electric autos eh mused Tom That s queer Leave it to me Mary and perhaps I can fix it You want to get her away from here in a hurry don t you Yes because servants are so scarce that they are engaged almost as soon as they register at the intelligence office I know the one I have hired is suspicious of me since I have mentioned your car and she ll surely go with missus Duy Puyster when she comes I m sorry I spoke of the automobile Well don t worry It s partly my fault and perhaps I can make amends I ll talk to the new cook decided the young inventor Oh Tom I don t believe it will do any good She won t come and all my girl friends will arrive shortly Miss Nestor was quite distressed Leave it to me suggested the lad with an assumed confidence he did not feel He left the car and walked toward the office Entering it with Miss Nestor in his wake he saw a pleasant faced Irish girl sitting on a bench with a bundle beside her And so you don t want to ride in an auto began Tom No an it s no use of the likes of you askin me either answered the girl but not impudently I am afeered of thim things an I won t work in a family that owns one But we don t own one said Mary The girl only sniffed It is the very latest means of traveling Tom went on and there is absolutely no danger I will drive slowly No snapped the new cook Tom was rather at his wits ends At that moment the telephone rang and Tom and Mary listening could hear the proprietress of the intelligence office talking to missus Duy Puyster over the wire We must get her away soon whispered Mary with a nod at the Irish girl or we ll lose her Tom was thinking rapidly but no plan seemed to come to him A moment later one of the assistants of the office led out from a rear room another Irish girl who it seems had just engaged herself to work in the country Good by Bridget said this girl to the one Mary Nestor had hired I m off now The carriage has just come for me I m goin away in style Good luck Sarah wished Bridget Tom looked out of the window A dilapidated farm wagon drawn by two rusty looking horses just drawing up at the curb There is your employer Sarah said the proprietress of the office You will have a nice ride to the country and I hope you will like the place A typical country farmer alighted from the wagon leaving a woman evidently his wife or the seat He called out I ll git th servant gal Mandy an we ll drive right out hum Then you won t have such hard work any more An so that s the style you was tellin me of eh Sarah asked the cook whom Miss Nestor had engaged That s queer style Sarah Sarah was blushing from shame and mortification Tom was quick to seize the advantage thus offered Bridget if YOU appreciate style he said you will come in the automobile I have one of the very latest models and it is very safe But perhaps you prefer a farm wagon Indade an I don t was the ready response I ll go wid you now if only to show Sarah Malloy thot I have more style than her She was boastin of the fine place she had an th illigant carriage that was comin t take her to the counthry If that s it I want none of it I ll go wid you an th young gintleman Style indade and gathering up her bundle she followed Tom and Mary to the waiting auto They entered it and started off just as missus Duy Puyster drove up in her elegantly appointed carriage while Sarah with tears of mortification in her eyes climbed up beside the farmer and his wife You saved the day for me Tom whispered Miss Nestor as the young inventor increased the speed of his car It was only just in time Don t forget the apple turnovers he whispered back Once she had made the plunge the new cook seemed to lose her fears of the auto and enjoyed the ride In a short time she had been safely delivered at Miss Nestor s home while that young lady repeated her thanks to Tom and renewed her invitation for him to come and sample the apple turnovers which Tom promised faithfully to do saying he would call on his return from Philadelphia Musing on the amusing feature of his trip Tom was urging his auto along at moderate speed when as he turned down a country road leading to his home he saw coming toward him a carriage drawn by a slow moving white horse and containing a solitary figure Why that looks like Andy Foger spoke Tom half aloud I wonder what he s doing out driving His auto must be out of commission But that s not strange considering the way he abuses the machine It s in the repair shop half the time He slowed down still more for he did not know but that Andy s horse might be skittish He need have no fears however for the animal did not seem to have much more life than did Eradicate s mule Boomerang As Tom came nearer the carriage he was surprised to see Andy deliberately swing his horse across the road blocking the highway by means of the carriage and steed Well Andy Foger what does that mean cried Tom indignantly as he brought his car to a sudden stop Why do you block the road Because I want to snarled the bully taking out a notebook and pencil and pretending to make some notes about the property in front of which he had halted I m in the real estate business now went on Andy and I m getting descriptions of the property I m going to sell Guess I ve got a right to stop in the road if I want to But not to block it up retorted Tom That s against the law Pull over and let me pass Suppose I don t do it Then I ll make you Huh I d like to see you try it snapped Andy If you make trouble for me it will be the worse for you If you pull to one side so I can pass there ll be no trouble said Tom seeing that Andy wished to pick a quarrel Well I m not going to pull aside until I finish putting down this description and the bully continued to write with tantalizing slowness Look here exclaimed Tom Swift with sudden energy I m not going to stand for this Either you pull to one side and let me pass or Well what will you do demanded the bully I ll shove you to one side and you can take the consequences You won t dare to I won t eh Just you watch Tom threw forward the lever of his car There was a hum of the motor and the electric moved ahead Andy had continued to write in the book but at this sound he glanced up Don t you dare to bunk into me yelled Andy If you do I ll sue you for damages Get out of the way or I ll shove you off the road threatened Tom calmly I ll not go until I get ready Oh yes you will responded our hero quietly He sent his car ahead slowly but surely It was within a few feet of the carriage containing Andy The bully had dropped his notebook and was shaking his fist at Tom As for the young inventor he had his plans made He saw that the horse was a quiet sleepy one that would not run away no matter what happened and Tom only intended to gently push the carriage to one side and pass on The front of his auto came up against the other vehicle Here you stop cried Andy savagely It s too late now answered Tom grimly Andy reached for the horsewhip Tom put on a little more power and the carriage began to slide across the road but the old horse never opened his eyes Take that cried Andy raising his whip with the intention of slashing Tom across the face for the front of the auto was open But the blow never fell for the next instant the carriage gave a lurch as one of the wheels slid against a stone and as Andy was standing up and leaning forward he was pitched head first out into the road By Jove I hope I haven t hurt him gasped Tom as he leaped from his auto which he had brought to a stop The young inventor bent over the bully There was a little cut on Andy s forehead and his face was white He had been most effectually knocked out entirely by his own meanness and fault but none the less Tom was frightened He raised up Andy s head on his arm and brushed back his hair Andy was unconscious CHAPTER IV mister DAMON WILL GO ALONG At first Tom was greatly frightened at the sight of Andy s pale face He feared lest the bully might be seriously hurt But when he realized that the fall from the carriage which was a low one was not hard and that Andy had landed on his outstretched hands before his head came in contact with the earth our hero was somewhat reassured I wish I had some water with which to bathe his head Tom murmured and he looked about in vain for some But it was not needed for a moment later Andy opened his eyes and when he saw Tom bending over and holding him the bully exclaimed Here You let me go Don t you hit me again Tom Swift or I ll punch you I didn t hit you declared Tom while Andy tore himself away and struggled to his feet Yes you did too hit me I did not You tried to strike me with your whip as I was shoving your carriage out of the way which I had a perfect right to do as you were blockading the highway You lost your balance and fell It was your own fault Well you ll suffer for it just the same snarled Andy and then putting his hand to his head and bringing it away with some drops of blood on it he cried out Oh I m hurt I m injured Get a doctor or maybe I ll bleed to death He began blubbering for Andy like all bullies was a coward You re not hurt asserted Tom trying not to laugh It s only a scratch Next time don t try to blockade the whole street and you won t get into trouble Are you able to drive home or shall I take you in my car I wouldn t ride in your car snapped the ugly lad You go on and mind your business now and I ll pay you back for this some day I could have you arrested And so could I have you locked up for obstructing traffic But I ll not Your rig isn t damaged and you d better drive home The old white horse had not moved and was evidently glad of the rest A glance satisfied Tom that the carriage had not been damaged and getting into his car while Andy was brushing the dust from his clothes our hero started the motor There was now room enough to pass around the obstructing carriage and soon Tom was humming down the road leaving a much discomfited bully behind him Tom Swift is too smart thinking he can run everybody and everything to suit himself growled Andy as he finished dusting off his clothes and wiping the blood from his face As Tom had said the wound was but a scratch though the bully s head ached and he felt a little dizzy I wish I d hit him with the horsewhip he went on vindictively I ll get square with him some day Andy had said this many times but he had never yet succeeded in permanently getting the best of Tom Pondering on some scheme of revenge the rich lad for mister Foger his father was quite wealthy drove on Meanwhile Tom rather wishing the little encounter had not taken place but refusing to blame himself for what had occurred was speeding toward home Let s see he murmured as he drove along in his powerful car I ve got quite a lot to do if I make an early start for Philadelphia in my airship to morrow I want to tighten the propeller on the shaft a trifle and give the engine a good try out Then too I think I d better make the landing springs a little stiffer The last time I made a descent the frame was pretty well jarred up Yes if I make that air trip to morrow I ll have to do some tall hustling when I get home The electric runabout swung into the yard of the Swift house and Tom brought it to a stop opposite the side door He looked about for a sight of his father missus Baggert or Garret Jackson The only person visible was Eradicate Sampson working in the garden Hello Rad called Tom Anybody home Yais Massa Tom answered the colored man Yo dad an anodder general mans hab jest gone in de house Who s the other gentleman Rad asked Tom and the negro glad of an excuse to cease the weeding of the onion bed came shuffling forward It s de general mans what is allers saying his prayers he answered Saying his prayers repeated Tom Yep Yo knows what I means Massa Tom He s allers askin a blessin on his shoes or his rubbers or his necktie Oh you mean mister Wakefield Damon Yais sah dat s who I done means mister Wakefull Lemon dat s sho him At that moment there sounded within the house the voices of mister Swift and some one else in conversation And so Tom has decided to make a run to the Quaker City in the BUTTERFLY to morrow mister Swift was saying and he s going to see if he can be of any service to this mister Fenwick Bless my watch chain exclaimed the other voice You don t say so Why I know mister Fenwick very well he and I used to go to school together but bless my multiplication tables I never thought he d amount to anything And so he s built an airship and Tom is going to help him with it Why bless my collar button I ve a good notion to go along and see what happens Bless my very existence but I think I will That s mister Damon all right observed Tom with a smile as he advanced toward the dining room whence the voices proceeded Dat s what I done tole you said Eradicate and with slow and lagging steps he went back to weed the onion bed How are you mister Damon called our hero as he mounted the steps of the porch Why it s Tom he s back exclaimed the eccentric man Why bless my shoe laces Tom how are you I m real glad to see you Bless my eyeglasses but I am I just returned from a little western trip and I thought I d rUn over and see how you are I came in my car had two blowouts on the way too Bless my spark plug but the kind of tires one gets now a days are a disgrace However I m here and your father has just told me about you going to Philadelphia in your monoplane to help a fellow inventor with his airship It s real kind of you Bless my topknot if it isn t Do you know what I was just saying I heard you mention that you knew mister Fenwick replied Tom with a smile as he shook hands with mister Damon So I do and what s more I d like to see his airship Will your BUTTERFLY carry two passengers Easily mister Damon Then I ll tell you what I m going to do If you ll let me I ll take that run to Philadelphia with you Glad to have you come along responded Tom heartily Then I ll go and what s more if Fenwick s ship will rise I ll go with you in that bless my deflection rudder if I don t Tom and puffing up his cheeks as he exploded these words mister Damon fairly raised himself on his tiptoes and shook Tom s hand again CHAPTER V VOL PLANING TO EARTH For a moment after mister Damon s announcement Tom did not reply mister Swift too seemed a little at a loss for something to say They did not quite know how to take their eccentric friend at times Of course I ll be glad of your company mister Damon said Tom but you must remember that my BUTTERFLY is not like the RED CLOUD There is more danger riding in the monoplane than there is in the airship In the latter if the engine happens to stop the sustaining gas will prevent us from falling But it isn t so in an aeroplane When your engine stops there Well what happens asked mister Damon impatiently for Tom hesitated You have to vol plane back to earth Vol plane and there was a questioning note in mister Damon s voice Yes glide down from whatever height you are at when the engine stalls Come down in a series of dips from the upper currents Vol planing the French call it and I guess it s as good a word as any Have you ever done it asked the odd character Oh yes several times Then bless my fur overcoat I can do it too Tom When will you be ready to start To morrow morning Now you are sure you won t get nervous and want to jump if the engine happens to break down Not a bit of it I ll vol plane whenever you are ready and mister Damon laughed Well we ll hope we won t have to went on Tom And I ll be very glad of your company mister Fenwick will no doubt be pleased to see you I ve never met him and it will be nice to have some one to introduce me Suppose you come out and see what sort of a craft you are doomed to travel in to morrow mister Damon I believe you never saw my new monoplane That s right I haven t but I d be glad to I declare I m getting to be quite an aviator and mister Damon chuckled A little later Tom having informed his father of the sending of the message took his eccentric friend out to the shop and exhibited the BUTTERFLY As many of you have seen the ordinary monoplane either on exhibition or in flight I will not take much space to describe Tom s Sufficient to say it was modeled after the one in which Bleriot made his first flight across the English channel The body was not unlike that of a butterfly or dragon fly long and slender consisting of a rectangular frame with canvas stretched over it and a seat for two just aft of the engine and controlling levers Back of the seat stretched out a long framework and at the end was a curved plane set at right angles to it The ends of the plane terminated in flexible wings to permit of their being bent up or down so as to preserve the horizontal equilibrium of the craft At the extreme end was the vertical rudder which sent the monoplane to left or right Forward almost exactly like the front set of wings of the dragon fly was the large main plane with the concave turn toward the ground There was the usual propeller in front operated by a four cylinder motor the cylinders being air cooled and set like the spokes of a wheel around the motor box The big gasolene tank and other mechanism was in front of the right hand operator s seat where Tom always rode He had seldom taken a passenger up with him though the machine would easily carry two and he was a little nervous about the outcome of the trip with mister Damon How do you like the looks of it asked the young inventor as he wheeled the BUTTERFLY out of the shed and began pumping up the tires of the bicycle wheels on which it ran over the ground to get impetus enough with which to rise It looks a little frail compared to the big RED CLOUD Tom answered the eccentric man but I m going up in her just the same bless my buttons if I m not Tom could not but admire the grit of his friend The rest of the day was busily spent making various adjustments to the monoplane putting on new wire stays changing the rudder cables and tuning up the motor The propeller was tightened on the shaft and toward evening Tom announced that all was in readiness for a trial flight Want to come mister Damon he asked I ll wait and see how it acts with you aboard was the answer Not that I m afraid for I m going to make the trip in the morning but perhaps it won t work just right now Oh I guess it will ventured Tom and in order to be able to know just how his BUTTERFLY was going to behave with a passenger of mister Damon s weight the young inventor placed a bag of sand on the extra seat The monoplane was then wheeled to the end of the starting ground Tom took his place in the seat and mister Jackson started the propeller At first the engine failed to respond but suddenly with a burst of smoke and a spluttering of fire the cylinders began exploding The hat of mister Damon who was standing back of the machine was blown off by the wind created by the propeller Bless my gaiters he exclaimed I never thought it was as strong as that Let go cried Tom to mister Jackson and Eradicate who were holding back the monoplane from gliding over the ground All right answered the engineer An instant later the explosions almost doubled for Tom turned on more gasolene Then like some live thing the BUTTERFLY rushed across the starting ground Faster and faster it went until the young inventor knowing that he had motion enough tilted his planes to catch the wind Up he went from earth like some graceful bird higher and higher and then in a big spiral he began ascending until he was five hundred feet in the air Up there he traveled back and forth in circles and in figure eights desiring to test the machine in various capacities Suddenly the engine stopped and to those below anxiously watching the silence became almost oppressive for Tom had somewhat descended and the explosions had been plainly heard by those observing him But now they ceased His engine s stalled cried Garret Jackson mister Swift heard the words and looked anxiously up at his son Is he in any danger gasped mister Damon No one answered him Like some great bird disabled in mid flight the monoplane swooped downward A moment later a hearty shout from Tom reassured them He shut off the engine on purpose said mister Jackson He is vol planing back to earth Nearer and nearer came the BUTTERFLY It would shoot downward and then as Tom tilted the planes would rise a bit losing some of the great momentum In a series of maneuvers like this the young inventor reached the earth not far from where his father and the others stood Down came the BUTTERFLY the springs of the wheel frame taking the shock wonderfully well She s all right regular bird cried Tom in enthusiasm when the machine had come to a stop after rolling over the ground and he had leaped out We ll make a good flight to morrow mister Damon if the weather holds out this way Good cried the eccentric man I shall be delighted They made the start early the next morning there being hardly a breath of wind There was not a trace of nervousness noticeable about mister Damon as he took his place in the seat beside Tom The lad had gone carefully over the entire apparatus and had seen to it that as far as he could tell it was in perfect running order When will you be back Tom asked his father To night perhaps or to morrow morning I don t know just what mister Fenwick wants me to do But if it is anything that requires a long stay I ll come back and let you know and then run down to Philadelphia again I may need some of my special tools to work with I ll be back to night perhaps Shall I keep supper for you asked missus Baggert the housekeeper I don t know answered Tom with a laugh Perhaps I ll drop down at Miss Nestor s and have some apple turnovers for he had told them or the incident of hiring the new cook Well he went on to mister Damon are you all ready As ready as I ever shall be Do you think we ll have to do any vol planing Tom Hard to say but it s not dangerous when there s no wind All right Garret Start her off The engineer whirled the big wooden built up propeller and with a rattle and roar of the motor effectually drowning any but the loudest shouts the BUTTERFLY was ready for her flight Tom let the engine warm up a bit before calling to his friends to let go and then when he had thrown the gasolene lever forward he shouted a good by and cried All right Let go Forward like a hound from the leash sprang the little monoplane It ran perhaps for five hundred feet and then with a tilting of the wings to set the air currents against them it sprang into the air We re off cried mister Damon waving his hand to those on the ground below Yes we re off murmured Tom Now for the Quaker City He had mapped out a route for himself the night before and now picking out the land marks he laid as straight a course as possible for Philadelphia The sensation of flying along two thousand feet high in a machine almost as frail as a canoe was not new to Tom It was in a degree to mister Damon for though the latter had made frequent trips in the large airship this mode of locomotion as if he was on the back of some bird was much different Still after the first surprise he got used to it Bless my finger ring he exclaimed I like it I thought you would said Tom in a shout and he adjusted the oil feed to send more lubricant into the cylinders The earth stretched out below them like some vari colored relief map but they could not stop to admire any particular spot long for they were flying fast and were beyond a scene almost as quickly as they had a glimpse of it How long will it take us yelled mister Damon into Tom s ear I hope to do it in three hours shouted back the young inventor What Why it takes the train over five hours Yes I know but we re going direct and it s only about two hundred and fifty miles That s only about eighty an hour We re doing seventy five now and I haven t let her out yet She goes faster than the RED CLOUD cried mister Damon Tom nodded It was hard work to talk in that rush of air For an hour they shot along their speed gradually increasing Tom called out the names of the larger places they passed over He was now doing better than eighty an hour as the gage showed The trip was a glorious one and the eyes of the young inventor and his friend sparkled in delight as they rushed forward Two hours passed Going to make it fairly howled mister Damon Tom nodded again Be there in time for dinner he announced in a shout It lacked forty minutes of the three hours when Tom pointing with one hand down below while with the other he gripped the lever of the rudder called North Philadelphia So soon gasped mister Damon Well we certainly made speed Where are you going to land I don t know answered the young inventor I ll have to pick out the best place I see It s no fun landing in a city No room to run along after you re down What s the matter with Franklin Field cried mister Damon Out where they play football Good The very thing shouted Tom mister Fenwick lives near there went on mister Damon and Tom nodded comprehendingly They were now over North Philadelphia and in a few minutes more were above the Quaker City itself They were flying rather low and as the people in the streets became aware of their presence there was intense excitement Tom steered for the big athletic field and soon saw it in the distance With a suddenness that was startling the motor ceased its terrific racket The monoplane gave a sickening dip and Tom had to adjust the wing tips and rudder quickly to prevent it slewing around at a dangerous angle What s the matter cried mister Damon Did you shut it off on purpose No shouted Tom Something s gone wrong Gone wrong Bless my overshoes Is there any danger We ll have to vol plane to earth answered Tom and there was a grim look on his face He had never executed this feat with a passenger aboard He was wondering how the BUTTERFLY would behave But he would know very soon for already the tiny monoplane was shooting rapidly toward the big field which was now swarming with a curious crowd CHAPTER VI THE NEW AIRSHIP For a brief instant after the stopping of the motor and the consequent sudden dropping toward the earth of the monoplane Tom glanced at mister Damon The latter s face was rather pale but he seemed calm and collected His lips moved slightly and Tom even in those tense moments wondered if the odd gentleman was blessing anything in particular or everything in general Tom threw up the tilting plane to catch more air beneath it and bring the BUTTERFLY in a more parallel position to the earth This in a manner checked the downward flight and they glided along horizontally for a hundred feet or more Is is there any great danger Tom asked mister Damon I think not answered the young inventor confidently I have done this same thing before and from greater heights The only thing that bothers me is that there are several cross currents of air up here which make it difficult to manage the planes and wing tips But I think we ll make a good landing Bless my overcoat exclaimed mister Damon I certainly hope so Conversation was more easily carried on now as the motor was not spitting fire and throbbing like a battery of Gatling guns Tom thought perhaps it might start on the spark as the propeller was slowly swinging from the force of air against it He tried but there was no explosion He had scarcely hoped for it as he realized that some part of the mechanism must have broken Down they glided coming nearer and nearer to the earth The crowd in the big athletic field grew larger Shouts of wonder and fear could be heard and people could be seen running excitedly about To Tom and mister Damon they looked like dolls Reaching the limit of the parallel glide the monoplane once more shot down on an incline toward the earth with terrible speed The ground seemed to rush up to meet mister Damon Look out he cried to Tom We re going to hit something Not yet was the calm answer I m going to try a new stunt Hold fast What are you going to do Some spirals I think that will let us down easier but the craft is likely to tilt a bit so hold on The young inventor shifted the movable planes and rudder and a moment later the BUTTERFLY swung violently around like a polo pony taking a sudden turn after the ball mister Damon slid to one side of his seat and made a frantic grab for one of the upright supports I made too short a turn cried Tom easing off the craft which righted itself in an instant The air currents fooled me Under his skillful guidance the monoplane was soon slowly approaching the earth in a series of graceful curves It was under perfect control and a smile of relief came on the face of the young inventor Seeing it mister Damon took courage and his hands which had grasped the uprights with such firmness that his knuckles showed white with the strain were now removed He sat easily in his seat We re all right now declared Tom I ll take a couple of forward glides now and we ll land He sent the machine straight ahead It gathered speed in an instant Then with an upward tilt it was slackened almost as if brakes had been applied Once more it shot toward the earth and once more it was checked by an up tilted plane Then with a thud which shook up the occupants of the two seats the BUTTERFLY came to the ground and ran along on the three bicycle wheels Swiftly it slid over the level ground A more ideal landing place would have been hard to find Scores of willing hands reached out and checked the momentum of the little monoplane and Tom and mister Damon climbed from their seats The crowd set up a cheer and hundreds pressed around the aviators Several sought to reach and touch the machine for they had probably never been so close to one before though airship flights are getting more and more common Where did you come from Are you trying for a record How high did you get Did you fall or come down on purpose Can t you start your motor in mid air These and scores of other questions were fairly volleyed at Tom and mister Damon The young inventor good naturedly answered them as best he could We were coming down anyhow he explained but we did not calculate on vol planing The motor was stalled and I had to glide Please keep away from the machine You might damage it The arrival of several policemen who were attracted by the crowd served to keep the curious ones back away from the BUTTERFLY or the men boys and women for there were a number of the latter in the throng might have caused serious trouble Tom made a hasty examination of the motor and having satisfied himself that only a minor difficulty had caused it to stop he decided to put the monoplane in some safe place and proceed to mister Fenwick s house The lad was just asking one of the officers if the air craft could not be put in one of the grandstands which surrounded the field when a voice on the outskirts of the crowd excitedly exclaimed Let me pass please I want to see that airship I m building one myself and I need all the experience I can get Let me in please A man pushed his way into the crowd and wormed his way to where Tom and mister Damon stood At the sight of him the eccentric individual cried out Why bless my pocket knife If it isn t mister Fenwick mister Fenwick gasped Tom Yes The inventor we came to see At the same moment the newcomer cried out Wakefield Damon That s who I am answered Tom s friend and let me introduce you to mister Swift the inventor of more machines than I can count He and I were coming to see you when we had a slight accident and we landed here But that didn t matter for we intended to land here anyhow as I knew it was near your house Only we had to vol plane back to earth and I can t say that I d care for that as a steady diet Bless my radiator but I m glad we ve arrived safely Did you come all the way from your home in that asked mister Fenwick of Tom as he shook hands with him and nodded at the monoplane Oh yes It s not much of a trip Well I hope my airship will do as well But something seems to be wrong with it and I have hopes that you can help me discover what it is I know your father and I have heard much of your ability That is why I requested your aid I m afraid I ve been much overrated spoke Tom modestly but I ll do all I can for you I must now leave my monoplane in a safe place however I ll attend to that mister Fenwick hastened to assure him Leave it to me By this time a lieutenant of police in charge of several reserve officers had arrived on the scene for the crowd was now very large and as mister Fenwick knew this official he requested that Tom s machine be protected from damage It was arranged that it could be stored in a large empty shed and a policeman would be left on guard Then seeing that it was all right Tom mister Damon and mister Fenwick started for the latter s house I am very anxious to show you the WHIZZER said mister Fenwick as they walked along The WHIZZER repeated Tom wonderingly Yes that s what I call my electric airship It hasn t whizzed any to speak of yet but I have hopes that it will now that you are here to help me We will take one of these taxicabs and soon be at my house I was out for a stroll when I saw your monoplane coming down and I hastened to Franklin Field to see it The three entered an automobile and were soon being driven to the inventor s home A little later he led them out to a big shed which occupied nearly all of a large lot in back of mister Fenwick s house Does it take up all that room asked Tom Oh yes the WHIZZER is pretty good size There she is cried mister Fenwick proudly as he threw open the doors of the shed and Tom and mister Damon looking in saw a large triplane with a good sized gas bag hovering over it and a strange collection of rudders wings and planes sticking out from either side Amidships was an enclosed car or cabin and a glimpse into it served to disclose to the young inventor a mass of machinery There she is That s the WHIZZER cried mister Fenwick with pride in his voice What do you think of her Tom Swift Tom did not immediately answer He looked dubiously at the electric airship and shrugged his shoulders It seemed to him at first glance that it would never sail CHAPTER VII MAKING SOME CHANGES Well what do you think of it asked mister Fenwick again as Tom walked all about the electric airship still without speaking It s big certainly remarked the lad Bless my shoe horn I should say it was burst out mister Damon It s larger than your RED CLOUD Tom But will it go That s what I want to know insisted the inventor Do you think it will fly Tom I haven t dared to try it yet though a small model which I made floated in the air for some time But it wouldn t move except as the wind blew it It would be hard to say without a careful examination whether this large one will fly or not answered Tom Then give it a careful examination suggested mister Fenwick I ll pay you well for your time and trouble Oh if I can help a fellow inventor and assist in making a new model of airship fly I m only too glad to do it without pay retorted Tom quickly I didn t come here for that Suppose we go in the cabin and look at the motor That s the most important point if your airship is to navigate There was certainly plenty of machinery in the cabin of the WHIZZER Most of it was electrical for on that power mister Fenwick intended to depend to sail through space There was a new type of gasolene engine small but very powerful and this served to operate a dynamo In turn the dynamo operated an electrical motor as mister Fenwick had an idea that better and more uniform power could be obtained in this way than from a gasolene motor direct One advantage which Tom noticed at once was that the WHIZZER had a large electric storage battery This was intended to operate the electric motor in case of a break to the main machinery and it seemed a good idea There were various other apparatuses machines and appliances the nature of which Tom could not readily gather from a mere casual view Well what s your opinion now that you have seen the motor asked mister Fenwick anxiously I d have to see it in operation said Tom And you shall right after dinner declared the inventor I d like to start it now and hear what you have to say but I m not so selfish as that I know you must be hungry after your trip from Shopton as they say aeroplaning gives one an appetite I don t know whether it s that or not answered Tom with a laugh but I am certainly hungry Then we ll postpone the trial until after dinner It must be ready by this time I think said mister Fenwick as he led the way back to the house It was magnificently furnished for the inventor was a man of wealth and only took up aeroplaning as a fad An excellent dinner was served and then the three returned once more to the shed where the WHIZZER was kept Shall I start the motor in here asked mister Fenwick when he had summoned several of the machinists whom he employed to aid himself and the young inventor It would be better if we could take it outside suggested Tom yet a crowd is sure to gather and I don t like to work in a mob of people Oh we can easily get around that said mister Fenwick I have two openings to my aeroplane shed We can take the WHIZZER out of the rear door into a field enclosed by a high fence That is where I made all my trials and the crowd couldn t get in though some boys did find knot holes and use them But I don t mind that The only thing that bothers me is that I can t make the WHIZZER go up and if it won t go up it certainly won t sail That s my difficulty and I hope you can remedy it Tom Swift I ll do the best I can But let s get the airship outside This was soon accomplished and in the open lot Tom made a thorough and careful examination of the mechanism The motor was started and the propellers for there were two whirled around at rapid speed Tom made some tests and calculations at which he was an expert and applied the brake test to see how much horse power the motor would deliver I think there is one trouble that we will have to get over he finally said to mister Fenwick What is that The motor is not quite powerful enough because of the way in which you have it geared up I think by changing some of the cogs and getting rid of the off set shaft also by increasing the number of revolutions and perhaps by using a new style of carburetor we can get more speed and power Then we ll do it cried mister Fenwick with enthusiasm I knew I hadn t got everything just right Do you think it will work after that Well remarked Tom hesitatingly I think the arrangement of the planes will also have to be changed It will take quite some work but perhaps after a bit we can get the WHIZZER up in the air Can you begin work at once asked the inventor eagerly

8176_115046_000052_000004	train-clean-360	Tom shook his head 
none	none	I can t stay long enough on this trip he said I promised father I would be back by to morrow at the latest but I will come over here again and arrange to stay until I have done all I can I need to get some of my special tools and then too you will require some other supplies of which I will give you a list I hope you don t mind me speaking in this way mister Fenwick as though I knew more about it than you do added Tom modestly Not a bit of it cried the inventor heartily I want the benefit of your advice and experience and I ll do just as you say I hope you can come back soon I ll return the first of the week promised Tom and then we ll see what can be done Now I ll go over the whole ship once more and see what I need I also want to test the lifting capacity of your gas bag The rest of the day was a busy one for our hero With the aid of mister Damon and the owner of the WHIZZER he went over every point carefully Then as it was too late to attempt the return flight to Shopton he telegraphed his father and he and mister Damon remained over night with mister Fenwick In the morning having written out a list of the things that would be needed Tom went out to Franklin Field and repaired his own monoplane It was found that one of the electric wires connected with the motor had broken thus cutting off the spark It was soon repaired and in the presence of a large crowd Tom and mister Damon started on their return flight Do you think you can make the WHIZZER work Tom asked mister Damon as they were flying high over Philadelphia I m a little dubious about it was the reply But after I make some changes I may have a different opinion The whole affair is too big and clumsy that s the trouble though the electrical part of it is very good Shopton was reached without incident in about three hours and there was no necessity this time of vol planing back to earth After a short rest Tom began getting together a number of special tools and appliances which he proposed taking back to Philadelphia with him The young inventor made another trip to mister Fenwick s house the first of the following week He went by train this time as he had to ship his tools and mister Damon did not accompany him Then with the assistance of the inventor of the WHIZZER and several of his mechanics Tom began making the changes on the airship Do you think you can make it fly asked mister Fenwick anxiously after several days of labor I hope so replied our hero and there was more confidence in his tone than there had been before As the work progressed he began to be more hopeful I ll make a trial flight anyhow in a few days he added Then I must send word to mister Damon decided mister Fenwick He wants to be on hand to see it and if possible go up so he told me All right assented Tom I only hope it does go up he concluded in a low tone CHAPTER VIII ANDY FOGER S REVENGE During the following week Tom was kept busy over the airship He made many important changes and one of these was to use a new kind of gas in the balloon bag He wanted a gas with a greater lifting power than that of the ordinary illuminating vapor which mister Fenwick had used Well remarked Tom as he came from the airship shed one afternoon I think we can give it a try out mister Fenwick in a few days more I shall have to go back to Shopton to get some articles I need and when I come back I will bring mister Damon with me and we will see what the WHIZZER can do Do you mean we will make a trial flight Yes For how long a distance It all depends on how she behaves answered Tom with a smile If possible we ll make a long flight Then I ll tell you what I m going to do went on the inventor I m going to put aboard a stock of provisions and some other supplies and stores in case we are two or three days in the air It might not be a bad plan agreed Tom though I hardly think we will be gone as long as that Well being out in the air always makes me hungry proceeded mister Fenwick so I m going to take plenty of food along The time was to come and that very soon when this decision of the inventor of the WHIZZER stood the adventurers in good stead Tom returned to Shopton the next day and sent word to have mister Damon join him in time to go back to the Quaker City two days later But why don t you start right back to Philadelphia to morrow asked mister Swift of his son Because answered Tom and that was all the reason he would give though had any one seen him reading a certain note a few minutes before that which note was awaiting him on his arrival from the Quaker City they would not have wondered at his decision The note was brief It merely said Won t you come and have some apple turnovers The new cook is a treasure and the girls are anxious to meet you It was signed Mary Nestor I think I could enjoy some apple turnovers remarked Tom with a smile Having gotten ready the few special appliances he wished to take back to Philadelphia with him Tom went that evening to call on Miss Nestor True to her promise the girl had a big plate full of apple turnovers which she gaily offered our hero on his arrival and on his laughing declination to partake of so many she ushered him into a room full of pretty girls saying They ll help you eat them Tom Girls here is mister Swift who doesn t mind going up in the air or under the ocean or even catching runaway horses by which last she referred to the time Tom saved her life and first made her acquaintance As for the young inventor he gave a gasp almost as if he had plunged into a bath of icy water at the sight of so many pretty faces staring at him He said afterward that he would rather have vol planed back to earth from a seven mile height than again face such a battery of sparkling eyes But our hero soon recovered himself and entered into the merriment of the evening and before he knew it he was telling Miss Nestor and her attractive guests something of his exploits But I m talking altogether too much about myself he said finally How is the new cook Miss Nestor and have you heard from your father and mother since they sailed on the RESOLUTE for the West Indies As to the new cook she is a jewel of the first water answered Miss Nestor We all like her and she is anxious for another ride in a taxicab as she calls your auto She shall have it declared Tom for those are the best apple turnovers I ever ate I ll tell her so declared Mary She ll appreciate it coming from an inventor of your ability Have you heard from your parents asked Tom anxious to change the subject Oh yes I had a wire to day They stopped at saint Augustine to let me know they were having a glorious time aboard the yacht mister Hosbrook the owner is an ideal host mamma said They are proceeding directly to the West Indies now I do hope they will arrive safely They say there are bad storms down there at this time of year Perhaps if they are shipwrecked mister Swift will go to their rescue in one of his airships or a submarine suggested Mabel Jackson one of the several pretty girls Oh I hope he doesn t have to exclaimed Mary Don t speak of shipwrecks It makes me shudder and she seemed unduly alarmed Of course they won t have any trouble asserted Tom confidently more to reassure Miss Nestor than from any knowledge he possessed but if they do get cast away on a desert island I ll certainly go to their rescue he added It was late when Tom started for home that night for the society of Miss Nestor and her friends made the time pass quickly He promised to call again and try some more samples of the new cook s culinary art as soon as he had gotten mister Fenwick s airship in shape for flying As later that night the young inventor came in sight of his home and the various buildings and shops surrounding it his first glance was toward the shed which contained his monoplane BUTTERFLY That little craft was Tom s pet It had not cost him anything like as much as had his other inventions either in time or money but he cared more for it than for his big airship RED CLOUD This was principally because the BUTTERFLY was so light and airy and could be gotten ready so quickly for a flight across country It was capable of long endurance too for an extra large supply of gasolene and oil was carried aboard So it was with rather a start of surprise that Tom saw a light in the structure where the BUTTERFLY was housed I wonder if dad or mister Jackson can be out there he mused Yet I don t see why they should be They wouldn t be going for a flight at night Or perhaps mister Damon arrived and is out looking it over A moment s reflection however told Tom that this last surmise could not be true since the eccentric man had telegraphed saying he would not arrive until the next day Somebody s out there however went on Tom and I m going to see who it is I hope it isn t Eradicate monkeying with the monoplane He s very curious and he might get it out of order Tom increased his pace and moved swiftly but softly toward the shed If there was an intruder inside he wanted to surprise him There were large windows to the place and they would give a good view of the interior As Tom approached the light within flickered and moved to and fro Tom reached one of the casements and peered in He caught a glimpse of a moving figure and he heard a peculiar ripping sound Then as he sprang toward the front door the light suddenly went out and the young inventor could hear some one running from the shop They ve seen me and are trying to get away thought the lad I must catch them He fairly leaped toward the portal and just as he reached it a figure sprang out So close was Tom that the unknown collided with him and our hero went over on his back The other person was tossed back by the force of the impact but quickly recovered himself and dashed away Not before however Tom had had a chance to glance at his face and to the chagrin of the young inventor he recognized by the dim light of a crescent moon the countenance of Andy Foger If additional evidence was needed Tom fully recognized the form as that of the town bully Hold on there Andy Foger shouted the young inventor What are you doing in my shed What right have you in there What did you do Back came the answer through the night I told you I d get square with you and I ve done it and then Andy s footsteps died away while a mocking laugh floated back to Tom What was Andy s revenge CHAPTER IX THE WHIZZER FLIES For a moment Tom gazed after the fleeting figure of the cowardly bully He was half minded to give pursuit and then realizing that he could find Andy later if he wanted him the young inventor decided his best plan would be to see what damage had been done For that damage would follow Andy s secret visit to the shop Tom was certain Nor was his surmise wrong Stepping into the building the lad switched on the lights and he could not repress an exclamation of chagrin as he looked toward his trim little monoplane the BUTTERFLY Now it was a BUTTERFLY with broken wings for Andy had slashed the canvas of the planes in a score of places The scoundrel growled Tom I ll make him suffer for this He s all but ruined my aeroplane Tom walked around his pet machine As he came in front and saw the propeller he gave another exclamation The fine wooden blades of several layers gracefully curved which had cost him so much in time and labor to build up and then fashion to the right shape had been hacked and cut with an axe The propeller was useless More of Andy s work murmured Tom This is about the worst yet There came over him a feeling of great despondency which was succeeded by a justifiable rage He wanted to take after the bully and give him a merciless beating Then a calmer mood came over Tom After all what s the use he reasoned Whipping Andy wouldn t mend the BUTTERFLY She s in bad shape but I can repair her when I get time Luckily he didn t meddle with the engine
8176_115047_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 That s all right 
none	none	A hasty examination had shown this I guess I won t do anything now went on Tom I ll have my hands full getting mister Fenwick s airship to run After that I can come back here and fix up my own It s a good thing I don t have to depend on her for making the trip to Philadelphia Poor BUTTERFLY you sure are in a bad way and Tom felt almost as if he was talking to some living creature so wrapped up was he in his trim little monoplane After another disheartening look at his air craft the young inventor started to leave the shop He looked at a door the fastening of which Andy had broken to gain admittance I should have had the burglar alarm working and this would never have happened reasoned Tom All the buildings were arranged so that if any one entered them after a certain hour an alarm would ring in the house But of late the alarm had not been set as Tom and his father were not working on any special inventions that needed guarding It was due to this oversight that Andy was able to get in undetected But it won t happen again declared Tom and he at once began connecting the burglar apparatus He went into the house and told his father and the engineer what had occurred They were both indignant and the engineer declared that he would sleep with one eye open all night ready to respond to the first alarm Oh there s no danger of Andy coming back right away said Tom He s too frightened I wouldn t be surprised if he disappeared for a time He ll be thinking that I m after him This proved true as Andy had left town next morning and to all inquiries his mother said he had gone to visit relatives She was not aware of her son s meanness and Tom did not tell her mister Damon arrived from his home in Waterfield that day and with many blessings wanted to know if Tom was ready for the trial of the electrical airship Yes we ll leave for Philadelphia to morrow was the answer Are we going in the BUTTERFLY Bless my watch chain but I like that little machine It will be some time before you again have a flight in her said Tom sorrowfully as he told of Andy s act of vandalism Why bless my individuality cried mister Damon indignantly I never heard of such a thing Never It did little good to talk of it however and Tom wanted to forget about it He wished he had time to repair the monoplane before he left home but there was much to do to get ready for the trial of the WHIZZER When will you be back Tom asked mister Swift as his son and mister Damon departed for the Quaker City the following morning Hard to say dad If I can make a long flight in the WHIZZER I ll do so I may even drop down here and pay you a visit But if I find there are many more changes to make in her construction which is more than likely I can t say when I ll return I ll keep you posted however by writing Can t you arrange to send me some wireless messages asked the older inventor with a smile I could if I had thought to rig up the apparatus on mister Fenwick s airship was the reply I ll hardly have time to do it now though Send wireless messages from an aeroplane gasped mister Damon Bless my gizzard I never heard of such a thing Oh it can be done Tom assured him And this was a fact Tom had installed a wireless apparatus on his RED CLOUD recently and it is well known that several of the modern biplanes can send wireless messages The crossing and bracing wires of the frame are used for sending wires and in place of ground conductors there are trailers which hang below the aeroplane The current is derived directly from the engine and the remaining things needed are a small step up transformer a key and a few other small parts Tom had gone a step farther than this and had also arranged to receive wireless messages though few modern aeroplanes are thus equipped as yet But of course there was no time now to install a wireless apparatus on mister Fenwick s craft Tom thought he would be lucky if he got the WHIZZER to make even a short flight Well let me hear from you when you can requested mister Swift and Tom promised It was some time after that and many strange things happened before Tom Swift again communicated with his father at any length The young inventor had bidden farewell to Miss Nestor the night previous She stated that she had a message that day from her parents aboard the RESOLUTE which spoke a passing steamer mister and missus Nestor and the other guests of mister Hosbrook were well and anticipated a fine time on reaching the West Indies Tom now said good by to his father the housekeeper and mister Jackson not forgetting of course Eradicate Sampson Don t let Andy Foger come sneaking around here Rad cautioned the young inventor Deed an I won t exclaimed the colored man Ef he do I ll hab Boomerang kick him t pieces an den I ll whitewash him so his own folks won t know him Oh don t you worry Massa Tom Dat Andy won t do no funny business when I m around Tom laughed and started for the station with mister Damon They arrived in Philadelphia that afternoon the trip being very slow as compared with the one made by the monoplane They found mister Fenwick anxiously awaiting them and Tom at once started work on the airship He kept at it until late that night and resumed early the next morning Many more changes and adjustments were made and that afternoon the young inventor said I think we ll give it a try out mister Fenwick Do you mean make a flight Yes if she ll take it but only a short one I want to get her up in the air and see how she behaves Well if you find out after you re up that she does well you may want to take a long flight suggested mister Fenwick If you do why I have everything aboard necessary for a long voyage The WHIZZER is well stocked with provisions An hour later the big electric machine was wheeled out into the yard for in spite of her size four men could easily move the craft about so well was she balanced Aside from a few personal friends of the inventor himself his machinists Tom and mister Damon no one was present at the try out Tom mister Damon and mister Fenwick climbed into the car which was suspended below the gas bag and between the wing like planes on either side The young inventor had decided to make the WHIZZER rise by scudding her across the ground on the bicycle wheels with which she was equipped and then by using the tilting planes to endeavor to lift her off the earth He wanted to see if she would go up that way without the use of the gas bag All was in readiness The motor was started and the machinery began to hum and throb The propellers gained speed with every revolution The airship had been made fast by a rope to which was attached a strong spring balance as it was desired to see how much pull the engine would give Eight hundred pounds announced one of the machinists A thousand would be better but we ll try it Murmured Tom Cast off The rope was loosened and increasing the speed of the engine Tom signalled to the men to give a little momentum to the craft She began running over the smooth ground There was a cheer from the few spectators Certainly the WHIZZER made good time on the earth Tom was anxiously watching the gages and other instruments He wanted a little more speed but could not seem to get it He ran the motor to the utmost and then seeing the necessity of making an attempt to get up into the air before the end of the speeding ground was reached he pulled the elevating plane lever The front of the WHIZZER rose and then settled down Tom quickly shut off the power and jammed on the brake an arrangement of spikes that dug into the earth for the high board fence loomed up before him What s the matter cried mister Fenwick anxiously Couldn t get up speed enough answered the young inventor We must have more momentum to make her rise Can it be gotten I think so I ll gear the motor higher It took an hour to do this Once more the scale test was applied It registered a pull of fifteen hundred pounds now We ll go up said Tom grimly Once more the motors spit out fire and the propellers whirled so that they looked like mere circles of light Once more the WHIZZER shot over the ground but this time as she neared the fence she rose up like a bird cleared it like a trick horse and soared off into the air The WHIZZER was flying CHAPTER X OVER THE OCEAN Hurrah cried mister Fenwick in delight My machine is really flying at last Yes answered Tom as he adjusted various levers and gears she is going It s not as high as I d like but it is doing very well considering the weight of the craft and the fact that we have not used the gas bag 
7608-115034-0000	train-other-500	I m going to let that fill now and we ll go up Don t you want to steer mister Fenwick No you manage it Tom until it s in good running shape I don t want to hoodoo it I worked as hard as I could and never got more than two feet off the ground
7608-115034-0001	train-other-500	Now I m really sailing It s great He was very enthusiastic and Tom himself was not a little pleased at his own success for certainly the airship had looked to be a very dubious proposition at first Bless my gaiters
none	none	 But we are doing pretty well 
7608-115034-0002	train-other-500	remarked mister Damon looking down on the field where mister Fenwick s friends and the machinists were gathered cheering and waving their hands We ll do better declared Tom
none	none	 He had already set the gas machine in operation and was now looking over the electric apparatus to see that it was working well 
7608-115034-0003	train-other-500	It needed some adjustments which he made
none	none	 All this while the WHIZZER was moving about in a big circle for the rudder had been automatically set to so swing the craft 
7608-115034-0004	train-other-500	It was about two hundred feet high but soon after the gas began to enter the bag it rose until it was nearly five thousand feet high This satisfied Tom that the airship could do better than he expected and he decided to return nearer earth
7608-115034-0005	train-other-500	In going down he put the craft through a number of evolutions designed to test her ability to answer the rudders promptly The lad saw opportunity for making a number of changes and suggested them to mister Fenwick Are you going any farther
7608-115034-0006	train-other-500	asked the owner of the WHIZZER as he saw that his craft was slowly settling No I think we ve done enough for the first day said Tom But I d like you to handle her now mister Fenwick You can make the landing while I watch the motor and other machines Yes
7608-115034-0007	train-other-500	I guess I can make a landing all right assented the inventor I m better at coming down than going up He did make a good descent and received the congratulation of his friends as he stepped from the airship Tom was also given much praise for his success in making the craft go at all
none	none	 for mister Fenwick and his acquaintances had about given up hope that she ever would rise Well what do you think of her 
7608-115034-0008	train-other-500	mister Fenwick wanted to know of the young inventor who replied that as soon as some further changes had been made they would attempt a long flight This promise was kept two days later They were busy days for Tom mister Fenwick and the latter s assistants
7608-115034-0009	train-other-500	Tom sent a short note to his father telling of the proposed long flight and intimated that he might make a call in Shopton if all went well He also sent a wire to Miss Nestor hinting that she might have some apple turnovers ready for him
7608-115034-0010	train-other-500	But Tom never called for that particular pastry though it was gotten ready for him when the girl received his message
7608-115034-0011	train-other-500	All was in readiness for the long flight and a preliminary test had demonstrated that the WHIZZER had been wonderfully improved by the changes Tom made The young inventor looked over the supply of food mister Fenwick had placed aboard
7608-115034-0012	train-other-500	glanced at the other stores and asked How long do you expect to be gone mister Fenwick
none	none	 Why don t you think we can stay out a week 
7608-115034-0013	train-other-500	That s quite a while responded Tom We may be glad to return in two days or less But I think we re all ready to start Are any of your friends going
none	none	 I ve tried to pursuade some of them to accompany me but they are a bit timid said the inventor 
7608-115034-0014	train-other-500	I guess we three will make up the party this time though if our trip is a successful one I ll be overwhelmed with requests for rides I suppose As before a little crowd gathered to see the start The day was warm
7608-115034-0015	train-other-500	but there was a slight haziness which Tom did not like He hoped though that it would pass over before they had gone far Do you wish to head for any particular spot mister Fenwick asked Tom as they were entering the cabin
none	none	 Yes I would like to go down and circle Cape May New Jersey 
7608-115034-0016	train-other-500	if we could I have a friend who has a summer cottage there and he was always laughing at my airship I d just like to drop down in front of his place now and pay him a call We ll try it assented Tom with a smile
7608-115034-0017	train-other-500	An auspicious start was made the WHIZZER taking the air after a short flight across the ground and then with the lifting gas aiding in pulling the craft upward the airship started to sail high over the city of Philadelphia
7608-115034-0018	train-other-500	So swiftly did it rise that the cheers of the little crowd of mister Fenwick s friends were scarcely heard Up and up it went and then a little later to the astonishment of the crowds in the streets Tom put the airship twice in a circle around the statue of William Penn
none	none	 on the top of the City Hall 
7608-115034-0019	train-other-500	Now you steer the lad invited mister Fenwick Take her straight across the Delaware River and over Camden New Jersey and then head south for Cape May
none	none	 We ought to make it in an hour for we are getting up good speed 
7608-115034-0020	train-other-500	Leaving the owner in charge of his craft to that gentleman s no small delight Tom and mister Damon began an inspection of the electrical and other machinery
none	none	 There was much that needed attention but Tom soon had the automatic apparatus in working order and then less attention need be given to it 
7608-115034-0021	train-other-500	Several times the young investor looked out of the windows with which the cabin was fitted mister Damon noticed this Bless my shoe laces Tom he said What s the matter
7608-115034-0022	train-other-500	I don t like the looks of the weather was the answer I think we re in for a storm Then let s put back No it would be too bad to disappoint mister Fenwick now that we have made such a good start
7608-115034-0023	train-other-500	He wants to make a long flight and I can t blame him spoke Tom in a low voice But if there s danger Oh well we can soon be at Cape May and start back The wind is freshening rather suddenly though
7608-115034-0024	train-other-500	and Tom looked at the anemometer which showed a speed of twenty miles an hour However it was in their favor aiding them to make faster time
7608-115034-0025	train-other-500	The speed of the WHIZZER was now about forty miles an hour not fast for an air craft but sufficiently speedy in trying out a new machine Tom looked at the barograph and noted that they had attained an altitude of seven thousand five hundred feet
7608-115034-0026	train-other-500	That s better than millionaire Daxtel s distance of seven thousand one hundred and five feet remarked the lad with a smile and it breaks Jackson s climb of seven thousand three hundred and three feet which is pretty good for your machine mister Fenwick
7608-115034-0027	train-other-500	Do you really think so asked the pleased inventor
none	none	 Yes And we ll do better than that in time but it s best to go slow at first until we see how she is standing the strain 
7608-115034-0028	train-other-500	This is high and fast enough for the present
none	none	 They kept on and as Tom saw that the machinery was working well he let it out a little 
7608-115034-0029	train-other-500	The WHIZZER at once leaped forward and a little later they came within sight of Cape May the Jersey coast resort Now to drop down and visit my friend said mister Fenwick with a smile Won t he be surprised
7608-115034-0030	train-other-500	I don t think we d better do it said Tom Why not Well the wind is getting stronger every minute and it will be against us on the way back If we descend and try to make another ascension we may fail
7608-115034-0031	train-other-500	We re up in the air now and it may be easy to turn around and go back Then again it may not but it certainly will be easier to shift around up here than down on the ground So I d rather not descend that is not entirely to the ground
7608-115034-0032	train-other-500	Well just as you say though I wanted my friend to know I could build a successful airship
none	none	 Oh we can get around that I ll take her down as low as is safe and fly over his house if you ll point it out and you can drop him a message in one of the pasteboard tubes we carry for that purpose That s a good idea assented mister Fenwick I ll do it 
7608-115034-0033	train-other-500	Tom sent the WHIZZER down until the hotels and cottages could be made out quite plainly After looking with a pair of opera glasses mister Fenwick picked out the residence of his friend and Tom prepared to circle about the roof
7608-115034-0034	train-other-500	By this time the presence of the airship had become known to hundreds and crowds were eagerly watching it There he is There s my friend who didn t believe I would ever succeed
none	none	 exclaimed mister Fenwick pointing to a man who stood in the street 
7608-115034-0035	train-other-500	in front of a large white house I ll drop him a message
none	none	 One was in readiness in a weighted pasteboard cylinder and soon it was falling downward 
7608-115034-0036	train-other-500	The airship was moving slowly as it was beating against the wind Leaning out of the cabin window mister Fenwick shouted to his friend Hey Will I thought you said my airship would never go I ll come and give you a ride some day
7608-115034-0037	train-other-500	Whether the gentleman understood what mister Fenwick shouted at him is doubtful but he saw the inventor waving his hand and he saw the falling cylinder and a look of astonishment spread over his face as he ran to pick up the message
7608-115034-0038	train-other-500	We re going up now and will try to head for home said Tom a moment later as he shifted the rudder Bless my storage battery cried mister Damon But we have had a fine trip
7608-115034-0039	train-other-500	A much better one than we ll have going back observed Tom in a low voice Why what s the matter asked the eccentric man The wind has increased to a gale and will be dead against us answered Tom
none	none	 mister Fenwick was busy writing another message to drop and he paid little attention to the young inventor Tom sent the craft well up into the air and then tried to turn it about and head back for Philadelphia 
7608-115034-0040	train-other-500	No sooner had he done so than the airship was met by the full force of the wind which was now almost a hurricane It had steadily increased but as long as they were moving with it
none	none	 they did not notice it so much 
7608-115034-0041	train-other-500	Once they attempted to stem its fury they found themselves almost helpless Tom quickly realized this and giving up his intention of beating up against the wind he turned the craft around and let it fly before the gale
7608-115034-0042	train-other-500	the propellers aiding to get up a speed of seventy miles an hour mister Fenwick who had dropped the last of his messages came from his small private cabin to where mister Damon and Tom were in a low voiced conversation near the engines
7608-115034-0043	train-other-500	The owner of the WHIZZER happened to look down through a plate glass window in the floor of car What he saw caused him to give a gasp of astonishment Why why he exclaimed We we re over the ocean
7608-115034-0044	train-other-500	Yes answered Tom quietly as he gazed down on the tumbling billows below them They had quickly passed over Cape May across the sandy beach and were now well out over the Atlantic Why why are we out here
7608-115034-0045	train-other-500	asked mister Fenwick Isn t it dangerous in an airship that hasn t been thoroughly tried yet Dangerous Yes somewhat replied Tom slowly But we can t help ourselves mister Fenwick We can t turn around and go back in this gale
7608-115034-0046	train-other-500	and we can t descend Then what s to be done Nothing except to keep on until the gale blows itself out And how long will that be I don t know a week maybe
none	none	 Bless my coffee pot I m glad we ve got plenty on board to eat exclaimed mister Damon CHAPTER XI A NIGHT OF TERROR After the first shock of Tom s announcement the two men who were traveling with him in the airship showed no signs of fear Yet it was alarming to know that one was speeding over the mighty ocean before a terrific gale with nothing more substantial under one that a comparatively frail airship Still mister Damon knew Tom of old and had confidence in his ability and while mister Fenwick was not so well acquainted with our hero he had heard much about him and put faith in his skill to carry them out of their present difficulty Are you sure you can t turn around and go back asked mister Fenwick His knowledge of air currents was rather limited It is out of the question replied Tom simply We would surely rip this craft to pieces if we attempted to buffet this storm Is it so bad then asked mister Damon forgetting to bless anything in the tense excitement of the moment It might be worse was the reply of the young inventor The wind is blowing about eighty miles an hour at times and to try to turn now would mean that we would tear the planes loose from the ship True we could still keep up by means of the gas bag but even that might be injured Going as we are in the same direction as that in which the wind is blowing we do not feel the full effect of it But perhaps if we went lower down or higher up we could get in a different current of air suggested mister Fenwick who had made some study of aeronautics I ll try assented Tom simply He shifted the elevating rudder and the WHIZZER began to go up slowly for there was great lateral pressure on her large surface But Tom knew his business and urged the craft steadily The powerful electric engines which were the invention of mister Fenwick stood them in good stead and the barograph soon showed that they were steadily mounting Is the wind pressure any less inquired mister Damon anxiously On the contrary it seems to be increasing replied Tom with a glance at the anemometer It s nearly ninety miles an hour now Then aided by the propellers we must be making over a hundred miles an hour said the inventor We are a hundred and thirty assented Tom We ll be blown across the ocean at this rate exclaimed mister Damon Bless my soul I didn t count on that Perhaps we had better go down suggested mister Fenwick I don t believe we can get above the gale I m afraid not came from Tom It may be a bit better down below Accordingly the rudder was changed and the WHIZZER pointed her nose downward None of the lifting gas was let out as it was desired to save that for emergencies Down down down went the great airship until the adventurers within by gazing through the plate glass window in the floor of the cabin could see the heaving white capped billows tossing and tumbling below them Look out or we ll be into them shouted mister Damon I guess we may as well go back to the level where we were declared Tom The wind both above and below that particular strata is stronger and we will be safer up above Our only chance is to scud before it until it has blown itself out And I hope it will be soon Why asked mister Damon in a low voice Because we may be blown so far that we can not get back while our power holds out and then Tom did not finish but mister Damon knew what he meant death in the tossing ocean far from land when the WHIZZER unable to float in the air any longer should drop into the storm enraged Atlantic They were again on a level where the gale blew less furiously than either above or below but this was not much relief It seemed as if the airship would go to pieces so much was it swayed and tossed about But mister Fenwick if he had done nothing else had made a staunch craft which stood the travelers in good stead All the rest of that day they swept on at about the same speed There was nothing for them to do save watch the machinery occasionally replenishing the oil tanks or making minor adjustments Well finally remarked mister Damon when the afternoon was waning away if there s nothing else to do suppose we eat Bless my appetite but I m hungry and I believe you said mister Fenwick that you had plenty of food aboard So we have but the excitement of being blown out to sea on our first real trip made me forget all about it I ll get dinner at once if you can put up with an amateur s cooking And I ll help offered mister Damon Tom can attend to the airship and we ll serve the meals It will take our minds off our troubles There was a well equipped kitchen aboard the WHIZZER and soon savory odors were coming from it In spite of the terror of their situation and it was not to be denied that they were in peril they all made a good meal though it was difficult to drink coffee and other liquids owing to the sudden lurches which the airship gave from time to time as the gale tossed her to and fro Night came and as the blackness settled down the gale seemed to increase in fury It howled through the slender wire rigging of the WHIZZER and sent the craft careening from side to side and sometimes thrust her down into a cavern of the air only to lift her high again almost like a ship on the heaving ocean below them As darkness settled in blacker and blacker Tom had a glimpse below him of tossing lights on the water We just passed over some vessel he announced I hope they are in no worse plight than we are Then there suddenly came to him a thought of the parents of Mary Nestor who were somewhere on the ocean in the yacht RESOLUTE bound for the West Indies I wonder if they re out in this storm too mused Tom If they are unless the vessel is a staunch one they may be in danger The thought of the parents of the girl he cared so much for being in peril was not reassuring to Tom and he began to busy himself about the machinery of the airship to take his mind from the presentiment that something might happen to the RESOLUTE We ll have our own troubles before morning the lad mused if this wind doesn t die down There was no indication that this was going to be the case for the gale increased rather than diminished Tom looked at their speed gage They were making a good ninety miles an hour for it had been decided that it was best to keep the engine and propellers going as they steadied the ship Ninety miles an hour murmured Tom And we ve been going at that rate for ten hours now That s nearly a thousand miles We are quite a distance out to sea He looked at a compass and noted that instead of being headed directly across the Atlantic they were bearing in a southerly direction At this rate we won t come far from getting to the West Indies ourselves reasoned the young inventor But I think the gale will die away before morning The storm did not however More fiercely it blew through the hours of darkness It was a night of terror for they dared not go to sleep not knowing at what moment the ship might turn turtle or even rend apart and plunge with them into the depths of the sea So they sat up occasionally attending to the machinery and noting the various gages mister Damon made hot coffee which they drank from time to time and it served to refresh them There came a sudden burst of fury from the storm and the airship rocked as if she was going over Bless my heart cried mister Damon springing up That was a close call Tom said nothing mister Fenwick looked pale and alarmed The hours passed They were swept ever onward at about the same speed sometimes being whirled downward and again tossed upward at the will of the wind The airship was well nigh helpless and Tom as he realized their position could not repress a fear in his heart as he thought of the parents of the girl he loved being tossed about on the swirling ocean in a frail pleasure yacht CHAPTER XII A DOWNWARD GLIDE They sat in the cabin of the airship staring helplessly at each other Occasionally Tom rose to attend to one of the machines or mister Fenwick did the same Occasionally mister Damon uttered a remark Then there was silence broken only by the howl of the gale It seemed impossible for the WHIZZER to travel any faster yet when Tom glanced at the speed gage he noted with a feeling of surprise akin to horror that they were making close to one hundred and fifty miles an hour Only an aeroplane could have done it and then only when urged on by a terrific wind which added to the speed produced by the propellers The whole craft swayed and trembled partly from the vibration of the electrical machinery and partly from the awful wind mister Fenwick came close to Tom and exclaimed Do you think it would be any use to try once more to go above or below the path of the storm Tom s first impulse was to say that it would be useless but he recollected that the craft belonged to Fenwick and surely that gentleman had a right to make a suggestion The young inventor nodded We ll try to go up he said If that doesn t work I ll see if I can force her down It will be hard work though The wind is too stiff Tom shifted the levers and rudders His eyes were on the barograph that delicate instrument the trembling hand of which registered their height Tom had tilted the deflection rudder to send them up but as he watched the needle he saw it stationary They were not ascending though the great airship was straining to mount to an upper current where there might be calm It was useless however and Tom seeing the futility of it shifted the rudder to send them downward This was more easily accomplished but it was a change for the worse since the nearer to the ocean they went the fiercer blew the wind Back Go back up higher cried mister Damon We can t yelled Tom We ve got to stay here now Oh but this is awful exclaimed mister Fenwick We can never stand this The airship swaged more than ever and the occupants were tossed about in the cabin from side to side Indeed it did seem that human beings never could come alive out of that fearful ordeal As Tom looked from one of the windows of the cabin he noted a pale grayish sort of light outside At first he could not understand what it was then as he observed the sickly gleams of the incandescent electric lamps he knew that the hour of dawn was at hand See he exclaimed to his companions pointing to the window Morning is coming Morning gasped mister Damon Is the night over Now perhaps we shall get rid of the storm I m afraid not answered Tom as he noted the anemometer and felt the shudderings of the WHIZZER as she careened on through the gale It hasn t blown out yet The pale light increased The electrics seemed to dim and fade Tom looked to the engines Some of the apparatus was in need of oil and he supplied it When he came back to the main cabin where stood mister Damon and mister Fenwick it was much lighter outside Less than a day since we left Philadelphia murmured the owner of the WHIZZER as he glanced at a distance indicator yet we have come nearly sixteen hundred miles We certainly did travel top speed I wonder where we are Still over the ocean replied mister Damon as he looked down at the heaving billows rolling amid crests of foam far below them Though what part of it would be hard to say We ll have to reckon out our position when it gets calmer Tom came from the engine room His face wore a troubled look and he said addressing the older inventor mister Fenwick I wish you d come and look at the gas generating apparatus It doesn t seem to be working properly Anything wrong asked mister Damon suspiciously I hope not replied Tom with all the confidence he could muster It may need adjusting I am not so familiar with it as I am with the one on the RED CLOUD The gas seems to be escaping from the bag and we may have to descend for some distance But the aeroplanes will keep us up said mister Daman Yes they will and Tom hesitated That is unless something happens to them They are rather frail to stand alone the brunt of the gale and I wish Tom did not complete the sentence Instead he paused suddenly and seemed to be intently listening From without there came a rending tearing crashing sound The airship quivered from end to end and seemed to make a sudden dive downward Then it appeared to recover and once more glided forward Tom followed by mister Fenwick made a rush for the compartment where the machine was installed They had no sooner reached it than there sounded an explosion and the airship recoiled as if it had hit a stone wall Bless my shaving brush What s that cried mister Damon Has anything happened I m rather afraid there has answered Tom solemnly It sounded as though the gas bag went up And I m worried over the strength of the planes We must make an investigation We re falling almost screamed mister Fenwick as he glanced at the barograph the delicate needle of which was swinging to and fro registering different altitudes Bless my feather bed So we are shouted mister Damon Let s jump and avoid being caught under the airship He darted for a large window opening from the main cabin and was endeavoring to raise it when Tom caught his hand What are you trying to do asked the lad hoarsely Save my life I want to get out of this as soon as I can I m going to jump Don t think of it You d be instantly killed We re too high for a jump even into the ocean The ocean Oh is that still below us Is there any chance of being saved What can be done mister Damon hesitated We must first find out how badly we are damaged said Tom quietly We must keep our heads and be calm no matter what happens I need your help mister Damon This served to recall the rather excited man to his senses He came back to the centre of the cabin which was no easy task for the floor of it was tilted at first one angle and then another He stood at Tom s side What can I do to help you he asked mister Fenwick was darting here and there examining the different machines None of them seemed to be damaged If you will look and see what has happened to our main wing planes I will see how much gas we have left in the bag suggested Tom Then we can decide what is best to be done We are still quite high and it will take some time to complete our fall as even if everything is gone the material of the bag will act as a sort of parachute mister Damon darted to a window in the rear of the cabin where he could obtain a glimpse of the main wing planes He gave a cry of terror and astonishment Two of the planes are gone he reported They are torn and are hanging loose I feared as much retorted Tom quietly The gale was too much for them What of the lifting gas asked mister Fenwick quickly It has nearly all flowed out of the retaining bag Then we must make more at once I will start the generating machine He darted toward it It will be useless spoke Tom quietly Why Because there is no bag left to hold it The silk and rubber envelope has been torn to pieces by the gale The wind is even stronger than it was last night Then what s to be done demanded mister Damon with a return of his alarmed and nervous manner Bless my fingernails What s to be done For an instant 
8176_115046_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Tom did not answer 
none	none	It was constantly getting lighter though there was no sun for it was obscured by scudding clouds The young inventor looked critically at the various gages and indicators Is is there any chance for us asked mister Fenwick quietly I think so answered Tom with a hopeful smile We have about two thousand feet to descend for we have fallen nearly that distance since the accident Two thousand feet to fall gasped mister Damon We can never do it and live I think so spoke Tom Bless my gizzard How fairly exploded mister Damon By vol planing down But even if we do we will fall into the ocean cried mister Fenwick We will be drowned No and Tom spoke more quietly than before We are over a large island he went on and I propose to let the disabled airship vol plane down to it That is our only chance Over an island cried mister Damon He looked down through the floor observation window Tom had spoken truly At that moment they were over a large island which had suddenly loomed up in the wild and desolate waste of the ocean They had reached its vicinity just in time Tom stepped to the steering and rudder levers and took charge He was going to attempt a most difficult feat that of guiding a disabled airship back to earth in the midst of a hurricane and landing her on an unknown island Could he do it There was but one answer He must try It was the only chance of saving their lives and a slim one at best Down shot the damaged WHIZZER like some giant bird with broken wings but Tom Swift was in charge and it seemed as if the craft knew it as she began that earthward glide CHAPTER XIII ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND Mingled feelings possessed the three adventurers within the airship mister Damon and mister Fenwick had crowded to the window as Tom spoke to get a glimpse of the unknown island toward which they were shooting They could see it more plainly now from the forward casement as well as from the one in the bottom of the craft A long narrow rugged piece of land it was in the midst of the heaving ocean for the storm still raged and lashed the waves to foam Can you make it asked mister Damon in a low voice I think so answered Tom more cheerfully Shall I shut down the motor inquired the older inventor Yes you might as well We don t need the propellers now and I may be better able to make the glide without them The buzzing and purring electrical apparatus was shut down Silence reigned in the airship but the wind still howled outside As Tom had hoped the ship became a little more steady with the stopping of the big curved blades though had the craft been undamaged they would have served to keep her on an even keel With skillful hand he so tilted the elevating planes that after a swift downward glide the head of the WHIZZER would be thrown up so to speak and she would sail along in a plane parallel to the island This had the effect of checking her momentum just as the aviator checks the downward rush of his monoplane or biplane when he is making a landing Tom repeated this maneuver several times until a glance at his barograph showed that they had but a scant sixty feet to go There was time but for one more upward throwing of the WHIZZER s nose and Tom held to that position as long as possible They could now make out the topography of the island plainly for it was much lighter Tom saw a stretch of sandy beach and steered for that Downward shot the airship inert and lifeless It was not like gliding his little BUTTERFLY to earth after a flight but Tom hoped he could make it They were now within ten feet of the earth skimming forward Tom tried another upward tilt but the forward planes would not respond They could get no grip on the air With a crash that could have been heard some distance the WHIZZER settled to the sand It ran along a slight distance and then as the bicycle wheels collapsed under the pressure the airship seemed to go together in a shapeless mass At the first impact with the earth Tom had leaped away from the steering wheel and levers for he did not want to be crushed against them mister Damon and mister Fenwick in pursuance of a plan adopted when they found that they were falling had piled a lot of seat cushions around them They had also provided some as buffers for Tom and our hero at the instant of the crash had thrown himself behind and upon them It seemed as if the whole ship went to pieces The top of the main cabin crashed down as the side supports gave way but fortunately there were strong main braces and the roof did not fall completely upon our friends The whole bottom of the craft was forced upward and had it not been for the protecting cushions there might have been serious injuries for all concerned As it was they were badly bruised and shaken up After the first crash and succeeding it an instant later there came a second smash followed by a slight explosion and a shower of sparks could be seen in the engine room That s the electrical apparatus smashing through the floor called Tom Come let s get out of here before the gasolene sets anything on fire Are you all right mister Damon and you mister Fenwick Yes I guess so answered the inventor Oh what a terrible crash My airship is ruined You may be glad we are alive said mister Damon Bless my top knot I feel He did not finish the sentence At that moment a piece of wood broken from the ceiling where it had hung by a strip of canvas came crashing down and hit mister Damon on the head The eccentric man toppled over on his pile of cushions from which he was arising when he was struck Oh is he killed gasped mister Fenwick I hope not cried Tom We must get him out of here at all events There may be a fire They both sprang to mister Damon s aid and succeeded in lifting him out There was no difficulty in emerging from the airship as there were big broken gaps on all sides of what was left of the cabin Once in the outer air mister Damon revived and opened his eyes Much hurt asked Tom feeling of his friend s head No no I I guess not was the slow answer I was stunned for a moment I m all right now Nothing broken I guess and his hand went to his head No nothing broken added Tom cheerfully but you ve got a lump there as big as an ostrich egg Can you walk Oh I m all right Bless my stars what a wreck mister Damon looked at the remains of the airship It certainly was a wreck The bent and twisted planes were wrapped about the afterpart the gas bag was but a shred the frame was splintered and twisted and the under part where the starting wheels were placed resembled a lot of broken bicycles The cabin looked like a shack that had sustained an explosion of dynamite It s a wonder we came out alive said mister Fenwick in a low voice Indeed it is agreed Tom as he came back with a tin can full of sea water with which to bathe mister Damon s head The lad had picked up the can from where it had rolled from the wreck and they had landed right on the beach It doesn t seem to blow so hard observed mister Damon as he was tenderly sopping his head with a handkerchief wet in the salt water No the wind is dying out but it happened too late to do us any good remarked Tom sorrowfully Though if it hadn t blown us this far we might have come to grief over the ocean and be floundering in that instead of on dry land That s so agreed mister Fenwick who was carefully feeling of some bruises on his legs I wonder where we are anyhow I haven t the least idea responded Tom It s an island but which one or where it is I don t know We were blown nearly two thousand miles I judge He walked over and surveyed the wreck Now that the excitement was over he was beginning to be aware of numerous bruises and contusions His legs felt rather queer and on rolling up his trousers he found there was a deep cut in the right shin just below his knee It was bleeding but he bandaged it with a spare handkerchief and walked on Peering about he saw that nearly the whole of the machinery in the engine room including most of the electrical apparatus had fallen bodily through the floor and now rested on the sand That looks to be in pretty good shape mused Tom but it s a question whether it will ever be any good to us We can t rebuild the airship here that s certain He walked about the wreck and then returned to his friends mister Damon was more like himself and mister Fenwick had discovered that he had only minor bruises Bless my coffee cup exclaimed mister Damon I declare I feel hungry I wonder if there s anything left to eat in the wreck Plenty spoke Tom cheerfully I ll get it out I can eat a sandwich or too myself and perhaps I can set up the gasolene stove and cook something As the young inventor was returning to the wreck he was halted halfway by a curious trembling feeling At first he thought it was a weakness of his legs caused by his cut but a moment later he realized with a curious sickening sensation that it was the ground the island itself that was shaking and trembling The lad turned back mister Damon and mister Fenwick were staring after him with fear showing on their faces What was that cried the inventor Bless my gizzard Did you feel that Tom cried mister Damon The whole place is shaking Indeed there was a stronger tremor now and it was accompanied by a low rumbling sound like distant thunder The adventurers were swaying to and fro Suddenly they were tossed to the ground by a swaying motion and not far off a great crack opened in the earth The roaring rumbling sound increased in volume An earthquake It s an earthquake cried Tom We re in the midst of an earthquake CHAPTER XIV A NIGHT IN CAMP The rumbling and roaring continued for perhaps two minutes during which time the castaways found it impossible to stand for the island was shaking under their feet with a sickening motion Off to one side there was a great fissure in the earth and frightened as he was Tom looked to see if it was extending in their direction If it was or if a crack opened near them they might be precipitated into some bottomless abyss or into the depths of the sea But the fissure did not increase in length or breadth and presently the rumbling roaring sound subsided The island grew quiet and the airship travelers rose to their feet Bless my very existence What happened cried mister Damon It was an earthquake wasn t it Tom asked mister Fenwick It sure was agreed the young inventor Rather a hard one too I hope we don t have any more Do you think there is any likelihood of it demanded mister Damon Bless my pocketbook If I thought so I d leave at once Where would you go inquired Tom looking out across the tumbling ocean which had hardly had a chance to subside from the gale ere it was again set in a turmoil by the earth tremor That s so there isn t a place to escape to went on the eccentric man with something like a groan We are in a bad place do you think there ll be more quakes Tom It s hard to say I don t know where we are and this island may be something like Japan subject to quakes or it may be that this one is merely a spasmodic tremor Perhaps the great storm which brought us here was part of the disturbance of nature which ended up with the earthquake We may have no more And there may be one at any time added mister Fenwick Yes assented Tom Then let s get ready for it proposed mister Damon Let s take all the precautions possible There aren t any to take declared Tom All we can do is to wait until the shocks come if any more do come which I hope won t happen and then we must do the best we can Oh dear me Bless my fingernails cried mister Damon wringing his hands This is worse than falling in an airship There you do have SOME chance Here you haven t any Oh it may not be so bad Tom cried to reassure him This may have been the first shock in a hundred years and there may never be another But as he looked around on the island he noted evidences that it was of volcanic origin and his heart misgave him for he knew that such islands created suddenly by a submarine upheaval might just as suddenly be destroyed by an earthquake or by sinking into the ocean It was not a pleasant thought it was like living over a mine that might explode at any moment But there was no help for it Tom tried to assume a cheerfulness he did not feel He realized that in spite of his youth both mister Damon and mister Fenwick rather depended on him for Tom was a lad of no ordinary attainments and had a fund of scientific knowledge He resolved to do his best to avoid making his two companions worry Let s get it off our minds suggested the lad after a while We were going to get something to eat Suppose we carry out that program My appetite wasn t spoiled by the shock I declare mine wasn t either said mister Damon but I can t forget it easily It s the first earthquake I was ever in He watched Tom as the latter advanced once more toward the wreck of the airship and noticed that the lad limped for his right leg had been cut when the WHIZZER had fallen to earth What s the matter Tom were you hurt in the quake asked the eccentric man No no Tom hastened to assure him I just got a bump in the fall that s all It isn t anything If you and mister Fenwick want to get out some food from the wrecked store room I ll see if I can haul out the gasolene stove from the airship Perhaps we can use it to make some coffee By delving in about the wreck Tom was able to get out the gasolene stove It was broken but two of the five burners were in commission and could be used Water and gasolene for use in the airship was carried in steel tanks Some of these had been split open by the crash but there was one cask of water left and three of gasolene insuring plenty of the liquid fuel As for the water Tom hoped to be able to find a spring on the island In the meanwhile mister Damon and mister Fenwick had been investigating the contents of the storeroom There was a large supply of food much larger than would have been needed even on a two weeks trip in the air and the inventor of the WHIZZER hardly knew why he had put so much aboard But if we have to stay here long it may come in handy observed Tom with a grim smile Why do you think we WILL be here long asked mister Damon The young inventor shrugged his shoulders There is no telling he said If a passing steamer happens to see us we may be taken off to day or to morrow If not we may be here a week or Tom did not finish He stood in a listening attitude There was a rumbling sound and the earth seemed again to tremble Then there came a great splash in the water at the foot of a tall rugged cliff about a quarter of a mile away A great piece of the precipice had fallen into the ocean I thought that was another earthquake coming said mister Damon with an air of relief So did I admitted mister Fenwick It was probably loosened by the shock and so fell into the sea spoke Tom Their momentary fright over the castaways proceeded to get their breakfast Tom soon had water boiling on the gasolene stove for he had rescued a tea kettle and a coffee pot from the wreck of the kitchen of the airship Shortly afterward the aroma of coffee filled the air and a little later there was mingled with it the appetizing odor of sizzling bacon and eggs for mister Fenwick who was very fond of the latter had brought along a supply carefully packed in sawdust carriers so that the shock had broken only a few of them Well I call this a fine breakfast exclaimed mister Damon munching his bacon and eggs and dipping into his coffee the hard pilot biscuit which they had instead of bread We re mighty lucky to be eating at all I suppose Indeed we are chimed in mister Fenwick I m awfully sorry the airship is wrecked though spoke Tom I suppose it s my fault I should have turned back before we got over the ocean and while the storm was not at its height I saw that the wind was freshening but I never supposed it would grow to a gale so suddenly The poor old WHIZZER there s not much left of her Now don t distress yourself in the least insisted mister Fenwick I m proud to have built a ship that could navigate at all I see where I made lots of mistakes and as soon as I get back to Philadelphia I m going to build a better one if you ll help me Tom Swift I certainly will promised the young inventor And I ll take a voyage with you cried mister Damon Bless my teaspoon Tom but will you kindly pass the bacon and eggs again There was a jolly laugh at the eccentric man in which he himself joined and the little party felt better They were seated on bits of broken boxes taken from the wreck forming a little circle about the gasolene stove which Tom had set up on the beach The wind had almost entirely died away though the sea was still heaving in great billows and masses of surf They had no exact idea of the time for all their watches had stopped when the shock of the wreck came but presently the sun peeped out from the clouds and from knowing the time when they had begun to fall they judged it was about ten o clock and accordingly set their timepieces Well observed Tom as he collected the dishes which they had also secured from the wreck we must begin to think about a place to spend the night I think we can rig up a shelter from some of the canvas of the wing planes and from what is left of the cabin It doesn t need to be very heavy for from the warmth of the atmosphere I should say we were pretty well south It was quite warm now that the storm was over and as they looked at the vegetation of the island they saw that it was almost wholly tropical I shouldn t be surprised if we were on one of the smaller of the West Indian islands said Tom We certainly came far enough flying a hundred miles or more an hour to have reached them But this one doesn t appear to be inhabited We haven t been all over it yet said mister Damon We may find cannibals on the other side Cannibals don t live in this part of the world Tom assured him No I think this island is practically unknown The storm brought us here and it might have landed us in a worse place As he spoke he thought of the yacht RESOLUTE and he wondered how her passengers including the parents of Mary Nestor had fared during the terrible blow I hope they weren t wrecked as we were mused Tom But there was little time for idle thoughts If they were going to build a shelter they knew that they must speedily get at it Accordingly with a feeling of thankfulness that their lives had been spared they set to work taking apart such of the wreck as could the more easily be got at Boards sticks and planks were scattered about and with the pieces of canvas from the wing planes and some spare material which was carried on board they soon had a fairly good shack which would be protection enough in that warm climate Next they got out the food and supplies their spare clothing and other belongings few of which had been harmed in the fall from the clouds These things were piled under another rude shelter which they constructed By this time it was three o clock and they ate again Then they prepared to spend the night in their hastily made camp They collected driftwood with which to make a fire and after supper which was prepared on the gasolene stove they sat about the cheerful blaze discussing their adventures To morrow we will explore the island said Tom as he rolled himself up in his blankets and turned over to sleep The others followed his example for it was decided that no watch need be kept Thus passed several hours in comparative quiet It must have been about midnight that Tom was suddenly awakened by a feeling as if someone was shaking him He sat up quickly and called out What s the matter Eh What s that Bless my soul What s going on shouted mister Damon Did you shake me inquired Tom I No What Then they realized that another earth tremor was making the whole island tremble Tom leaped from his blankets followed by mister Damon and mister Fenwick and rushed outside the shack They felt the earth shaking but it was over in a few seconds The shock was a slight one nothing like as severe as the one in the morning But it set their nerves on edge Another earthquake groaned mister Damon How often are we to have them I don t know answered Tom soberly They passed the remainder of the night sleeping in blankets on the warm sands near the fire for they feared lest a shock might bring the shack down about their heads However the night passed with no more terrors CHAPTER XV THE OTHER CASTAWAYS Well we re all alive at any rate announced Tom when the bright sun shining into his eyes had awakened him He sat up tossed aside his blankets and stood up The day was a fine one and the violence of the sea had greatly subsided during the night their shack had suffered not at all from the slight shock in the darkness Now for a dip in old Briney the lad added as he walked down to the surf I think it will make me feel better I m with you added mister Fenwick and mister Damon also joined the bathers They came up from the waves tingling with health and their bruises and bumps including Tom s cut leg felt much better You did get quite a gash didn t you observed mister Fenwick as he noticed Tom s leg Better put something on it I have antiseptic dressings and bandages in the airship if we can find them I ll look for them after breakfast Tom promised and following a fairly substantial meal considering the exigencies under which it was prepared he got out the medicine chest of which part remained in the wreck of the WHIZZER and dressed his wound He felt much better after that Well what s our program for to day mister Damon wanted to know as they sat about after they had washed up what few dishes they used Let s make a better house to stay in proposed mister Fenwick We may have to remain here for some time and I d like a more substantial residence I think the one we now have will do suggested Tom I was going to propose making it even less substantial Why so Because in the event of an earthquake while we are sleeping in it we will not be injured Made of light pieces of wood and canvas it can t harm us very much if it falls on us That s right agreed mister Damon In earthquake countries all the houses are low and built of light materials Ha So I recollect now spoke mister Fenwick I used to read that in my geography but I never thought it would apply to me But do you think we will be subject to the quakes I m afraid so was Tom s reply We ve had two now within a short time and there is no way of telling when the next will come We will hope there won t be any more but He did not finish his sentence but the others knew what he meant Thereupon they fell to work and soon had made a shelter that while very light and frail would afford them all the protection needed in that mild climate and at the same time there would be no danger should an earthquake collapse it and bring it down about their heads while they were sleeping in it For they decided that they needed some shelter from the night dews as it was exceedingly uncomfortable to rest on the sands even wrapped in blankets and with a driftwood fire burning nearby It was noon when they had their shack rebuilt to their liking and they stopped for dinner There was quite a variety of stores in the airship enough for a much larger party than that of our three friends and they varied their meals as much as possible Of course all the stuff they had was canned though there are some salted and smoked meats But canned food can be had in a variety of forms now a days so the castaways did not lack much What do you say to an exploring expedition this afternoon asked Tom as they sat about after dinner We ought to find out what kind of an island we re on I agree with you came from mister Fenwick Perhaps on the other side we will stand a much better chance of speaking some passing vessel I have been watching the horizon for some time now but I haven t seen the sign of a ship All right then we ll explore and see what sort of an island we have taken possession of went on Tom And see if it isn t already in possession of natives or cannibals suggested mister Damon Bless my frying pan but I should hate to be captured by cannibals at my time of life Don t worry there are none here Tom assured him again They set out on their journey around the island They agreed that it would be best to follow the beach around as it was easier walking that way since the interior of the place consisted of rugged rocks in a sort of miniature mountain chain We will make a circuit of the place proposed Tom and then if we can discover nothing we ll go inland The centre of the island is quite high and we ought to be able to see in any direction for a great distance from the topmost peak We may be able to signal a vessel I hope so cried mister Damon I want to send word home that I am all right My wife will worry when she learns that the airship in which I set out has disappeared I fancy we all would like to send word home added mister Fenwick My wife never wanted me to build this airship and now that I have sailed in it and have been wrecked I know she ll say I told you so as soon as I get back to Philadelphia Tom said nothing but he thought to himself that it might be some time before missus Fenwick would have a chance to utter those significant words to her husband Following the beach line they walked for several miles The island was larger than they had supposed and it soon became evident that it would take at least a day to get all around it In which case we will need some lunch with us said Tom I think the best thing we can do now is to return to camp and get ready for a longer expedition to morrow mister Fenwick was of the same mind but mister Damon called out Let s go just beyond that cliff and see what sort of a view is to be had from there Then we ll turn back To oblige him they followed They had not gone more than a hundred yards toward the cliff than there came the preliminary rumbling and roaring that they had come to associate with an earthquake At the same time the ground began to shiver and shake Here comes another one cried Tom reeling about He saw mister Damon and mister Fenwick topple to the beach The roaring increased and the rumbling was like thunder close at hand The island seemed to rock to its very centre Suddenly the whole cliff toward which they had been walking appeared to shake itself loose In another instant it was flung outward and into the sea a great mass of rock and stone The island ceased trembling and the roaring stopped Tom rose to his feet followed by his companions He looked toward the place where the cliff had been Its removal by the earthquake gave them a view of a part of the beach that had hitherto been hidden from them And what Tom saw caused him to cry out in astonishment For he beheld gathered around a little fire on the sand a party of men and women Some were standing clinging to one another in terror Some were prostrate on the ground Others were running to and fro in bewilderment More castaways cried Tom More castaways and he added under his breath more unfortunates on earthquake island CHAPTER XVI AN ALARMING THEORY For a few seconds following Tom s announcement to his two companions neither mister Damon nor mister Fenwick spoke They had arisen from the beach where the shock of the earthquake had thrown them and were now staring toward the other band of castaways who in turn were gazing toward our three friends There was a violent agitation in the sea caused by the fall of the great cliff and immense waves rushed up on shore but all the islanders were beyond the reach of the rollers Is it do I really am I dreaming or not at length gasped mister Damon Is this a mirage or do we really see people Tom inquired mister Fenwick They are real enough people replied the lad himself somewhat dazed by the unexpected appearance of the other castaways But how why how did they get here went on the inventor of the WHIZZER As long as they re not cannibals we re all right murmured mister Damon They seem to be persons like ourselves Tom They are agreed the lad and they appear to be in the same sort of trouble as ourselves Let s go forward and meet them The tremor of the earthquake had now subsided and the little band that was gathered about a big fire of driftwood was calmer Those who had fallen or who had thrown themselves on the sand arose and began feeling of their arms and legs to see if they had sustained any injuries Others advanced toward our friends Nine of them murmured Tom as he counted the little band of castaways and they don t seem to have been able to save much from the wreck of their craft whatever it was The beach all about them was bare save for a boat drawn up out of reach of high water Do you suppose they are a party from some disabled airship Tom asked mister Fenwick Not from an airship answered the lad Probably from some vessel that was wrecked in the gale But we will soon find out who they are Tom led the way for his two friends The fall of the cliff had made a rugged path around the base of it over rocks to where the other people stood Tom scrambled in and out among the boulders in spite of the pain it caused his wounded leg He was anxious to know who the other castaways were and how they had come there Several of the larger party were now advancing to meet the lad and his friends Tom could see two women and seven men A moment later when the lad had a good view of one of the ladies and a gentleman he could not repress a cry of astonishment Then he rubbed his eyes to make sure it was not some blur or defect of vision No his first impression had been correct mister Nestor cried Tom recognizing the father of his girl friend And missus Nestor he added a moment later Why of all things look Amos it s it can t be possible and yet why it s Tom Swift cried the lady Tom Tom Swift here ejaculated the man at her side Yes Tom Swift the young inventor of Shopton don t you know the lad who saved Mary s life in the runaway Tom Swift Tom Swift murmured mister Nestor Is it possible I m Tom Swift all right answered the owner of that name but how in the world did you get on this island mister Nestor I might ask you the same thing Tom The yacht RESOLUTE on which we were making a voyage to the West Indies as guests of mister George Hosbrook was wrecked in the awful gale We took to the boats and managed to reach this island The yacht sunk and we only had a little food We are almost starved But how came you here mister Fenwick s airship was wrecked and we dropped down here What a coincidence To think that I should meet you here But if you re hungry it s the best thing in the world that we met you for though our airship was wrecked we have a large supply of food Come over to our camp and we ll give you all you want Tom had rushed forward and was shaking hands with Mary s parents so unexpectedly met with when mister Nestor called out Come over here mister Hosbrook I want you to meet a friend of mine A moment later the millionaire owner of the ill fated RESOLUTE was shaking hands with Tom I can t understand it mister Hosbrook said To think of meeting other people on this desolate island this island of earthquakes Oh please don t speak of earthquakes cried missus Nestor We are in mortal terror There have been several since we landed in the most terrible storm day before yesterday Isn t it awful It is a regular earthquake island That s what I call it spoke Tom grimly The others of the larger party of refugees now came up Besides mister and missus Nestor and mister Hosbrook there was mister and missus Floyd Anderson friends of the millionaire mister Ralph Parker who was spoken of as a scientist mister Barcoe Jenks who seemed an odd sort of individual always looking about suspiciously Captain Mentor who had been in command of the yacht and Jake Fordam the mate of the vessel And are these all who were saved asked Tom as he introduced his two friends and told briefly of their air voyage No answered mister Hosbrook two other boatloads one containing most of the crew and the other containing some of my guests got away before our boat left I trust they have been rescued but we have heard nothing about them However our own lives may not long be safe if these earthquakes continue But did I understand you to say mister Swift that you had food he went on If you have I will gladly pay you any price for some especially for these two ladies who must be faint I have lost all my ready cash but if we ever reach civilization I will Don t speak of such a thing as pay interrupted mister Fenwick All that we have we ll gladly share with you Come over to our camp We have enough for all and we can cook on our gasolene stove Don t speak of pay I beg of you Ah er if mister Hosbrook has no money perhaps I can offer an equivalent broke in the man who had been introduced as Barcoe Jenks I have er some securities He stopped and looked about indefinitely as though he did not know exactly what to say and he was fumbling at a belt about his waist a belt that might contain treasure Don t speak of reimbursing us went on mister Fenwick with rather a suspicious glance at mister Jenks You are welcome to whatever we have Bless my topknot certainly yes joined in mister Damon eagerly Well I er I only spoke of it said mister Jenks hesitatingly and then he turned away mister Hosbrook looked sharply at him but said nothing Suppose we go to our camp proposed Tom We may be able to get you up a good meal before another earthquake comes I wonder what makes so many of them asked missus Nestor with a nervous shiver Yes indeed they are terrifying One never knows when to expect them added missus Anderson I have a theory about them said mister Parker the scientist who up to this time had spoken but little A theory inquired Tom Yes This island is one of the smaller of the West Indies group It is little known and has seldom been visited I believe But I am sure that what causes the earthquakes is that the whole island has been undermined by the sea and it is the wash of great submarine waves and currents which cause the tremors Undermined by the sea repeated Tom Yes It is being slowly washed away Bless my soul Washed away gasped mister Damon And in the course of a comparatively short time it will sink went on the scientist as cheerfully as though he was a professor propounding some problem to his class Sink ejaculated missus Nestor The whole island undermined Oh what an alarming theory I wish I could hold to a different one madam was mister Parker s answer but I cannot I think the island will sink after a few more shocks Then what good will my began Barcoe Jenks but he stopped in confusion and again his hand went to his belt with a queer gesture CHAPTER XVII A MIGHTY SHOCK Tom Swift turned to gaze at mister Barcoe Jenks That individual certainly had a strange manner Perhaps it might be caused by the terror of the earthquakes but the man seemed to be trying to hold back some secret He was constrained and ill at ease He saw the young inventor looking at him and his hands which had gone to his belt with a spasmodic motion dropped to his side You don t really mean to say Parker that you think the whole island is undermined do you asked the owner of the RESOLUTE That s my theory It may be a wrong one but it is borne out by the facts already presented to us I greatly fear for our lives But what can we do cried missus Nestor Nothing answered the scientist with a shrug of his shoulders Absolutely nothing save to wait for it to happen Don t say that begged missus Andersen Can t you gentlemen do something build a boat and take us away Why the boat we came here in Struck a rock and stove a hole in the bottom as big as a barrel madam interrupted Captain Mentor It would never do to put to sea in that But can t something else be done demanded missus Nestor Oh it is awful to think of perishing on this terrible earthquake island Oh Amos Think of it and Mary home alone Have you seen her lately mister Swift Tom told of his visit to the Nestors home Our hero was almost in despair not so much for himself as for the unfortunate women of the party and one of them was Mary s mother Yet what could he do What chance was there of escaping from the earthquake Bless my gizzard exclaimed mister Damon Don t let s stand here worrying If you folks are hungry come up to our camp We have plenty Afterward we can discuss means of saving ourselves I want to be saved exclaimed mister Jenks I must be saved I have a great secret a secret Once more he paused in confusion and once more his hands nervously sought his belt I would give a big reward to be saved he murmured And so I fancy we all would added Captain Mentor But we are not likely to This island is out of the track of the regular line of vessels Where are we anyhow inquired mister Fenwick What island is this It isn t down on the charts I believe was the captain s reply but we won t be far out if we call it Earthquake Island That name seems to fit it exactly They had walked on while talking and now had gone past the broken cliff Tom and his two friends of the airship led the way to the camp they had made On the way mister Hosbrook related how his yacht had struggled in vain against the tempest how she had sprung a leak how the fires had gone out and how helpless in the trough of the sea the gallant vessel began to founder Then they had taken to the boats and had most unexpectedly come upon the island And since we landed we have had very little to eat said missus Nestor We haven t had a place to sleep and it has been terrible Then too the earthquakes And my husband and I worried so about Mary Oh mister Swift Do you think there is any chance of us ever seeing her again I don t know answered Tom softly I ll do all I can to get us off this island Perhaps we can build a raft and set out If we stay here there is no telling what will happen if that scientist s theory is correct But there is our camp just ahead You will be more comfortable at least for a little while In a short time they were at the place where Tom and the others had built the shack The ruins of the airship were examined with interest and the two women took advantage of the seclusion of the little hut to get some much needed rest until a meal should be ready One was soon in course of preparation by Tom and mister Damon aided by Mate Fordam of the RESOLUTE Fortunate it was that mister Fenwick had brought along such a supply of food for there were now many mouths to feed That the supper which the meal really was for it was getting late was much enjoyed goes without saying The yacht castaways had subsisted on what little food had been hurriedly put into the life boat as they left the vessel At Tom s request while it was yet light Captain Mentor and some of the men hunted for a spring of fresh water and found one for with the increase in the party the young inventor saw the necessity for more water The spring gave promise of supplying a sufficient quantity There was plenty of material at hand for making other shacks and they were soon in course of construction They were made light as was the one Tom and his friends first built so that in case of another shock no one would be hurt seriously The two ladies were given the larger shack and the men divided themselves between two others that were hastily erected on the beach The remainder of the food and stores was taken from the wreck of the airship and when darkness began to fall the camp was snug and comfortable a big fire of driftwood burning brightly Oh if only we can sleep without being awakened by an earthquake exclaimed missus Nestor as she prepared to go into the shack with missus Anderson But I am almost afraid to close my eyes If it would do any good to stay up and watch to tell you when one was coming I d do so spoke Tom with a laugh but they come without warning However the night did pass peacefully and there was not the least tremor of the island In the morning the castaways took courage and after breakfast began discussing their situation more calmly It seems to me that the only solution is to build some sort of a raft or other craft and leave the island said mister Fenwick Bless my hair brush cried mister Damon Why can t we hoist a signal of distress and wait for some steamer to see it and call for us It seems to me that would be more simple than going to sea on a raft I don t like the idea A signal would be all right if this island was in the path of the steamers said Captain Mentor But it isn t Our flag might fly for a year and never be seen His words seemed to strike coldness to every heart Tom who was looking at the wreck of the airship suddenly uttered an exclamation He sprang to his feet What is it demanded mister Fenwick Does your sore leg hurt you No but I have just thought of a plan fairly shouted the young inventor I have it Wait and see if I can work it Work what cried mister Damon Tom did not get a chance to answer for at that moment there sounded at the far end of the island whence the yacht castaways had come a terrific crash It was accompanied rather than followed by a shaking trembling and swaying of the ground Another earthquake screamed missus Nestor rushing toward her husband The castaways gazed at each other affrighted Suddenly before their eyes they saw the extreme end of that part of the island on which they were camping slip off and beneath the foaming waves of the sea while the echoes of the mighty crash came to their ears CHAPTER XVIII mister JENKS HAS DIAMONDS Stunned and well nigh paralyzed by the suddenness of the awful crash and the recurrence of the earthquake the castaways gazed spell bound at one another Succeeding the disappearance of the end of the island there arose a great wave in the ocean caused by the immersion of such a quantity of rock and dirt Look out yelled Tom there may be a flood here They realized his meaning and hastened up the beach out of reach of the water if it should come And it did At first the ocean retreated as though the tide was going out then with a rush and roar the waves came leaping back and had the castaways remained where they had been standing they would have been swept cut to sea As it was the flood reached part of the wreck of the airship that lay on the beach and washed away some of the broken planks But after the first rush of water the sea grew less troubled and there was no more danger from that source True the whole island was rumbling and trembling in the throes of an earthquake but by this time the refugees had become somewhat used to this and only the two ladies exhibited any outward signs of great alarm though mister Barcoe Jenks Tom observed was nervously fingering the belt which he wore about his waist I guess the worst is over spoke mister Fenwick as they stood looking toward where part of the island had vanished The shock expended itself on tearing that mass of rock and earth away Let us hope so added mister Hosbrook solemnly Oh if we could only get away from this terrible place We must hoist a signal of distress even if we are out of the track of regular vessels Some ship blown out of her course may see it Captain Mentor I wish you and mister Fordam would attend to that I will sir answered the commander of the ill fated RESOLUTE The signal shall be hoisted at once Come on mister Fordam he added turning to the first mate If you don t mind interrupted Tom I wish you would first help me to get what remains of the airship up out of reach of any more possible high waves That one nearly covered it and if there are other big rollers the wreck may be washed out to sea I can t see that any great harm would result from that put in mister Jenks There isn t anything about the wreck that we could use to make a boat or raft from Indeed there was little left of the airship save the mass of machinery Well it may come in handy before we leave here said Tom and there was a quiet determined air about him that caused mister Damon to look at him curiously The odd gentleman started to utter one of his numerous blessings and to ask Tom a question but he thought better of it By this time the earthquake had ceased and the castaways were calmer Tom started toward the airship wreck and began pulling off some broken boards to get at the electrical machinery I guess you had better give mister Swift a hand Captain Mentor spoke the millionaire yacht owner I don t know what good the wreck can be but we owe considerable to mister Swift and his friends and the least we can do is to aid them in anything they ask So Captain if you don t mind you and the mate bear a hand In fact we ll all help and move the wreck so far up that there will be no danger even from tidal waves Tom looked pleased at this order and soon he and all the men in the little party were busy taking out the electrical apparatus and moving it farther inland What are you going to do with it Tom asked mister Damon in a low voice as he assisted the young inventor to carry a small dynamo that was used for operating the incandescent lights I hardly know myself I have a half formed plan in my mind I may be able to carry it out and I may not I don t want to say anything until I look over the machinery and see if all the parts which I need are here Please say nothing about it Bless my toothpick Of course I ll not promised mister Damon When the removal of most of the machinery of the wrecked airship had been completed missus Nestor exclaimed Well since you are moving that out of harm s way don t you think it would be a good idea to change our camp also I m sure I ll never sleep a wink thinking that part of the island may fall into the ocean at any moment in the night and create a wave that may wash us all out to sea Can t we move the camp mister Swift No reason why we can t answered the lad smiling I think it would be a good plan to take it farther back We are likely to be here some time and while we are about it we might build more complete shelters and have a few more comforts The others agreed with this idea so the little shacks that had been erected were taken down and moved to higher ground where a better outlook could be had of the surrounding ocean At the same time as safe a place as possible considering the frequent earthquakes was picked out a place where there were no overhanging rocks or cliffs Three huts were built one for the two ladies one for the men and third where the cooking could be done This last also held the food supplies and stores and Tom noted with satisfaction that there was still sufficient to eat to last over a week mister Fenwick had not stinted his kitchen stores This work done Captain Mentor and Mate Fordam went to the highest part of the island where they erected a signal made from pieces of canvas that had been in the life boat The boat itself was brought around to the new camp and at first it was hoped that it could be repaired and used But too large a hole had been stove in the bottom so it was broken up and the planks used in making the shacks This work occupied the better part of two days and during this time there were no more earthquakes The castaways began to hope that the island would not be quiet for a while missus Anderson and missus Nestor assumed charge of the housekeeping arrangements and also the cooking which relieved Tom from those duties The two ladies even instituted wash day and when a number of garments were hung on lines to dry the camp looked like some summer colony of pleasure seekers out for a holiday In the meanwhile Tom had spent most of his time among the machinery which had been taken from the airship He inspected it carefully tested some of the apparatus and made some calculations on a bit of paper He seemed greatly pleased over something and one afternoon when he was removing some of the guy and stay wires from the collapsed frame of the WHIZZER he was approached by mister Barcoe Jenks Planning something new asked mister Jenks with an attempt at jollity which however failed The man had a curious air about him as if he was carrying some secret that was too much for him Well nothing exactly new answered Tom At best I am merely going to try an experiment An experiment eh resumed mister Jenks And might I ask if it has anything to do with rescuing us from this island I hope it will have answered Tom gravely Good exclaimed mister Jenks Well now I have a proposition to make to you I suppose you are not very wealthy mister Swift He gazed at Tom quizzically I am not poor was the young inventor s proud answer but I would be glad to make more money legitimately I thought so Most every one would Look here He approached closer to Tom and pulling his hand from his pocket held it extended in the palm were a number of irregularly shaped objects stones or crystals the lad took them to be yet they did not look like ordinary stones or crystals Do you know what those are asked mister Jenks I might guess replied Tom I ll save you the trouble They are diamonds Diamonds of the very first water but uncut Now to the point I have half a million dollars worth of them If you get me safely off this island I will agree to make you a quarter of a million dollars worth of diamonds Make me a quarter of a million dollars worth of diamonds asked Tom struck by the use of the work make Yes make answered mister Jenks That is if I can discover the secret the secret of Phantom Mountain Get me away from the island and I will share my knowledge with you I need help help to learn the secret and help to make the diamonds see there are some of the first ones made but I have been defrauded of my rights I need the aid of a young fellow like you Will you help See I ll give you some diamonds now They are genuine though they are not like ordinary diamonds I made them Will you Before Tom could answer there came a warning rumble of the earth and a great fissure opened almost at the feet of mister Jenks who with a cry of fear leaped toward the young inventor CHAPTER XIX SECRET OPERATIONS Help me save this machinery yelled Tom whose first thought was for the electrical apparatus Don t let it fall into that chasm For the crack had widened until it was almost to the place where the parts of the wrecked airship had been carried The machinery What do I care about the machinery cried mister Jenks I want to save my life And this machinery is our only hope retorted Tom He began tugging at the heavy dynamos and gasolene engine but he might have saved himself the trouble for with the same suddenness with which it opened the crack closed again The shock had done it and as if satisfied with that phenomena the earthquake ceased and the island no longer trembled That was a light one spoke Tom with an air of relief He was becoming used to the shocks now and when he saw that his precious machinery was not damaged he could view the earth tremors calmly Slight exclaimed mister Jenks Well I don t call it so But I see Captain Mentor and mister Hosbrook coming Please don t say anything to them about the diamonds I ll see you again and with that the queer mister Jenks walked away We came to see if you were hurt called the captain as he neared the young inventor No I m all right How about the others Only frightened replied the yacht owner This is getting awful I hoped we were free from the shocks but they still continue And I guess they will added Tom We certainly are on Earthquake Island mister Parker the scientist says this last shock bears out his theory went on the millionaire He says it will be only a question of a few days when the whole island will disappear Comforting to say the least commented Tom I should say so But what are you doing mister Swift Trying an experiment answered the young inventor in some confusion He was not yet ready to talk about his plans We must begin to think seriously of building some sort of a boat or raft and getting away from the island went on the millionaire It will be perilous to go to sea with anything we can construct but it is risking our lives to stay here I don t know what to do Perhaps Captain Mentor has some plan suggested Tom hoping to change the subject No answered the commander I confess I am at a loss to know what to do There is nothing with which to do anything that is the trouble But I did think of hoisting another signal on this end of the island where it might be seen if our first one wasn t I believe I ll do that and he moved away to carry out his intention Well I think I ll get back Tom and tell the others that you are all right spoke mister Hosbrook I left the camp after the shock because missus Nestor was worried about you The place to which the airship machinery had been removed was some distance from the camp and out of sight of the shacks Oh yes I m all right said Tom Then with a sudden impulse he asked Do you know much about this mister Barcoe Jenks mister Hosbrook Not a great deal was the reply In fact I may say I do not know him at all Why do you ask Because I thought he acted rather strangely Just what the rest of us think declared the yacht owner He is no friend of mine though he was my guest on the RESOLUTE It came about in this way I had invited a mister Frank Jackson to make the trip with me and he asked if he could bring with him a mister Jenks a friend of his I assented and mister Jackson came aboard with mister Jenks Just as we were about to sail mister Jackson received a message requiring his presence in Canada and he could not make the trip But mister Jenks seemed so cut up about being deprived of the yachting trip and was so fond of the water that I invited him to remain on board even if his friend did not So that is how he came to be among my guests though he is a comparative stranger to all of us I see spoke Tom Has he been acting unusually strange asked mister Hosbrook suspiciously No only he seemed very anxious to get off the island but I suppose we all are He wanted to know what I planned to do Did you tell him No for the reason that I don t know whether I can succeed or not and I don t want to raise false hopes Then you would prefer not to tell any of us No one that is except mister Fenwick and mister Damon I may need them to help me I see responded mister Hosbrook Well whatever it is I wish you luck It is certainly a fearful place this island and busy with many thoughts which crowded upon him the millionaire moved away leaving Tom alone A little while after this Tom might have been seen in close conversation with mister Damon and mister Fenwick The former on hearing what the young inventor had to say blessed himself and his various possessions so often that he seemed to have gotten out of breath mister Fenwick exclaimed Tom if you can work that it will be one of the greatest things you have ever done I hope I can work it was all the young inventor replied For the next three days Tom and his two friends spent most of their time in the neighborhood of the pile of machinery and apparatus taken from the wrecked WHIZZER mister Jenks hung around the spot but a word or two from mister Hosbrook sent him away and our three friends were left to their work in peace for they were inclined to be secretive about their operations as Tom did not want his plans known until he was ready The gasolene motor was overhauled and put in shape to work Then it was attached to the dynamo When this much had been done Tom and his friends built a rude shack around the machinery shutting it from view Humph Are you afraid we will steal it asked mister Parker the scientist who held to his alarming theory regarding the ultimate disappearance of the island No I simply want to protect it from the weather answered Tom You will soon know all our plans I think they will work out You d better do it before we get another earthquake and the island sinks was the dismal response But there had been no shocks since the one that nearly engulfed mister Jenks As for that individual he said little to any one and wandered off alone by himself Tom wondered what kind of diamonds they were that the odd man had and the lad even had his doubts as to the value of the queer stones he had seen But he was too busy with his work to waste much time in idle speculation CHAPTER XX THE WIRELESS PLANT The castaways had been on Earthquake Island a week now and in that time had suffered many shocks Some were mere tremors and some were so severe as to throw whole portions of the isle into the sea They never could tell when a shock was coming and often one awakened them in the night But in spite of this the refugees were as cheerful as it was possible to be under the circumstances Only mister Jenks seemed nervous and ill at ease and he kept much by himself As for Tom mister Damon and mister Fenwick the three were busy in their shack The others had ceased to ask questions about what they were doing and mister Nestor and his wife took it for granted that Tom was building a boat Captain Mentor and the mate spent much time gazing off to sea hoping for a sight of the sail of some vessel or the haze that would indicate the smoke of a steamer But they saw nothing I haven t much hope of sighting anything the captain said I know we are off the track of the regular liners and our only chance would be that some tramp steamer or some ship blown off her course would see our signal I tell you friends we re in a bad way If money was any object began mister Jenks What good would money be demanded mister Hosbrook What we need to do is to get a message to some one some of my friends to send out a party to rescue us That s right chimed in mister Parker the scientist And the message needs to go off soon if we are to be saved Why so asked mister Anderson Because I think this island will sink inside of a week A scream came from the two ladies Why don t you keep such thoughts to yourself demanded the millionaire yacht owner indignantly Well it s true stubbornly insisted the scientist What if it is It doesn t do any good to remind us of it Bless my gizzard no exclaimed mister Damon Suppose we have dinner I m hungry That seemed to be his remedy for a number of ills If we only could get a message off summoning help it WOULD be the very thing sighed missus Nestor Oh how I wish I could send my daughter Mary word of where we are She may hear of the wreck of the RESOLUTE and worry herself to death But it is out of the question to send a message for help from Earthquake Island added missus Anderson We are totally cut off from the rest of the world here Perhaps not spoke Tom Swift quietly He had come up silently and had heard the conversation What s that you said cried mister Nestor springing to his feet and crossing the sandy beach toward the lad I said perhaps we weren t altogether cut off from the rest of the world repeated Tom Why not demanded Captain Mentor You don t mean to say that you have been building a boat up there in your little shack do you Not a boat replied Tom but I think I have a means of sending out a call for help Oh Tom mister Swift how exclaimed missus Nestor Do you mean we can send a message to my Mary Well not exactly to her answered the young inventor though he wished that such a thing were possible But I think I can summon help How demanded mister Hosbrook Have you managed to discover some cable line running past the island and have you tapped it Not exactly was Tom s calm answer but I have succeeded with the help of mister Damon and mister Fenwick in building an apparatus that will send out wireless messages Wireless messages gasped the millionaire Are you sure Wireless messages exclaimed mister Jenks I ll give He paused clasped his hands on his belt and turned away Oh Tom cried missus Nestor and she went up to the lad threw her arms about his neck and kissed him whereat Tom blushed Perhaps you d better explain suggested mister Anderson I will said the lad That is the secret we have been engaged upon mister Damon mister Fenwick and myself We did not want to say anything about it until we were sure we could succeed And are you sure now asked Captain Mentor Fairly so How could you build a wireless station inquired mister Hosbrook From the electrical machinery that was in the wrecked WHIZZER spoke Tom Fortunately that was not damaged by the shock of the fall and I have managed to set up the gasolene engine and attach the dynamo to it so that we can generate a powerful current We also have a fairly good storage battery though that was slightly damaged by the fall I have just tested the machinery and I think we can send out a strong enough message to carry at least a thousand miles Then that will reach some station or some passing ship murmured Captain Mentor There is a chance that we may be saved If it isn t too late gloomily murmured the scientist There is no telling when the island will disappear beneath the sea But they were all so interested in Tom s announcement that they paid little attention to this dire foreboding Tell us about it suggested mister Nestor And Tom did He related how he had set up the dynamo and gasolene engine and how by means of the proper coils and other electrical apparatus all of which fortunately was aboard the WHIZZER he could produce a powerful spark I had to make a key out of strips of brass to produce the Morse characters the lad said This took considerable time but it works though it is rather crude I can click out a message with it That may be said mister Hosbrook who had been considering installing a wireless plant on his yacht and who therefore knew something about it you may send a message but can you receive an answer I have also provided for that replied Tom I have made a receiving instrument though that is even more crude than the sending plant for it had to be delicately adjusted and I did not have just the magnets carbons coherers and needles that I needed But I think it will work Did you have a telephone receiver to use Yes There was a small interior telephone arrangement on mister Fenwick s airship and part of that came in handy Oh I think I can hear any messages that may come in answer to ours But what about the aerial wires for sending and receiving messages asked mister Nestor Don t you have to have several wires on a tall mast Yes and that is the last thing to do declared Tom I need all your help in putting up those wires That tall tree on the crest of the island will do and he pointed to a dead palm that towered gaunt and bare like a ship s mast on a pile of rocks in the centre of Earthquake Island CHAPTER XXI MESSAGES INTO SPACE Tom Swift s announcement of the practical completion of his wireless plant brought hope to the discouraged hearts of the castaways They crowded about him and asked all manner of questions mister Fenwick and mister Damon came in for their share of attention for Tom said had it not been for the aid of his friends he never could have accomplished what he did Then they all trooped up to the little shack and inspected the plant As the young inventor had said it was necessarily crude but when he set the gasolene motor going and the dynamo whizzed and hummed sending out great violet hued sparks they were all convinced that the young inventor had accomplished wonders considering the materials at his disposal But it s going to be no easy task to rig up the sending and receiving wires declared Tom That will take some time Have you got the wire asked mister Jenks I took it from the stays of the airship was Tom s reply and he recalled the day he was at that work when the odd man had exhibited the handful of what he said were diamonds Tom wondered if they really were and he speculated as to what might be the secret of Phantom Mountain to which mister Jenks had referred But now followed a busy time for all Under the direction of the young inventor they began to string the wires from the top of the dead tree to a smaller one some distance away using five wires set parallel and attached to a wooden spreader or stay The wires were then run to the dynamo and the receiving coil and the necessary ground wires were installed But I can t understand how you are going to do it said missus Nestor I ve read about wireless messages but I can t get it through my head How is it done mister Swift The theory is very simple said the young inventor To send a message by wire over a telegraph system a battery or dynamo is used This establishes a current over wires stretched between two points By means of what is called a key this current is interrupted or broken at certain intervals making the sounding instrument send out clicks A short click is called a dot and a long click a dash By combinations of dots dashes and spaces between the dots and dashes letters are spelled out For instance a dot and a space and a dash represent the letter A and so on I understand so far admitted missus Nestor In telegraphing without wires went on Tom the air is used in place of a metallic conductor with the help of the earth which in itself is a big magnet or a battery as you choose to regard it The earth helps to establish the connection between places where there are no wires when we ground certain conductors To send a wireless message a current is generated by a dynamo The current flows along until it gets to the ends of the sending wires which we have just strung Then it leaps off into space so to speak until it reaches the receiving wires wherever they may be erected That is why any wireless receiving station within a certain radius can catch any messages that may be flying through the air that is unless certain apparatus is tuned or adjusted to prevent this Well once the impulses or electric currents are sent out into space all that is necessary to do is to break or interrupt them at certain intervals to make dots dashes and spaces These make corresponding clicks in the telephone receiver which the operator at the receiving station wears on his ear He hears the code of clicks and translates them into letters the letters into words and the words into sentences That is how wireless messages are sent And do you propose to send some that way asked missus Anderson I do replied Tom with a smile Where to missus Nestor wanted to know That s what I can t tell was Tom s reply I will have to project them off into space and trust to chance that some listening wireless operator will pick them up as they call it and send us aid But are wireless operators always listening asked mister Nestor Somewhere some of them are I hope was Tom s quiet answer As I said we will have to trust much to chance But other people have been saved by sending messages off into space and why not we Sinking steamers have had their passengers taken off when the operator called for help merely by sending a message into space But how can we tell them where to come for us on this unknown island inquired missus Anderson I fancy Captain Mentor can supply our longitude and latitude answered Tom I will give that with every message I send out and help may come some day It can t come any too quick for me declared mister Damon Bless my door knob but my wife must be worrying about my absence What message for help will you send Captain Mentor wanted to know I am going to use the old call for aid was the reply of the young inventor I shall flash into space the three letters C Q D They stand for Come Quick Danger A new code call has been instituted for them but I am going to rely on the old one as in this part of the world the new one may not be so well understood Then I will follow that by giving our position in the ocean as nearly as Captain Mentor can figure it out I will repeat this call at intervals until we get help Or until the island sinks added the scientist grimly Here Don t mention that any more ordered mister Hosbrook It s getting on my nerves We may be rescued before that awful calamity overtakes us I don t believe so was mister Parker s reply and he actually seemed to derive pleasure from his gloomy prophecy It s lucky you understand wireless telegraphy Tom Swift said mister Nestor admiringly and the other joined in praising the young inventor until blushing he hurried off to make some adjustments to his apparatus Can you compute our longitude and latitude Captain Mentor asked the millionaire yacht owner I think so was the reply Not very accurately of course for all my papers and instruments went down in the RESOLUTE But near enough for the purpose I fancy I ll get right to work at it and let mister Swift have it I wish you would The sooner we begin calling for help the better I never expected to be in such a predicament as this but it is wonderful how that young fellow worked out his plan of rescue I hope he succeeds It took some little time for the commander to figure their position and then it was only approximate But at length he handed Tom a piece of paper with the latitude and longitude written on it In the meanwhile the young inventor had been connecting up his apparatus The wires were now all strung and all that was necessary was to start the motor and dynamo A curious throng gathered about the little shack as Tom announced that he was about to flash into space the first message calling for help He took his place at the box to which had been fastened the apparatus for clicking off the Morse letters Well here we go he said with a smile His fingers clasped the rude key he had fashioned from bits of brass and hard rubber The motor was buzzing away and the electric dynamo was purring like some big cat Just as Tom opened the circuit to send the current into the instrument there came an ominous rumbling of the earth Another quake screamed missus Anderson But it was over in a second and calmness succeeded the incipient panic Suddenly overhead there sounded a queer crackling noise a vicious snapping as if from some invisible whips Mercy What s that cried missus Nestor The wireless replied Tom quietly I am going to send a message for help off into space I hope some one receives it and answers he added in a low tone The crackling increased While they gathered about him Tom Swift pressed the key making and breaking the current until he had sent out from Earthquake Island the three letters C Q D And he followed them by giving their latitude and longitude Over and over again he flashed out this message Would it be answered Would help come If so from where And if so would it be in time These were questions that the castaways asked themselves As for Tom he sat at the key clicking away while overhead from the wires fastened to the dead tree flashed out the messages 
8176_115046_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XXII
none	none	 ANXIOUS DAYS 
8176_115046_000003_000000	train-clean-360	After the first few minutes of watching Tom click out the messages the little throng of castaways that had gathered about the shack moved away 
8176_115046_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The matter had lost its novelty for them though of course they were vitally interested in the success of Tom s undertaking 
none	none	Only mister Damon and mister Fenwick remained with the young inventor for he needed help occasionally in operating the dynamo or in adjusting the gasolene motor missus Nestor who with missus Anderson was looking after the primitive housekeeping arrangements occasionally strolled up the hill to the little shed
8176_115046_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Any answer yet mister Swift she would ask 
none	none	No was the reply
8176_115046_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 We can hardly expect any so soon and missus Nestor would depart with a sigh 
none	none	Knowing that his supply of gasolene was limited Tom realized that he could not run the dynamo steadily and keep flashing the wireless messages into space 
8176_115046_000006_000001	train-clean-360	He consulted with his two friends on the subject and mister Damon said 
8176_115046_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Well the best plan I think would be only to send out the flashes over the wires at times when other wireless operators will be on the lookout or rather listening 
none	none	There is no use wasting our fuel 
8176_115046_000007_000002	train-clean-360	We can t get any more here 
8176_115046_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 That s true admitted Tom but how can we pick out any certain time when we can be sure that wireless operators within a zone of a thousand miles will be listening to catch clicks which call for help from the unknown 
8176_115046_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 We can t decided mister Fenwick 
none	none	The only thing to do is to trust to chance If there was only some way so you would not have to be on duty all the while and could send out messages automatically it would be good Tom shook his head I have to stay here to adjust the apparatus he said It works none too easily as it is for I didn t have just what I needed from which to construct this station Anyhow even if I could rig up something to click out C Q D automatically I could hardly arrange to have the answer come that way And I want to be here when the answer comes
8176_115046_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you any plan then asked mister Damon 
none	none	Bless my shoe laces there are enough problems to solve on this earthquake island
8176_115046_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought of this said Tom 
8176_115046_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll send out our call for help from nine to ten in the morning 
8176_115046_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Then I ll wait and send out another call from two to three in the afternoon 
none	none	Around seven in the evening I ll try again and then about ten o clock at night before going to bed
8176_115046_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 That ought to be sufficient agreed mister Fenwick 
8176_115046_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Certainly we must save our gasolene for there is no telling how long we may have to stay here and call for help 
none	none	It won t be long if that scientist Parker has his way spoke mister Damon grimly Bless my hat band but he s a MOST uncomfortable man to have around always predicting that the island is going to sink I hope we are rescued before that happens
8176_115046_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I guess we all do remarked mister Fenwick 
8176_115046_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 But Tom here is another matter 
8176_115046_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Have you thought about getting an answer from the unknown from some ship or wireless station that may reply to your calls 
8176_115046_000015_000003	train-clean-360	How can you tell when that will come in 
none	none	I can t
8176_115046_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Then won t you or some of us have to be listening all the while 
8176_115046_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 No for I think an answer will come only directly after I have sent out a call and it has been picked up by some operator 
none	none	Still there is a possibility that some operator might receive my message and report to his chief or some one in authority over him before replying In that time I might go away 
8176_115046_000018_000003	train-clean-360	But to guard against that I will sleep with the telephone receiver clamped to my ear 
none	none	Then I can hear the answer come over the wires and can jump up and reply Do you mean you will sleep here asked mister Damon indicating the shack where the wireless apparatus was contained
8176_115046_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes answered Tom simply 
none	none	Can t we take turns listening for the answer inquired mister Fenwick and so relieve you I m afraid not unless you understand the Morse code replied Tom You see there may be many clicks which result from wireless messages flying back and forth in space and my receiver will pick them up But they will mean nothing Only the answer to our call for help will be of any service to us Do you mean to say that you can catch messages flying back and forth between stations now asked mister Fenwick
8176_115046_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes replied the young inventor with a smile 
none	none	Here listen for yourself and he passed the head instrument over to the WHIZZER s former owner 
8176_115046_000024_000002	train-clean-360	The latter listened a moment 
8176_115046_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 All I can hear are some faint clicks he said 
8176_115046_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 But they are a message spoke Tom 
8176_115046_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 Wait I ll translate and he put the receiver to his ear 
8176_115046_000026_000002	train-clean-360	 STEAMSHIP FALCON REPORTS A SLIGHT FIRE IN HER FORWARD COMPARTMENT said Tom slowly 
8176_115046_000026_000003	train-clean-360	 IT IS UNDER CONTROL AND WE WILL PROCEED 
none	none	Do you mean to say that was the message you heard cried mister Damon
8176_115046_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 Bless my soul I never can understand it 
none	none	It was part of a message answered Tom
8176_115046_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 I did not catch it all nor to whom it was sent 
none	none	But why can t you send a message to that steamship then and beg them to come to our aid asked mister Fenwick
8176_115046_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 Even if they have had a fire it is out now and they ought to be glad to save life 
none	none	They would come to our aid or send spoke Tom but I can not make their wireless operator pick up our message Either his apparatus is not in tune or in accord with ours or he is beyond our zone But you heard him insisted mister Damon
8176_115046_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but sometimes it is easier to pick up messages than it is to send them 
none	none	However I will keep on trying Putting into operation the plan he had decided on for saving their supply of gasolene Tom sent out his messages the remainder of the day at the intervals agreed upon Then the apparatus was shut down but the lad paid frequent visits to the shack and listened to the clicks of the telephone receiver He caught several messages but they were not in response to his appeals for aid That night there was a slight earthquake shock but no more of the island fell into the sea though the castaways were awakened by the tremors and were in mortal terror for a while Three days passed days of anxious waiting during which time Tom sent out message after message by his wireless and waited in vain for an answer There were three shocks in this interval two slight and one very severe which last cast into the ocean a great cliff on the far end of the island 
8176_115046_000035_000002	train-clean-360	There was a flooding rush of water but no harm resulted 
8176_115046_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 It is coming nearer said mister Parker 
8176_115046_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 What is demanded mister Hosbrook 
8176_115046_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 The destruction of our island 
8176_115046_000038_000001	train-clean-360	My theory will soon be confirmed and the scientist actually seemed to take pleasure in it 
8176_115046_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh you and your theory exclaimed the millionaire in disgust Don t let me hear you mention it again 
8176_115046_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Haven t we troubles enough whereat mister Parker went off by himself to look at the place where the cliff had fallen 
8176_115046_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Each night Tom slept with the telephone receiver to his ear but though it clicked many times there was not sounded the call he had adopted for his station E 
8176_115046_000040_000001	train-clean-360	I Earthquake Island 
none	none	In each appeal he sent out he had requested that if his message was picked up that the answer be preceded by the letters E I It was on the fourth day after the completion of the wireless station that Tom was sending out his morning calls 
8176_115046_000041_000001	train-clean-360	missus Nestor came up the little hill to the shack where Tom was clicking away 
none	none	No replies yet I suppose she inquired and there was a hopeless note in her voice
8176_115046_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 None yet but they may come any minute and Tom tried to speak cheerfully 
8176_115046_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I certainly hope so added Mary s mother But I came up more especially now mister Swift to inquire where you had stored the rest of the food 
8176_115046_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 the rest of the food 
none	none	The rest of the food
8176_115046_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes the supply you took from the wrecked airship 
none	none	We have used up nearly all that was piled in the improvised kitchen and we ll have to draw on the reserve supply
8176_115046_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 The reserve murmured Tom 
none	none	Yes there is only enough in the shack where missus Anderson and I do the cooking to last for about two days 
8176_115046_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Isn t there any more 
none	none	Tom did not answer He saw the drift of the questioning 
8176_115046_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Their food was nearly gone yet the castaways from the RESOLUTE thought there was still plenty 
8176_115046_000049_000003	train-clean-360	As a matter of fact there was not another can except those in the kitchen shack 
none	none	Get out wherever there is left some time to day if you will mister Swift went on missus Nestor as she turned away and missus Anderson and I will see if we can fix up some new dishes for you men folks
8176_115046_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh all right answered Tom weakly 
8176_115046_000052_000000	train-clean-360	His hand dropped from the key of the instrument 
none	none	He sat staring into space Food enough for but two days more with earthquakes likely to happen at any moment and no reply yet to his appeals for aid 
8176_115046_000052_000003	train-clean-360	Truly the situation was desperate 
none	none	Tom shook his head It was the first time he had felt like giving up CHAPTER XXIII A REPLY IN THE DARK 
8176_115047_000002_000000	train-clean-360	The young inventor looked out of the wireless shack 
none	none	Down on the beach he saw the little band of castaways 
8176_115047_000002_000002	train-clean-360	They were gathered in a group about mister Jenks who seemed to be talking earnestly to them The two ladies were over near the small building that served as a kitchen 
none	none	More food supplies needed eh mused Tom
8176_115047_000003_000001	train-clean-360	 Well I don t know where any more is to come from 
8176_115047_000003_000002	train-clean-360	We ve stripped the WHIZZER bare He glanced toward what remained of the airship 
none	none	I guess we ll have to go on short rations until help comes and wondering what the group of men could be talking about Tom resumed his clicking out of his wireless message He continued to send it into space for several minutes after ten o clock the hour at which he usually stopped for the morning for he thought there might be a possible chance that the electrical impulses would be picked up by some vessel far out at sea or by some station operator who could send help 
8176_115047_000005_000000	train-clean-360	But there came no answering clicks to the E 
8176_115047_000005_000001	train-clean-360	I station to Earthquake Island and after a little longer working of the key Tom shut down the dynamo and joined the group on the beach 
none	none	I tell you it s our only chance mister Jenks was saying I must get off this island and that s the only way we can do it 
8176_115047_000006_000002	train-clean-360	I have large interests at stake 
none	none	If we wait for a reply to this wireless message we may all be killed though I appreciate that mister Swift is doing his best to aid us But it is hopeless
8176_115047_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you think about it Tom asked mister Damon turning to the young inventor 
8176_115047_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Think about what 
none	none	Why mister Jenks has just proposed that we build a big raft and launch it 
8176_115047_000009_000001	train-clean-360	He thinks we should leave the island 
none	none	It might be a good idea agreed the lad as he thought of the scant food supply Of course I can t say when a reply will be received to my calls for aid and it is best to be prepared Especially as the island may sink any minute added mister Parker If it does even a raft will be little good as it may be swamped in the vortex 
8176_115047_000011_000001	train-clean-360	I think it would be a good plan to make one then anchor it some distance out from the island 
none	none	Then we can make a small raft and paddle out to the big one in a hurry if need be
8176_115047_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes that s a good idea too conceded Tom 
8176_115047_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 And we must stock it well with provisions said mister Damon 
8176_115047_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Put plenty of water and food aboard 
8176_115047_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 We can t spoke Tom quietly 
none	none	Why not
8176_115047_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Because we haven t plenty of provisions 
8176_115047_000016_000001	train-clean-360	That s what I came down to speak about and the lad related what missus Nestor had said 
8176_115047_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Then there is but one thing to do declared mister Fenwick 
8176_115047_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 What asked Captain Mentor 
8176_115047_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 We must go on half rations or quarter rations if need be 
8176_115047_000019_000001	train-clean-360	That will make our supply last longer 
8176_115047_000019_000002	train-clean-360	And another thing we must not let the women folks know 
8176_115047_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Just pretend that we re not hungry but take only a quarter or at most not more than a half of what we have been in the habit of taking 
8176_115047_000019_000004	train-clean-360	There is plenty of water thank goodness and we may be able to live until help comes 
8176_115047_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Then shall we build the raft asked mister Hosbrook 
none	none	It was decided that this would be a good plan and they started it that same day Trees were felled with axes and saws that had been aboard the WHIZZER and bound together in rude fashion with strong trailing vines from the forest 
8176_115047_000021_000002	train-clean-360	A smaller raft as a sort of ferry was also made 
8176_115047_000022_000000	train-clean-360	This occupied them all that day and part of the next 
8176_115047_000022_000001	train-clean-360	In the meanwhile Tom continued to flash out his appeals for help but no answers came 
8176_115047_000022_000002	train-clean-360	The men cut down their rations and when the two ladies joked them on their lack of appetite they said nothing 
8176_115047_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Tom was glad that missus Nestor did not renew her request to him to get out the reserve food supply from what remained in the wreck of the airship 
8176_115047_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Perhaps mister Nestor had hinted to her the real situation 
none	none	The large raft was towed out into a quiet bay of the island and anchored there by means of a heavy rock attached to a rope 
8176_115047_000023_000001	train-clean-360	On board were put cans of water which were lashed fast but no food could be spared to stock the rude craft 
8176_115047_000023_000002	train-clean-360	All the castaways could depend on was to take with them in the event of the island beginning to sink what rations they had left when the final shock should come 
8176_115047_000024_000000	train-clean-360	This done they could only wait and weary was that waiting 
none	none	Tom kept faithfully to his schedule and his ear ached from the constant pressure of the telephone receiver 
8176_115047_000024_000002	train-clean-360	He heard message after message flash through space and click on his instrument but none of them was in answer to his 
8176_115047_000024_000003	train-clean-360	On his face there came a grim and hopeless look 
none	none	One afternoon a week following the erection of the wireless station Mate Fordam came upon a number of turtles 
8176_115047_000025_000001	train-clean-360	He caught some by turning them over on their backs and also located a number of nests of eggs under the warm sands 
none	none	This will be something to eat he said joyfully and indeed the turtles formed a welcome food supply 
8176_115047_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Some fish were caught and some clams were cast up by the tide all of which eked out the scanty food supply that remained 
8176_115047_000026_000002	train-clean-360	The two ladies suspected the truth now and they too cut down their allowance 
8176_115047_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Tom who had been sitting with the men in their sleeping shack that evening rose as the hour of ten approached 
none	none	It was time to send out the last message of the night and then he would lie down on an improvised couch with the telephone receiver clamped to his ear to wait in the silence of the darkness for the message saying that help was on the way
8176_115047_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Well are you off asked mister Damon kindly 
8176_115047_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 I wish some of us could relieve you Tom 
8176_115047_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I don t mind it answered the lad Perhaps the message may come to night 
8176_115047_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Hardly had he spoken than there sounded the ominous rumble and shaking that presaged another earthquake 
8176_115047_000030_000001	train-clean-360	The shack rocked and threatened to come down about their heads 
8176_115047_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 We must be doomed cried mister Parker 
8176_115047_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 The island is about to sink Make for the raft 
8176_115047_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Wait and see how bad it is counseled mister Hosbrook 
8176_115047_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 It may be only a slight shock 
none	none	Indeed as he spoke the trembling of the island ceased and there was silence The two ladies who had retired to their own private shack ran out screaming and mister Anderson and mister Nestor hastened over to be with their wives
8176_115047_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I guess it s passed over spoke mister Fenwick 
8176_115047_000035_000000	train-clean-360	An instant later there came another tremor but it was not like that of an earthquake shock 
8176_115047_000035_000001	train-clean-360	It was more like the rumble and vibration of an approaching train 
8176_115047_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Look cried Tom pointing to the left 
8176_115047_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Their gaze went in that direction and under the light of a full moon they saw sliding into the sea a great portion of one of the rocky hills 
8176_115047_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 A landslide cried Captain Mentor 
8176_115047_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 The island is slowly breaking up 
8176_115047_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 It confirms my theory said mister Parker almost in triumph 
8176_115047_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Forget your theory for a while Parker please begged mister Hosbrook 
none	none	We re lucky to have left a place on which to stand Oh when will we be rescued he asked hopelessly The worst seemed to be over at least for the present and learning that the two ladies were quieted Tom started up the hill to his wireless station mister Damon and mister Fenwick went with him to aid in starting the motor and dynamo Then after the message had been clicked out as usual Tom would begin his weary waiting 
8176_115047_000041_000000	train-clean-360	They found that the earthquake shock had slightly disturbed the apparatus and it took them half an hour to adjust it 
8176_115047_000041_000001	train-clean-360	As there had been a delay on account of the landslide it was eleven o clock before Tom began sending out any flashes and he kept it up until midnight 
8176_115047_000041_000002	train-clean-360	But there came no replies so he shut off the power and prepared to get a little rest 
8176_115047_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 It looks pretty hopeless doesn t it said mister Fenwick as he and mister Damon were on their way back to the sleeping shack 
8176_115047_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes it does 
8176_115047_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Our signal hasn t been seen no ships have passed this way and our wireless appeal isn t answered 
8176_115047_000043_000002	train-clean-360	It does look hopeless but do you know I haven t given up yet 
none	none	Why not
8176_115047_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Because I have faith in Tom Swift s luck declared the eccentric man 
none	none	If you had been with him as much as I have up in the air and under the water and had seen the tight places he has gotten out of you d feel the same too
8176_115047_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps but here there doesn t seem to be anything to do 
none	none	It all depends on some one else That s all right You leave it to Tom 
8176_115047_000047_000002	train-clean-360	He ll get an answer yet you see if he doesn t 
8176_115047_000048_000000	train-clean-360	It was an hour past midnight 
none	none	Tom tossed uneasily on the hard bed in the wireless shack 
8176_115047_000048_000002	train-clean-360	The telephone receiver on his ear hurt him and he could not sleep 
none	none	I may as well sit up for a while he told himself and he arose In the dimness of the shack he could see the outlines of the dynamo and the motor
8176_115047_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Guess I ll start her up and send out some calls he murmured 
8176_115047_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 I might just happen to catch some ship operator who is up late 
none	none	I ll try it The young inventor started the motor and soon the dynamo was purring away 
8176_115047_000051_000001	train-clean-360	He tested the wireless apparatus 
8176_115047_000051_000002	train-clean-360	It shot out great long sparks which snapped viciously through the air 
8176_115047_000051_000003	train-clean-360	Then in the silence of the night Tom clicked off his call for help for the castaways of Earthquake Island 
8176_115047_000052_000000	train-clean-360	For half an hour he sent it away into space none of the others in their shacks below him awakening 
none	none	Then Tom having worked off his restless fit was about to return to bed 
8176_115047_000053_000000	train-clean-360	But what was this 
none	none	What was that clicking in the telephone receiver at his ear 
8176_115047_000053_000002	train-clean-360	He listened 
8176_115047_000076_000001	train-clean-360	He listened 
8176_115047_000053_000003	train-clean-360	It was not a jumble of dots and dashes conveying through space a message that meant nothing to him 
none	none	No It was his own call that was answered 
8176_115047_000053_000006	train-clean-360	The call of his station E I Earthquake Island 
none	none	WHERE ARE YOU 
8176_115047_000054_000001	train-clean-360	WHAT S WANTED 
none	none	That was the message that was clicked to Tom from somewhere in the great void
8176_115047_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 I GET YOUR MESSAGE E 
none	none	I WHAT S WANTED 
8176_115047_000056_000002	train-clean-360	DO I HEAR YOU RIGHT REPEAT Tom heard those questions in the silence of the night 
8176_115047_000057_000000	train-clean-360	With trembling fingers Tom pressed his own key 
8176_115047_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Out into the darkness went his call for help 
8176_115047_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 WE ARE ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND He gave the longitude and latitude COME QUICKLY OR WE WILL BE ENGULFED IN THE SEA 
none	none	WE ARE CASTAWAYS FROM THE YACHT RESOLUTE AND THE AIRSHIP WHIZZER CAN YOU SAVE US 
8176_115047_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Came then this query 
8176_115047_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 WHAT S THAT ABOUT AIRSHIP 
8176_115047_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 NEVER MIND AIRSHIP clicked Tom 
8176_115047_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 SEND HELP QUICKLY 
none	none	WHO ARE YOU The answer flashed to him through space STEAMSHIP CAMBARANIAN FROM RIO DE JANEIRO TO NEW YORK 
8176_115047_000063_000001	train-clean-360	JUST CAUGHT YOUR MESSAGE 
8176_115047_000063_000002	train-clean-360	THOUGHT IT A FAKE 
8176_115047_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 NO FAKE Tom sent back 
none	none	HELP US QUICKLY 
8176_115047_000064_000002	train-clean-360	HOW SOON CAN YOU COME 
none	none	There was a wait and the wireless operator clicked to Tom that he had called the captain 
8176_115047_000065_000001	train-clean-360	Then came the report 
none	none	WE WILL BE THERE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS KEEP IN COMMUNICATION WITH US YOU BET I WILL flashed back Tom his heart beating joyously and then he let out a great shout We are saved We are saved My wireless message is answered A steamer is on her way to rescue us 
8176_115047_000068_000000	train-clean-360	He rushed from the shack calling to the others 
8176_115047_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 What s that demanded mister Hosbrook 
8176_115047_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Tom briefly told of how the message had come to him in the night 
8176_115047_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell them to hurry begged the rich yacht owner 
8176_115047_000071_000001	train-clean-360	 Say that I will give twenty thousand dollars reward if we are taken off 
none	none	And I ll do the same cried mister Jenks
8176_115047_000072_000001	train-clean-360	 I must get to the place where 
8176_115047_000072_000002	train-clean-360	Then he seemed to recollect himself and stopped suddenly Tell them to hurry he begged Tom 
8176_115047_000072_000003	train-clean-360	The whole crowd of castaways save the women were gathered about the wireless shack 
none	none	They ll need to hurry spoke mister Parker the gloomy scientist The island may sink before morning mister Hosbrook and the others glared at him but he seemed to take delight in his prediction 
8176_115047_000075_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly the wireless instruments hummed 
8176_115047_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Another message whispered Tom 
none	none	He listened THE CAMBARANIAN WILL RUSH HERE WITH ALL SPEED he announced and not a heart there on that lonely and desolate island but sent up a prayer of thankfulness CHAPTER XXIV WE ARE LOST There was little more sleep for any one that night They sat up talking over the wonderful and unexpected outcome of Tom Swift s wireless message and speculating as to when the steamer would get there Bless my pocket comb But I told you it would come out all right if we left it to Tom declared mister Damon But it hasn t come out yet remarked the pessimistic scientist The steamer may arrive too late You re a cheerful sort of fellow to take on a yachting trip murmured mister Hosbrook sarcastically I ll never invite you again even if you are a great scientist I m going to sit and watch for the steamer declared mister Damon as he went outside the shack The night was warm and there was a full moon Which way will she come from Tom I don t know but I should think that if she was on her way north from South America she d pass on the side of the island on which we now are That s right agreed Captain Mentor She ll come up from over there and he pointed across the ocean directly in front of the shacks and camp Then I m going to see if I can t be the first to sight her lights declared mister Damon She can t possibly get here inside of a day according to what the operator said declared Tom Wire them to put on all the speed they can urged the eccentric man No don t waste any more power or energy than is needed suggested mister Hosbrook You may need the gasolene before we are rescued They are on their way and that is enough for now The others agreed with this and so Tom after a final message to the operator aboard the CAMBARANIAN stating that he would call him up in the morning shut down the motor mister Damon took up his position where he could see far out over the ocean but as the young inventor had said there was no possible chance of sighting the relief steamer inside of a day Still the nervous eccentric man declared that he would keep watch Morning came and castaways brought to breakfast a better appetite than they had had in some time They were allowed larger rations too for it was seen that they would have just enough food to last until taken off We didn t need to have made the big raft said mister Fenwick as Tom came down from his station to report that he had been in communication with the Camabarian and that she was proceeding under forced draught We ll not have to embark on it and I m glad of it Oh we may need it yet asserted mister Parker I have been making some observations just now and the island is in a very precarious state It is I believe resting on only a slim foundation and the least shock may break that off and send it into the sea That is what my observations point out Then I wish you wouldn t make any more observations exclaimed missus Nestor with spirit You make me nervous And me also added missus Anderson Science can not deceive madam retorted mister Parker Well it can keep quiet about what it knows and not make a person have cold chills replied Mary s mother I m sure we will be rescued in time There was a slight tremor of an earthquake as they were eating dinner that day but aside from causing a little alarm it did no damage In the afternoon Tom again called up the approaching steamer and was informed that because of a slight accident it could not arrive until the next morning Every effort would be made to keep up speed it was said There was much disappointment over this and mister Damon was observed to be closely examining the food supply but hope was too strong to be easily shattered now mister Parker went off alone to make some further observations as he called them but mister Hosbrook warned him never again to speak of his alarming theories mister Barcoe Jenks called Tom aside just before supper that evening I haven t forgotten what I said to you about my diamonds he remarked with many nods and winks I ll show you how to make them if you will help me Did you ever see diamonds made No and I guess very few persons have replied the lad thinking perhaps mister Jenks might not be quite right mentally The night passed without alarm and in the morning at the first blush of dawn every one was astir looking eagerly across the sea for a sight of the steamer Tom had just come down from the wireless station having received a message to the effect that a few hours more would bring the CAMBARANIAN within sight of the island Suddenly there was a tremendous shock as if some great cannon had been fired and the whole island shook to its very centre Another earthquake The worst yet screamed missus Anderson We are lost cried missus Nestor clinging to her husband An instant later they were all thrown down by the tremor of the earth and Tom looking toward his wireless station saw nearly half of the island disappear from sight His station went down in collapse with it splashing into the ocean and the wave that followed the terrible crash washed nearly to the castaways as they rose and kneeled on the sand The island is sinking cried mister Parker Make for the raft I guess it s our only chance murmured Captain Mentor as he gazed across the water There was no steamer in sight Could it arrive on time The tremors and shaking of the island continued CHAPTER XXV THE RESCUE CONCLUSION Down to where the small raft was moored ran mister Parker He was followed by some of the others We must put off at once he cried Half the island is gone The other half may disappear any moment The steamer can not get here on time but if we put off they may pick us up if we are not engulfed in the ocean Help everybody Tom gave one more look at where his wireless station had been It had totally disappeared there being at the spot now but a sheer cliff which went right down into the sea The women were in tears The men with pale faces tried to calm them Gradually the earthquake tremor passed away but who could tell when another would come Captain Mentor mister Hosbrook and the others were shoving out the small raft They intended to get aboard and paddle out to the larger one which had been moored some distance away in readiness for some such emergency as this Come on cried mister Fenwick to Tom who was lingering behind Come on ladies We must all get aboard or it may be too late The small raft was afloat missus Anderson and missus Nestor weeping hysterically waded out through the water to get aboard Have we food cried mister Damon Bless my kitchen range but I nearly forgot that There isn t any food left to take answered missus Anderson Shove off cried Captain Mentor At that instant a haze which had hung over the water was blown to one side The horizon suddenly cleared Tom Swift looked up and gave a cry The steamer The steamer The CAMBARANIAN he shouted pointing to it The others joined in his exclamations of joy for there rushing toward Earthquake Island was a great steamer crowding on all speed Saved Saved cried missus Nestor sinking to her knees even in the water It came just in time murmured mister Hosbrook Now I can make my diamonds whispered mister Jenks to Tom Push off Push off cried mister Parker The island will sink soon I think we will be safer on the island than on the raft declared Captain Mentor We had better land again They left the little raft and stood on the shore of the island Eagerly they watched the approach of the steamer They could make out hands and handkerchiefs waving to them now There was eager hope in every heart Suddenly some distance out in the water and near where the big raft was anchored there was a curious upheaval of the ocean It was as if a submarine mine had exploded The sea swirled and foamed It s a good thing we didn t go out there observed Captain Mentor We would have been swamped sure as guns Almost as he spoke the big raft was tossed high into the air and fell back breaking up The castaways shuddered Yet were they any safer on the island They fancied they could feel the little part of it that remained trembling under their feet The steamer is stopping cried mister Damon Surely enough the CAMBARANIAN had slowed up Was she not going to complete the rescue she had begun She s going to launch her lifeboats declared Captain Mentor Her commander dare not approach too close not knowing the water He might hit on a rock A moment later and two lifeboats were lowered and urged on by the sturdy arms of the sailors they bounded over the waves The sea seemed to be more and more agitated It is the beginning of the end murmured mister Parker The island will soon disappear Will you be quiet demanded mister Damon giving the scientist a nudge in the ribs The lifeboats were close at hand now Are you all there shouted some one evidently in command All here answered Tom Then hurry aboard There seems to be something going on in these waters perhaps a submarine volcano eruption We must get away in a hurry The boats came in to the shelving beach There was a little stretch of water between them and the sand Through this the castaways waded and soon they were grasped by the sailors and helped in In the reaction of their worriment missus Anderson and missus Nestor were both weeping but their tears were those of joy Give way now men cried the mate in charge of the boats We must get back to the ship The sea was now swirling angrily but the sailors who had been in worse turmoils than this rowed on steadily We feared you would not get here in time said Tom to the mate We were under forced draught most of the way was his answer Your wireless message came just in time An hour later and our operator would have gone to bed The young inventor realized by what a narrow margin they had been rescued The island will soon sink predicted mister Parker as they reached the steamer and boarded her Captain Valasquez who was in command warmly welcomed the castaways We will hear your story later he said Just now I want to get out of these dangerous waters He gave the order for full speed and as the CAMBARANIAN got under way Tom and the others standing on the deck looked back at Earthquake Island Suddenly there sounded a dull rumbling report The whole ocean about the island seemed to upheave There was a gigantic shower of spray a sound like an explosion and when the waters subsided the island had sunk from sight I told you it would go cried mister Parker triumphantly but the horror of it all the horror of the fate that would have been theirs had they remained there an hour longer held the castaways dumb The scientist s honor of having correctly predicted the destruction of the island was an empty one The agitation of the sea rocked even the mighty CAMBARANIAN and had our friends been aboard the frail raft they would surely have perished in the sea As it was they were safe saved by Tom Swift s wireless message The steamer resumed her voyage and the castaways told their story Captain Valasquez refused to receive the large amount of money mister Hasbrook and mister Jenks would have paid him for the rescue accepting only a sum he figured that he had lost by the delay which was not a great deal The castaways were given the best aboard the ship and their stories were listened to by the other passengers with bated breath In due time they were landed in New York and mister and missus Nestor accompanied Tom to Shopton mister Damon with many blessings also accompanied them going to his home in Waterfield Later it was learned that the other boats from the RESOLUTE had been picked up and the sailors and guests were all saved Of course as soon as our friends had been rescued by the steamer the wireless operator aboard her with whom Tom soon struck up an acquaintance sent messages to the relatives of the castaways apprising them of their safety And the joy of Mary Nestor when she found that it was Tom who had saved her parents can well be imagined As for our hero well he was glad too for Mary s sake I won t forget my promise to you Tom Swift said mister Barcoe Jenks as he parted from the young inventor and what the promise was will be told in the next volume of this series to be called Tom Swift Among the Diamond Makers or The Secret of Phantom Mountain In that Tom is destined to have many more surprising adventures as is also mister Damon who learned new ways to call down blessings on himself and his possessions And now for a time we will take leave of the young inventor and also of his many friends who never ceased to wonder over Tom Swift s skill with the wireless THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Tom Swift and his Wireless Message by Victor Appleton END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOM SWIFT AND HIS WIRELESS MESSAGE This file should be
