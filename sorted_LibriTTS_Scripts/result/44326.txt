none	none	it is to feel that way in your life Oh I m too busy for such nonsense returned Gloria in her serene and caressing voice Indeed it would be difficult for any one favored with Miss Gloria Greene s acquaintance to imagine her wishing to depart a life to the enjoyment of which she has vastly added for thousands of people For under a slightly different name Miss Greene is known to and admired by most of the theater going populace of the United States From the top of her ruddy imperiously poised head to the tip of her perfectly shod toes she justifies and fulfills in every line and motion the happy thought which inspired the dean of American playwrights to nickname her Gloria Deeper than her beauty and abounding vitality there lies a more profound quality the rare gift of giving graciously and naturally It is Gloria Greene s unconscious and intuitive mission in life to lend color and light and cheer to colorless dim and forlorn folk wherever she encounters them That is why Darcy Cole was at the moment dribbling tears and aspirations for an immediate demise all over Gloria s rare Anatolian rug Not that Darcy really desired to die She merely wished Gloria Greene to make life more practicable for her That s imagination you know continued the actress It isn t snivelled Darcy Then it s indigestion Have a pill I won t declined the

none	none	a handicap admitted her hostess But Darcy s pretty enough anyway It s the only pretty thing about me Oh Gloria burst out the girl in a sudden flood tide of self revelation if you knew how I long to be pretty Not beautiful like you I wouldn t ask as much as that But just pretty enough to be noticed once in a while Illustration If you knew how I long to be pretty twenty eight Why Darcy dear No let me talk Darcy proceeded in little jerky gasps of eagerness Pretty And well dressed And up to date And smart And everything I d sell my soul to the devil if he d buy such a weakly puny piffling little soul just really to live and be something besides a thoroughly nice girl for one short year A thoroughly nice girl Yah said Miss Cole in a manner which whatever else it might have been was not thoroughly nice That s a rotten thing to say about any one agreed the sympathetic Gloria Who calls you that The girls You know the way they say it Well no wonder Look at me she cried in passionate conclusion to her passionate outburst Gloria looked at her She beheld an ungirlish frump of a thing with a lank but bulgy figure misclothed in woefully inappropriate garments a muddy complexion a sagging mouth a drooping chin a mass of deranged hair and big deep gray lusterless eyes which implored her The older woman considered and marveled My dear child she said gently are you sure it isn t some man I don t care a darn for any man in the world returned the other with convincing promptitude It isn t that It s just that I m not I don t Her courage seemed to ebb out but she gained command of herself and continued plaintively All I want is to be in the game as other girls play it to have a little attention and maybe a box of candy or some flowers once in a while not to have men look past me like a tree It isn t much to ask is it If you knew how tired I am of being just plain nobody There s a a somebody inside here she thumped her narrow ribby chest but I can t get it out Rising lumpily to her feet she stretched out hands of piteous and grotesque appeal Please Gloria she prayed in a dwindling and saintly voice I want to raise just a little teeny bit of hell before I die A flash of sympathy and comprehension from the actress s intent face answered this noble aspiration Why you re real aren t you she exclaimed Did you think I wasn t even that returned the other reproachfully Not so many people are It s something anyway Are you going to be honest as well How honest With me Are you going to be frank Of course Then tell me what started you on this A dismal sort of muddy flush overspread the girl s features Silently she drew from her pocket a full page drawing from Life which she unfolded and handed to the other She laid a finger on the central figure That s Darcy said she Is it Gloria studied the illustration interestedly Who drew it Holcomb Lee That scrawl in the corner means Lee does it Is it drawn from life Yes What does Maud say to your sitting as model for her young man Maud laughed said Darcy between her teeth Pussy pussy commented Miss Greene That decided you to keep on I suppose Naturally Well the result justifies you D you think it s pretty I most certainly do And don t you think it looks just the least lee eetle bit like me pursued Darcy shyly Gloria scrutinized the drawing again and then the wistful face before her With growing astonishment she realized the fundamental likeness More than that said she That young man knows how to see with his eyes It was his own notion said the girl in a rush of words One night I was sitting at the piano He said there were lines in my face that he wanted He asked me if I d sit for him once Then he had me come back again and again I didn t mind I I liked it It was the first time any one had ever seen anything to admire about me since I was a child Oh and one day he said Miss Darcy you must have been a beautiful child Were you asked Gloria From another pocket Darcy took a small photograph holder Exhibit B she said passing it to the other It showed the head and shoulders of an eleven year old girl It s charming said Gloria and meant it That s the way I ought to look now only more so Holcomb said He said I was a spoilt job Pig Oh no He didn t mean it that way He just blurted it out as if he was sorry about it He seemed to think that I was a waste of good material and and he was quite peeved about it and kept swearing under his breath while he was drawing me There I m with him declared Gloria vigorously I hate waste It s in my Yankee blood I suppose And a wasted human being that s a sort of practical blasphemy according to my religion Darcy caught the inference Made in the image she said quickly But what am I made in the image of What happened to change you from this Gloria held up Exhibit B Well I had an illness when I was thirteen And about then we lost our money And my parents died a little while after And I never seemed to get back much life or spirit or ambition or digestion or anything Can t get hold of your own boot straps queried the other suggestingly Haven t got the lifting power if I did answered the girl She picked nervously at her raveled and seedy sleeve Lee said he believed I could look like that the way he made me look in the picture you know if only some one who knew could tell me how to go about it D you think maybe p raps it might be just partly possible Once more Gloria compared Exhibit A with Exhibit B and then both with the original I do she pronounced with fitting solemnity Oh h h h breathed Darcy in a long drawn ecstatic sigh At least partly possible It s worth the trial in any case Darcy said Miss Greene incisively I m going to take you in hand myself Oh Gloria If you would I ll love you forever for it You won t On the contrary you ll probably hate me poisonously before it s half over For helping me to be something and look like something protested the girl incredulously How could I be anything but the most grateful Wait and see interrupted the oracle We re going to begin our little magic process right now Presto pass You re a lay figure A what faltered Darcy A lay figure Act accordingly What does a lay figure do please It

none	none	s dead It s dumb Don t talk You distract my mind For several minutes she walked around the girl debating her from every angle with pitiless impersonality and with the analytical eye of the adept in a school wherein attractiveness is often a personal and technical achievement At the conclusion of this ordeal Darcy found herself perched upon a high backed seat while the actress expertly daubed her face with make up from a box kept for purposes of experimentation Next the subject s hair was arranged and her figure draped in the flowing lines of some shimmering fabric chosen after much profound consideration on Gloria s part from a carved chest She was then told to straighten her spine and smile Near her lay Gloria s hand mirror Before the proprietor could interfere the girl picked it up and sat staring into it Well and what do you think of yourself queried her mentor grimly I I look like a bad joke whimpered Darcy You do But if you cry I ll set you out on the fire escape just as you are for the neighbors to throw things at I m n n n not c c crying And don t grab next time Well conditioned lay figures never do Sit up You re all caved in again With strong hands she prodded bent and moulded the girl s yielding figure to the desired posture Finally she wheeled into position several yards away a full length glass and turned on an overhead light Now Look in here Looking Darcy gave a little gasp of wonder and delight Under the modulated radiance and with the toning down of distance the harsh turgid spots and lines of the make up had blended into a harmonious ensemble The face was that of Holcomb Lee s picture almost Oh cried Darcy hoarsely Could you ever make me like that No Darcy collapsed I might have known she wailed What do you expect for a nickel in these days of depreciated currency inquired Gloria callously It isn t as simple as it looks But if you can t do it for me I certainly can t my dear Then why did you let me But if I can t perhaps some one else can Who You Me You your own little lone self and no one else in the whole big round world declared the actress with electrifying vigor Thou art the woman What must I do How do I do it What do I need cried Darcy in a breath Grit Is that all All No it isn t all It s just a beginning But if you think it s an easy one you don t know what the word means yet Pooh retorted Darcy with another glance at the magic glass I d cheerfully stand still and be stuck full of red hot pins and needles if it would make me look like that I ll furnish the grit she added confidently if you ll show me how to do the rest There came a gleam into her mentor s eye that the girl missed Very well said Gloria Allowing that let s make a start Of all your little ambitions which one would you like to have fulfilled first The girl pondered Dress she decided presently I want to have beautiful thrilling clothes like a princess The one princess of my acquaintance observed Gloria looks as though she dressed herself backwards out of a mail order catalogue But that s beside the question Clothes cost money How much money have you got Darcy clasped her hands I m rich she announced triumphantly How rich Awfully rich Two thousand big round hard beautiful dollars Isn t that grand I don t know that it s grand But it s good with care It s twice as much as I ve ever made in a whole year of work on my silly little wall paper designs Darcy directed a resentful look at the imitation leather roll lying in the corner where she had kicked it Where did you get it My blessed old Aunt Sarah wrote it to me Wrote it Wrote you two thousand dollars Yes Why not She d intended to leave it to me when she died But she doesn t feel like dying for a long time yet so she wrote and said that she preferred giving it and getting thanked because it was so much rather than willing it and getting roasted because it was so little Sensible auntie Are you going to be sensible too How Put the money in the bank And forget this experiment Darcy stretched out desperate hands toward the big blessed mirror And give up that Me Perhaps you never could be that It s only a chance at best But it is a chance You said it was a chance yourself Yes but And now are you going to take that away from me Gloria s eyes were doubtful Is it worth two thousand big round hard beautiful dollars Just the bare chance of it Two million declared Darcy with impassioned conviction Then you re determined to be a fool about this I am Suddenly Gloria seized and hugged her If you weren t I d disown you as a recreant to our sex she cried Then you re going to help me To the bitter end First let s take an inventory Be a lay figure again The girl stiffened to attention Gloria ticked off the points on her fingers as she talked You ve got several assets First you re a lady Nothing to teach there and it s the hardest of all lessons Second you ve got a really charming voice if you didn t whine with it Third your hair is nice But it might as well be stuffing a pillow for all the good you get of it Fourth you ve got eyes that d be dangerous if the whites weren t yellow If you d try wearing your heart in em instead of your liver they d do very well Fifth the lines of the face see Life Sixth you look as if you were built to be light and strong I rather like being a dummy purred Darcy Wait The other side of the ledger is coming You re going to have a bad five minutes Stand up Darcy obeyed Like a camel dispassionately commented the actress Look in the glass now she ordered Darcy looked How d you like it demanded her instructor N not as well I should think likely You lop I I can t help it Nonsense You slump Darcy s lips slackened petulantly down at the corners Like a flash Gloria transfixed the offending mouth with two leveled fingers You peeve she accused Darcy continued to peeve Also she sniffled Your chin is flabby pursued the inexorable critic Your mouth is fishy Your eyes are bleary Your skin is muddy You walk like a duck and you stand like a bag And if you cry I ll quit you here now and forever With a mighty struggle Darcy choked back her emotions I suppose the Lord gave me my face she defended herself sulkily Don t libel your Maker The Lord gave you a face See Exhibit B I can t help it if Of course you could have helped it What you ve done to your face is a crime Darcy Cole You ought to be arrested Not to mention what you ve done to your figure I shouldn t be surprised she added as the doorbell rang if that were the police now come to hale you away to judgment Sit still she commanded as Darcy suddenly conscious of her exotic costume looked about for a way of escape The door opened not to the police but to a visitor who was presented to the shrinking Miss Cole as mister Thomas Harmon mister Harmon displayed himself as a stocky man with very cheerful bright brown eyes reassuringly deferential manners and a curious effect of carrying his sturdy frame as if it weighed nothing at all Darcy mentally observed that he looked as fit in his way as did Gloria in hers Already she was beginning to take note of physical condition Have I interrupted a rehearsal asked mister Harmon No said Gloria That is yes That s a fair choice remarked mister Harmon magnanimously I ll take yes Am I right Miss Cole It doesn t matter We d finished murmured Darcy confusedly I ve promised mister Harmon Gloria explained turning to her to help him choose an anniversary present for his sister It won t take more than an hour Amuse yourself until I come back On the stairway outside Gloria intent upon her new purpose addressed her companion Tom what do you think of her Of whom Little Darcy Cole Oh vaguely I don t know Gloria sighed Why the effect of hopelessness inquired Tom Harmon Oh nothing Only you don t seem to use your eyes much I was using them to the best of purposes declared mister Harmon indignantly Considering that I haven t set them on you for nearly a month you can t expect me to waste time on casual flappers in fancy dress costumes Be fair Gloria Darcy isn t a casual flapper What is she then A coming genius A reigning beauty and heart wrecker of the future Good Lord said mister Harmon with such fervor that Gloria sighed again Couldn t you see anything in her Tom she asked appealingly Only the humpy way she wore that costume and the fact that she d apparently been crying answered mister Harmon who despite Gloria s strictures was a person not devoid of discernment She seemed rather a mess to me What s the idea Gloria Anything I can help in Gloria smiled It s like you to want to help But this is my job And she added to herself it s going to be a real one CHAPTER II LIGHT and vitality died out of the atmosphere for Darcy with Gloria s exit Divesting herself of the trappings of glory and hope and promise she resumed her workaday garb The long mirror endued with a sardonic personality watched her with silent but pregnant commentary She did not wish to look into it But her will was weak Hypnotic effluences pouring from the shining surface enveloped and drew her She walked before it and surveyed herself The effect was worse by contrast than she could have imagined Oh you frump she whispered savagely You frazzled botch of a frump Glowing ambition faded to dull and hopeless mockery in her disillusioned soul She made a bitter grimace at the changeling in the glass Imbecile said she It was a surrender to grim facts Suddenly she felt extremely languid The big couch in the peaceful curtained alcove lured her She plumped into it higgledy piggledy and curled up an unsightly humpful excrescence upon its suave surface Within two minutes worn out by stress of unaccustomed emotions she was winging her airy way through that realm of sleep wherein happiness is the sure prize of being and beauty is forever in the eye of the self beholder Dream music crept into her dreams Clearer and richer it grew until it filled the dreams so full that they burst wide open The dreamer floated out through the cleft to a realization of the fact that somebody beyond the draperies which secreted her was piping like Pan s very self to an accompaniment of strange lulling minor chords She peeped out A tall slender young man in clothes which seemed to Darcy s still sleep enchanted eyes to fit him with a perfection beyond artistry sat at the piano humming in a melodious undertone a song of which he had apparently forgotten the words One passage seemed to puzzle him He repeated the melody several times essaying various harmonies to go with it shook his head discontentedly and dashed away into Gilbert and Sullivan In the midst of this the door opened Gloria stood on the threshold A look of pleasure flashed over her face as she saw the player A dozen light soft footed steps carried her to him She clasped her hands over his eyes let them slip to his shoulders planted a swift little kiss on the top of his head and stepped back Jack she cried The man swung around leaped to his feet caught her by both hands and exclaimed Well Gloria It s a treat to see you I d begun to think you were never coming back Where do you hail from Oh all over the map But no place as good as this He smiled down at her still holding her hands To a keen thin sensitive face with a mobile mouth and quiet eyes the smile set the final impression of charm Instanter and before he had spoken ten words Darcy decided that he was the one man she had ever seen worthy of Gloria Greene And she was glad they had found each other But where s Darcy asked the hostess looking about Who asked her visitor A little acquaintance whom I left here when I went out The concealed girl sat up Here I am she announced shyly I fell asleep Oh then I m afraid I waked you up with my silly hammering said the man N no It doesn t matter I didn t mind I I mean I liked it stammered the girl falling into her usual acutely zero feeling in the presence of the masculine gender Then go and play it again Jack commanded Miss Greene while I get off my things And then go away You can come back for dinner Miss Cole and I have important things to talk over Oh no Please I can come some other time protested Darcy in a flutter of embarrassment I don t want to drive mister mister him away mister Jacob Remsen has all the time in the world said Gloria calmly Time is the least of his troubles He kills it at sight Don t mind her Miss Corey put in Remsen Darcy noting the error in her name wondered petulantly why Gloria didn t introduce them in proper form But her uneasiness and gaucherie presently dissipated before the cordial and winning simplicity of Gloria s man And to her own surprise she found herself volunteering a harmonic solution of the difficult change where he had blundered over the transition and humming the melody while she played her version He accepted it with enthusiasm Sing it he urged I like your voice what little you let us hear of it Instantly Darcy stiffened up inside and stammered a refusal She didn t mean to be ungracious to this sunny and inspiriting young fellow It was just her unhappy consciousness of a cramped and graceless self Remsen took it with matter of fact good humor I m sure you do sing though he called back as his hostess finally evicted him I m going to send you that song But he didn t look at her she noticed as he said it Why should he indeed when Gloria was in the room For that matter men never looked at Darcy And here was her grievance against the scheme of things exemplified anew There it is she complained waving an awkward arm toward the door through which mister Jacob Remsen had vanished That s what I ve been trying to tell you about Jack puzzled her hostess Why what s wrong with Jack Oh nothing replied the girl wearily But did you notice what he did when he left Offered to send you some music I thought it was quite polite Jack s always courteous Oh courteous He didn t even look at me Well why That s it Why Why should any man look at me They don t They they re strictly neutral in their attitude And women are well just tolerant and friendly Darcy s such a nice girl Where does that get you fiercely demanded the subject of it People don t really know I m alive I might as well be a ghost I wish I were At least I d scare em Don t try to scare me returned the other Now list to the voice of wisdom You complain that people don t know you re alive Why should they You don t give out anything warmth color personality I m not so sure you are alive You re inert I haven t anything to give mourned the accused Why Because you ve wasted it You ve had beauty good looks anyway You have let that die down to nothing One thing only you ve kept up and that ought to be an asset You ve got a voice Do you ever use it for other people I don t like to sing before people There you are Always thinking of your little self You give nothing to the world yet you think yourself ill used because What does the world give me broke in the aggrieved Darcy Nothing for nothing What would you expect Do you think it s going to smile at you when you scowl at it and stop its own business and gaze on you adoringly and say Much obliged to you for being alive It isn t that kind of a world Miss Amanda Darcy Cole The owner of the despised first name winced I never thought of that she murmured Thinking is going to be part of your education from now on You can t begin too soon I m ready said the girl meekly Do you want me to begin with my voice Shall I take singing lessons Oh it s got to go a lot deeper than that was Gloria s grim reply You ll begin by taking living lessons Do you know what that means I m not sure I do It sounds awfully hard faltered the other It is Go home and think it over Come back here

none	none	at this time and get your orders Yessum said Darcy folding her hands with assumed docility Gloria regarded her with suspicion It isn t going to be any joke said she with severity No m assented Darcy with a still more lamblike expression But her eyes twinkled through it Oh well if you want to take it that way observed the actress But I d advise you to save your high spirits for the time when they ll be needed In the seclusion of the hallway Darcy drew out Exhibit A and sought inspiration from the charming face which Holcomb Lee had surrounded with gallant and admiring suitors in the illustration If it can be done said Darcy to the picture with the solemnity of a rite I ll do it CHAPTER III AT its best the old Remsen house on West Twelfth Street wore its ancestral respectability cloaked with gloom Home though it was to Jacob of that name and possession he regarded it with distinct distaste as he approached the dull brown steps leading to the massive door All that could reasonably be done to furbish it up against the young master s return old Connor Jacob s inherited man had faithfully attempted the house s face was at least washed and its linen so to speak fresh and clean But a home long unused becomes musty to a sense deeper than the physical Entering young mister Remsen felt a chill descend upon his blithe spirit A basso profondo clock within struck a hollow five Hark from the tomb observed young mister Remsen I think I ll move to the club Slow footsteps sounding from below dissipated that intention No I can t do that I ve got to stay here and be looked after by old Connor or forever wound his feelings That s the worst of family responsibilities The footsteps mounted the basement stairs unevenly and with a suggestion of a stagger in them What Connor taken to drink thought Jacob with sinful amusement Wonder where he found it There is hope still The old servitor puffed into sight half carrying half dragging a huge clothes basket

Having like some thousands of other young Americans departed from his native land and normal routine of life for a long period on important business of a muddy sanguinary and profoundly wearisome nature concerning which he had but the one wish namely to forget the whole ugly but necessary affair as swiftly and comprehensively as possible mister Jacob Remsen had deemed it wise to cut loose from home considerations as far as feasible but he now reflected that he had perhaps made a mistake in having no mail forwarded Well there was nothing for it but to make up for arrears He took off his coat and plunged in The immediate special he set aside to teach it as he stated to the acquiescent Connor not to be so infernally assertive and insistent while he ran through a few scores of communications mainly devoted to inviting him to dinners and dances which had passed into the shades anywhere from a year to eighteen months previously Now I ll attend to you said he severely to the special Only don t brag about your superior importance next time He opened it and glanced at the heading Connor said he this is from mister Bentley Yes mister Jacob He says it is necessary for him to see me without delay Yes sir Do you believe Connor that it is really as necessary as he pretends for mister Bentley to see me without delay mister Bentley is your lawyer sir pointed out Connor firmly If he says so sir I think it would be so You re wrong Connor you re wrong This letter is dated just seven weeks ago As I haven t seen mister Bentley yet and am still in good health and spirits it can t have been vitally necessary that he see me without delay can it Necessity knows no law Connor and law knows no necessity that can t wait seven weeks mister Bentley has been telephoning sir almost every day Has he Why didn t you tell me I tried to inform you about several telephone messages mister Jacob So you did when you met me at the pier And you told me if the telephone annoyed me to have it taken out sir Right right perfectly right Did you have it taken out No sir Then it doesn t annoy you No mister Jacob What a blessing is philosophic calm I ll take pattern by you and learn not to let it annoy me either That s it ringing now Let it ring Are my dinner clothes laid out Yes sir And beg pardon sir I think that s the doorbell not the phone It ll be mister Bentley I took the liberty of phoning him sir that you d be here in time to dress for dinner His blood be on your head Let him in Connor mister Herbert Bentley of Bench Bentley a huge puffy man of fifty rolled into the room shook hands warmly with Remsen went through the usual preliminary queries as to health recent experience and time of return and then attacked the matter in hand How s your family pride Jacob Languid It s likely to be stirred up a bit Some of us been distinguishing ourselves Not specially But your cousins are threatening a will contest If they want to pry me loose from this grisly mausoleum observed Jacob with an illustrative wave of the hand around the gloomful drawing room I ll listen to terms Nothing of that sort The house is yours as long as you fulfill the terms of your grandfather s will Then what s the contest to me Let my amiable cousins choke themselves and each other with law It s a question of your Great Uncle Simeon s estate They want you as a witness For what To prove the old boy s insanity Who says he was insane They do Wasn t he Well he was eccentric in some particulars admitted Jacob cautiously As for instance Let me think Whenever there was a long drought he used to claim that he was a tree toad and he d climb the ancestral elm up at the Westchester place and squawk for rain Eccentric as you say Anything else He had the largest collection of tin can labels in Westchester County At least he boasted that it was the largest and I never heard any one dispute it What did he do with em Same as any kind of a collecting bug does with his collection nothing I see Is that all Everything I can recall except that every May Day he used to put on a high hat and a pink sash and dance around a Maypole in Central Park As he didn t care whose Maypole it happened to be he usually got arrested I see And the rest of the family did they show any symptoms Nothing special What do you mean special Come out with it Of course there was my poor old maiden aunt Miss Melinda You ve heard of her Only as a name She did her best to change that When she was fifty four she eloped with the coachman Only they couldn t get any one to marry em so she had to come home What was wrong Was the coachman married already No But he was a trifle colored Interesting line of relatives you carry What about the remainder of the tribe Just about the usual run of old families I guess One of the other aunts used to do a little in the anonymous letter line and break up happy families Then of course Cousin Fred used to pull some fairly interesting stuff when he had the d t s but the claim that Uncle Simeon s first wife dressed up as the Van Cortland Manor ghost isn t Enough said I didn t ask for a new edition of the Chronique Scandaleuse How would you like to tell all this to the court and through it to the newspapers I ll see em d d first All very well But if they put you on the stand you ll have to tell or go to jail And they ll put you on for you re their one best bet With you they can win and without you they can t Then they lose I ll skip the country rather than rake up all that dead and decayed stuff How about your grandfather s will under which you inherit this house and most of your fortune Have you forgotten that you re required to inhabit the house from now on at least three months out of every six until you re married So I have Happy alternative Lose the house or parade the family skeletons all diked out in pink sashes and tin can labels When does the blasted suit come on I don t know When I do I ll let you know Then it s up to you either to stand a siege in the house or to light out and go into hiding and take a chance on getting back within the three months Well Connor said Jacob Remsen after the lawyer had left here s a complication for a peace and quiet loving young man How did such a respectable person as you ever come to take service in such a herd of black sheep I don t know anything about those goings on sir asseverated the old man doggedly If they put me in jail the rest of my life I couldn t remember ever hearing a word about any of em sir Good man Don t you testify to anything that would tend to incriminate or degrade the memory of Uncle Simeon or any other Remsen And neither will I However this isn t dressing for dinner Having changed young mister Remsen returned to dine with Gloria Greene He found her smiling over a note which she carefully blotted before turning from her desk to greet him What did you think of my protegee she inquired I m collecting opinions on her The little Colter girl She isn t as sniffy as she appears at first sight Her name isn t Colter And I don t know how you can judge First sight is all that you had of her Not so fair lady She passed me in the hallway as I was waiting for a taxi to come along I could see her nerving herself up to say something and finally she said it Well what was it Nothing important Just that she was sorry she couldn t sing for me and that some other time she would But she said it quite pleasantly She hasn t a bad voice Effect of Lesson the First commented the actress What are you doing with that young person Gloria Working some of your white magic on her Just remaking life a little for her replied the other offhandedly This is part of it She fluttered the note paper on which she had been writing What is it asked Remsen A pass to Paradise She looked as cheered up as if she were getting something of the kind It s a commutation ticket to Hades first class was the actress s Delphic response But the poor child won t know it till she gets there CHAPTER IV HOPE which is credited with various magic properties had kindled a sickly sort of sub glow in Darcy Cole s pasty face as she arrived at Miss Greene s address to keep her appointment Part of it subsided at sight of the indication that the elevator was still on strike The remainder had vanished long before she had surmounted the four flights of stairs and stood panting dolorously before Gloria Greene That composed person feigned polite surprise Why what s the matter Darcy Those awful pouf stairs How whoof uff d you ever whoo oo oof do it Two steps at a time explained the actress practically cuts the distance in half Darcy looked skeptical It would kill me she declared Very likely as you are now We re going to change all that The gleam returned into Darcy s big dull eyes Yes said she eagerly How I should say answered the actress with a carefully judicial air that you d better start in by learning to give up Give up what Everything that makes life worth living Is it a joke asked Darcy dubiously Far from it Food for instance You eat too much Often I don t get any luncheon at all And too irregularly pursued the accuser You drink too much Gloria One cocktail before dinner was the indignant response And too regularly went on the relentless judge One is one too many for a girl with your complexion Go on said Darcy with sullen resignation You sleep too much Eight hours isn t You interrupt too much broke in the mentor severely You laze too much You shirk and postpone too much You nibble too much candy When you feel below par you take a pill instead of a walk Don t you The girl stared How do you know all these things about me Read em in your face of course And a lot more besides Nobody else ever read em there Not even the doctor Probably he has but is too polite to tell you all he sees or too cynical to believe that you d take the trouble to do anything about it if he told you Or perhaps he just doesn t see it Then how do you I m an expert my dear young innocent It s part of my profession to be good looking just as it is to keep well read and well dressed And a lot harder How can it be harder for you You re beautiful just naturally I m not beautiful Your Holcomb Lee or any other artist with a real eye could reduce my face to a mere scrap heap of ill assorted features I m reasonably pleasant to look at because I work hard at the business of being just that And I m going to keep on being pleasant to look at for twenty good years yet if care and clothes will do it Clothes help such a lot sighed the girl When are you going to help me with mine Gloria Greene looked disparagingly at the girl s slack and flaccid body When you develop something to put em on said she curtly But I thought that if I had some nice clothes You d develop inside them like the butterfly in the chrysalis supplemented the other Unfortunately it doesn t work that way with humans Didn t I tell you yesterday that it wasn t going to be easy Yes But you re not telling me anything now You re just just discouraging me Why you poor spirited little grub you haven t even touched the outer edge of discouragement yet Here Can you do this Lifting her hands high above her glowing head Gloria swept them down in a long curve of beauty until she stood bowed but with unbending knees her pink fingers flattened on the floor Of course I can t whined Darcy Try it suggested the other enticingly It isn t hard Darcy did not stir I ve got corsets on said she You have Awful ones Take em off I will she promised Performance not promise was what her instructor demanded Do it now With a sigh the girl obeyed It makes me look sloppier than ever she lamented glancing toward the mirror Not actually was the counsel of dubious comfort from the other You only feel now as you ve been looking all the time Don t get another pair until I tell you I ll pick em out if you still want them when Andy Dunne is through with you Who s Andy Dunne Andy explained the actress concisely is the devil That s encouraging murmured the girl Anyway you ll think he is He s my trainer Trainer You talk as if you were a prizefighter I cut Andy s lip with a straight left once said Miss Greene with a proud reminiscent gleam in her eye It was one of the biggest moments of my life Taking from her desk the note which she had described to Jacob Remsen as a commutation ticket to the last station down line she handed it to Darcy The girl read it Andy This is Miss Darcy Cole Put her through as you did me only more so Gloria Greene Darcy tucked it carefully into her imitation leather roll saying It s awfully good of you to take all this trouble for me Oh it isn t for you entirely Call it part of my contribution to the general welfare It gives me a pain in my artistic sense to see a woman job spoiled like a good picture daubed over by a bad amateur So if I can rescue you as a brand from the burning and put you back on earth a presentable human I ll feel like a major of the Salvation Army That s why I ve decided to take you in hand And may Heaven have mercy upon your body Amen confirmed Darcy piously feeling for the introductory note Only added Gloria slowly I want to be clear on one point I d like to know for whom I m really doing this Why for me of course said Darcy big eyed Not for any one else Who else should there be I told you there wasn t any I know You swore there was no man in this Then on top of it you rouse my darkest suspicions by acting like a school girl yesterday and tearing your hair because the first casual man that comes along doesn t gaze soulfully at you when he takes his departure Gloria I hate you D you mean mister Remsen Surely you don t for a minute imagine No I don t suppose Jack has anything to do with it personally But I seem to get a strong indication of Man as a species somewhere in the background of this business Pink grew Miss Darcy Cole then red and eventually scarlet under Gloria s interested regard You see exclaimed that acute person Come now Explain It s it s Maud Raines s fault blurted Darcy Agreed that it s all Maud s fault Go on No it isn t all Maud s fault corrected Darcy with a palpable effort to do exact justice It s partly the British War Office s fault International complications Maud and the British War Office mister Lee had better look out Not at all It isn t Maud that the British War Office has been writing letters to No Who is it Me Is this a long distance flirtation with an official Britisher all wound round with red tape What kind of fetters Well not personal exactly reluctantly admitted the girl Propaganda matter It s sent out by their press bureau But it always comes addressed in nice firm man ny handwriting But why do they send to you Darcy giggled That s the funny part of it They must have got me confused with Dorsey Coles the essayist He used to live on East Fifty Sixth Street Very likely When does the Man enter We ell you see Maud and Helen were awfully curious about my English correspondent Naturally So I well I just let em be Is that any reason why you should wear the expression of one about to confess to a coldblooded murder Wait You know I told you Maud had been catty about my sitting to Holcomb Lee Yes This is what I overheard her say to Helen and I m not even sure she didn t mean me to overhear She said Darcy s been sitting to Holcomb Fancy it Darcy as a model I can no more imagine her being a model than I could her being engaged Wasn t that nasty of her Gloria It was And you very properly smothered her with a pillow as she slept and have come here to make your confession twinkled Gloria Worse said Darcy in a small tremulous voice Much worse Gloria sat up straight No she cried hopefully Yes For Helen said Well somebody in

none	none	seems pretty much interested in her anyway That s what put it into my head I wish you d put it into mine said the other plaintively You don t seem to get any nearer the subject of your romance which is Man Well promise not to laugh at me Gloria I ll try Just to show em both I got engaged Darcy Yes and one evening when both of the girls were being just a little extra peacocky over their double wedding next October and letting me understand what a favor it was to me that I was to be double maid of honor I just up and told em I didn t know whether I could be as I had an important engagement to be married myself Lovely Gorgeous They jumped at the English letters So I told them that I thought I might as well own up about the affair how I d met him on my vacation in Canada and helped him try out horses for the British Government which had sent him over for that purpose when he was wounded and we had corresponded ever since It was awfully well done if I do say it as shouldn t Let me get this right pleaded Gloria You made him all up yourself just on the basis of those war office letters N no That s just the trouble You didn t make him up N n not entirely For Heaven s sake do be more explicit I m t t trying to said Darcy brokenly I got him out of a book Then he s imaginary I m afraid he s real Awfully real Darcy Cole what book did you get him out of Burke s Peerage With one headlong plunge Gloria projected herself upon the couch where she wallowed ecstatically among the pillows Oh Darcy Darcy she gasped when she could achieve coherent speech For this I shall love you forever I ll do more I ll adopt you I ll endow you I ll I ll canonize you What s his name Sir Montrose Veyze Bart of Veyze Holdings Hampshire England recited the girl formally Dissociating herself from a convulsed silk coverlet Gloria straightened up Sir Montrose Veyze she repeated thoughtfully and relishingly Why that particular and titled gentleman I got to the V s before I found any one that seemed to fill the bill What special qualification commended him to your favorable consideration Miss Cole Well he s unmarried That s important And he s far away I came across that in an English magazine How far Way out in the East somewhere where one of the fifty seven varieties of left over wars is still going on So far so good What are you going to do with him when he comes back If I only knew was the miserable rejoinder Maybe he won t come back Maybe something will happen to him It won t He ll bear a charmed life just to plague you retorted her friend with conviction You bloodthirsty little beast she added The worst I wish him said Darcy tearfully is an honorable military death Oh Is that all You d have to go into deep mourning That d be better than suicide And I can t see anything else for me to do if he lives through I won t confess to that Maud cat I won t I won t I won t I don t blame you But when are you to be married Uncertain That s the advantage of having a fiance at war You must make it after the double wedding decided Gloria Just for curiosity how did you describe him I ve rather dodged that so far But I think I d like to have him tall and slender and with nice steady friendly eyes like mister Remsen So would Monty doubtless surmised Gloria Who Monty Veyze Gloria Do you know Sir Montrose Veyze Rather I visited at his sister s last time I was in England Heavens That makes it seem so ghastly real What s he like Round and roly poly and red and fiercelooking but a good sort And he used to be quite an admirer of mine I do think Darcy that with the whole of Burke s Peerage to choose from you might have refrained from trespassing on my preserves It isn t clubby of you You can have him cried the girl desperately Any one can have him I don t care how round and red and He s rather far from your picture of him certainly Not a bit like Jack Remsen So you approve of Jack do you I thought him awfully attractive said Darcy shyly Oh Jack s a dear It s a pity about his money Has he lost it No Got it Too much Without it he might make a real actor He s the best amateur in New York to day But an amateur What does he do Dabbles in artistic things And plays at being everybody s little sunbeam Never mind Jack It s the imaginary Sir Montrose Veyze that we ve got to figure on Oh do tell me what to do with him implored the too inventive Darcy Keep him Prize him above rubies and diamonds Nothing has given me a laugh like that for a year But if Let the future take care of its ifs Who can tell what will turn up Fate is kind to creative genius And I m going to assist Fate if I can I ll make you a bargain Darcy for half of your beautiful inspiring heaven sent lie You take me into equal partnership in it and I ll be your little personal Guide to Health and Beauty until we ve made a job of you But you ve got to promise on honor to keep up the Veyze myth if I m to be partner and half owner in it until I agree to drop it Is it a bargain The light of unholy reckless adventure shot into Darcy s pale eyes It s a bargain she agreed solemnly CHAPTER V SUCH demoniac attributes as mister Andy Dunne might possess lurked in the background on the occasion of Darcy s first visit Smothering her misgivings the girl had mounted the steps of the old fashioned house just off Sixth Avenue undistinguished by any sign or symbol of the mystic activities within and presented Gloria s letter mister Dunne revealed himself as a taciturn gentleman in funereal trousers and a blue sweater who suggested facially an athletic monk of reserved and misanthropic tendency He led her into a severely business like office sparsely furnished with a desk and two hard and muscular looking chairs with liberal wall ornamentations of the championship Baltimore Orioles A Dunne twod b in clear script on the frame pictures of mister Dunne and other worthies in sundry impressive and hostile postures and a large photograph signed with a noble flourish Yours truly John L Sullivan It was the crowning glory of mister Dunne s professional career that he had trained the Big Feller for his final championship fight Having perused his former pupil s brief epistle mister Dunne cast an appraising glance over the neophyte Full course he inquired Yes please How long Six months The girl produced a roll of bills and laid them on the desk mister Dunne counted them twice With a stony face and in a highly correct hand he made out a receipt Six months Paid in advance he stated D je meanter pay it all Y y yes Isn t it usual queried Darcy wondering whether she was shattering some conventionality of this unknown world Nope Three s usual What s the big idea Gloria that is Miss Greene told me to pay it all in advance because if I didn t I might get tired of it and back out But I shan t From between mister Dunne s hard set lips issued a vowel less monosyllable such as might be enunciated by a contemplative bulldog engaged in self communion Grmph said mister Dunne which Darcy decided might mean much or little Friend o Miss Greene s he inquired after a pause Yes Some lady said mister Dunne with an approach to enthusiasm which Darcy was never thereafter to experience from his repressive spirit save only when he spoke of the Big Feller Isn t she wonderful acquiesced Darcy mister Dunne rubbed his lower lip with a reminiscent and almost romantic gleam in his heavy browed eyes and the girl with difficulty suppressed a query as to whether that was the spot whereon Gloria had landed her triumphant left Emerging from his reverie he issued his first direction Stannup please Darcy rose and stood consciously loppish while the trainer circumnavigated her twice Grmph he grunted When yah wanna begin At once please Gotta outfit No Gittit He thrust a typed list into her hand How much you weigh I don t know Yah don t know Somewhere about a hundred and fifty I suppose Yah suppose Grmph The exclamation was replete with contempt Come into the shop She followed him into a big airy room flooded with overhead light and filled with all sorts of mechanism Obedient to a gesture she stepped on the scales mister Dunne busied himself with a careful adjustment You ll strip a hunner n fifty two he declared Darcy vaguely felt as if she were being accused of murder She felt even worse when the iron faced mister Dunne made an entry in a little notebook Will I she said faintly Not long retorted the trainer He strode across the room and set foot upon a huge ungainly leather ball It seemed but the merest touch that he gave Nevertheless the ball left that spot hurriedly rolled across to Darcy and encountered her shins with an impact that all but crumpled her flabby legs beneath her Know what that is demanded the trainer I m afraid I don t Medicine ball Little pill You ll like the little pill Prophetic voices within Darcy told her that this was improbable but she mildly assented The pulley weights were next called to her attention and identified What do I do with them she inquired with a proper show of interest Pull em up I see And then what Let em down It seemed to Darcy a profitless procedure but she wisely refrained from saying so and was glad that she did when mister Dunne added in a tone which emphasized the importance of the transaction A coupla hundred times Subsequently the neophyte was introduced to the dumb bells the Indian clubs the rings the hand ball court the rowing machine she earned a glance of contempt by asking where it rowed to the punching bag which she disliked at sight the finger grip roller the stationary bicycle which also got you nowhere the boxing gloves and a further bewildering but on the whole inspiriting array of machines for making one strong happy beautiful and healthy to order Somewhere in the girl s consciousness lurked a suspicion that the apparatus couldn t be expected to do all the work that there were patient and perhaps strenuous endeavors expected of the operator But of the real rigors of the awaiting fate she had but the faintest glimmer As she was leaving a door bumped violently open and there appeared in the shop a horrific female figure It was that of a fat blonde with four sweaters on Her cheeks were puffy red her eyes jutted poppily from the sockets and her jowls dripped As a slave treading the unending grind of the mill the apparition set herself to trot heavily around the circumference of the room And as she ran she blubbered Oh poor thing cried Darcy under her breath What s the matter with her Nothin said mister Dunne indifferently But there must be something insisted the newcomer aghast Fat vouchsafed mister Dunne They mostly take it hard at the start he condescended to add She s only been at it a month A month Darcy s heart sank within her She began to see why Gloria had insisted on a binding prepayment Did Gloria splendid vigorous Gloria have to go through that stage Was this the inevitable purgatory through which all flesh must pass to reach the goal Could she Darcy conscious of flaccidity of body and spirit endure Tomorra at three cut in mister Dunne s brusque tones Impersonal and coldly business like though Andy Dunne might appear to the apprehensive novice he was an artist in his line and took a conscientious interest in his clients Inspired thereby he called up Gloria Greene and requested information Spoiled child was the diagnosis which he received over the phone Fool parents he inquired No Rich feller Nothing of that sort What s spoilt her then She s spoilt herself That s bad But she doesn t know it That s worse So I ve sent her to you Andy And Gloria outlined her hopeful programme for Darcy Grmph snorted the trainer Will she stand the gaff d yah think She ll have to chuckled Gloria If she doesn t let me know I ve got a hold over her The mere process of purchasing has an inspiriting effect upon the feminine psychology By the time Darcy had acquired her simple gymnasium outfit her fears were forgotten in optimism With such appropriate clothes the experiment must be a success Proudly she arrayed herself in them upon arrival at mister Andy Dunne s academy at the hour set the close fitting rather scratchy tights the scant and skirtless trousers the light canvas shoes the warmly enveloping sweater and the rubber cap to keep her hair from interfering with her exertions Thus appareled Darcy quite esteemed herself as an athlete She could already feel her muscular potentialities developing beneath the rough stimulant cloth She thought lightly of the various apparatus awaiting her in the shop playthings of her coming prowess She would show mister Andy Dunne what an apt and earnest devotee of the vigorous life could achieve Thus uplifted she went forth with a confident smile to meet the man who for weary months was to fill a large part of her life At sight of her mister Dunne schooled though he was in self restraint barely suppressed a groan of pained surprise That garb which had so pleased Darcy however much it may have been an inspiration to her was a revelation to the dismayed eyes of her instructor To Gloria Greene one of the few people with whom he forgot his reticence he afterwards made his little plaint If they re fat I can sweat em If they re skinny I can pad em with muscle But this squab she s fat and skinny all in the wrong places Half hopeful that he might discover some disabling symptom he tested her heart and her breathing All was normal He noted her yellowish eyes her sallow skin the beginning of a fold under her chin the slackness of her posture How old are yah he demanded Just twenty one Grmph barked mister Dunne in a tone which unflatteringly suggested surprise but also relief Well we gotta getta work How pleasurable was that hour s exercise to Darcy With what delight did her unforeboding spirit take to the ways of a hardy athleticism Never could she have imagined it so easy No sooner was she weary of one kind of a trial dumb bells Indian clubs or pulleys than when her breath began to come short the watchful instructor stopped her and after a rest set her to something else Her skin pricked and glowed beneath the close but unrestricting suit Little drops of moisture came out on her face and were gayly brushed away She could feel herself breathing deeper her blood running faster and fuller in her veins her muscles suppling along the bones She hurled the medi cine ball with fervor She attacked the punch ing bag with ferocity She swung at the elusive little hand ball with a violence unhampered by any sense of direction From time to time she threw a glance hopefully inviting approval at the stonily watchful visage of mister Andy Dunne The approval did not manifest itself Darcy had she but known it was going through that schedule of the mildest type known derisively to Andy s academy as the consumptive s stunt At the conclusion of a trot three times around the room which she conceived herself as performing with a light and springy step like a three legged goat was mister Dunne s mental comparison that gentleman said Nuff a word which later was to rank in his pupil s consciousness as the one assuaging thing in an agonized world The regulation first day s end catechism then took place How d yah feel Fine s good Lame Not a bit Yah ll stiffen up later Don t let it bother yah Hot bath in the morning All right Same time day after tomorra He busied himself replacing the deranged apparatus How s the appetite he asked carelessly It hasn t been so very good No Try it on this Diet for Miss D Cole was typed across the top of a meager looking list of edibles and what that young lady would have considered inedibles which she found herself conning Is that all she inquired dismally Take as much as yah want of it returned mister Dunne generously But I mean it doesn t look very nice The Big Feller trained on it observed the other with an air of finality What s wrong with it Why why it s well monotonous explained the girl There isn t a sweet thing in it No cakes No desserts Not even ice cream Why can t I have a little sweets Because answered mister Dunne yah got creases in your stomach Darcy started No Have I she asked vaguely alarmed as to what profound digestive catastrophe that might portend Well haven t yah About there and there and prob ly there mister Dunne drew an illustrative and stubby forefinger thrice vertically across his own flat abdomen Look to night and yah ll see em Oh gasped Darcy turning fiery red for it is one of our paradoxical conventions that a young lady may discuss the inside of her stomach without shame but not the outside mister Dunne regarded the blush with disfavor Look a here he said bluntly Yah needn t get rattled But I I didn t Cut the school girl stuff Yah r my pupil I m yahr trainer That s all there is to it if we re going to get along comfortable Get me Yes said Darcy I won t be silly again And I ll try and mind the diet Vastly to her surprise and gratification the neophyte arose on the following morning without severe symptoms of lameness Here and there an unsuspected muscle had awakened to life and to mild protest over the resurrection But on the whole Darcy felt none the worse for her experience She began to surmise that she was one of that physically blessed class a born athlete If beauty vigor and health were to be achieved at no harder a price than this they were almost like a gift of the good fairies The only unusual phenomena she observed as a result of her introspection were a lack of interest in her food which she set down to the discredit of the diet and a tendency to fall asleep over her work She went to bed early that night quite looking forward to the morrow s exercise Nature has a stock practical joke which she plays on the physically negligent when they begin training Instead of inflicting muscular remorse on the morning after she lets the bill run for another twenty four hours and then pounces upon the victim with an astounding accumulation of painful arrears Opening her eyes on that second day after mister Dunne s mild but sufficient schedule the one muscular movement she was able to make without acute agony Darcy became cognizant that every hinge in her body had rusted She attempted to swing her legs out of bed and stuck with her feet projecting out from the clothes paralyzed and groaning From the bedroom next to Darcy s alcove Helen Barrett heard the sounds of lamentation and tottered drowsily in What ever is the matter Darcy I can t get up moaned the victim What is it Are you ill No No I m all right Only Get your legs back in bed The kindly Helen thrust back the protruding limbs thereby wringing from the sufferer a muffled shriek which brought Maud Raines to the scene It s rheumatism I think explained Helen to the newcomer Or else paralysis It isn t denied Darcy indignantly What is it then Racked by all manner of darting pains and convulsive cramps Darcy began the cautious process of emerging from bed Do be good ugh she implored And don t ooch ask questions and draw me a boiling hot bath ow w w and help me into it oh h h h dear Greatly wondering they followed the sufferer s directions got her duly en tubbed and ensconced themselves outside the door which they left carefully ajar for explanations All they got for this maneuver was an avowal of the bather s firm intention of spending the rest of the day in the mollifying water If you want to be really nice she added you might bring my coffee and rolls to me here Well really said Maud indignantly for this was a reversal of the normal order of things in Bachelor Girls Hall As the homely member of an otherwise attractive trio Darcy had been by common consent constituted the meek and unprotesting servitor of the other two Thus do relics of Orientalism persist among the most independent race of women known to history Darcy accepted the rebuff It doesn t matter said she with a quaver of self pity I can t have coffee I can t have hot rolls I can t have anything Her two mates exchanged glances Darcy you ve got to see a doctor I haven t I won t But if you can t move and can t eat I m much better now Really I am declared the other alarmed at the threat of a physician who might suspect the truth and give her away to the others I m going to dress Which she did at the price of untold pangs Breakfast passed in a succession of questioning silences and suspicious glances but Darcy guarded her tongue To reveal the facts and what lay behind them would be only to invite discouragement and dissuasion if not actual ridicule After the frugal and tasteless ordeal of hominy without sugar followed by one egg without butter she limped into the front room and set herself doggedly to the elaboration of a new design for B Riegel Sons Notwithstanding the legacy she could not afford to neglect the economic side of life whilst fostering the physical Her special course in the development of charm via the muscle and sinew route she perceived was going to take longer than she had foreseen Already she felt that the schedule ought to be radically relaxed Her unfitness to take the lesson set for that afternoon was obvious Next week perhaps though on the whole she inclined to the belief that she should have about ten days to recuperate She would write to mister Dunne and explain No she would telephone him Better still she would go up to the Academy of Tortures in person and exhibit to the proprietor s remorseful eyes the piteous wreck which he had made of her blithe young girlhood She went mister Andy Dunne regarded the piteous wreck without outward and visible signs of distress Yah got five minutes he remarked emotionlessly glancing at the clock I can t

none	none	go on to day said Darcy firmly No Every bone in my body creaks I haven t got a muscle that isn t sore I ache in places that I didn t even know I had Why mister Dunne she declared impressively as a conclusion to the painful inventory if I tried to go through those exercises again to day I d die Grmph said mister Dunne indicating that he was unimpressed I c c c can t do it and I won t said Darcy like a very naughty child Yah paid me three hundr n sixty dollars didn t yah Yes replied Darcy her heart sinking at the recollection of the sum which she had invested in assorted agonies Did yah think that was going to buy yah what yah r after Darcy gulped dismally It ain t Money can t buy it Yah gotta have gu grit mister Dunne achieved the timely amendment in the middle of the stronger qualification Darcy s mind went back to Gloria Greene s preachment upon the text of grit You don t know what the word means yet Apparently she was in a fair way to find out Two minutes gone announced the trainer s inexorable voice How she did it she never knew But under impulsion of the sterner will she got into her gymnasium suit and was on the floor only three minutes past the hour The apparatus which she had at first encountered with so much interest and curiosity now had a sinister effect of lying in wait like the implements of a dentist s office She speculated with a shrinking of her whole frame upon which one would be selected as the agency of the initial agony Giving them not so much as a look mister Andy Dunne led her to a large rough mat and bade her stretch out on her back Lift the left foot in the air he directed Darcy did so with caution Higher said mister Dunne Oo yee lamented Darcy Back Lift the right foot in the air Darcy obeyed without enthusiasm Higher said mister Dunne Ow wow mourned Darcy Back Lift both feet in the air I can t said Darcy Yah gotta said mister Dunne Two wavering quivering legs rose slowly from the mat attained an angle of forty five degrees and dropped back to earth with a thud Their owner had been forcibly reminded of the three creases in her stomach by the fact that they had unanimously set to writhing and grinding upon each other in fiery convolutions of protest resultant upon the unwonted angle of the legs Higher commanded the pitiless mister Dunne Can t Gotta With a spasmodic heave the victim attained perhaps fifty degrees of elevation and straightened out gasping Next her instructor had her sit up erect from a flat position without aid from hands or elbows whereat all the muscles in her back thighs and abdomen hitherto unawakened roused themselves and yelled in chorus Then he had her repeat the whole devastating process from the first before he spoke the word of reprieve Nuff Darcy rolled over on her face and lay panting How d yah feel Awful gasped Darcy Still a bit stiff A bit Oh h h h Then we ll do it all again said mister Dunne cheerfully Nothin like light exercise to loosen up the human frame For that light Darcy could cheerfully have slain him Nobody since the world began she felt convinced neither gladiator of the classic arena nor the mighty John L himself had ever undergone such a fearsome grilling and lived And now there was more to come Over the twistings and turnings the arm flexures the hoppings and skippings the tingling of the outraged muscles the panting of the overtaxed lungs let us draw a kindly curtain When the horrid hour was over Darcy in her cold shower felt numb Whether she could ever manage to get home on her own disjointed feet seemed doubtful But she did She went to bed at eight o clock that night having eaten almost nothing in the firm conviction that she never would be able to get up in the morning without help and probably not with it Sleep such as she had not known in years submerged her Roused late by her companions she moved first an arm then a leg tentatively No penalty attached to the experiment With a low anticipatory groan she sat up slowly in bed The groan was a case of crying before she was hurt She began to feel herself cautiously all over Her skin was a little tender to the touch and she noted with interest that the blood ran impetuously to whatever spot on the surface her exploring fingers pressed But of that crippling lameness that feeling of the whole bodily mechanism being racked and rusted there remained only a trace In its place was left a new variety of pang which Darcy pleasantly identified She was ravenously hungry Maud Raines observed to Helen Barrett after breakfast that any one who could bolt plain oatmeal the way Darcy did must have the appetite of a pig and no wonder she was fat and slobby But Andy Dunne calling up Gloria to report progress thus delivered his opinion You know that squab you sent me Miss Greene Yes She wanted to quit No Did she do it I bluffed her out of it And say Miss Greene Yes Andy There may be something to that kid Glad you think so Said Andy Dunne expert on the human race slowly consideringly and more prophetically than he knew I kinda think there s fighting stuff some wheres under that fat CHAPTER VI HAD Andy Dunne s surmise been laid before Darcy it might have brought sorely needed encouragement to her soul as the regenerative process went on True she had presently passed the first crisis which athletic regimen develops for the untrained and which is purely muscular She no longer swung to and fro a helpless pendulum between the agonies of apprehension and the anguish of action The steady exercise was telling in so far as her muscles were concerned she had still to face the test of discipline In this second and sterner crisis Andy Dunne could help her but little It was a question of her own power of will a will grown slack and flabby from lack of exercise Ahead of her loomed only dimly discerned as yet the ordeal of strenuous monotony the deadly dull prolonged grind wherein endurance as it hardens is subjected to a constantly harsher strain until the soul revolts as in the earlier stage the body had rebelled A subject like Gloria Greene high and fine of spirit the sage mister Dunne could have eased through the difficult phase by appeals to her pride and to the sense of partnership which the successful trainer must establish between himself and his pupil With Darcy this was impracticable because Andy Dunne as he would have admitted with a regretful grin was in wrong Darcy enthusiastically hated him At first sight she had estimated him as a stem spirit Through successive changes that reckoning had been altered to harsh then brutal and now Satanic Gloria s judgment of her note of introduction as a commutation ticket to Hades first class was amply borne out Professionally mister Dunne s discourse tended ever to the hortatory and corrective He was a master of the verbal rowel Keep it up Again Ah h h put some punch in it Yah ain t haff trying Go wan Yah gotta do better n at And occasionally Rotten Worse still was a manner he had of regarding her with an expression of mild and regretful wonder whilst giving voice to his bulldoggish Grmph in a tone indicating only too plainly that never before was conscientious trainer so bored and afflicted with such an utterly incompetent inefficient and generally hopeless subject as the daily withering Darcy In lighter moments he would regale her with reminiscences of the Big Feller and his eccentricities in and insubordinations under training while Darcy would lie panting and spent on the hard floor wondering regretfully why the Big Feller hadn t killed mister Dunne when opportunities must have been so plentiful Then just as her labored breathing would begin to ease the taskmaster in mister Dunne would awaken the call Time would sound like doom to her ears and she would set to it again arching on her back rolling on her stomach where the three creases were beginning to flatten yanking at overweighted pulleys interminably skipping a loathly rope standing up like a dumb ten pin before the ponderous medi cine ball which mister Dunne hurled at her punching at an elusive and too often vengeful bag rowing an imaginary boat against wind wave and every dictate of her weary body and finally running silly circles around the room like a demented cat until the monitor uttered the one lone word of pity in his inquisitorial vocabulary Nuff Had all this deep wrung sweat of brow and soul produced any definable effect Darcy could have borne it with a resigned spirit It didn t Four times a week she went through the hideous grind and nothing happened Each night she went to bed early and after profound sleep had to get up out of the cuddly warmth into a shudderingly cold bath and nothing happened She gave up the before dinner cocktail and with it what little zest she had for her deadly plain diet and nothing happened She denied her sweet tooth so much as one little bite of candy oh but that was a bitter deprivation and nothing happened To her regimen at the gymnasium she added a stint of simple but violent house exercises on off days and nothing happened Life which she had supposed in her first flush of hopeful enthusiasm for the new regime would be one grand sweet song was in fact one petty sour discord wherein nothing happened This was quite right and logical had Darcy but known it Layers of fat physical and moral accumulated through years of self coddling are not worked off in a week or a month There came a day when something did happen There always does It was not of that order of occurrences which can be foreseen by the expert eye It seldom is Andy Dunne honestly and simply intent on earning his money had been unusually exigent Besides Darcy had a nail in her shoe Besides mister Riegel had been curtly critical of her latest and most original design as new fangled Besides Maud was becoming satirically curious as to where she was spending so many afternoons Besides it was a rotten day There was no light on earth or in heaven What s the use of it all anyway thought Darcy to herself for perhaps the fiftieth time but rather more fervently than before As if in exasperation of her agnostic mood the preceptor in the half time intermission had suggested not less but more work Yah r gettin stale observed mister Dunne which Darcy thought a hopeful beginning I feel so she said There s a clock mister Dunne informed her at Fifty Ninth and Eighth Darcy waited There s another at a Hundred n Tenth and Seventh pursued the chronometrical mister Dunne and fell into calculating thought Darcy waited again Yah leave Fifty Ninth at four point twenty p m When Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays Oh said Darcy blankly And yah get to a Hundred n Tenth in time to hear that clock strike five What Walk Nearly three miles in forty minutes No said mister Dunne thoughtfully Then how Yah d better run part way or yah won t make it on time You want to kill me declared the petulant and self pitying Darcy Grmph said mister Dunne Suppose it rains put forth Darcy desperately Then yah ll get wet was mister Dunne s reasonable answer And catch my death riding back in the bus Don t ride Walk I m giving this to yah for fresh air But mister Dunne Time It may have been this fresh grievance which lay heavy upon Darcy s chest clogging her breathing and slowing her suppled muscles She was conscious of doing less well than usual and of not caring either The medicine ball was heavier and more unwieldy than ever The punching bag instinct with a demoniac vitality came back at her on a new schedule and bumped her nose violently a mortifying incident which had not occurred since the first week The despicable little hand ball propelled by her trainer bounded just a fraction of an inch out of her straining reach and when she did hit it felt as soggy as sand and as hard as rock and raised stone bruises on her hands She even pinched her thumb in the rowing machine which is the zenith of inexpertness With every fresh mishap she became more self piteous and resentful and reckless Andy the Experienced would have ascribed all this to that common if obscure phenomenon an off day familiar to every professor whether of integral calculus or the high trapeze Then the dreadful thing happened and he revised his opinion The last and therefore worst five minutes of the grind had come Darcy lay on the mat going through the loathed body and limb lifting while Andy Dunne exhorted her to speed up Now the legs Come on Hup Something in Darcy went on strike Can t she said Grmph What s matter Won t said Darcy From the corner of a hot and rebellious eye she could see overspreading her trainer s face that familiar expression of contemptuous and weary patience Anything else she could have stood But that that was the spark that fired the powder Stooping over the trainer laid hold none too gently on one inert heel Heaven and earth reversed themselves for mister Andy Dunne Also day and night for a galaxy of stars appeared and circulated before his mazed eyes The walls and the ceiling joined in the whirl to which an end was set by the impact of the floor against the back of his head For one brief sweet romantic moment Andy Dunne was back in the training ring with the Big Feller and that venerated and mulish right had landed one on his jaw But why oh why should the mighty John L thereupon burst into hysterical sobbing And if it wasn t the Big Feller who was it making those grievous noises mister Dunne sat up viewed a huddled girlish form trying unsuccessfully to burrow headforemost out of sight in the hard mat and came to a realization of the awful fact With all the force of her newly acquired leg muscles the meek Miss Cole had landed a galvanic kick on his unprotected chin For a moment he stared in stupefaction Then he arose and went quietly forth into his own place where he sat on a chair and rubbed his chin and thought and presently began to chuckle and kept it up until the chuckle grew into a laugh which shook his tough frame more violently than had the unexpected assault Well I am d d said mister Dunne The little son of a gun Meanwhile Darcy lay curled up like a quaking armadillo Probably Andy Dunne would kill her She didn t much care Life wasn t worth living anyhow She was through The one pleasant impression of her whole disastrous gymnasium experience was the impact of her heel against that contemptuous chin She opened one eye Andy Dunne was not where he should have landed as the result of the revolution which he had been performing when he whirled from her view She opened the other eye Andy Dunne was not anywhere He had vanished into nothingness With all the sensation of a criminal Darcy rose dressed and fled She fled straight to Gloria Greene That industrious person was as usual at work and as usual found time to hear Darcy s troubles What she heard was gaspy and fragmentary Gloria I ve done an awful thing What Out with it commanded the actress I ki ki ki I can t tell you gulped Darcy mister Dunne I mean I ki ki ki Yes encouraged Gloria What awful thing have you done to Andy Dunne Kissed him No Worse Oh You ki ki killed him I suppose twinkled Gloria I don t know I hope so I ki ki kicked him I kicked him good Darcy Where On the chin What did he do Disappeared Do I understand that you kicked him into microscopical pieces Don t laugh at me Gloria It s very very serious It sounds so I m done with it Forever Done with what The gymnasium The diet Andy Dunne Everything Oh no you re not I am I am I yam declared Darcy with progressive petulance I ve been torturing myself for nothing It hasn t made a bit of difference Look at me Gloria looked and with difficulty concealed a smile of satisfaction For to her expert eyes there was a difference a marked difference still submerged but obvious beneath the surface in movements which formerly sluggish were now brisk and supple in a clear eye and a skin which seemed to fit on the flesh where before it had sagged How did you get up here inquired Gloria abruptly Ran Up the whole four flights The elevator is working D n the elevator said the outrageous Darcy A few weeks ago you were damning it because it wouldn t carry up your lazy body Isn t there a difference now I don t care it isn t the difference I want I want to look like something Gloria I m desperate No child That isn t despair It s temper It s not Go back to Andy s and work it off I wont Very well With a sigh for her interrupted task Gloria selected a hat set it carefully upon her splendid hair and pinned it in place You ll excuse me won t you my dear she added in tones which aroused her visitor s alarmed suspicions Where are you going To see mister Dunne Not at all Darcy s misgivings livened into something like terror Where then To see Maud and Helen What for To recount to them the authentic and interesting history of Sir Montrose Veyze Bart hand picked fiance of Gloria You wouldn t be so base I would be just that base returned the other in the measured tones of judgment But I ll give you a respite until your next training day When is it Day after to morrow answered Darcy faintly If you aren t at Andy s then to answer to the call of time I ll tell the whole thing to the two fiancees with whatever extra details my imagination can provide Whereupon Darcy burst into tumultuous weeping declared that she hadn t a friend in the world and didn t care anyway because she wished she was dead and went forth of that unsympathetic spot with the air and expression of one spurning earth s vanities and deceptions forever Being wise in her generation and kind Gloria knew that the girl would go back to her martyrdom So she called up Andy Dunne for a conference which concluded with this sage advice from her to him This is the appointed time Andy When she comes back put the screws on hard She ll go through If she doesn t let me know No scapegrace of school led back from truancy after some especially nefarious project ever wore a face of more tremulous abasement than Miss Darcy Cole returning to her faithful trainer whom she had kicked in the jaw As he entered the gymnasium a strip of court plaster on the curve of his chin caught her fascinated attention and for the moment evicted from her mind the careful apology which she had formulated Before she could recapture it the opportunity was gone Time barked mister Dunne The day s work was on Such an ordeal as Darcy underwent in consequence of Gloria s advice few of mister Dunne s pupils other than professional athletes would have been called upon to endure a fact which might have helped her had she known it Not knowing it she won through that violent hour on sheer grit At the trainer s final Nuff she contrived to smile but she couldn t quite manage to walk off the floor She sat down upon a convenient medicine ball and waited for the dimness to clear A hand fell on her shoulder and rested there with an indefinable pressure of fellowship She looked up to see the taskmaster standing above her Say kid he began Yah are a kid ainche he broke off a little doubtfully I m going on twenty two panted Darcy Yeh I d figure yah about there now Well I m an old man old enough for the father stuff And I wanta tell yah something I like yah D yah know why I like yah Darcy with brightening eye shook her head Because yah r game said mister Andy Dunne A voice within Darcy s heart burst into song For the first time in her life she had been praised to the limit of a fellow being s measure For gameness as she well knew was the ultimate virtue to the athlete mind The Big Feller had been game even in his downfall it was that over and above all his victories which had enshrined him in Andy Dunne s and thousands of other stout and inexpressive hearts Her trainer had paid her his finest compliment Yah r game he repeated I dunno exactly what yah r out after but I m backin yah to get it Thank you mister Dunne said Darcy gratefully Grmph retorted that gentleman Cut the Mister Andy to you Thank you Andy said the recipient of the accolade CHAPTER VII Rum tu m tu m tu m tu m tu m tiddle THE voice sounded fresh and brisk from behind the portals of the Fifty Sixth Street eyrie It was followed by a rapid succession of floppish noises which fell strangely upon the ears of Miss Maud Raines and Miss Helen Barrett panting after their long ascent outside the door They had returned from a shopping tour at the unaccustomed hour of three when Darcy usually could rely upon having the place to herself Isn t Darcy the gay young sprite said Helen as the song burst forth again Flip flop flippity floppity flub sounded in progression across the living room floor The two fiancees looked at each other in bewilderment What on earth said Maud Raines Again the voice was uplifted in familiar melody gemmed with words less familiar Ru m tu m tu m tu m tu m tu m tiddle I have rolled ten pounds from off my middle By rolling on the floor Flip Flop As I told you before Behind Behind Before Floppity flop I do believe she s doing it whispered Helen in awed accents The voice with its strange accompaniments resumed Ru m tu m tu m tum tu m tu m tiddle I ll roll twenty pounds from off my middle I have done it before Floppity flop Thump I can do it some more Whoof By this time Maud s key silently inserted in the spring lock had made connections She threw the door open Darcy giving an imitation of a steam roller in full career toward the two entrants was startled into a cry She came to her feet with a bound without pausing to touch so much as a finger to the floor a detail which escaped the protruding eyes of her flatmates and stood facing them flushed and defiant Well said Maud Raines What are you up to Darcy asked Helen Exercising said Darcy blandly And practicing vocal music on the side remarked Maud Oh that s just for breathing exclaimed the girl But what s it all about queried Helen I ve gone into training You What for Oh I don t know Just for fun You look it was Maud s grim commentary Who s training you Andy Dunne He trained John L Sullivan and Gloria Greene And which one are you modeling yourself on asked Maud maliciously Oh I d rather be like Gloria of course retorted Darcy

none	none	But I feel more like John L I think it very clever of you Darcy approved the kind hearted Helen Englishmen are so athletic Darcy seized upon the convenient suggestion Monty is crazy for me to be a real sport she said modestly It s a good thing he can t see you learning remarked Maud Did you ever know anything more pathetic said Helen when they had withdrawn leaving Darcy to resume her exercises Pathetic Driveling foolishness Such a figure as she cuts And it s all such a waste concluded Maud complacent in her own bright hued prettiness But a more discerning eye took a different view Holcomb Lee who hadn t seen Darcy for some weeks had no sooner said Hello in his usual offhand way when he came to call that evening than he seized a pencil and demanded a sheet of paper You re always drawing Darcy said Maud disdainfully Just that curve from the ear down said he absently Something s happened to it What asked Maud It s come true The way I wanted it to be Only better He took Darcy into the corner under the light and sketched busily As his quick glances appraised her a look of puzzlement came into his eyes He leaned forward and with the inoffensive impersonality of the one ideaed artist ran his hand lightly over her shoulder and down the arm Moses said Holcomb Lee Darcy had flexed her upper arm and the long slender muscles came up like iron Training he asked Darcy nodded Again he regarded her subtly altered face What for The chorus Haven t I been chorus long enough twinkled Darcy

none	none	said Lee with emphasis You ll make the ingenue hustle for her job whoever she is By Jinks it s a miracle But don t tell them said Darcy Who The girls Haven t they noticed Why a blind man could feel the difference in you ten feet away You re the only one that has noticed it so far and you re an artist Well I suppose the girls wouldn t said the illustrator thoughtfully They see too much of you to recognize the change What Andy Dunne s exercises had so obviously wrought in muscle and condition Andy Dunne s discipline had accomplished for character Imperceptibly even to herself the inner Darcy was growing strong One result was a new zest in her designing taking the form of experiments aside from the beaten track which did not always meet the approval of B Riegel active head of B Riegel Sons manufacturers of wall paper Now mister Riegel s approval with the consequent check was highly essential to Miss Darcy Cole s plans And Miss Darcy Cole s attitude toward mister Riegel had always been acquiescent not to say humble But on a particular morning when the designer was even more alive than she was now accustomed to feel she brought in a particular design upon which she had spent much time and thought and with which she was well content Not so mister Riegel Being first last and between times a man of business he hardly gave a glance to the dowdy girl as she entered but bestowed his entire attention on the sketch Too blank was his verdict That makes it restful suggested Darcy Who wants restfulness Pep That s what goes these days It s for a sleeping room you know For all the effect upon the wall paper man she might as well not have spoken He set two pencil cross marks on the design Ornamentation here and here he directed curtly I prefer it as it is said Darcy calmly Two months yes two weeks before Darcy would have stepped meekly out and ruined her pattern by introducing the Riegel ornamentation But all was different now Andy Dunne s encomium because yah r game had put fire in her blood There was a reflection of it in her cheeks when mister Riegel looked up at her in surprise and annoyance He saw the same familiar figure in the same shabby ill fitting clothes But now she was standing up inside them And she whose dull regard formerly drooped away from the most casual encounter was confronting him with bright and level eyes Suppose you give my way a trial suggested this changeling Mebbe you know more about this business than I do he challenged Not at all But it s my design after all isn t it said the girl pleasantly Gathering it up with hands which somehow suggested protectiveness against the Philistine blight of mister Riegel she bestowed it safe in her imitation leather roll I ll try to bring you another next week she promised Wait now a minute cried the perplexed employer What re you going to do with this one Try it on Balke Stover Leave it he ordered Check ll be sent He whirled around in his chair presenting the broad hint of a busy back to her Make it for thirty dollars please said Darcy to the back mister Riegel performed a reverse whirl so much more swiftly than his swivel chair was prepared for that it was thrown off its balance and its occupant with a smothered yelp beheld himself orbitally projected toward a line of open sample paints waiting on the floor for a test mister Riegel s own person was the last medium in the world upon which he desired to test them for much stress had been laid upon their lasting quality He was sprawling out fairly above them beyond human help it seemed when something happened Darcy standing in that attitude of unconscious but alert poise which rigid physical training inculcates thrust forth a slender but powerful hand caught the despairing Riegel as it were in mid flight brought him up all standing restored him to the chair and both of them to the status quo Urf gasped the victim of these maneuvers He bent a look upon Darcy which was a curious blend of wonder skepticism and respect Say he said you couldn t use a job in the trucking department maybe Then recovering himself he growled What was that you said about thirty dollars The growl had no effect Darcy s confidence had been stiffened by the little interlude of the chair My prices have gone up she informed him The devil they have Beg y pardon Miss Watchemame My name is Cole Miss Cole Look a here now d you think your work is worth ten dollars more than it has been Put it this way I think you ve been paying me ten dollars too little Don t you At bottom mister Riegel was a fair minded as well as a shrewd person Moreover he had been tremendously impressed by the unsuspected physical prowess of this queer specimen To catch him in mid flight and reestablish his equilibrium had required no mean quality of muscle Yet this sloppy looking girl had done it without turning a hair And now she was striking him for a raise He laughed aloud That ain t the point said he I don t but some of my competitors might Lessay twenty five for the next half dozen after that thirty and this one goes as is Right said Darcy composedly Exultant she went out into a dusk of wind and rain such as would have swamped her spirit in misery aforetime and fought her way joyously through it ending her journey by taking the long flights of the apartment two steps at a time and singing as she sped Outside the door she had noticed a taxi In the front room she found Gloria who had stopped on her way to the theater stretched on the divan and talking with the turtledoves I looked in to see how you were getting on said the actress eyeing Darcy keenly Splendidly Everything all right in the gymnasium Did Andy er Oh yes It s all right hastily broke in the girl having no mind to hear her felonies discussed by her flat mates Just as right as right can be You re awfully chirpy considering what a beast of a raw rainy day it s been observed Helen Is it bad said Darcy blandly I suppose it is but I hardly noticed Another British mail in I suppose conjectured Maud That always brightens her up If there is I haven t got anything yet answered Darcy who had neglected to consult the morning papers for the incoming steamship entries Her myth involved so many supporting lies that it was difficult and ticklish to keep it properly bolstered up Has she told you about the Britisher Gloria asked Helen Monty Veyze Of course I know him You know him cried Helen and Maud in a breath What s he like Oh he s all that Darcy thinks he is smiled Gloria It s years since I ve seen him To put it Englishwise he was by way of being horribly smart then Just where is he now Darcy Near the Siberian frontier said Darcy shortly There was a gleam in Gloria s eye which she neither understood nor liked In one of the twenty two sub wars that signalize the universal peace I suppose laughed the actress Or is it twenty nine I thought long engagements weren t the thing in England said Maud musingly Particularly in these uncertain times when when anything might happen I think that s pretty horrid of you Maud retorted Darcy with carefully assumed sadness smothering a private and murderous wish that anything would happen to her home made fiance I don t mean it that way But if I were really engaged to an Englishman on active service I d go over and marry him on his very first leave Casual though Maud s really sounded it brought red to Darcy s cheeks and a livelier gleam to Gloria s eyes The latter turned to Darcy Why not tell them Tell them what inquired the girl staring at her mentor in amaze and alarm All about Monty The whole thing You know I claim a partnership in him By a mighty effort Darcy suppressed a gasp What was Gloria up to now Go on the actress urged Tell them I I can t stammered Darcy which was exactly what the feminine Macchiavelli on the divan was maneuvering for Shy said she sweetly Very well then I ll tell them May I Receiving a dubious nod Gloria proceeded Sir Montrose Veyze has finally got his leave He ll be here about the middle of October That gone feeling came over Darcy By the fifteenth asked Helen eagerly In time for our wedding No That s the unfortunate part We hoped we could make it a triple wedding That s the little surprise Darcy has been waiting to spring on you Can t he make it asked Maud The notion of a titled adjunct to her marriage appealed strongly to her practical mind Not quite The best he can do is the sixteenth Possibly later So they ll be married quite quietly from my apartment and have a month s honeymoon before he goes back To all of which Darcy listened in the stupefaction of despair She was roused by Helen Barrett s bear hug of congratulations Do you know said Helen I haven t really quite been able to believe it up to now Oh Darcy I m so glad for you With some faltered excuse for getting out of the room the subject of this untimely felicitation escaped Her brain seethed with horrid conjectures Here was a furtherance of her phantom plans for which she was wholly unprepared Doubtless Gloria had something in mind but what could it be When the day of inevitable reckoning should come Darcy could see no adequate solution other than suicide or permanent disappearance Meanwhile Gloria was putting her to the test of the severest judgment by asking her flat mates Don t you think Darcy looks well If beauty is in the eye of the beholder so likewise is the lack of it Having become habituated to regarding their junior partner as aesthetically and femininely negligible the other girls failed to appreciate the vital changes that were in progress Miracles set under our eyes do not arrest us Otherwise we should all stand about in stupefaction watching trees grow She looks healthy granted Maud indifferently And she s a lot more cheerful and lively added Helen But she ll always be well just Darcy Being a scrupulously courteous person Miss Gloria Greene refrained from the prophetic comparison which suggested itself to her annoyed mind as appropriate and contented herself with the inward retort Oh will she Wait until I ve dressed her And then keep a watchful eye on your Holcomb Lees and your Paul Woods On her way out Darcy pounced upon her Gloria What have you let me in for How am I ever going to get out of it Heaven knows returned the actress airily Don t you know Haven t an idea Sufficient unto the day is Unto all the rest of my days I should think interrupted the dolorous Darcy Engagements have to come to a head sometime somehow pointed out Gloria But you ve made this so dreadfully definite Darcy I had to I just couldn t stand Maud s insinuation that you weren t really engaged the cat She as much as said that Montrose Veyze was just having a silly flirtation with you and that you took it au grand serieux What if she knew the awful truth Don t be afraid She won t How are we going to help it Break the engagement there s one way Say the word Darcy my child said Gloria striking a sacrificial attitude and I ll go across and gather in Monty Veyze myself for your sake Isn t there an obstacle on this side of the water suggested Darcy shyly thinking of Jack Remsen Gloria reddened a little Not that any one knows of she returned Anyway if the engagement is broken they ll say he jilted me Then jilt him They d never believe it Probably not assented Gloria And October is awfully near I ll never dare show my face again wailed Darcy Oh I don t know returned the other reassuringly If it were your old face now you might be justified in not wanting to show it Faces change and we change with em as the prophet says It wasn t the prophet and he didn t say that anyway He said Times change and and faces change with em worse luck supplied the actress cheerfully Though all of em don t change for the worse Darcy how much do you weigh she demanded with an abrupt change of tone to the business like One hundred and twenty eight and a half as I go on the gym floor That s good enough The time has come the walrus said to talk of many things of shoes and shirts and chemisettes of hats and eke stockings Clothes cried Darcy her eyes sparkling Clothes Are you prepared in the sight of heaven and earth to spend seven or eight hundred of Aunt Sarah s hard earned on a trousseau Oof Don t say trousseau to me It reminds me Apart from that try me All right What are you going to do tomorrow at three Cover Central Park lengthwise and back in the even hour Andy s orders Far be it from me to interfere

none	none	at ten o clock in the morning Meet me at my place We ll have a sartorial orgy That night Darcy dreamed herself a princess CHAPTER VIII SELFISHNESS says that wise and happy and altogether radiant person Gloria Greene comes from lack of vitality Most people haven t enough capital stock of vigor to live on comfortably So you can t expect them to loan or give away any in the form of thoughtfulness for any one else They re paupers poor things The bankruptest person I ever knew had eighty thousand a year and nothing else Adroitly and by indirection the proponent of this doctrine had been suggesting it to Darcy Cole and that adaptable pupil had unconsciously absorbed much of it The new character that she had built up out of discipline and abstinence as the weeks grew into months the solidifying confidence in herself the burgeoning of vigor and the subtle development of that wondrous and mysterious quality which we term personality and which is the touchstone between our inner and outer worlds had combined to open and broaden Darcy s life Andy Dunne had long ago begun to take certain of his professional problems to her and profit by her shrewd helpfulness More than once she had of her own initiative laid hold on some shrinking draggled disheartened neophyte such as she herself had been who through mere helplessness had reduced Andy to wrathful despair and by a forced loan of will power and buoyancy pulled her through the shallows to fair going again On one occasion she had gone to police court with Andy on behalf of a girl who was going wrong the sister of one Gillig a promising young pugilist under Andy s guidance where she had so impressed the magistrate that seeing her with Andy whom he knew he asked if she was a trainer and hinted that he would be glad of her help on some of the border line cases which reach our lower courts in a status of suspended balance and are either hauled back to safety or plunged into the chasm of the underworld according as they are handled with or without tact and sympathy After that visit Darcy took to dropping in at the court twice a week or so to act as unofficial counselor where the judge mistrusted the mechanical rigidity of official intervention It gave her a fresh zest in life to find herself of some practical use to others As to the extra work she took that upon her supple shoulders without a quiver Body and soul Darcy had grown as fresh and vigorous as ripening fruit and as sturdy as the tree that bears it Satisfying as was the compliment paid her by the magistrate she had a better one from Andy not long after At the conclusion of one of their five minute boxing bouts in the course of which she had landed once with force and precision below the professional s properly cauliflowered ear he said to her with a somewhat hesitant air Say Miss Darcy are yah rich I certainly am not But excuse me if I m too nosey yah got money ain t yah Only what I earn Earn D yah work Of course I m the original Honest Working Girl you read about Andy Pretty good job Fairly Yah wouldn t wanta quit it I guess surmised the trainer For what asked the Wondering Darcy Yah see explained Andy nonchalantly juggling a medicine ball the while since the tight skirt come in I m getting a lot of ladies to train down to their skirts More n I can really handle right Now I kinda thought if you d come in as assistant well yah can name yahr own terms Miss Darcy The girl looked at him with bright and affectionate eyes Andy you re a dear That s the nicest thing that ever happened to me It ain t a proposition I d make to everybody I can tell yah averred the professional In fact I dunno as there s any one else I d make it to but you Except Miss Greene he added loyally I m awfully sorry Andy But I couldn t very well drop my other work No sighed Andy Well I s pose not Well he added palliating the blow to his hopes yah ll be gettin married one of these days and then it d be all off anyhow Married laughed his pupil Who d marry a plain little stick like me in a city full of pretty girls Go wan retorted the other Regarding her candid face he perceived that this was no bluff Go wan he repeated fervidly Get onto yahrself Ain t yah got a mirrah in the house Oh that s just because you like me Andy she returned Nevertheless she thrilled to the rough compliment Holcomb Lee with his artistic sense and now this expert of flesh and blood Was her dream really coming true already That very afternoon it was shattered The Fifth Avenue bus went sliding slewing and curving along the wet pavement Within sat a moist and bedraggled but cheerful Darcy returning from a highly encouraging consultation with mister B Riegel and the head of his color room called in to meet the firm s most promising contributor of designs Another advance in her rates had been foreshadowed so what did Darcy care though forgotten umbrella and overshoes had exposed her to a violent shower now clearing Her Central Park jaunts had hardened her to a point where she disregarded weather with contemptuous indifference So now instead of being huddled in her seat contemplative of her own discomfort she sat alert and interestedly watchful of the outside world that went sliding past her window At the corner of Fifteenth Street the bus skidded to a stop at the signal of a frail poorly dressed young woman who staggered out from the curb lugging a large suitcase in both hands She tried to lift it to the step and failed Now it was nobody s business how the chance fare got on the bus or indeed whether she got on at all or was left standing on the asphalt except the conductor s and he was busy upstairs Certainly it was no affair of Darcy s and the old Darcy would have taken that view in the improbable event of her having noticed the overweighted woman at all The new Darcy was up instinctively and out like a flash She grabbed the case and got a surprise It weighed at least sixty pounds Darcy had the basis for a fairly accurate estimate as she had been recently occupying herself with a sixty pound dumb bell Thanks to a persuasive quality of muscle which this exercise had imparted to her she whisked the ponderous thing to the platform and bore it victoriously inside The woman followed panting out her gratitude As Darcy was setting her burden down the bus gave an unexpected lurch and one end of the case landed upon a slightly projecting shoe The owner of the shoe gave utterance to a startled and pained interjection Oh I m so sorry apologized Darcy shifting the offending bag The injured one turned upon her a smile as unruffled and good humored as if his main enjoyment in life was having heavy things dropped on his feet But there was no recognition in the smile nor in the brief glance which accompanied it Yet the smiler was mister Jacob Remsen Entirely my fault said he Teach me to keep my feet out of the aisle Darcy murmured something muffled and incoherent Let me stow that for you offered Remsen and finding a spot for it beneath the steps deposited it there bowed in response to the thanks of the two women and resumed his seat The newcomer slipped in beside Darcy You work don t you asked she timidly Yes What makes you think so Because you re so kind And you re awful strong That suitcase is much too heavy for you You ll injure yourself with it said Darcy who was no larger than the other severely Metal advertising cuts explained the other I only have to carry it twice a week Where to Thirtieth over beyond Third Av nyeh But that s a terribly long way to carry that weight The woman sighed Yes I know It s nearer by the Fourth Av nyeh line but I go this way because the bus conductors are so decent about helpin you on and off said she paying a merited compliment to the most courteous and serviceable of New York s transportation employees It s worth the extra nickel I ll get off with you and give you a lift Different arrangements however were in process Nearing the corner of the prospective debarkation mister Jacob Remsen arose walked to the door and vigorously yanked the corpulent valise from its nook I beg your pardon said he dividing his impersonal and courteous regard between the two occupants of the seat but I overheard your conversation It just happens that I m bound for Third Avenue myself So if you will permit me Darcy s companion abashed by the elegance of this obvious swell wriggled and fluttered and protested mister Remsen paid no heed Here we are he announced cheerily stepping to the pavement Watch your step Thus overruled the woman followed The assumer of burdens not his own attained the sidewalk and all but dislocated his neck by the jerk with which he turned it as a voice from the departing bus said clearly and as he thought a shade maliciously Thank you mister Remsen The malice was there It was a reflex of Miss Darcy Cole s resentment in that apart from any question of recognition mister Jacob Remsen had failed to see in one casual glance at her face anything which impelled him to bestow a second glance Genuine though they had been the testimonials of Messrs Andy Dunne and Holcomb Lee were thereby attainted and brought to naught No one to hear Miss Cole s lightsome subsequent report of the occurrence for the benefit of Gloria Greene would have dreamed that it had left a sting Now what concluded the narrator of the episode do you suppose the magnificent mister Remsen was doing in a scrubby Third Avenue locality Precisely what you were going to do opined Gloria Helping some one who needed his help You mean that that combination of Adonis and Ananias had no real business of his own there at all I can t conceive what it would be Darcy opened wide and luminous eyes Then it was just to be a good fellow Probably You wouldn t think it of Jack Remsen would you I don t know that I wouldn t Why not Oh he gives the impression to those who don t know him of being so particular about himself and so indifferent about all the rest of the world that isn t a Remsen said Gloria D you think so queried Darcy carelessly That wasn t the impression he gave me when I first met him What was your reading of his character oh wise and profound student of human nature If you laugh at me I won t tell you retorted Darcy and as Gloria was openly laughing at her proceeded to do it in the following inventory I thought that if I was a very old plain woman with a lot of bundles or a sick cat or a man in an awful mess I d look to him first in any crowd Jack would like that commented Gloria with her sunlit smile But not if I were a plain little unnoticeable girl Gloria twinkled An afterthought she declared Meaning yourself Meaning myself Liar Well aren t I that kind of a girl And if I aren t why didn t he recall me or even look at me twice Perhaps he s engrossed in his own troubles Didn t look as if he had a trouble in the world No Jack wouldn t if he were to be shot at sunrise Is he Not that I know of But he s going to be exiled or forced into hiding or something evasive and lonely Some boresome family row that threatens to burst into a lawsuit and when it does Jack has to take cover and keep it until it s over so as not to be called as a witness So you needn t feel insulted simply because he is brooding on his own affairs to the neglect I m not feeling insulted denied the girl vigorously It s nothing to me whether people remember me or not Suddenly her face sparkled and her mobile lips quivered delicately with suppressed glee Oh but I have been insulted I ve saved it up to tell you Business of listening eagerly said the actress Who did it A man Naturally Hence the dimple She pointed an accusing finger at Darcy s cheek Where Mouseley s restaurant on the Circle Gracious child You are peeking around the comers of life Don t you know the Mouse Trap isn t respectable I do now I didn t then Tea was all I wanted The tea was respectable enough It was very good tea Never mind the tea Tell me the rest He the man came over to my table He wasn t a bad looking man at all so freshcolored and pinky brown and dressed like the back page of a magazine And he called me Darcy chuckled most reprehensibly at this point he called me Miss Glad Eyes Did you shoo him away I told him he d made a mistake and he said he d like to make one like it every day in the week and pulled out a chair and sat down It was awfully funny It sounds so What did you do then I don t know what I d have done but I didn t have to do anything Another man came up Two murmured Gloria Shades of Circe Well This one had a funny ear and short hair and he said You don t know me miss But I seen you workin out at Andy s My name s Gillig You done a good turn for my kid sister once and I ain t forgot it So I said How do you do mister Gillig I can t introduce you to this other gentleman because he helped himself to this chair without mentioning his name That kind does mister Gillig said He d better take a run My pinky brown caller didn t seem to take to the suggestion Maybe so maybe not he said I belong to the Bouncers Union myself Then mister Gillig looked at him hard and said I m Spike Gillig the welter weight I don t practice me art for me health Yes he did Gloria he spoke of it as his art And I ain t strong for scrappin out of business hours he said But I ain t goin to sit by and see any rough stuff pulled on this young lady Whad dye mean rough stuff said the other man quite dignified and injured Lemme tell you I m as much a gent as you are And I ain t duckin any muss professional or amachure My weight is a hundred and eighty stripped beggin Miss Peach s pardon and if you wanta know who I am I m Scrap Gilfillan shortstop of the Marvels comin champions of the world But if you say this lady is a friend of yours For some reason Gloria that seemed to make mister Gillig awfully angry He got purple clear to his ears and growled She ain t no friend of mine See This is a lady this is I gotcha the shortstop man said He turned to me Am I in wrong miss Was you ever to this joint before Never I told him Apologies all round he said quite handsomely And if no offense is taken where none s meant would the two of you kindly have one little one with me just to prove it Lovely cried the entranced Gloria What did you do This is important Oh this is most awfully important Do rippled the girl I took sarsaparilla Darcy Cole formerly Amanda Darcy Cole said Gloria solemnly Come to my arms I hereby declare you a full Fellow of the Institute of Life free of its brotherhood equipped to come and go in all its ways unafraid and unembarrassed by any complication Blessed are those who are not too meek for they shall take their own share of the earth without waiting forever to inherit it Go forth and take yours You ll like it I love it And I m not afraid of it any more It d better be afraid of you commented Gloria regarding the vivid youth flushed creature before her Wait till I get you dressed up to your looks Are you ready to gird on your armor for the campaign I m dying with impatience We ll have a taxi by the hour and go forth to wallow in clothing Oh my blessed young protegee but you re going to make some trouble for this neglectful old world of ours before you wither or I miss my guess I shan t returned the girl demurely but with dancing eyes unless it calls me Poor Darcy CHAPTER IX WHILE life and the lust of lovely things remain to Darcy Cole she will not forget the thrilling experience of that day and other shopping days to follow When it was all over she possessed Item A dark blue serge business suit cut with a severity of line which on a less graciously girlish figure would have been grim with a small trim expensive hat and the smartest of tan shoes and tan gloves Clad in that Darcy suggested a demure and business like bluebird Item A black and white small checked suit with just a little more latitude of character to it and to go with this black patent leather shoes from the best shop in town and a black sailor hat with a flash of white feather in it In that Darcy resembled a white breasted chat which is perhaps the very most correct and smartest bird that flies Item several items in fact Wonderful but unobvious garments conjured by the magic touch of Gloria from the purchase of a whole bolt of white filmy crepe de chine and several holts of baby blue ribbon together with well chosen odds and ends of laces no less wonderful but much more visible negligees with long lustrous rhythmical lines devised by the same Gloria from the bargain purchase of an odd lot of pink crepe de chine arrayed in which Darcy was able to give herself a very fair imitation of a complacent though pale flamingo Item An evening gown of shimmering silver and blue carried out in the curve of the daintiest of silk stockings to the tip of fairy gift silver slippers and over it a blue velvet wrap lined and trimmed with an old chinchilla coat which Sensible Auntie had given her several years before wherein Darcy felt like some winged and shining thing come down from a moonlit cloud That was the end of eight hundred of Aunt Sarah s hard round beautiful dollars But not of the wonderful trip to Clothes Land For at the last Gloria produced the most stunning of traveling coats dark blue cheviot with a quaint little cape the whole lined with silken gray a gray with a touch of under color to match the blue warmth behind the gray of Darcy s eyes For your wedding present my dear explained Gloria mischievously And when the girl wept for sheer delight her mentor abused her and called her Amanda and threatened her with dreadful reprisals unless she at once dried her eyes so that account could be duly taken of her Of that stock taking Gloria re creatrix made no report to the subject But this is what her gratified eyes saw A girl who held herself straight like an Indian and at ease like an animal Where there had been sallow cheeks and an unwholesome flabbiness the blood now shone in living pink through the lucent skin The eyes were twice as large as when the year before Darcy had set out upon her determined beauty quest but that was because the sagging lines beneath had disappeared and the eyes themselves deep gray against clear white were softly brilliant with health Above the broad smooth candid forehead the hair so deep brown as to be almost black played the happy truant in little waves and whorls as delicate and errant as blown smoke The chin was set and firm that was Andy Dunne s discipline of soul and body Above it the mouth smiled as naturally and unconsciously as it had formerly drooped and two little dimples had come to live in the comers Beyond and above the sheer formative change in the girl she was so pulsating so palpitant with life that even as she stood quiescent before Gloria s appraising eyes she seemed to sway to some impalpable rhythm of the blood Yet Gloria was not wholly content Hers was a wisdom that went deep The re created Darcy was a notable triumph to be sure looking upon her handiwork Gloria found it good nor did she doubt that others would find it good But what of Darcy s own bearing toward all these changes Had she found herself Until that question was settled in the affirmative Gloria re creatrix would not be satisfied Just the same I d like to see Jack Remsen or any other man look at her as she is now once without looking twice Gloria challenged the masculine world on behalf of her candidate for troubles and honors in the Great Open Lists Not men alone but women as well became addicted to that second look when Darcy passed their way in her new feathers To her housemates the change now forced upon their reluctant acceptance was a matter of bewilderment if not of actual perturbation Holcomb Lee justified of his prophecies exulted over the fact to such a point that Maud Raines felt it her womanly duty to fix a quarrel upon him Undismayed Holcomb took Darcy out to dinner Never never never in the world would I have accepted Gloria that dangerous young person assured her mentor if Maud Raines hadn t been so catty and sneery about Holcomb s drawing me And Miss Raines hastily drowned her trumped up grievance in a flood of alarmed tears Even matter of fact Paul Wood Helen s betrothed was impressed to the point of admiring comment That chrysalis has hatched for fair said he Hatched retorted Helen It didn t hatch It exploded She and Maud wished to know not without asperity first why Darcy was getting her trousseau in advance of the season next why she was wearing it item by item Darcy was wearing the unaccustomed finery for a perfectly sound and feminine reason which she did not feel called upon to expound for the enlightenment of the two fiancees She felt taller straighter and more independent in it Moreover she found it a business asset Palpably affected by the richness and variety of her wardrobe B Riegel had proffered a guarantee basis of work which assured her future income Thus the clothes bade fair to pay for themselves But on alternate afternoons Darcy faithful to her training garbed herself in rusty sweater short skirt and shapeless shoes and did her stunt through Central Park Her term at Andy s academy having expired she had taken on a new schedule of two hours per week that being all her preceptor assured her that was needed for the preservation of her fitness to jump in the ring and put em up with the Big Feller himself at the clang of the bell A slight exaggeration but to Darcy a grateful one With ever growing approval Gloria saw the girl accomplish that distinctively feminine feat known as settling into your clothes My dear she remarked one day when the two had come in from a walk if Monty Veyze could see us together now I wouldn t have a chance with him Darcy grabbed and hugged her You re talking nonsense and you know it No man in the world would look at me if you were in the same block Wouldn t they retorted the actress ungrammatically I d hate to put it to the test of a regular constituted jury I d have to bar mister Remsen from the jury box smiled Darcy Have you seen Jack again Ran into him plop on Fifth Avenue yesterday Were you in your best bib and tucker The black and white check Did he look through you asked the actress N not exactly Did he look past you asked the actress N o o o Well did he look at you she persisted Yes But he didn t know me I m sure he didn t chuckled Gloria Didn t you bow to him she added Next time you meet a nice young man like Jack Remsen you march straight up to him and take him by the beard He hasn t got a beard metaphorically speaking and ask him if he isn t ashamed of himself for not remembering you He will be Oh never fear he will be Darcy pursed her red lips up to a funny little assumption of prudery He d think me a forward young hussy Let him You ve been backward long enough I I I haven t really got used to to the new feeling yet said the girl shyly To being pretty Say it out It s easy enough to get used to Just feel as pretty as you look Go on a perpetual parade until you learn the right kind of self consciousness Being a woman is an asset not a liability in life When you ve absorbed that powerful truth come to me and I ll impart some more wisdom She fell into thought Darcy she said portentously Well I ve got a grand and glorious idea for a grand and glorious feeling like mister Briggs s Don t keep me waiting I can t stand suspense I m going to give a party for you with the brides for side dishes but principally to celebrate your graduation Oh joy cried Darcy Joy proved to be a mild and inexpressive word for the party So far as Miss Darcy Cole was concerned it was a triumph The two brides each sufficiently attractive in her own type simply paled away before their unconsidered flat mate Gloria didn t pale away No rivalry could shadow her superb individuality With her guest of honor she shared the laurels of a victorious evening Stimulated to her best self by the realization of success conscious of a buoyant body perfectly clad and a soaring spirit Darcy unwittingly took and held the center of the stage into which Gloria cunningly and unobtrusively maneuvered her At the end of the long night of fun Miss Cole sat enthroned Miss Cole had sung like a lark Miss Cole had danced like an elf Miss Cole had laughed like a spirit of mirth Miss Cole had fairly radiated a wholesome keen full blooded high spirited gayety and happiness shot through with that indefinable glow of womanhood which is as mysterious and unmistakable as the firefly s light and perhaps as unconsciously purposeful One thing only detracted from Gloria Greene s satisfaction in the triumph of her protegee Jacob Remsen had not been a witness to it mister Remsen was in retirement I do want you and Jack to like each other said Gloria to Darcy in the inevitable talk over which followed the grand triumphal party Of course returned the girl softly and warmly regarding her friend And of course I m going to like him just as hard as ever I can if he ll let me For your sake was the implication of that warmth which would have considerably astonished Gloria had she appreciated it But how should she know the interpretation given by the girl to that casual kiss overseen in the studio Gloria s mind was running in quite a different direction Sequels to the party and to Darcy s success were promptly manifested in the form of sundry boxes and parcels bearing fashionable trade insignia which flowed in upon Bachelor Girls Hall But not for Miss Raines or Miss Barrett Out of her sumptuous surplus Miss Cole was pleased to present a dozen American Beauty roses to Miss Raines and a five pound box of special candies to Miss Barrett explaining kindly that she could not possibly use them herself That was the glory crowned summit of a delicate revenge long overdue Poor Darcy indeed So Darcy came into her own One year Gloria had given her The year had

none	none	gone But most of Aunt Sarah s gift had Who cared Not Darcy She had won her heritage of womanhood Where a few brief months before and she could laugh now at the pangs and hardships of those months which were so small a price to pay for the results she had looked a worn thirty years old and felt like a sapless leaf she now looked a budding twenty and felt like a baby with a drum Life was her drum All its stirring rataplan however could not quite drown out the grim voice of reckoning which spoke with the accent of Sir Montrose Veyze Bart of Veyze Holdings Hampshire England CHAPTER X 
6064_300880_000001_000000	train-clean-100	FIVE times mister Thomas Harmon vainly rang the bell of the Remsen mansion While engaged upon the sixth variation he became aware of a face in the window scrutinizing him

6064_300880_000057_000002	train-clean-100	How would it be if the taxi I arrive in should catch fire at the psychological moment

6064_300880_000068_000002	train-clean-100	Cheery o said his host Britishly 
6064_300880_000069_000000	train-clean-100	Promptly at that hour on the second morning thereafter a taxicab swerved violently into the curbstone almost at the feet of the patient and vigilant Murphy and stopped with an alarming scrunch of brakes From its window emerged a heavy puff of smoke 
6064_300880_000069_000001	train-clean-100	From its door emerged mister Thomas Harmon who rolled upon the pavement apparently strangling mister Murphy rushed to his aid 
6064_300880_000069_000002	train-clean-100	When he was restored to his feet and his breath and the taxi had ceased to imitate Fafnir the Dragon a tall figure in an extremely English ulster which had hastily emerged from the Remsen front door rushed down ten steps and leisurely climbed them again was wrenching violently at the bell 
6064_300880_000069_000003	train-clean-100	For a time mister Murphy regarded him disdainfully then crossed over held brief colloquy and returned 
6064_300880_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 Hot chance he s got of breaking in he observed to mister Harmon 
6064_300880_000071_000000	train-clean-100	 What is he making all the fuss about inquired that gentleman as the visitor again applied himself forcefully to the bell 
6064_300880_000072_000000	train-clean-100	 Wants to see mister Remsen 
6064_300880_000072_000001	train-clean-100	But the old bulldog of a butler won t let him put his nose inside the door

6064_300880_000073_000002	train-clean-100	It was done almost as well as that accomplished actor mister Jacob Remsen could have done it 
none	none	Harmon sprang across the street Carteret Roddy Carteret he called
6064_300880_000074_000002	train-clean-100	 What on earth are you doing over here 
6064_300880_000074_000003	train-clean-100	The bell ringer adjusted a monocle and ambled down the steps to shake hands 
6064_300880_000074_000004	train-clean-100	 Well met m deah fellah 
6064_300880_000074_000005	train-clean-100	Perhaps you can tell me what s amiss with this beastly house 
6064_300880_000075_000000	train-clean-100	 I ll tell you proffered the obliging and innocent mister Murphy 
6064_300880_000075_000001	train-clean-100	He did so 
6064_300880_000076_000000	train-clean-100	 Then I ll just go back and jolly well camp there till somebody jolly well lets me in decided the caller 
6064_300880_000077_000000	train-clean-100	Argument followed while the chauffeur burrowed into the mechanism of his car 
6064_300880_000077_000001	train-clean-100	It ended by the Englishman bestowing two dollars upon mister Murphy to get a message to mister Remsen containing a protest and an address 
6064_300880_000077_000002	train-clean-100	The two gentlemen then moved away in the extinguished taxi

6064_300880_000078_000002	train-clean-100	Hardly had he settled when a young couple in suspiciously new apparel arrived and were shown into Drawing Room A at the upper end of the car 
6064_300880_000078_000003	train-clean-100	Shortly after another couple also glistening as to garb entered and took possession of Drawing Room B at the lower end of the car 
none	none	The eluder of justice eyed them and drew his own conclusions
6064_300880_000079_000000	train-clean-100	 Here we are all of us he said to himself retiring discreetly behind his newspaper 
none	none	This was just one short of the full and fateful facts CHAPTER XI ONE into the dim recesses of the past was the nuptial day of October fifteen Gone also into what dim recesses their erstwhile flat mate knew not were missus Holcomb Lee nee Maud Raines and missus Paul Wood nee Helen Barrett Presently Darcy would be gone also for this was October seventeen and although the fact had been successfully concealed from the society editors of the metropolis ever avid of news with a title in it on October sixteen she had been married to Sir Montrose Veyze of Veyze Holdings Hampshire England at the Church of the Imagination Sir Montrose had sent a wireless forged by Miss Gloria Greene advising his fiancee that he would arrive on the sixteenth and they would be married at once All of which would have profoundly astonished and perhaps scandalized the authentic Sir Montrose Veyze at that particular time huddled over an insufficient stove and fervently cursing a Siberian northeaster with three feet of snow in its clouds No little strategy had been required to keep up the deception until after the real brides were wedded and as the conspirators supposed safely out of the way Gloria supplied the required strategy but it exhausted her store What was going to be the outcome she knew no more than Darcy did One fact only was clear Darcy must disappear for a while Accordingly the self appointed manageress of the affair had borrowed Tom Harmon s hospitality for her protegee Unfortunately or fortunately according to the point of view mister Harmon had refrained from mentioning to Gloria the other prospective visits Behold then on the fateful seventeenth of October Miss Darcy Cole a one day bride of fancy swinging down the long platform of the Grand Central Terminal with fifteen minutes to spare for the nine o clock train In her hand was a ticket to Weirs and a small green slip entitling her to seat No twelve in the parlor car Chorea In her eyes was a twinkling and perilous light and in her heart a song of sheer happy bravado For Darcy was feeling in reckless spirits It was her first vacation for more than a year She was tingling with health and vitality She rejoiced in that satisfaction more precious to woman than rubies or diamonds or a conscience clear of reproach the pervading sense of being perfectly dressed As for the wraith of Sir Montrose Veyze Bart of Veyze Holdings Hampshire England and all the consequences depending therefrom she was much in the mood to twiddle her thumbs at the whole affair and defy fate to do its worst She entered the car and saw him If ever a willful skillful careful circumstantial lie came to life and embodiment for the purpose of confronting its perpetrator hers stood before her with a monocle in its eye In every detail it was as she had conceived Sir Montrose Veyze tall slender clad in impeccable tweeds with an intelligent thin face inappropriately half framed in side whiskers and an expression of dissociation with the outside world not so much conscious aloofness as a sort of habitual mental absenteeism The apparition was at the moment trying to dispose an extremely British ulster in a rather insufficient rack Darcy stared at it mute with amazement It moved a little to let her pass and what the girl saw beyond it froze her blood In Drawing Room A sat Paul Wood and his bride Flight instant and precipitate was Darcy s one idea flight forth from that unchancy car She whirled around started for the lower exit took three steps and halted with a choked cry In Drawing Room B sat Maud Raines that was with her bridegroom Fate defied had promptly accepted the challenge Darcy was trapped Kentucky cherishes a legend concerning the potency of its moonshine whiskey which is said to be such that one drink of it will inspire a rabbit to spit in the eye of a bulldog Desperation will produce much the same psychological effect in the soul of woman There in monocle and whiskers was Darcy s bulldog And before her and behind her threatened Desperation double barreled Darcy took a short gaspy breath it was all she could get and advanced upon her unwitting victim The apparition had just succeeded in its aerial enterprise with the ulster when it became aware of a mute appeal at its elbow It turned It saw a girlish face suffused with a wonderful warmth of color clear steady eyes with an irresistible plea in them lips that looked both firm and soft and were tremulous at the comers with what might be fear but seemed much like mirth and two perfectly gloved little hands stretched out in welcome No possible doubt about it those hands were held out to the apparition The apparition s face underwent a sort of junior earthquake Its monocle fell out It replaced the doubtful aid to vision It contemplated the creature of bewildering charm and still more bewildering behavior confronting it Hesitatingly its hands went forth to meet those little appealing waiting hands Monty said the girl in a clear ringing happy voice and inexpertly kissed the apparition on the nose Holy Snakes gasped the apparition It took a step backward Its knees caught It collapsed in its chair CHAPTER XII AFTER that one exclamatory lapse from Briticism the tweed clad man sat speechless struggling to regain command over his shattered sensibilities In this laudable endeavor he was severely handicapped by his vis a vis She had turned the chair next his and was now seated facing him with parted lips fluttering color and lovely desperate suppliant eyes a picture to divert the most determined attempt at concentration Please Please she implored like a child holding out her small quivering hands to him Won t you speak to me Why er to be sure To be sure What shall I say for choice Anything Weather Politics Shakespeare and the musical glasses Only talk But I m afraid er there s some beastly mistake you know Pretend it isn t she urged Oh help me pretend it isn t There was the sound of a clicking latch back of her and the tension of the girl s face relaxed a little A second click in front indicated a similar closure of Drawing Room B Darcy took a long breath No longer under observation she enjoyed a truce in which to lay her plans Incidentally she did her newly wed friends the gross injustice of rejoicing that Pullman doors have no keyholes Now I can explain said she composedly Pray do There was lively interest in his tone No I don t know that I can either I m afraid you won t understand Give me a sporting chance at it How very English he was Had he been American she might have appealed to his sense of the jocular and absurd No hope with this ultra British solemnity Well she began desperately there are some people in this car that I don t want to see In the er compartment In both compartments And they mustn t see me Quite so But they ve already seen me Awkward that he murmured Not so awkward as if they d seen me alone They ve seen us Together But er it s no end nice of you you know and and all that sort of thing But why together That s what I m trying to explain She looked at him doubtfully I m finding it rather hard Perhaps you re not supposed to be traveling alone he suggested Now that s quite clever of you Darcy beamed gratitude upon him I m not But I started alone and and You were to meet a a companion who failed you He was really striving to be helpful but Darcy felt herself getting in deeper and deeper No that isn t it at all Then er I may be beastly stupid but er really Blank bewilderment was expressed in every feature of his face including the monocle Not at all returned the girl politely No wonder you find it puzzling It s quite involved Then she took the plunge I m eloping Eloping Her vis a vis dropped his monocle replaced it and stared at Darcy Eloping Impossible Why impossible Don t you elope in England Er personally seldom And never alone Was there a twinkle behind the monocle Were the jokesmiths wrong about the English lack of humor Or had she happily encountered a phenomenon Darcy embraced the hope and changed her strategy in the midst of the assault Here s your chance she said with calm effrontery You see my the other person in my elopement failed to live up to his opportunity Her companion was understood to reflect adversely upon the sanity of the recreant So pursued the girl her color flushing and paling but her eyes unflinchingly steady if you would oh please don t think me dreadful if you could just pretend to be the man It s only for a little while she pleaded Just until we can get away from those people Will you I will he said solemnly I wish you wouldn t say that as if as if we were in church protested the startled Darcy plaintively Ah yes by the way have we been Have we been what To church This isn t Sunday No but you say that we are eloping Just for the present Quite so But is this er before or after Before or Oh Comprehension flooded the girl s mind and colored her cheeks simultaneously After she said in a small gaspy voice We we re married Buck up exhorted her companion Don t take it so hard It will soon be over I merely wished to know in case any question arose When Ye ye yesterday I mean this morning Best stick to yesterday he advised kindly Before nine a m is too early for probability He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes You re not growing faint under the strain I hope inquired Darcy recovering her spirits It isn t that he replied dreamily I am only thinking that things like this do not happen to people I shall count three and if you re still there I shall know well I shall know that my mind is failing and be glad of it Darcy began rather to like her accomplice He was really quite nice though old Count ten she advised It s a better test He began to count slowly and an elderly lady who came down the aisle to take the chair opposite hastily sought the porter with a view to having her seat changed When he had declaimed Ten and opened his eyes the quite startling exclamation which followed convinced the old lady that her caution was well judged The enumerator had found himself facing emptiness Turn around directed a soft voice behind him He pivoted Oh he exclaimed in the most flattering tones of relief The door of Drawing Room B was getting nervous she said So I changed I don t want them to catch my eye They might come out to speak to us Come one come all declaimed the other this chair shall fly from its firm base as soon as I Fine poetry granted the girl But this is prose Nothing of the sort if you ll pardon me Impossible and glorious romance Words by Lewis Carroll Music by Lohengrin mister Brit ling is for seeing it through mister Britling if you re sure that mister H G Wells would be willing to lend you the name I ll chance it Then mister Britling doesn t know his part yet and might get poor me into awful difficulties No we must get out of this car Stamford the next stop said the porter who had overheard in passing Can you put us into another car Darcy asked him Farther away from the restaurant car added her companion and she thanked him with a glance for his shrewdness If they were between the Chorea and the diner her friends would pass them at luncheon time Dey s a obsehvation cah reah cah suggested the porter No extra chahge Darcy immediately rewarded him with a dollar If any one inquires about us she said tell them that we got off at New Haven Yassum What name please maddum No name The lady and gentleman in fourteen and sixteen Fortune had left vacant for their coming a semi retired alcove in the observation car Therein ensconced they took breath and thought and stock of each other Now if you don t mind said the man Who am I Your name is Veyze answered the girl dimpling You re English You re awfully English You re as English as as yourself Happy coincidence Mayn t I have more than one name A full allowance Sir Montrose Veyze of Veyze Holdings Hampshire I say Then I ve come into the title Quite a while ago What you were before your succession you know better than I He caught the point Rodney Carteret at your service he replied Here on a short stay Diplomatic affairs Well mister Carteret I ll remember you forever for helping me out of an awful scrape It must seem dreadfully flitter headed and bad taste and ill bred I can imagine you being flitter headed odd words you Americans use but I really can t conceive of you doing anything ill bred or in bad taste said he with such sincerity that the girl flushed again That s nice of you she responded gratefully considering what I ve done to you Thereupon she proceeded to repay his courtesy by a tissue of fabrications which did credit to her long practice in mendacity You wouldn t understand our American humor she wound up but I put up a joke on my friends in the other car by pretending I was to be married yesterday I won t bore you with the circumstances I was going away for a trip all by my little self and they were to think it was my wedding trip Who would have thought there could be such awful luck as to find them on my train And me without a ghost of a husband to show on my honeymoon until I grabbed you Then you re not actually married or betrothed or anything of the sort he inquired with lively hopefulness Oh but I am engaged she answered reverting to her original fiction My fiance is on duty and can t get away As soon as he comes over we re to be married Now please do you think it s very awful You ve been so good I should hate to have you despise me Oh I m no sort of a despiser he assured her And if I felt like doing a bit of despising I d go out in the woods and despise a toad Certainly I shouldn t try my hand on anything as plucky and resourceful as you Resourcefulness is good as far as it goes said she But could I carry the thing through if my friends come back here and I have to present you I shouldn t concern myself about that he comforted her Surely they won t come Why not Bridal touring couples don t commonly go about seeking other companionship do they Darcy stared How do you know they are on their bridal trip I never told you Surmised it from something my friend mister Thomas Harmon told me Do you know mister Harmon Rah ther I m on my way to his place What place gasped Darcy Boulder Brook he calls it It s up on the edge of the mountains The girl leaned back closed her eyes and began to count slowly One two three four I say broke in the partner of her plot Let a chap in on this What s wrong You said it just now These things do not happen to people You were right They don t Anyhow they ought not to be allowed to Five six seven Oh there s no use counting ten on this She opened her great gray blue eyes wide upon him So m I she announced So m you what Going to Boulder Brook Barely in time did he check the natural rejoinder So are your friends the bridal couples for he bethought himself that if she knew she would doubtless escape from the train at the first station and this astounding and priceless adventure would be abruptly terminated Instead he said May I take you over with me I m having a car at Laconia mister Harmon is having me met at Weirs Weirs is miles nearer Then perhaps you wouldn t mind giving me a lift with you I m for the Bungalow wherever that is And I m for the Farmhouse and the chaperonage of missus Bond So it isn t as terribly compromising as it sounds is it Though what in the world mister Harmon would think if this ever got to his ears It won t In any case Harmon is not a thinker of evil Nevertheless the girl saw trouble in his eyes Partly it was her innocence partly the bravado to which the emergency of the day had strung her which kept that same trouble out of her own eyes With him it attained speech How old are you Across his shoulder Darcy s eye caught a number on the paneled side of the car Twenty six she lied promptly He was taken aback Really he murmured I should have said aw much younger Are you sure you appreciate the possible well er misconstructions to which this visit might give rise I don t see why it should returned Darcy stoutly Anyway I ve no other place to go But I could put off my trip That would be a nuisance to you wouldn t it To be quite frank it would be rather more than that I should risk getting caught Caught echoed Darcy interestedly It sounds thrilling Are you a fugitive from justice No I m a fugitive from injustice See here Miss Romancia I m something of a faker myself Being up against it good I m going to fess up Faker Up against it Why why where s your English accent gone Cut out Pretty soon I m going to do the same with these whiskers They tickle So many surprises had been forced upon Darcy that inured to them she was able to sustain this one unperturbed It s a wonderful disguise she approved And you play the part beautifully But if the question isn t indiscreet why As I indicated I m flying for my life Then I hope it s something thrilling like murder or arson and not something petty like bigamy or fancy finance Nothing as interesting as crime I m wanted as a witness in a will case They re trying to catch me and put me on the stand and make me testify that my great uncle was a crafty and vicious old lunatic When he wasn t How horrid When he was That s horrider And that others of my relatives were roues and scandalmongers and drunkards I seem to have eloped into a nice cheerful sort of family observed the girl It ll be a lot less cheerful if they ever get me on the stand My lawyer was to have warned me in time to get away but the other side stole a march on him and I barely managed to sneak out in this disguise So I was going to lie low at Harmon s place until they gave up the chase But as matters are I can stick to my whiskers and my accent a while longer And really much as I should like to continue this prose poem of ours I think that for the sake of well of appearances I d better go on somewhere else Unless you re quite sure that missus Bond is there and She is broke in Darcy I ve had a telegram In that case In that case you come along in the car with me I won t have your trip spoiled Besides don t you think I have some curiosity in my make up I ve got to see you without yours or perish There was no irruption of the newly weds to complicate matters The pseudo weds had sandwiches and ginger ale in the observation car and sat there getting better acquainted and more content with each other until the Chorea s porter sought them out Drawin rooms is bofe gone he said A got off at Ashlan an B lef at Meredith S pi cioned you all might lak to know His suspicion brought its reward Ten minutes before the arrival at Weirs Darcy s confederate excused himself You get out by yourself he said I ll join you on the platform Not yet comprehending she followed instructions Shortly after there descended in front of the jaw loose and petrified porter the ultra British ulster and the forceful tweed suit enclosing not a bewhiskered moroded and blond Englishman but a smooth faced pleasant vis aged young man who looked out upon the world from his own unaided keen and twink ing eyes As the train pulled out with the porter still bulging incredulous from the door the changeling turned to join his self appointed bride How do you do mister Remsen said she For the second time that day sheer amazement loosed the hinges of mister Jacob Remsen s knees and the wellsprings of mister Jacob Remsen s sincere American speech Well I am jiggered gasped mister Jacob Remsen tottering back against a truck CHAPTER XIII R JACOB REMSEN late Rodney Carteret esquire of Somewhere in England was roused from his Semi paralysis by a broad and bearded native who approached and with a friendly grin inclusive of both parties to the vis a vis inquired Either of yeh Miss Cole for Boulder Brook Both said Darcy Haw barked the native That is we are both going to mister Harmon s Free bus to Boulder Brook proclaimed the humorous native It s jest as well there s two of ye though mister Tom didn t say nothin about more n one Ye won t rattle s much when we hit the rocks I joined the party at the last moment explained the impromptu bridegroom I m for the Bungalow Ye ll be there before ye know it Twenty one mile in twenty eight minutes comin over in the ole boat Their cicerone led the way to the ole boat a large battered comfortably purring car tucked them in with many robes and applied himself to the wheel with an absorption which left them free to resume their own concerns The surrounding mountains were in full panoply of their blazing October foliage a scene to enthrall the dullest vision Notwithstanding mister Remsen s eyes kept straying from those splendors to the face of his companion Attractive though this nearer view was his own face wore the expression of one who painfully seeks the answer to an insoluble riddle The girl answered his look with challenging mockery Don t overheat your poor brain about it she implored He called you Miss Cole said Remsen with furrowed brows Why not since it s my name Cole Cole ruminated her companion No Positively no Positively yes Do you think it s quite gallant in you to forget me entirely First you say I m your husband complained Remsen and now you claim acquaintance with me It isn t fair It muddles one s brain Look at me hard I ve been doing that all day But it doesn t seem to have any result Haven t you ever seen me before Certainly Darcy almost jumped Which time I mean where On the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Fiftieth Street at two point thirty p m September eleventh returned the other as one who recites a well conned lesson You were looking up at an aeroplane and ran into me You wore a black and white checked suit and a most awfully smart little hat and I stood there gawking after you until I was in danger of being arrested for obstructing the traffic Why Frankly because I hadn t seen anything quite like you since I landed and I wanted to make the most of a poor opportunity Then why didn t you lift your hat politely and say How do you do Miss Cole Like that Because by Heavens cried the badgered Remsen I don t know any Miss Cole Think again adjured Darcy There was a blowy windy day on a Fifth Avenue coach when you got off to help a woman with a suitcase Full of burglar s tools or solid gold ingots I don t know which Never thought a suitcase could weigh so much Poor mister Remsen laughed the girl but her eyes were soft as she turned them to him You must have been terribly bored But you were game You didn t see me on the coach I didn t notice any one but the two work ing girls with the suitcase Do you think I could have seen you and forgotten you Be careful You re only making it worse One of the two working girls called after you to thank you didn t she Remsen fell suddenly thoughtful Now I recall the voice did seem familiar But surely Perhaps this will help She hummed softly a passage of the lulling lilting song which she had heard from his lips on that memorable day of her great resolve Wait he cried I m getting it Gloria Greene s studio A girl asleep on the divan while I was playing She corrected a change of chord for me But you Never tell me that was you Darcy Cole at your service Well well but stammered Remsen for once in his life wholly confused and bewildered What were you in disguise for I wasn t Then I must have been stone blind that day You had no eyes at all for me said she demurely However that s not to be wondered at If it were somebody else would have to do the wondering My capacity in that direction is totally exhausted Won t you please explain With pleasure If you ll tell me what Miss Cole was enjoying herself greatly What this transformation scene means At the studio you were well Say it she encouraged I was an ugly little toad Remsen made gestures and gurgles of violent protest Not at all But you were well quite different Yes I wasn t very well Nor very happy Judging from appearances you must be about the healthiest and happiest person in the world to day then he retorted Do you know she reproved that your compliments lack subtlety That s easy Because I mean em The native at the wheel made a quarter turn with his head extended his mouth to a point east by north of his right ear and from the corner of it shouted Set tight Here s where she gits kinder streaky Thereupon as at a signal call the car gathered itself together and proceeded to emulate the chamois of the Alps For several frantic leaps and jounces the couple in the back seat preserved the conventionalities Then came a stretch where an ancient humpbacked vein of granite had thrust itself up through the road s surface and all decorum was flung to the winds Miss Cole crossed the car in two bunny jumps and fell upon mister Remsen s neck thrusting his head against the side curtain with such force as to form a bulge which several outreaching trees playfully poked with their branches As further evidence of her affection she stuck her elbow in his eye after which she coyly retreated into her own corner by the aerial route mister Remsen assisted her flight by a method known in football as giving the shoulder He then rose to explain settled squarely upon both her feet and concluded the performance by seating himself on her knees and browsing a mouthful from the veil which was twisted about her hat Taking advantage of a precious but fleeting moment when the car soared like a gull across a bay of mud they both addressed the chauffeur Stop shrieked Miss Cole Schlupff vociferated mister Remsen meaning the same thing But the veil had become involved with his utterance The native brought his boat to a halt just short of a ghastly blind turn screened by a wooded cliff S matter he inquired You re shaking us to bits protested Darcy Please don t go so fast Shucks said the other Call that fast I could do better with a hearse Very likely returned Remsen The passenger in a hearse hasn t anything to say about how he travels We have Ease it up What retort the native might have found was cut off by a persistent trumpeting from around the curve Honk honk Prr rr rrump Honk Honk honk honk Prr rr rrump prr rr rramp Two cars interpreted the native Bel lerin fer help I wouldn t wonder Prob ly bogged down in that mud waller at the foot of the hill One of em sounds like our truck Again the brazen voice of warning and appeal thrilled through the air T is our truck confirmed the chauffeur I know the old caow s voice I pree soom that couple for the boss s cottage is gettin a taste of real country life in the roadin line What couple asked Darcy sitting up Young married pair Got off the train at Meredith At Meredith repeated Darcy in troubled tones There s another couple due from Ashland for the Island All friends of the boss s Like s not that s the other car that s whoopin it up daown there t the foot o the hill Quite a pa ty The gleam of a horrid surmise shone in the look which Darcy turned upon Remsen Do you suppose it could be they Oh it couldn t I m very much afraid it is Oh that would be too awful Don t let it be Maud and Helen If I could help it I would he replied bracing himself for confession I m sure it is your friends In fact Tom Harmon told me they were coming You knew it all the time I did And let me come here without a word of warning The girl s tone rasped Remsen s accusing conscience She spoke like a hurt child whose trust has been betrayed Remsen waited until the chauffeur who had jumped out and was on his way to the scene of distress was beyond hearing Then he said Please don t think me wholly selfish But how was I to know that the presence of other couples I mean other people would be so distressing to you Don t pretend to be stupid she rebuked him There I was a bride without any bridegroom looking for a place to hide myself and you let me run right into the very people of all in the world that I didn t want to see You knew I didn t want to see them I told you so she ended with a suggestion of fearfulness the first thing On the train Before you had a husband he reminded her Now you have one And that makes it worse A thousand times worse Oh why didn t you tell me on the train Suppose I had What would you have done Got off at the next station Jumped out of the window Anything And have been alone in some strange place with nobody to look after you If you d done that I should have felt obligated to get off too You wouldn t Darcy stamped her foot You haven t any right When a lady puts a claim on a gentleman as her husband remonstrated Remsen mildly while he may not have the right to prevent her from jumping out of the window of a moving train at least he may use all fair means to see her through Do you think you ve been fair in this Kamerad I surrender I don t The plain fact is I knew you d run away if I told you and I couldn t bear to lose you after I d miraculously found you again Consequently she accused I am here where the girls are sure to find me married and without a husband or with a husband that they ll discover is bogus What am I going to do List to an inspired idea I ve just thought it out When you see your friends tell them that I didn t get off the train at all I went right on to Montreal And deserted your bride Emergency call on imperative official business Back to morrow or next day or whenever you choose to tell em That ll give you time to arrange things and fix up a good water tight lie No lie could be good enough Wait till we put our heads together over it How can we put our heads together if your head is in Montreal It won t be except for publication to the bridal party It ll be at the Bungalow I m going to carry it there now on foot And stay there until it s time for you to get back from Montreal Precisely When you need your titled Britisher back I ll be ready with the accent and the infernal scratchy whiskers Suppose meantime the bridal couples come wandering about the Bungalow Then I ll take to the woods Lives of the hunted and all that sort of thing Before I m through with all this I may have to disguise myself as a rabbit and learn to twitch my ears It s fearfully risky began the girl It is he confirmed with the woods full of amateur hunters But I ve known rabbits to live to a ripe old age There was an old cottontail on Uncle Simeon s place Please don t joke It s fearfully serious for me I ve got to go ahead and face the girls Say the word and I ll gird my gospel armour on I mean my side burns and support you Yes and what would our frisky chauffeur think of that Gracious goodness I forgot about him What will he think about your disappearance if you run away now Leave him to me I ve got an argument for him The native reappeared with the information that the truck was bemired and that the garage car in which one couple had arrived from Ashland the motor boat having broken down was unable to pull it out unaided Therefore he told them he would have to go to the rescue with his car mister Remsen produced a roll of greenbacks Have you any aversion to a ten dollar bill he inquired I ain t never knowed one teh make me sick t my stommick yet confessed the native Try this one said Remsen But the speeder withheld his hand What am I bein hired fer To tell me a short cut by foot to the Bungalow Over this hill and yeh can see it Only house in sight Whut else To ferget that you ve seen me Nuthin fishy about this inquired the cautious chauffeur It s just a little joke on the people in front My mem ry said the other pocketing the bill ain t whut it was I c n t ba ly rec lect t say Thank ye but there my power gives out Some one cornin aroun the bend he added Remsen made a dive into the underbrush From somewhere above Darcy a moment later a tree found voice to speak like a dryad I ll be at your call to morrow At the elbow of the road appeared Maud and Holcomb Lee Darcy envying Daniel what has been regarded as one of the most trying experiences in the records of animal training walked forward to meet them Her head was high Her chin was firm Her step was light Her eyes danced with defiance Andy Dunne would have been proud of her She was game CHAPTER XIV ROUSED into semi wakefulness by the first shaft of sunlight that pierced the Bungalow windows mister Jacob Remsen indulged in sleepy self communion Who are we this morning Not our bright and lovely self That s a cinch Rodney Carteret No we shook Rodney in New York Veyze That s it Montrose Veyze Sir Montrose if you please Oh Lord The bride Unaccustomed though he was to allow the sun s early rays to pry him forth from his slumbers the man of aliases leapt out of bed chuckled himself through his toilet and breakfast and still emitting sub sounds not so much of glee as of a profound and abiding satisfaction in life took the road for Center Harbor Darcy still wrapped in dreams at the Farmhouse would have made the distance in better time nevertheless his hour and a half was a fairly creditable performance In consequence of certain telephonic efforts of the previous evening he expected to find an express package at his destination wherein he was not disappointed At eleven o clock Darcy rambled down the long wooded driveway leading from the Farmhouse to the lake Off to her right where a little brook brawled gayly down among rounded boulders another dryad haunted tree burst into soft familiar music She answered the whistled melody with a pipe of her own as true and sweet Coast clear asked the tree which for a good American hickory spoke with a surprisingly British accent Yes Come out Just a minute What s my nationality English this morning I thought likely So I put on the regalia The owner of the voice stepped forth in the full panoply of wig whiskers and monocle Darcy surveyed him disparagingly No she decided I don t like it as well as I did Perhaps you prefer the original he suggested modestly I do myself But I was afraid some one might be around Nobody is likely to be here this morning And the rig doesn t fit in with that great box you re carrying What s in it More disguises He uncovered the box and held it out to her Grown on the premises he lied gayly Picked with the dew still on em The girl gathered the blooms into her arms and drew them up to her face with a sudden tender mothering gesture which caused the giver s heart an unaccustomed and disturbing thrill He was well repaid for the trip to Center Harbor How lovely she cried And how good of you What kind are they For reward you may take off your disguise but you must hide if the others come I will he agreed and answered her question They re bride and bridesmaid roses Appropriate to the occasion Darcy had the grace to blush Out of date she said hastily What Already I ve changed my mind was her calm announcement I ve decided that you re not my husband Wedded and Parted by Bertha M Clay Who s the Bertha M that s done this thing to me I am As soon as you left I saw that it wouldn t fit in at all for us to be married The servants here probably visit between house and house And it was bound to come out that I was at the Farmhouse and you at the Bungalow and well don t you see that would look funny if we were married What Jack Remsen saw was that the girl was like the pinkest of the bridesmaid roses when she blushed though a sweeter warmer pink Didn t I go to Montreal then No Though you may have to later There s some legal formality to be gone through yet before we can be married Oh then we re still engaged Indeed yes Don t think you re going to get out of it so easily The legal papers are in Montreal So instead of being married on the sixteenth as we had planned we ve had to wait and you ve brought me up here on your way to Montreal Is this the genial fiction that you ve handed out to your friends the newly weds It is How did they take it Hard Maud that s missus Lee especially feels that she has a terrible weight of responsibility on her shoulders She was going to wire Gloria Greene until I told her that missus Bond the housekeeper is mister Harmon s own second cousin and therefore a fully equipped chaperon Is she said Remsen in surprise How do I know returned the girl innocently She might be I hadn t asked her But I had to invent something to pacify Maud Invention observed the admiring mister Remsen appears to be mere child s play for you Even so it didn t satisfy Maud She quite insisted on my moving over to the Cottage to be under her eye You re not going to do that he cried apprehensively And play the goosiest kind of gooseberry Indeed I m not What comes next Am I to meet the turtledoves If you don t it will look suspicious So it will Let s get it over with then I ll risk a small bet that after meeting Sir Montrose Veyze once they won t care to repeat the experience What are you going to do to them Treat them to an exhibition of British hauteur and superiority Hasn t that sort of thing rather gone out since the war Not in the family into which you ve married my dear young lady With the Veyzes nothing ever comes in and nothing ever goes out Don t you think that would be a good line to spring on them he added with animation You mustn t be too horrid enjoined Darcy I don t want them to think I m marrying a a A lemon supplied the other Speaking of lemons don t you think it would be a pious idea for you to invite your fiance to lunch with you Excellent And you can practice your accent on missus Bond Profound and awesome was the impression made upon that lady She found it only natural that the couple should wander off immediately after the meal though she would have been surprised enough at the actual basis of their desire for seclusion which was that they might work out their plan for the encounter with the honeymooning quartette The boathouse which commands the approach to the Farm was selected for the scene of the presentation About mid afternoon the Lees and the Woods appeared motoring up the lower road and were halted by Darcy who pink and excited indicated a figure on the boathouse porch The figure was tipped back in a chair with its feet on the railing smoking a pipe Come and meet my Monty invited Darcy Upon their approach the figure removed its feet from the railing with obvious reluctance It did not remove its pipe from its face at all To the women it bowed glumly To the men it offered a flabby half portion of hand Holcomb Lee took it and dropped it Paul Wood looked at the fingers presented to him in turn looked at Darcy looked at the sky and observed dispassionately that it looked like rain Vay likely Beastly weathah grunted the other Bad weather makes good fishing they say up here said Helen Wood pleasantly Have you tried it Nothin but sunfishes and little basses they tell me Beastly water You might find the hunting better proffered Maud Lee Huntin Where s one to find a decent mount missus Lee means the shooting dear explained Darcy sweetly Haw Nevah heard shootin called huntin before No decent shootin either Tramped about all mornin and flushed one chippin squirrel He means chipmunk expounded the helpful Darcy Poor Monty finds our American speech so difficult Beastly language murmured the bogus baronet resuming his seat But surely said the kindly spirited Helen you find the mountains beautiful Haw Too crowded No chance to turn about without knockin people s elbows The visitors took a hasty departure Stupid ass growled Lee before they were fairly out of earshot Oh for just one good swing at his fat head yearned the husky Wood Did you ever see such a boor was Helen s contribution to the symposium He s old disclosed the observing Maud That s a wig he had on I d swear to it Poor Darcy Dissolved in mirth Darcy congratulated the amateur upon a highly distinguished performance Did Gloria teach you to act like that she inquired If Gloria would train me he returned I could do something But she won t waste time on an amateur Do you know that she s one of the very best coaches in the profession I know that she s the most wonderful woman in the world What she s done for me It s probably no more than she s done for hundreds of other people said Remsen and launched out into a panegyric of the actress which would have made a press agent feel like an amateur With more experience of men Darcy would have known that this was the language of the highest type of admiration but of nothing more In her innocence she took it as a final confirmation of the scene she had witnessed in the studio Gloria wants you to work doesn t she she asked shyly Gloria s such a tremendous worker herself that she thinks every one ought to be busy on some job all the time Doesn t she get after you You look far too much of the lily of the field type to meet her approval Lily of the field yourself returned the girl indignantly I ve brought a lot of work up here with me Can you say the same Guilty I m jobless except as your present slave Have you ever done anything worth while in the world Darcy challenged but the smile with which she accompanied the words was indulgent He took silent counsel with himself At a class reunion I once chased a trolley car on a dromedary he said hopefully That made life temporarily happier for a good many people including the dromedary who was conducting the performance Sir Monty my real Sir Monty used to be an officer in a camel corps fabricated Darcy dreamily Now why drag in my fellow fiance just as I was beginning to forget him he expostulated We you he isn t to be forgotten said the girl hastily Of course not I m sorry Tell me about him Attempting to do so Darcy found that the flavor had unaccountably oozed out of her lie Pretense and falsification with this man who had unprotestingly let himself in for an indefinite career of both on his own account to aid a girl whom he didn t even know in what for all he could tell might be only an unworthy prank well it simply went against the grain No I don t believe I will just now she returned I might confuse him with your masterly impersonation Then tell me about yourself What would you have done if you hadn t found a readymade Englishman on the bridal train Heaven only knows Committed suicide I think I may have to come to that yet she said dismally Oh dear The further it goes the worse it gets You ve helped me out for the present but Then let me help you out some more he urged Murder arson forgery bigamy anything you wish I m an outlaw anyway and a crime or two makes no difference to me Underneath his lightness she divined the deeper wish to be of service Take off your disguise she said quietly I want to look at the real you He obeyed and endured the scrutiny of her intent eyes smiling Yes she decided You d be a real friend I could trust you And I want to Oh I do want to I m in an awful mess Probably it isn t nearly as bad as it looks Trot it out and let s examine it But it isn t my secret alone I ve got a a partner The wicked partner She isn t wicked Oh it s a she The shadows deepen And I ve promised a hope to die promise Beg off from it She jumped up clapping her hands like a child I ll try You go home now and don t touch your telephone for it s a party wire and I m going to phone a night letter to my partner This is the night letter which went to Gloria Greene Will you release me from promise and let me tell one person very near to you who can help Also may I tell same person that I know about you two Darcy The entire telegram puzzled the recipient more than a little particularly the last portion Not understanding she took the wisest course and played safe by wiring a veto The wording of her reply caused much painful puzzlement in the virginal breast of the lady telegraph operator who on the following morning thus phoned it to Miss Darcy Cole This the Farmhouse That Miss Cole I gotta telegram f r you Miss Cole an I d knowz I ken make it all out Sounds queer t me Shall I get a repeat Give it t you first All right Jussuz you say Ready Miss Dassy Cole The Farm Boulder Brook No Don t dare trust you with the truth You do too well with the other thing Get that yes s funny ain t it There s funnier comin Ready Keep it up till you hear from me by following letter Now comes the queer part Don t be a damp hool Get that Yes hool Me don t know what a hool is Spell it D a m p got hat H double o l Got that Well mebbe it is funny but I don t get no laughter out of it What Oh yes of course Signed Gloria Want me to get a repeat No Jussuz you say I m sat sfied if you are But theh ain t no sech a word in my dictionary I jest looked it up Miss Darcy Cole gazing out into a worldful of rain mused upon the message with its definite inhibition For a moment she was tempted to derive some compensating mirth from the telegram by calling up the telegraph lady advising her to re read the cryptic sentence which had so disturbed her professional calm by dividing the two words after the m instead of the p and then listening for the reaction to the shock But this she dismissed as not worth while But I think I am one she reflected drearily not to make Gloria release me anyway CHAPTER XV MISS DARCY COLE sat on the edge of Red Rock swinging twenty dollars worth of the very smartest obtainable boots the personal selection of Miss Gloria Greene over two hundred feet of shimmering October air Behind her mister Jacob Remsen was using the residue of the atmosphere to replenish his exhausted lungs for he had undertaken to keep pace with his companion up the face of the declivity with all but fatal results It is not well for a man who has been cooped up within a city house exerciseless and under the espionage of a minion of the law to compete on a thirty per cent grade with a woman who has just come from the training of Andy Dunne Lack of her accustomed outdoor exercise had simply lent zest to Darcy Three days before the rains had descended and the floods had come and kept on coming Now when the skies of this mountain region set out seriously to rain the local ducks borrow mackintoshes Several times the visitor at the Farmhouse had ventured forth only to be promptly beaten back to shelter There she would have led a lonely existence for the bridal couples were weather bound and even the rural delivery was cut off so that the promised letter from Gloria hadn t arrived had it not been for her neighbor of the Bungalow Each morning he waded over the soaking mile and of course in such weather a decent sense of hospitality compelled his hostess to keep him for luncheon and dinner So they had come to know each other on an inevitable footing of unconscious intimacy better perhaps than they normally would have done in the conventional encounters of a year s acquaintanceship and he played for her and she sang to him and they discussed people and differed about art and agreed about books and quarreled about politics and religion and were wholly and perilously content with one another and the situation On the afternoon of the fourth day the sun broke gloriously through and Darcy challenged Remsen to make the precipitous ascent of the front of Red Hill Behold her then at the conclusion serenely overlooking the lowland and the lake while her companion stretched out panting behind her This is a peak on the Siberian front she announced And I m an outpost What do you see Sister Anne Wait and I ll tell you An aeroplane she pointed to a wheeling crow above them has just signaled me Caw said the crow Thank you said Darcy and threw the bird a kiss that a regiment is coming up from below There s the advance guard She pointed down the sheer rock Remsen moved across and looked over the edge That spider he inquired unimaginatively He s just pretending to be a spider But he s really a spy disguised as a spider Now the question is Shall I drop this bomb on him She held a pebble above the toiling crawler War is hell observed Remsen lazily Why add to its horrors How far away it all seems said the girl dreamily Do you suppose over there it s beautiful and peaceful like this hillside one day and then the next I guess I ll let my spy spider live she broke off dropping her chin in her hand Remsen sat down at her side What s your soldier man like he asked abruptly What Who inquired the startled Darcy Oh Monty Gloria s insufficient sketch came to her aid Why he s short and round and roly poly Then I don t give a very exact imitation of him do I Not very And he s red and fierce looking with a stubby scrubby mustache she added augmenting Gloria s description Her companion stared Not what I should call a particularly enthusiastic portaiture Oh but of course he s awfully nice she made haste to amend Not really a bit fierce you know but very brave and and eagerly casting about a lovely voice What kind Barytone And you sing together he asked gloomily Oh lots I suppose so He gathered some loose stones and began idly to drop them over the rock s crest There You ve given the alarm to the spy she accused See him wigwagging at you Now he ll go and report Darcy Well You don t mind my calling you Darcy do you N n no I like it I wonder if you ll mind what I m going to say now I don t believe I should mind anything you would say It s about the little song The one that you set right for me Our song Our song he repeated with a wistful emphasis on the pronoun Darcy you won t sing that to him will you No she said Her eyes were dimly troubled and would not meet his I won t sing that to any one again Thank you he said humbly Oh look she cried with an effort at gayety The enemy They approach Let s go and meet em She jumped to her feet and pointed to a far stretch of the road where four figures were slowly moving along That means I ve got to put on my infernal whiskers and wig he groaned Just think how long a vacation you ve had from them she reproached him And my still more uncomfortable manners Tone them down a little she advised I think Holcomb and Paul are just about ready to turn on the haughty Britisher and rend him limb from limb Don t blame em he said lazily But they seem to be turning off toward the village he added peering down into the valley And the girls are coming on said Darcy Probably they ve got the mail With foreign letters said Remsen jealously Did you leave a forwarding address She shot a swift indirect look at him But he was gazing out over the regally garbed forest spread below them Come along she urged We must hurry We ll take the Bungalow trail and I ll wait while you put on your Veyze outfit Then we ll catch the girls on their return from the Farm Having carried through the first part of this programme they took the road together and presently came upon the two brides Maud bore a folded newspaper as if it were a truncheon of official authority Her expression was stem and important Helen was obviously struggling with a tendency to hysterical excitement Upon catching sight of Darcy and her escort Maud marched with an almost military front straight upon them her fellow bride acting as rear guard Darcy said Maud ignoring the now perfectly whiskered fiance I should like to speak to you alone A qualm of mingled intuition and caution warned Darcy What about Maud she asked A private matter which your fiance can hear later returned the uncompromising Maud Please Darcy added Helen Not at all returned the girl with spirit Has it anything to do with Monty It has a great deal to do with him was the grim response Then he should hear it at the same time Haw By all means Haw confirmed the fiance bringing his monocle to bear upon Maud and Helen in turn Very well said Maud in a your blood be on your own head voice Read that She thrust the newspaper into Darcy s hand pointing to a penciled paragraph on the front page To Darcy s eternal credit be it said she succeeded in preserving a calm and unperturbed face while she read the paragraph and then passed it to her waiting fiance It informed the world that for distinguished service in the aerial corps the King of England had on the previous day personally decorated Sir Montrose Veyze Bart of Veyze Holdings Hampshire England CHAPTER XVI FOR the death disappearance or capture of Sir Montrose Veyze of Veyze Holdings Hampshire England Darcy was duly prepared in a spirit of Christian fortitude and resignation That fame might mark him out thus forcing the issue for her was wholly unforeseen It took her completely aback The Darcy of a year before would have collapsed miserably under it But this was a different Darcy She faced the accuser with a quiet smile back of which her thoughts ran desperately around in circles like a bevy of little rabbits cut off from cover You ve read what it says in the newspaper said Maud in the accents of a cross examining counsel Yes Oh certainly Then perhaps you can explain Darcy shot a swift glance at the bogus Sir Montrose He also was smiling Most illogically Darcy s heart began to sing a little private Hymn of Hate of its own What did he mean by standing there with a sickly grin on his silly face when the whole fabric of their mutual pretense was being riddled Herein she was ungrateful as well as illogical The face was silly because she had compelled him to make it so As for the rest the smile was good enough of its kind He was not smiling because he felt like it but to conceal the fact that he was doing some high pressure thinking of his own From the smirking countenance of her ally Darcy turned to the lowering front of the enemy Well you see she said with an air of great candor after deliberately tearing out the paragraph it s rather an involved matter I don t see anything involved about it returned the lofty and determined Maud Who is this man Yes who is he echoed Helen coming mildly to her support From the corner of her eye the badgered girl could see the object of the inquiry Still smiling It was too much Then and there Darcy committed that ignoble act known and reprehended in the higher sporting circles wherein Andy Dunne moves as passing the buck You tell them Monty she said sweetly Of a great statesman now dead it has been written Cheated by treachery and beguiled by Fate Once in his life we well may call him great Thus with mister Jacob Remsen alias Sir Montrose Veyze Out of conscious nothing he had in that precious moment s respite evoked an instantaneous and full fledged plan to meet the crisis Fixing upon Maud as the more formidable antagonist he impaled her on the beam of his monocle Haw he ejaculated You ve heard about the Veyze Succession I assume Never said Maud stoutly What Nevah heard of the King s Judgment Why my deah lady we re as well known as the Tower of London or the the Crystal Palace In America you see explained the more pacific Helen these things don t get to us But I assuah you cried the other turning his glassy regard upon her your atrocious American press has been quite full of it from time to time Come now You re spoofing me You must have read of the Veyze divided title What Hypnotized by the glare of the monocle Helen s imagination inspired her to confess that she did vaguely recall something about it which was the more gratifying to the representative of the Veyzes in that he had introduced the press feature on the inspiration of the moment The less impressionable Maud was not to be diverted from the main issue Even if we knew all about your family it would not explain Sir Montrose Veyze being here in America at the same time that he is being received by the King in London Wearing two swords Doesn t the press report mention that It should put in the Veyze representative conscientiously piling up picturesque detail to embellish and fortify his case Don t forget that please It s a Veyze prerogative Is it a Veyze prerogative to be in two places at once queried the cross examiner Or there aren t two of you I suppose Of cawse The accused delivered the answer in a tone of calm and wondering contempt Obviously he was incredulous that such ignorance as his interrogator displayed could exist in a Christian country Two Sir Montrose Veyzes Of the same name and title Maud was glaring now Of cawse The famous Veyze twins Though we re not rahlly twins any more you understand Under the calm and steady beam of the monocle Maud weakened What are you famous for she asked more amenably Because there are two of us to the divided title Bally hard for an American to understand I m afraid It begins back in the early days of the title quite before Columbus landed the Puritans at Bunker Hill you know Columbus wasn t a Puritan dear corrected Darcy No Nevah heard anything against the man s morals that I can recall Never mind Columbus said the interested Helen Do tell us about the Veyzes Right o Two brothers were born twins d you see There was some natural confusion Which was the heir born first you know Nobody could tell The King was stayin at Veyze Holdings then for the shootin very famous shootin The family referred it to him Would he play the part of Solomon and decide His Majesty graciously acceded to the request He decreed that the title should thenceforth be a dual one It s remained so ever since We don t produce twins any more but the two eldest sons of the line inherit title and property jointly and each carries two swords at court There s Sir Montrose and Sir Montrose II I m II Illustration There are two of us to the divided title two hundred thirty six How romantic breathed Helen Rah ther We pride ourselves on that sort of thing we Veyzes As the glory of his performance developed before her enraptured mind the Hymn of Hate died out within Darcy to be succeeded by a Paean of Praise And now said she severely I should think you girls might have the decency to apologize to Sir Montrose Rah ther confirmed her ally I m awfully sorry said Helen contritely I ll apologize when I m proved wrong returned missus Lee dubiously We ll know soon enough Yes And how mister Wood is trying to get the British Embassy on long distance phone My respects to Lord Wyncombe said the undisturbed suspect But why go to so much trouble Surely there s a simpler way How asked Darcy wondering what fresh audacity was developing in that fertile brain Don t you have er public libraries in your American towns Certainly Then perhaps there is one at Center Harbor There is answered Helen so promptly that Darcy shot a glance of suspicion at her What more easy than to drive over there at once observed the suspect blandly and consult their Burke Burke s Peerage you mean said Darcy Perhaps they haven t one They haven t blurted Maud and stopped reddening Apparently you ve tried remarked Darcy witheringly We appreciate your interest But Sir Montrose II was painfully shocked Not got a Burke he exclaimed Unbelievable What a country I ll send for one at once Impressed despite herself Maud Lee hesitated looking from Darcy to her fiance It may be all right she admitted I don t say that it isn t But until it is cleared up beyond a doubt don t you think Darcy you ought to come and stay with us I think not put in Darcy s escort quietly I m taking Miss Cole back to the Farm If you ve nothing further to add Nothing now answered the baffled missus Lee Then we ll bid you good day Safely around the curve they stopped and faced each other You wonderful person giggled Darcy hysterically How did you ever think of it Assuming a grandiose pose he declaimed You may break you may shatter the Veyze if you will But the scent of the Montrose will cling to it still To get down to prose how long will it cling she asked thoughtfully Allowing for inevitable official red tape I should say anywhere from twenty four hours to a month Paul Wood has a cousin in the State Department In that case nearer the twenty four hours than the month Darcy seated herself on a boulder and took her chin into her cupped hands Let me think she murmured Remsen watched her as she considered and would have given much to be able to read her mind Presently she looked up Do you mind leaving me here she inquired Yes he said Why I always mind leaving you It gives me a lost feeling She nodded Yes I know what you mean I feel it too Do you he cried eagerly You ve been so wonderfully good to me all through this queer mess she supplemented a little hurriedly He disregarded this Besides he said I m afraid this is going to be our last walk She looked her startled question What I d like of course he pursued is to stay here and face it through with you But that s going to be worse for you than if I went isn t it I m afraid it is Then it s up to me to leave But what if they find you and take you back to New York I ve got to take the risk They re pretty likely to find out about me here if they undertake a Veyze investigation That s true she cried I ve made this place impossible for you as a refuge Not you I did it myself I d do it again a thousand times for these last four days When would you go To night Eleven o clock Meredith Wait till to morrow His heart leaped We re to have this evening together No she said gently I want this evening to myself I have to think I m a marvelous stimulus to thought he pleaded She shook an obstinate head Might I walk back to the Farm with you No please I d rather you didn t She rose and laid her hand in his You ve been a very parfait gentil knight she said Darcy But she was already swinging up the hill with that free lithe rhythmic pace of hers At the summit she turned and waved For one brief second he saw her sweet flushed profile clear against the sweet flushed sky It disappeared leaving earth and heaven dim and void Remsen turned blindly homeward He knew at last what had happened to him CHAPTER XVII ALL that afternoon and well into the evening Darcy Cole at the Farmhouse sat and wrote and wrote and wrote All that afternoon and well into the evening Jack Remsen at the Bungalow sat and smoked and mused and let his pipe go out and relighted it and mused again All that afternoon and well into the evening the four amateur sleuths at the Lodge waited for a reply from Washington which didn t come At a point a mile or so above these human processes a large cold cloud sprung a million leaks and sifted down a considerable quantity of large soft snowflakes and continued so to do until the air was darkened and the earth whitened with them Through this curtain after a time frightened but determined tramped Darcy Cole Through this curtain tramped also Jack Remsen deep in such trouble of heart as he had never known before and most undetermined Both were headed for the same spot the mailbox at the entrance from the main road to the byway which leads up to the Bungalow Having started considerably earlier than Jack Darcy got there first She opened the box dropped in her note and proceeded to another mail box some distance along the road and opposite the Island where she deposited a second epistle That left her two and a half hours in which to make the ten miles of dark heavy road to Meredith If it were too little she had learned of a trail through meadowland and forest which would cut off nearly two miles Darcy didn t like woods at night most of us don t if we re honest with ourselves but she proposed to catch that train Now an all wise government has ordained that upon rural delivery boxes there shall be a metal flag which works automatically with the raising and the lowering of the lid Upon reaching the Bungalow box shortly after the wayfarer from the Farmhouse had passed Jack Remsen observed with surprise that the flag which he knew to have been down was raised How s this inquired the wayfarer addressing the box I ve been here and got the noon delivery and the postman comes only once a day Yet you re flying signals As the box did not respond Remsen opened it and felt inside Darcy s note rewarded his explorations By the light of successive matches and at the cost of scorched fingers he read it Good bye Knight Your service is over It has been an ungrateful one But I am more grateful than I can say You must not go You must stay I have written to Helen she is the kind one and told her about it just how I dragged you into it to take the real Sir Montrose s place I had to tell her who you were But your secret won t be betrayed So you won t have to go away You ll be safe here I m glad I like to think of you here It s been good hasn t it Perhaps when you are able to come back to New York I ll see you at Gloria s some time I can t say a millionth part of what I want to I couldn t even if there were time You ve been so good to me so good And all you ve had for it is trouble I m sorry Good night Knight D C Even if there were time As has been indicated Jack Remsen s mind could on occasion work swiftly Time for what Why should she be pressed for time Obviously because she was going away And she would leave that note only just before her departure That could mean only the eleven o clock train from Meredith the train he had intended taking before she asked him to postpone his departure until the morrow Of course so that he should get her note On her way to the station she would leave the explanatory and damnatory letter for Helen Wood at the Island Well it would be a long time before that letter reached its addressee Examination of the blanketed ground confirmed his reasoning There were the small clear set footprints infinitely pathetic in the black wildness of the night As he well knew from experience catching up with Darcy Cole when she was set on getting somewhere was a job for the undivided attention of the briskest pedestrian He set out along the road at a dogtrot His first stop was for the purpose of committing a felony punishable by several years in the Federal penitentiary It took him about a second to complete the crime and as he left the rifled mail box behind his inside pocket quite bulged with the fat letter wherein Darcy had set forth her circumstantial but by no means complete confession which was to exculpate her partner and inculpate herself Remsen s heart beat a little faster under that bulky epistle with its contents of courage and self sacrifice At the door of a late autumnal cottage he borrowed a flash With this he could plainly discern the trail of the little feet blurred but not obliterated by the snowfall His watch indicated a quarter after nine He jogged on with high hopes On a long straight level stretch he let himself out for a burst of speed Perhaps from the summit of the hill in which it terminated he might catch a glimpse of her for the moon was now trying its best to send a struggling ray through the flying wrack of cloud Tenderly he pictured to himself the vision of her head up to the storm the strong lithe shoulders squared skimming with that easy effortless pace of hers that had in it all the grace of perfectly controlled vigor Halfway across the open space he slackened up to cast the light of the flash on the road No footmarks were visible Remsen cried out with the shock of his dismay He cast about him on all sides No result Struggling to keep cool he turned back going slowly careful to miss no trace which intent scrutiny might discover A quarter of a mile back he picked up the trail where she had left the road to cross a brooklet and take to the open fields Her object he guessed to cut across a broad and heavily wooded hill thus saving herself some two miles of travel where the road took a wide double curve Eased in his breathing by the enforced slowness of the search he was now able to accelerate his pace Halfway up the open hillside a sudden fury of storm descended lapping him in whirling darkness Ahead of him stretched the dead black line of woodland More by luck than direction he came upon a gateway and thus set foot to the forest path less difficult to discern in such conditions than the open trail of the meadows With his light he could follow it quite easily But when he thought of Darcy lightless and inexperienced in woodcraft with only her strength and her courage to help her wandering in that wilderness his spirit sickened with terror The numbed fingers of the hand which gripped the flash warned him of dropping temperature One might easily freeze on such a night in the open Worst of all the marks in the snow were now all but invisible under the fresh fall He blundered desperately onward shouting her name into the gale as he went There was an answering call He threw his light on She rose from a fallen tree trunk into the arc of radiance I ve been lost she said and walked straight to his arms Just for the comfort and safety and relief of it she clung to him with no other or further thought than that where he was no harm could reach her But now that she was found Rem sen s self control broke under the reaction His arms closed about her With a shock of sweetness amazement and terror she felt his lips on hers and answered them For the briefest instant only The thought of Gloria pierced through the rapture of the moment a poisoned dart She thrust herself back from him her hands on his breast Go away she sobbed You ve no right You know you ve no right As she had thought of Gloria so now he thought of the Briton oversea fighting in his country s service I know he groaned Forgive me She stood back from him staring with bewildered dismayed eyes I forgot for the moment that I m only a counterfeit he pleaded You forgot many things said she slowly Forgive me Darcy he said again It it swept me off my feet the sweetness of it It was base dishonorable anything you want to call it but when I felt you in my arms Oh don t she wailed Will it make it better or worse if I tell you that I love you as I never loved or thought I could love any woman Worse Worse Infinitely worse This is the end of me he said He spoke quietly and in a flat even tone as a man might speak who knew that he was giving up everything in life worth having I ll not offend again But after I d kissed you you had to know I couldn t let you think it anything less than it was the going out to you of a heart that I could no longer control In dishonor If you will have it so The dishonor is mine You are untouched by it Now let us get to other matters Are you hurt No Then you can follow me back he said Where To the Farmhouse I ll never go back to the Farmhouse You must I m going away on this train What good would that do Haven t you read my note to you Of course Otherwise I shouldn t have got on your trail Then you must know that I ve written the whole thing to Helen Wood and even if I wanted to go back now Dismiss that letter from your mind I got it on my way here You took my letter to Helen Did you read it Do you think me dishonorable in everything he returned quietly Oh I m sorry cried the girl impetuously I don t think you dishonorable I know you re not I don t know what to think or do Take this light and hurry back to the Farmhouse I ve still got time for the train Or I ll take you back and make the morning train One thing I cannot and will not do spend another night at the Farm Is that your last word Yes Obstinacy itself was in the monosyllable Then I ll go with you to Meredith I won t let you I ll go he retorted in a tone which ended that discussion Under his guidance and in silence they regained the main road At Center Harbor he succeeded in getting a team to take them the rest of the way Not until the end of the journey did Darcy speak to him What shall you do now I don t know Go somewhere said he gloomily You must go back Boulder Brook without you he said passionately But where else can you go It doesn t matter They stood in silence until her train pulled in I shan t see you again shall I he said wretchedly You ve made it impossible Oh why did you do it she wailed softly With no further word she turned from him and went into the car Remsen stood dazed with misery Forward something was shunted from an express car with a heavy crash There was a babel of voices a moment s delay Darcy flashed out upon the steps again her eyes starry Remsen jumped to meet her She caught his hands in hers with a swift forgiving little pressure I couldn t leave you so she said tremulously You ve been too good to me Good bye and forget Before he could answer she was gone again Until the tail light of the train glimmered into obscurity around the curve Remsen stood uncovered in the gale Then he turned to the miles of lonely road CHAPTER XVIII DARCY in her berth sat huddled up and wide eyed She knew at last what had happened to her The burning memory of that kiss in the woods had left nothing unrevealed to a soul as frank with itself as Darcy s had grown to be She knew too what she had to face There was no doubt or hesitancy in her thoughts no weak attempt to justify herself or find an easy way out If it had been any one but Gloria Greene whose happiness was at stake Gloria who had picked her up from the scrap heap of waste and made a living pulsating eager human creature of her Darcy might have fought for her own hand But how could a man who had loved Gloria Greene and whom Gloria loved care seriously for any other woman on earth No this was only a sudden unreckonable infatuation on Jack Remsen s part Then she recalled the look in his eyes when they parted and knew that her conscience was lying to her heart In any case her course was clear She must be game In her deep trouble her thoughts turned to Gloria the wise kind counsellor the safe refuge But she would not do for this crisis To betray Remsen to her that was unthinkable and nothing short of the whole truth would serve with Gloria Darcy knew that she must fight it out alone Never not even in the old dead days had she felt so alone Human nature being what it is there is nothing strange in the fact that on her return to New York Darcy shrank from meeting Gloria Although the girl s conscience absolved her except for that one instinctive lapse when she had been caught off her guard her sore heart pleaded guilty to the self brought charge of a lasting disloyalty With the thrill of Jack Rem sen s kiss still in her veins how could she face the woman to whom Remsen owed his allegiance the woman who moreover had been the kindest most effectual most unselfish friend of her own unbefriended life Yet there remained to be concluded the obsequies of Sir Montrose Veyze of Veyze Holdings Hampshire England Those remains of unblessed memory must positively be removed from the premises before they gave rise to further and even more painful complications Darcy experienced the grisly emotions of a murderer with an all too obvious corpse to dispose of First of all Gloria s absolution from the promise of secrecy must be obtained which she would doubtless be more than ready to accord now that Sir Montrose had become too heavy a burden to carry also Gloria s advice and aid if she would give it Nerving herself for the encounter Darcy went to see the actress and told her the whole if she herself was to be believed disastrous tale Gloria was too shrewd to believe quite that far There were obvious hesitancies blank spaces and reservations wherever the name and deeds of mister Jacob Remsen alias Sir Montrose Veyze II or in his own proper person entered into the narrative And there was a something in the girl s eyes deep down where the warm gray was lighted to warmer blue which hadn t been there before It completed the woman in her With an inner flush of creative pride Gloria communed with herself upon the new miracle This is a wonderful and lovable thing that I have made Instinctive honesty compelled her however to add But somebody else has given the finishing touch She was too keen an observer not to suspect who her fellow creative artist was Being of the ultra blessed who hold their tongues until it is time to speak Gloria made no comment upon this phase but set her mind singly to the problem in hand as presented by Darcy s recital It s time to own up was her decision I suppose so agreed the girl I don t look forward to telling Maud Let me handle Maud Would you Gloria You are good However well you do it though she added resentfully I suppose I ll be Poor Darcy again without even the compensation of being Such a nice girl Do you feel like Poor Darcy No Do you look like Poor Darcy The girl glanced at the long studio mirror back of her No I don t she replied and two dimples came forward and offered corroborative testimony Then whom is the joke on The dimples vanished On me said their erstwhile proprietor Don t be an imbecile adjured her mentor Can t help it returned Darcy dolefully I ve got the habit Break it Hark to the voice of Pure Reason that s me As long as you were Poor Darcy you had to invent a fiance or go without didn t you Yes And your invention was sure to be a regular old Frankenstein monster and to come back and devour you as soon as you were found out I can hear the clanking of his joints this minute You can t He isn t there If you were still Poor Darcy there d be no hope for you You re not You re something totally different That s your view of it returned the dispirited Darcy But to other It s anybody s view that isn t blind as a bat Half the men you meet are crazy about you Aren t they I haven t met many lately said Darcy demurely You met plenty at our party Even Maud and Helen saw the effect Their eyes bunged out I don t see how their eyes bunging out is going to help explain Sir Montrose Veyze I let alone Sir Montrose Veyze II Why worry when I m here to take the burden from you I propose said Miss Greene relishingly to tell those girls the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth Gloria They ll pass it on and I ll be the laughing stock Will they I dare em to pass it on Why shouldn t they cried the girl It s just the sort of thing that Maud would revel in Allowing that she could get away with it you re right She couldn t Couldn t make people believe it you mean Never Never in the world But it s true Dear and lovely innocence Do you think that helps it to get itself believed Besides the main part of it isn t true I mean it s true that it isn t true and if Maud tells the truth about what isn t true Come out of that skein of metaphysical wool kitten laughed Gloria You re tangled Here s what isn t true that you re Poor Darcy who has to get lovers out of books for lack of em in real life But I have been All right Let Maud tell the people that used to know you and make them believe it There s only a few of them and they don t count As for trying it on any one else all she ll get will be a reputation for green eyed jealousy How would anybody convince Jack Remsen for instance Darcy winced and Gloria s quick sense caught it that you had to invent an imaginary adorer because you couldn t get a real one No indeed The evidence is all against it from Exhibit A Darcy s eyes down to Exhibit Z Darcy s smart little boots For an unattractive girl your little effort of the imagination would be a pathetic desperate ridiculous invention with the laugh on the inventor For an attractive girl it s just a festive little joke Don t you see how it works out The pretty girl that s you can have all the adorers she wants but she prefers to take in her friends by inventing one Is the joke on the girl or her friends One guess Why oh why concluded Gloria addressing the Scheme of the World in a burst of self admiration wasn t I born a professor of logic instead of an actress It sounds reasonable confessed Darcy But will Maud and Helen be clever enough to see it Probably not Then Therefore I shall point it out to them in my inimitable and convincing style with special hints as to the perils and disadvantages of getting a reputation for jealousy of a better looking girl Then that s all settled said Darcy with a sigh Now what about Sir Montrose The real Sir Montrose I mean Well what about him Suppose he should come over here and hear about it He won t He s engaged to an English girl I ve just heard How nice and considerate of him You know Gloria I could almost love that man Could you What about the bogus Sir Montrose asked the actress significantly Darcy flushed faintly Well what about him she echoed How much does he know Not very much Do you think I ought to tell him Does the child expect me to manage her conscience as well as her affairs cried the actress If any one is to tell him you re the one I suppose so assented Darcy spiritlessly and made her farewells in no more cheerful frame of mind than when she had come albeit one load was off her shoulders CHAPTER XIX For a week or more Gloria neither saw nor heard from the girl At the end of that time she did to her surprise encounter the erstwhile bogus Sir Montrose without his hirsute adornments and in his proper person of mister Jacob Remsen sauntering idly along the Park Hailing him she took him into her taxi mister Remsen was not looking his customary sunny self Did the law s minions catch you in spite of your whiskers she asked No Case was compromised So I ve come back And what are you going to do now I m going to work Work You said the actress with unfeigned and unflattering surprise Why What s the answer Ambition replied mister Remsen in a lifeless voice Sounds more like penal servitude commented Gloria And what is to be the scene of your violent endeavors Ask the Government he replied wearily Washington maybe Or perhaps San Francisco or Savannah Or right here in New York for all I know Jerusalem and Madagascar And North and South Amerikee quoted the other Are you about to become an American courier for the peripatetic mister Cook his agency Got a chance to go into the Treasury Department answered Remsen gloomily Don t give up heart she encouraged him Strong young men like you often survive the rigors of that life Pity they don t send you to London where your monocle and your accent would be appreciated By the way have you seen your quondam fiancee since your return No said Remsen Gloria noting that he winced much as Darcy had winced wondered and turned the talk to other topics which gave her opportunity to revolve the problem of the two masqueraders in her mind That there was a problem she was now well assured She took it to luncheon with her after dropping one of the subjects of it and came to a conclusion characteristic of her philosophy and worthy of a mathematician namely that the figures in any problem work out their own solution if properly arranged She decided to do the arranging after luncheon by telephone She sent word to Darcy to meet her at the studio without fail at five Then she got Remsen at his club and told him that a matter of importance had come up about which she wanted to see him at her place about five fifteen Whether she herself could get through her engagements and be back home at that hour she did not know nor particularly care Her duties as hostess did not weigh heavily upon her in this respect Let Jack or Darcy or both reach the place before her it didn t greatly matter Perhaps it would even be better that way Furthermore Gloria Greene was very deeply and happily preoccupied with certain affairs of her most intimate own which will serve to explain a slight vagueness in her usually accurate schedules with consequences quite unforeseen by her managerial self For one of Miss Greene s errands that day had been to send a vitally important telegram which called for an answer in person on the following day That the answer in person might arrive that same day she had not reckoned She had consulted only railway time tables forgetting that far and swift flying chariot of Cupid the high powered automobile ALL things threaten a guilty conscience Haunted by the unlaid ghost of Sir Montrose Veyze Darcy on receipt of Gloria s message fearfully anticipated that some new complication had arisen Having concluded a satisfactory interview with B Riegel Sons whose representative was impressed anew with her splendor she reached Gloria s studio a little before the appointed time The place was empty For a few moments she idled about examining the new pictures glancing casually at books and presently drifted to the piano seat Insensibly guided by memories her fingers wandered into the little soothing cradle song which she had first heard in that very spot from Jack Remsen s lips Long ago it seemed so long ago Once she played it through and then in her tender and liquid voice she crooned it softly She did not hear the door open and close But she felt a light draught of air and the next instant a man s figure loomed through the gathering dusk a man s strong hands fell on her shoulders and a man s glad voice cried Dearest Oh exclaimed Darcy in consternation Good Lord ejaculated the newcomer in an altered and horrified tone Darcy turned to confront Thomas Harmon She had seen him but once but she carried the clearest memory of his quiet eyes his vital personality his big light moving active frame and his persuasively friendly manner mister Harmon was a person not easy to forget Now he was covered with confusion I I really beg your pardon he stammered It was inexcusably stupid of me Darcy held out her hand smiling I m Darcy Cole mister Harmon she said And I have a great deal to thank you for Me said the big man in surprise I d be glad to think so but But you don t know why she concluded kindly intent on putting him at his ease Darcy who a year before would have been on live coals of embarrassment before any strange man You gave me a refuge at Boulder Brook when I very much needed one Oh So you re Gloria s Miss Greene s little friend I hope they made you comfortable Didn t you get a note from me telling you how delightful your place is No But you see I ve been away Just got in They stood looking at each other for a moment the girl demure but dimpling the man still in some confusion of spirit Then encouraged perhaps by the dimples perhaps by some aura of fellowship and understanding which exhaled from the girl Hannon burst out boyishly I ve heard a lot about you Miss Darcy and I believe you re a well a good fellow I am Darcy assured him with absolute conviction Well after the break I made I ve got to tell somebody or bust Tell me invited the girl Whom did you think I was when you rushed on me Gloria of course Gloria Although untrained in fancy gymnastics Darcy s brain whirled around ten times in one direction clicked and whirled around ten times on the reverse She put her hand to her head dizzily striving to readjust her thoughts Isn t it very sudden she faltered About as sudden as Jacob s little affair with Rachel laughed Harmon It s been a seven year siege on my part But Gloria Oh it s been a heap suddener for Gloria In fact she only I only got the word to day And here I am He examined the girl s troubled face You don t look exactly pleased he added crestfallen Indeed you mustn t think that she cried earnestly But I I I thought it was mister Remsen In her bewilderment she blundered on I saw her k k k Too late she strove to catch herself on the brink of a shameful betrayal You saw her kiss Jack he interpreted smiling He s a sort of a third cousin or something and a privileged character anyway I didn t know answered the girl Then recovering herself Oh mister Harmon I am so glad I believe you re just as fine as Gloria is and that s the most any one could say My dear he said more gravely Nobody on earth is that But well I want to shout and sing and Play your music again won t you Maybe that ll help Maybe thought Darcy it would help her too for she also wanted to shout and sing and most contradictorily to hide and cry and wait Forgetful in the turmoil of her mind of the pledge to Jack Remsen about the little song which was to be their one keepsake of those enchanted days in the mountains she turned back to the piano and hummed the melody It s built for a second part commented Harmon Do you mind if I try it So she went over it again and he struck in in a clear charming barytone and with a singularly happy inspiration of a tenor part Over and over it they went she suggesting and he perfecting his second and they were still at it when the door opened again upon deaf ears In the hallway Jack Remsen stopped dead The first thing of which he was conscious was that the voice of the girl he loved and had continued to love against every dictate of conscience and honor was running like sweet fire through his veins again Instantly the fire became bitter and scorching For there was another voice accompanying and fulfilling hers the barytone which she had adduced as one of her British lover s chief charms Remsen had to admit the quality of the voice now raised in his song The song which she had promised to keep as his and hers the one thing which he might claim of her A hot anger rose in his heart and as quickly faded Why shouldn t she sing that song with her lover At most it was an idle promise which he had had no right to exact He conquered an impulse to turn and leave No the thing had to be faced Might as well face it now When the chords died down he advanced to the door and spoke Darcy whirled on her seat and rose very white His one glance told Remsen that she was lovelier than ever Then everything was swallowed up in the amazement of finding Hannon there Harmon alone in the dusk with Darcy where he had expected to find the fiance his song and that charming clear barytone of which Darcy had boasted in Sir Montrose An explanation came to his mind light in the darkness It was just another masquerade Darcy apparently specialized in them and Veyze had been but a blind for Harmon the real lover in the background all the time He felt Harmon wringing his hand in welcome and heard himself saying with a creditable affect of heartiness Then I suppose it s you that I m to congratulate It is returned the other chuckling joyously Though how on earth you knew it I can t conceive Isn t it evident enough said Jack He marched over to Darcy She saw him changed thinned with lines in his smooth face lines of thoughtfulness of self control of achieved manhood and her heart was in her eyes as they met his and drooped And you he said I wish you every happiness I couldn t wish you better than Tom Harmon What cried that complimented but astounded gentleman Me Miss Darcy Well if it isn t you said Jack lifelessly looking from one to the other will you kindly tell It is me but it isn t her broke in Harmon with the superb disregard of grammar suitable to the occasion Man alive it s Gloria As if in confirmation Gloria s voice came to them down the hallway Darcy Where are you child Two chairs which foolishly attempted to impede mister Thomas Harmon s abrupt and athletic progress across the floor were sent to the janitor next day Tom cried Gloria s voice in a breathless and different tone Then the door slammed Jack Remsen turned to Darcy So that s it is it he said slowly That answered Darcy is it Isn t it splendid Couldn t be splendider for those most concerned What about the rest of it The rest of it Her brows were raised in dainty puzzlement but her eyes refused to meet his Where is Veyze On his way back to the East I understand said Darcy carefully When is he coming over Not at all Are you going over there to England No You re not looking me in the face I I don t want to look you in the face You re not pretty when you make a a catechism of yourself Darcy said Remsen there s been something queer about this Veyze business from the start As long as I could help I did didn t I Yes said the girl quite low And I asked no questions No she said even lower But now I ve got to know I ve got a right to know Why It was the merest whisper Because I ve come back loving you more than when you left me I wouldn t have believed it possible But it s so Every hope and wish of my heart is bound up in you Darcy is it broken off between you and Montrose Veyze She raised her eyes to his The color flushed and trembled adorably in her face She spoke clear and sweet as music There never was anything between me and Sir Montrose Veyze You mean said the astounded Remsen that you were only acquaintances If Sir Montrose walked into the room this minute I shouldn t know him But how I made it up All Every bit of it She put her hands together in a posture of half mocking plea Please sir do I have to tell you the whole shameful story He caught the hands between his There s only one thing you have to tell me Darcy Shall I tell you what it is There was no need The hands stole to his shoulders and then around his neck Oh I do I do she breathed There never was any Veyze or any engagement or anything or anybody but just you But Darcy love he demanded holding her close why wouldn t you give me a chance when we were at Boulder Brook I I I thought it was G g g gloria with you all the time You didn t How could you miss seeing that I was mad about you from the first Why didn t you tell me what you thought With her cheek against his and her lips at his ear she confessed between soft quick catchings of the breath Because I was afraid of letting you see how much I cared I I ve been such a little fool Jack dear And and about the Veyze thing I m a cheat and an awful little liar and and and and a forger I guess But it never hurt anybody but myself and I ve been loving you all the time until my heart almost broke I m pretty good at those crimes myself returned her lover comfortingly And worse I ve robbed a mail box When did you ever descend to such desperate depths as that I tried to kill my trainer retorted Darcy proudly and he s the best friend I ever had except Gloria He s the one that made me presentable I ll ask him to be best man said her lover promptly As for our crimes I ll tell you darling of my heart let s turn over a new leaf and live straight and happy ever after Let s agreed Darcy with a sigh of happiness Half an hour later Tom Harmon and Gloria outside heard music the cradling measures of the little song and crept to the door hand in hand They caught the mention of Boulder Brook and shamelessly listened The pair within were already future building on Tom Harmon s property And we ll get on that same train right after the wedding said Remsen And get off at Weirs added the prospective bride And have the festive native there to meet us with th ole boat And take that awful bumpy road slower than we did before And go straight to the Farmhouse I m sorry children the rightful owner of the coolly appropriated property broke in upon their dreams but you can t have the Farmhouse Oh said Darcy hastily moving north by west on the piano seat That s taken explained Harmon beaming upon Gloria for another couple Heaven bless em said Jack heartily Thank you You concluded their past and future host may have the Bungalow CHAPTER XX SOMEWHERE in Siberia quite unaware of his activities as an absentee Cupid Sir Montrose Veyze of Veyze Holdings Hampshire England with a spread of huge composition planes where his dovelike wings should have been and a quick firer at his side in place of bow and quiver reached out of his aeroplane for the long overdue mail and read with languid surprise an invitation to be present at the marriage of Miss Darcy Cole to mister Jacob Remsen in New York City New York on the preceding Christmas day Now where the dayvle puzzled
