6184-61313-0000	train-other-500	During this vast interval of time the cultural influences emanating from the Tigro Euphrates valley reached far distant shores along the intersecting avenues of trade
6184-61313-0001	train-other-500	and in consequence of the periodic and widespread migrations of peoples who had acquired directly or indirectly
none	none	 the leavening elements of Mesopotamian civilization 
6184-61313-0002	train-other-500	Even at the present day traces survive in Europe of the early cultural impress of the East our Signs of the Zodiac for instance
none	none	 as well as the system of measuring time and space by using sixty as a basic numeral for calculation are inheritances from ancient Babylonia 
6184-61313-0003	train-other-500	As in the Nile Valley however it is impossible to trace in Mesopotamia the initiatory stages of prehistoric culture based on the agricultural mode of life
6184-61313-0004	train-other-500	What is generally called the Dawn of History is really the beginning of a later age of progress it is necessary to account for the degree of civilization attained at the earliest period of which we have knowledge by postulating
6184-61313-0005	train-other-500	a remoter age of culture of much longer duration than that which separates the Dawn from the age in which we now live
none	none	 Although Sumerian early Babylonian civilization presents distinctively local features 
6184-61313-0006	train-other-500	which justify the application of the term indigenous in the broad sense it is found like that of Egypt to be possessed of certain elements which suggest exceedingly remote influences and connections at present obscure
6184-61313-0007	train-other-500	Of special interest in this regard is Professor Budge s mature and well deliberated conclusion
none	none	 that both the Sumerians and early Egyptians derived their primeval gods from some common 
6184-61313-0008	train-other-500	but exceedingly ancient source
none	none	 The prehistoric burial customs of these separate peoples are also remarkably similar 
6184-61313-0009	train-other-500	and they resemble closely in turn those of the Neolithic Europeans The cumulative effect of such evidence forces us to regard as not wholly satisfactory and conclusive the hypothesis of cultural influence
6184-61313-0010	train-other-500	A remote racial connection is possible and is certainly worthy of consideration when so high an authority as Professor Frazer author of The Golden Bough
6184-61313-0011	train-other-500	is found prepared to admit that the widespread homogeneity of beliefs may have been due to homogeneity of race It is shown Chapter one that certain ethnologists have accumulated data
6184-61313-0012	train-other-500	which establish a racial kinship between the Neolithic Europeans
none	none	 the proto Egyptians the Sumerians the southern Persians and the Aryo Indians 
6184-61313-0013	train-other-500	Throughout this volume comparative notes have been compiled in dealing with Mesopotamian beliefs
none	none	 with purpose to assist the reader towards the study of linking myths and legends 
6184-61313-0014	train-other-500	Interesting parallels have been gleaned from various religious literatures in Europe Egypt India and elsewhere It will be found that certain relics of Babylonian intellectual life which have a distinctive geographical significance
6184-61313-0015	train-other-500	were shared by peoples in other cultural areas
none	none	 where they were similarly overlaid with local colour 
6184-61313-0016	train-other-500	Modes of thought were the products of modes of life and were influenced in their development by human experiences The influence of environment on the growth of culture
6184-61313-0017	train-other-500	has long been recognized but consideration must also be given to the choice of environment by peoples who had adopted distinctive habits of life Racial units migrated from cultural areas to districts suitable for colonization
6184-61313-0018	train-other-500	and carried with them a heritage of immemorial beliefs and customs
none	none	 which were regarded as being quite as indispensable for their welfare as their implements and domesticated animals When consideration is given in this connection to the conservative element in primitive religion 
6184-61313-0019	train-other-500	it is not surprising to find that the growth of religious myths was not so spontaneous in early civilizations of the highest order as has hitherto been assumed It seems clear that in each great local mythology
6184-61313-0020	train-other-500	we have to deal in the first place not with symbolized ideas so much as symbolized folk beliefs
none	none	 of remote antiquity and to a certain degree of common inheritance 
6184-61313-0021	train-other-500	It may not be found possible to arrive at a conclusive solution of the most widespread and therefore the most ancient folk myths such as for instance the Dragon Myth or the myth of the culture hero
6184-61313-0022	train-other-500	Nor perhaps is it necessary that we should concern ourselves greatly regarding the origin of the idea of the dragon which in one country symbolized fiery drought and in another overwhelming river floods
6184-61313-0023	train-other-500	The student will find footing on surer ground by following the process which exalts the dragon of the folk tale into the symbol of evil and primordial chaos The Babylonian Creation Myth for instance
6184-61313-0024	train-other-500	can be shown to be a localized and glorified legend in which the hero and his tribe are displaced by the war god and his fellow deities whose welfare depends on his prowess Merodach kills the dragon Tiamat
6184-61313-0025	train-other-500	as the heroes of Eur Asian folk stories kill grisly hags by casting his weapon down her throat He severed her inward parts he pierced her heart He overcame her and cut off her life
6184-61313-0026	train-other-500	He cast down her body and stood upon it And with merciless club he smashed her skull He cut through the channels of her blood And he made the north wind to bear it away into secret places
none	none	 Afterwards He divided the flesh of the Ku pu and devised a cunning plan 
6184-61313-0027	train-other-500	mister L W King from whose scholarly Seven Tablets of Creation
none	none	 these lines are quoted notes that Ku pu 
6184-61313-0028	train-other-500	is a word of uncertain meaning
none	none	 Jensen suggests trunk body Apparently Merodach obtained special knowledge after dividing and perhaps eating the Ku pu 
6184-61313-0029	train-other-500	His cunning plan is set forth in detail he cut up the dragon s body He split her up like a flat fish into two halves He formed the heavens with one half and the earth with the other
6184-61313-0030	train-other-500	and then set the universe in order His power and wisdom as the Demiurge were derived from the fierce and powerful Great Mother Tiamat In other dragon stories the heroes devise their plans after eating the dragon s heart
none	none	 According to Philostratus one Apollonius of Tyana was worthy of being remembered for two things 
6184-61313-0031	train-other-500	his bravery in travelling among fierce robber tribes not then subject to Rome
none	none	 and his wisdom in learning the language of birds and other animals as the Arabs do 
6184-61313-0032	train-other-500	This accomplishment the Arabs acquired Philostratus explains by eating the hearts of dragons The animals who utter magic words are of course the Fates Siegfried of the Nibelungenlied
6184-61313-0033	train-other-500	after slaying the Regin dragon makes himself invulnerable by bathing in its blood He obtains wisdom by eating the heart as soon as he tastes it
none	none	 he can understand the language of birds 
6184-61313-0034	train-other-500	and the birds reveal to him that Mimer is waiting to slay him Sigurd similarly makes his plans after eating the heart of the Fafner dragon In Scottish legend
6184-61313-0035	train-other-500	Finn mac Coul obtains the power to divine secrets by partaking of a small portion of the seventh salmon associated with the well dragon and Michael Scott
6184-61313-0036	train-other-500	and other folk heroes become great physicians after tasting the juices of the middle part of the body of the white snake The hero of an Egyptian folk tale slays a deathless snake
none	none	 by cutting it in two parts and putting sand between the parts 
6184-61313-0037	train-other-500	He then obtains from the box of which it is the guardian the book of spells when he reads a page of the spells he knows what the birds of the sky the fish of the deep and the beasts of the hill say the book gives him power to enchant the heaven and the earth
none	none	 the abyss the mountains and the sea two Magic and religion were never separated in Babylonia not only the priests but also the gods performed magical ceremonies Ea Merodach s father overcame Apsu the husband of the dragon Tiamat by means of spells 
6184-61313-0038	train-other-500	he was the great magician of the gods
none	none	 Merodach s division of the Ku pu was evidently an act of contagious magic by eating or otherwise disposing of the vital part of the fierce and wise mother dragon 
6184-61313-0039	train-other-500	he became endowed with her attributes and was able to proceed with the work of creation Primitive peoples in our own day
none	none	 like the Abipones of Paraguay eat the flesh of fierce and cunning animals so that their strength courage and wisdom may be increased The direct influence exercised by cultural contact on the other hand may be traced when myths with an alien geographical setting are found among peoples 
6184-61313-0040	train-other-500	whose experiences could never have given them origin In India where the dragon symbolizes drought and the western river deities are female the Manu fish and flood legend resembles closely the Babylonian and seems to throw light upon it
none	none	 Indeed the Manu myth appears to have been derived from the lost flood story in which Ea figured prominently in fish form as the Preserver The Babylonian Ea cult and the Indian Varuna cult 
6184-61313-0041	train-other-500	had apparently much in common as is shown Throughout this volume special attention has been paid to the various peoples who were in immediate contact with
none	none	 and were influenced by Mesopotamian civilization The histories are traced in outline of the Kingdoms of Elam 
6184-61313-0042	train-other-500	Urartu Ancient Armenia Mitanni
none	none	 and the Hittites 
6184-61313-0043	train-other-500	while the story of the rise and decline of the Hebrew civilization as narrated in the Bible and referred to in Mesopotamian inscriptions
none	none	 is related from the earliest times until the captivity in the Neo Babylonian period 
6184-61313-0044	train-other-500	and the restoration during the age of the Persian Empire The struggles waged between the great Powers for the control of trade routes and the periodic migrations of pastoral warrior folks
none	none	 who determined the fate of empires are also dealt with so that light may be thrown on the various processes and influences associated with the developments of local religions and mythologies 
6184-61313-0045	train-other-500	Special chapters with comparative notes are devoted to the Ishtar Tammuz myths the Semiramis legends Ashur and his symbols
6184-61313-0046	train-other-500	and the origin and growth of astrology and astronomy The ethnic disturbances which occurred at various well defined periods in the Tigro Euphrates valley
none	none	 were not always favourable to the advancement of knowledge and the growth of culture The invaders who absorbed Sumerian civilization 
6184-61313-0047	train-other-500	may have secured more settled conditions by welding together political units but seem to have exercised a retrogressive influence on the growth of local culture Babylonian religion writes doctor Langdon
none	none	 appears to have reached its highest level in the Sumerian period or at least not later than two thousand B C 
6184-61313-0048	train-other-500	From that period onward to the first century B C popular religion maintained with great difficulty the sacred standards of the past Although it has been customary to characterize Mesopotamian civilization as Semitic
6184-61313-0049	train-other-500	modern research tends to show that the indigenous inhabitants who were non Semitic were its originators
none	none	 Like the proto Egyptians the early Cretans and the Pelasgians in southern Europe and Asia Minor they invariably achieved the intellectual conquest of their conquerors as in the earliest times they had won victories over the antagonistic forces of nature If the modern view is accepted that these ancient agriculturists of the goddess cult were of common racial origin it is to the most representative communities of the widespread Mediterranean race that the credit belongs of laying the foundations of the brilliant civilizations of the ancient world in southern Europe and Egypt and the valley of the Tigris and Euphrates INTRODUCTION Ancient Babylonia has made stronger appeal to the imagination of Christendom than even Ancient Egypt because of its association with the captivity of the Hebrews whose sorrows are enshrined in the familiar psalm By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down Yea we wept when we remembered Zion We hanged our harps upon the willows In sacred literature proud Babylon became the city of the anti Christ the symbol of wickedness and cruelty and human vanity Early Christians who suffered persecution compared their worldly state to that of the oppressed and disconsolate Hebrews and like them they sighed for Jerusalem the new Jerusalem When saint John the Divine had visions of the ultimate triumph of Christianity he referred to its enemies the unbelievers and persecutors as the citizens of the earthly Babylon the doom of which he pronounced in stately and memorable phrases Babylon the great is fallen is fallen And is become the habitation of devils And the hold of every foul spirit And a cage of every unclean and hateful bird For her sins have reached unto heaven And God hath remembered her iniquities The merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her For no man buyeth their merchandise any more At the noise of the taking of Babylon cried Jeremiah referring to the original Babylon the earth is moved and the cry is heard among the nations It shall be no more inhabited forever neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation The Christian Saint rendered more profound the brooding silence of the desolated city of his vision by voicing memories of its beauty and gaiety and bustling trade The voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee And no craftsman of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee And the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee For thy merchants were the great men of the earth For by thy sorceries were all nations deceived And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints And of all that were slain upon the earth three So for nearly two thousand years has the haunting memory of the once powerful city pervaded Christian literature while its broken walls and ruined temples and palaces lay buried deep in desert sand The history of the ancient land of which it was the capital survived in but meagre and fragmentary form mingled with accumulated myths and legends A slim volume contained all that could be derived from references in the Old Testament and the compilations of classical writers It is only within the past half century that the wonderful story of early Eastern civilization has been gradually pieced together by excavators and linguists who have thrust open the door of the past and probed the hidden secrets of long ages We now know more about the land of Babel than did not only the Greeks and Romans but even the Hebrew writers who foretold its destruction Glimpses are being afforded us of its life and manners and customs for some thirty centuries before the captives of Judah uttered lamentations on the banks of its reedy canals The sites of some of the ancient cities of Babylonia and Assyria were identified by European officials and travellers in the East early in the nineteenth century and a few relics found their way to Europe But before Sir A H Layard set to work as an excavator in the forties a case scarcely three feet square as he himself wrote enclosed all that remained not only of the great city of Nineveh but of Babylon itself four Layard the distinguished pioneer Assyriologist was an Englishman of Huguenot descent who was born in Paris Through his mother he inherited a strain of Spanish blood During his early boyhood he resided in Italy and his education which began there was continued in schools in France Switzerland and England He was a man of scholarly habits and fearless and independent character a charming writer and an accomplished fine art critic withal he was a great traveller a strenuous politician and an able diplomatist In eighteen forty five while sojourning in the East he undertook the exploration of ancient Assyrian cities He first set to work at Kalkhi the Biblical Calah Three years previously M P C Botta the French consul at Mosul had begun to investigate the Nineveh mounds but these he abandoned for a mound near Khorsabad which proved to be the site of the city erected by Sargon the Later who is referred to by Isaiah The relics discovered by Botta and his successor Victor Place are preserved in the Louvre At Kalkhi and Nineveh Layard uncovered the palaces of some of the most famous Assyrian Emperors including the Biblical Shalmaneser and Esarhaddon and obtained the colossi bas reliefs and other treasures of antiquity which formed the nucleus of the British Museum s unrivalled Assyrian collection He also conducted diggings at Babylon and Niffer Nippur His work was continued by his assistant Hormuzd Rassam a native Christian of Mosul near Nineveh Rassam studied for a time at Oxford The discoveries made by Layard and Botta stimulated others to follow their example In the fifties mister W K Loftus engaged in excavations at Larsa and Erech where important discoveries were made of ancient buildings ornaments tablets sarcophagus graves and pot burials while mister J E Taylor operated at Ur the seat of the moon cult and the birthplace of Abraham and at Eridu which is generally regarded as the cradle of early Babylonian Sumerian civilization In eighteen fifty four Sir Henry Rawlinson superintended diggings at Birs Nimrud Borsippa near Babylon and excavated relics of the Biblical Nebuchadrezzar This notable archaeologist began his career in the East as an officer in the Bombay army He distinguished himself as a political agent and diplomatist While resident at Baghdad he devoted his leisure time to cuneiform studies One of his remarkable feats was the copying of the famous trilingual rock inscription of Darius the Great on a mountain cliff at Behistun in Persian Kurdistan This work was carried out at great personal risk for the cliff is seventeen hundred feet high and the sculptures and inscriptions are situated about three hundred feet from the ground Darius was the first monarch of his line to make use of the Persian cuneiform script which in this case he utilized in conjunction with the older and more complicated Assyro Babylonian alphabetic and syllabic characters to record a portion of the history of his reign Rawlinson s translation of the famous inscription was an important contribution towards the decipherment of the cuneiform writings of Assyria and Babylonia Twelve years of brilliant Mesopotamian discovery concluded in eighteen fifty four and further excavations had to be suspended until the seventies on account of the unsettled political conditions of the ancient land and the difficulties experienced in dealing with Turkish officials During the interval however archaeologists and philologists were kept fully engaged studying the large amount of material which had been accumulated Sir Henry Rawlinson began the issue of his monumental work The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia on behalf of the British Museum Goodspeed refers to the early archaeological work as the Heroic Period of research and says that the Modern Scientific Period began with mister George Smith s expedition to Nineveh in eighteen seventy three George Smith like Henry Schliemann the pioneer investigator of pre Hellenic culture was a self educated man of humble origin He was born at Chelsea in eighteen forty At fourteen he was apprenticed to an engraver He was a youth of studious habits and great originality and interested himself intensely in the discoveries which had been made by Layard and other explorers At the British Museum which he visited regularly to pore over the Assyrian inscriptions he attracted the attention of Sir Henry Rawlinson So greatly impressed was Sir Henry by the young man s enthusiasm and remarkable intelligence that he allowed him the use of his private room and provided casts and squeezes of inscriptions to assist him in his studies Smith made rapid progress His earliest discovery was the date of the payment of tribute by Jehu King of Israel to the Assyrian Emperor Shalmaneser Sir Henry availed himself of the young investigator s assistance in producing the third volume of The Cuneiform Inscriptions In eighteen sixty seven Smith received an appointment in the Assyriology Department of the British Museum and a few years later became famous throughout Christendom as the translator of fragments of the Babylonian Deluge Legend from tablets sent to London by Rassam Sir Edwin Arnold the poet and Orientalist was at the time editor of the Daily Telegraph and performed a memorable service to modern scholarship by dispatching Smith on behalf of his paper to Nineveh to search for other fragments of the Ancient Babylonian epic Rassam had obtained the tablets from the great library of the cultured Emperor Ashur bani pal the great and noble Asnapper of the Bible five who took delight as he himself recorded in The wisdom of Ea six the art of song the treasures of science This royal patron of learning included in his library collection copies and translations of tablets from Babylonia Some of these were then over two thousand years old The Babylonian literary relics were indeed of as great antiquity to Ashur bani pal as that monarch s relics are to us The Emperor invoked Nebo god of wisdom and learning to bless his books praying Forever O Nebo King of all heaven and earth Look gladly upon this Library Of Ashur bani pal his thy shepherd reverencer of thy divinity seven mister George Smith s expedition to Nineveh in eighteen seventy three was exceedingly fruitful of results More tablets were discovered and translated In the following year he returned to the ancient Assyrian city on behalf of the British Museum and added further by his scholarly achievements to his own reputation and the world s knowledge of antiquity His last expedition was made early in eighteen seventy six on his homeward journey he was stricken down with fever and on nineteenth August he died at Aleppo in his thirty sixth year So was a brilliant career brought to an untimely end Rassam was engaged to continue Smith s great work and between eighteen seventy seven and eighteen eighty two made many notable discoveries in Assyria and Babylonia including the bronze doors of a Shalmaneser temple the sun temple at Sippar the palace of the Biblical Nebuchadrezzar which was famous for its hanging gardens a cylinder of Nabonidus King of Babylon and about fifty thousand tablets M de Sarzec the French consul at Bassorah began in eighteen seventy seven excavations at the ancient Sumerian city of Lagash Shirpula and continued them until nineteen hundred He found thousands of tablets many has reliefs votive statuettes which worshippers apparently pinned on sacred shrines the famous silver vase of King Entemena statues of King Gudea and various other treasures which are now in the Louvre The pioneer work achieved by British and French excavators stimulated interest all over the world An expedition was sent out from the United States by the University of Pennsylvania and began to operate at Nippur in eighteen eighty eight The Germans who have displayed great activity in the domain of philological research are at present represented by an exploring party which is conducting the systematic exploration of the ruins of Babylon Even the Turkish Government has encouraged research work and its excavators have accumulated a fine collection of antiquities at Constantinople Among the archaeologists and linguists of various nationalities who are devoting themselves to the study of ancient Assyrian and Babylonian records and literature and gradually unfolding the story of ancient Eastern civilization those of our own country occupy a prominent position One of the most interesting discoveries of recent years has been new fragments of the Creation Legend by L W King of the British Museum whose scholarly work The Seven Tablets of Creation is the standard work on the subject The archaeological work conducted in Persia Asia Minor Palestine Cyprus Crete the Aegean and Egypt has thrown and is throwing much light on the relations between the various civilizations of antiquity In addition to the Hittite discoveries with which the name of Professor Sayce will ever be associated as a pioneer we now hear much of the hitherto unknown civilizations of Mitanni and Urartu ancient Armenia which contributed to the shaping of ancient history The Biblical narratives of the rise and decline of the Hebrew kingdoms have also been greatly elucidated In this volume which deals mainly with the intellectual life of the Mesopotamian peoples a historical narrative has been provided as an appropriate setting for the myths and legends In this connection the reader must be reminded that the chronology of the early period is still uncertain The approximate dates which are given however are those now generally adopted by most European and American authorities Early Babylonian history of the Sumerian period begins some time prior to three thousand B C Sargon of Akkad flourished about twenty six fifty B C and Hammurabi not long before or after two thousand B C The inflated system of dating which places Mena of Egypt as far back as five thousand five hundred B C and Sargon at about three thousand eight hundred B C has been abandoned by the majority of prominent archaeologists the exceptions including Professor Flinders Petrie Recent discoveries appear to support the new chronological system There is a growing conviction writes mister Hawes that Cretan evidence especially in the eastern part of the island favours the minimum Berlin system of Egyptian chronology according to which the Sixth Egyptian Dynasty began at c twenty five forty B C and the Twelfth at c two thousand B C eight Petrie dates the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty at c three thousand four hundred B C To students of comparative folklore and mythology the myths and legends of Babylonia present many features of engrossing interest They are of great antiquity yet not a few seem curiously familiar We must not conclude however that because a European legend may bear resemblances to one translated from a cuneiform tablet it is necessarily of Babylonian origin Certain beliefs and the myths which were based upon them are older than even the civilization of the Tigro Euphrates valley They belong it would appear to a stock of common inheritance from an uncertain cultural centre of immense antiquity The problem involved has been referred to by Professor Frazer in the Golden Bough Commenting on the similarities presented by certain ancient festivals in various countries he suggests that they may be due to a remarkable homogeneity of civilization throughout Southern Europe and Western Asia in prehistoric times How far he adds such homogeneity of civilization may be taken as evidence of homogeneity of race is a question for the ethnologist nine In Chapter I the reader is introduced to the ethnological problem and it is shown that the results of modern research tend to establish a remote racial connection between the Sumerians of Babylonia the prehistoric Egyptians and the Neolithic Late Stone Age inhabitants of Europe as well as the southern Persians and the Aryans of India Comparative notes are provided in dealing with the customs religious beliefs and myths and legends of the Mesopotamian peoples to assist the student towards the elucidation and partial restoration of certain literary fragments from the cuneiform tablets Of special interest in this connection are the resemblances between some of the Indian and Babylonian myths The writer has drawn upon that great storehouse of ancient legends the voluminous Indian epic the Mahabharata and it is shown that there are undoubted links between the Garuda eagle myths and those of the Sumerian Zu bird and the Etana eagle while similar stories remain attached to the memories of Sargon of Akkad and the Indian hero Karna and of Semiramis who was Queen Sammu ramat of Assyria and Shakuntala The Indian god Varuna and the Sumerian Ea are also found to have much in common and it seems undoubted that the Manu fish and flood myth is a direct Babylonian inheritance like the Yuga Ages of the Universe doctrine and the system of calculation associated with it It is of interest to note too that a portion of the Gilgamesh epic survives in the Ramayana story of the monkey god Hanuman s search for the lost princess Sita other relics of similar character suggest that both the Gilgamesh and Hanuman narratives are derived in part from a very ancient myth Gilgamesh also figures in Indian mythology as Yama the first man who explored the way to the Paradise called The Land of Ancestors and over which he subsequently presided as a god Other Babylonian myths link with those found in Egypt Greece Scandinavia Iceland and the British Isles and Ireland The Sargon myth for instance resembles closely the myth of Scyld Sceaf the patriarch in the Beowulf epic and both appear to be variations of the Tammuz Adonis story Tammuz also resembles in one of his phases the Celtic hero Diarmid who was slain by the green boar of the Earth Mother as was Adonis by the boar form of Ares the Greek war god In approaching the study of these linking myths it would be as rash to conclude that all resemblances are due to homogeneity of race as to assume that folklore and mythology are devoid of ethnological elements Due consideration must be given to the widespread influence exercised by cultural contact We must recognize also that the human mind has ever shown a tendency to arrive quite independently at similar conclusions when confronted by similar problems in various parts of the world But while many remarkable resemblances may be detected between the beliefs and myths and customs of widely separated peoples it cannot be overlooked that pronounced and striking differences remain to be accounted for Human experiences varied in localities because all sections of humanity were not confronted in ancient times by the same problems in their everyday lives Some peoples for instance experienced no great difficulties regarding the food supply which might be provided for them by nature in lavish abundance others were compelled to wage a fierce and constant conflict against hostile forces in inhospitable environments with purpose to secure adequate sustenance and their meed of enjoyment Various habits of life had to be adopted in various parts of the world and these produced various habits of thought Consequently we find that behind all systems of primitive religion lies the formative background of natural phenomena A mythology reflects the geography the fauna and flora and the climatic conditions of the area in which it took definite and permanent shape In Babylonia as elsewhere we expect therefore to find a mythology which has strictly local characteristics one which mirrors river and valley scenery the habits of life of the people and also the various stages of progress in the civilization from its earliest beginnings Traces of primitive thought survivals from remotest antiquity should also remain in evidence As a matter of fact Babylonian mythology fulfils our expectations in this regard to the highest degree Herodotus said that Egypt was the gift of the Nile similarly Babylonia may be regarded as the gift of the Tigris and Euphrates those great shifting and flooding rivers which for long ages had been carrying down from the Armenian Highlands vast quantities of mud to thrust back the waters of the Persian Gulf and form a country capable of being utilized for human habitation The most typical Babylonian deity was Ea the god of the fertilizing and creative waters He was depicted clad in the skin of a fish as gods in other geographical areas were depicted wearing the skins of animals which were regarded as ancestors or hostile demons that had to be propitiated Originally Ea appears to have been a fish the incarnation of the spirit of or life principle in the Euphrates River His centre of worship was at Eridu an ancient seaport where apparently the prehistoric Babylonians the Sumerians first began to utilize the dried up beds of shifting streams to irrigate the soil One of the several creation myths is reminiscent of those early experiences which produced early local beliefs O thou River who didst create all things When the great gods dug thee out They set prosperity upon thy banks Within thee Ea the king of the Deep created his dwelling ten The Sumerians observed that the land was brought into existence by means of the obstructing reeds which caused mud to accumulate When their minds began to be exercised regarding the origin of life they conceived that the first human beings were created by a similar process Marduk son of Ea laid a reed upon the face of the waters He formed dust and poured it out beside the reed He formed mankind eleven Ea acquired in time as the divine artisan various attributes which reflected the gradual growth of civilization he was reputed to have taught the people how to form canals control the rivers cultivate the fields build their houses and so on But although Ea became a beneficent deity as a result of the growth of civilization he had also a demoniac form and had to be propitiated The worshippers of the fish god retained ancient modes of thought and perpetuated ancient superstitious practices The earliest settlers in the Tigro Euphrates valley were agriculturists like their congeners the proto Egyptians and the Neolithic Europeans Before they broke away from the parent stock in its area of characterization they had acquired the elements of culture and adopted habits of thought which were based on the agricultural mode of life Like other agricultural communities they were worshippers of the World Mother the Creatrix who was the giver of all good things the Preserver and also the Destroyer the goddess whose moods were reflected by natural phenomena and whose lovers were the spirits of the seasons In the alluvial valley which they rendered fit for habitation the Sumerians came into contact with peoples of different habits of life and different habits of thought These were the nomadic pastoralists from the northern steppe lands who had developed in isolation theories regarding the origin of the Universe which reflected their particular experiences and the natural phenomena of their area of characterization The most representative people of this class were the Hatti of Asia Minor who were of Alpine or Armenoid stock In early times the nomads were broken up into small tribal units like Abraham and his followers and depended for their food supply on the prowess of the males Their chief deity was the sky and mountain god who was the World Father the creator and the wielder of the thunder hammer who waged war against the demons of storm or drought and ensured the food supply of his worshippers The fusion in Babylonia of the peoples of the god and goddess cults was in progress before the dawn of history as was the case in Egypt and also in southern Europe In consequence independent Pantheons came into existence in the various city States in the Tigro Euphrates valley These were mainly a reflection of city politics the deities of each influential section had to receive recognition But among the great masses of the people ancient customs associated with agriculture continued in practice and as Babylonia depended for its prosperity on its harvests the force of public opinion tended it would appear to perpetuate the religious beliefs of the earliest settlers despite the efforts made by conquerors to exalt the deities they introduced Babylonian religion was of twofold character It embraced temple worship and private worship The religion of the temple was the religion of the ruling class and especially of the king who was the guardian of the people Domestic religion was conducted in homes in reed huts or in public places and conserved the crudest superstitions surviving from the earliest times The great burnings and the human sacrifices in Babylonia referred to in the Bible were no doubt connected with agricultural religion of the private order as was also the ceremony of baking and offering cakes to the Queen of Heaven condemned by Jeremiah which obtained in the streets of Jerusalem and other cities Domestic religion required no temples There were no temples in Crete the world was the house of the deity who had seasonal haunts on hilltops in groves in caves c In Egypt Herodotus witnessed festivals and processions which are not referred to in official inscriptions although they were evidently practised from the earliest times Agricultural religion in Egypt was concentrated in the cult of Osiris and Isis and influenced all local theologies In Babylonia these deities were represented by Tammuz and Ishtar Ishtar like Isis absorbed many other local goddesses According to the beliefs of the ancient agriculturists the goddess was eternal and undecaying She was the Great Mother of the Universe and the source of the food supply Her son the corn god became as the Egyptians put it Husband of his Mother Each year he was born anew and rapidly attained to manhood then he was slain by a fierce rival who symbolized the season of pestilence bringing and parching sun heat or the rainy season or wild beasts of prey Or it might be that he was slain by his son as Cronos was by Zeus and Dyaus by Indra The new year slew the old year The social customs of the people which had a religious basis were formed in accordance with the doings of the deities they sorrowed or made glad in sympathy with the spirits of nature Worshippers also suggested by their ceremonies how the deities should act at various seasons and thus exercised as they believed a magical control over them In Babylonia the agricultural myth regarding the Mother goddess and the young god had many variations In one form Tammuz like Adonis was loved by two goddesses the twin phases of nature the Queen of Heaven and the Queen of Hades It was decreed that Tammuz should spend part of the year with one goddess and part of the year with the other Tammuz was also a Patriarch who reigned for a long period over the land and had human offspring After death his spirit appeared at certain times and seasons as a planet star or constellation He was the ghost of the elder god and he was also the younger god who was born each year In the Gilgamesh epic we appear to have a form of the patriarch legend the story of the culture hero and teacher who discovered the path which led to the land of ancestral spirits The heroic Patriarch in Egypt was Apuatu the opener of the ways the earliest form of Osiris in India he was Yama the first man who searched and found out the path for many The King as Patriarch was regarded during life as an incarnation of the culture god after death he merged in the god Sargon of Akkad posed as an incarnation of the ancient agricultural Patriarch he professed to be a man of miraculous birth who was loved by the goddess Ishtar and was supposed to have inaugurated a New Age of the Universe The myth regarding the father who was superseded by his son may account for the existence in Babylonian city pantheons of elder and younger gods who symbolized the passive and active forces of nature Considering the persistent and cumulative influence exercised by agricultural religion it is not surprising to find as has been indicated that most of the Babylonian gods had Tammuz traits as most of the Egyptian gods had Osirian traits Although local or imported deities were developed and conventionalized in rival Babylonian cities they still retained traces of primitive conceptions They existed in all their forms as the younger god who displaced the elder god and became the elder god and as the elder god who conciliated the younger god and made him his active agent and as the god who was identified at various seasons with different heavenly bodies and natural phenomena Merodach the god of Babylon who was exalted as chief of the National pantheon in the Hammurabi Age was like Tammuz a son and therefore a form of Ea a demon slayer a war god a god of fertility a corn spirit a Patriarch and world ruler and guardian and like Tammuz he had solar lunar astral and atmospheric attributes The complex characters of Merodach and Tammuz were not due solely to the monotheistic tendency the oldest deities were of mystical character they represented the Self Power of Naturalism as well as the spirit groups of Animism The theorizing priests who speculated regarding the mysteries of life and death and the origin of all things had to address the people through the medium of popular beliefs They utilized floating myths for this purpose As there were in early times various centres of culture which had rival pantheons the adapted myths varied greatly In the different forms in which they survive to us they reflect not only aspects of local beliefs but also grades of culture at different periods We must not expect however to find that the latest form of a myth was the highest and most profound The history of Babylonian religion is divided into periods of growth and periods of decadence The influence of domestic religion was invariably opposed to the new and high doctrines which emanated from the priesthood and in times of political upheaval tended to submerge them in the debris of immemorial beliefs and customs The retrogressive tendencies of the masses were invariably reinforced by the periodic invasions of aliens who had no respect for official deities and temple creeds We must avoid insisting too strongly on the application of the evolution theory to the religious phenomena of a country like Babylonia The epochs in the intellectual life of an ancient people are not comparable to geological epochs for instance because the forces at work were directed by human wills whether in the interests of progress or otherwise The battle of creeds has ever been a battle of minds It should be recognized therefore that the human element bulks as prominently in the drama of Babylon s religious history as does the prince of Denmark in the play of Hamlet We are not concerned with the plot alone The characters must also receive attention Their aspirations and triumphs their prejudices and blunders were the billowy forces which shaped the shoreland of the story and made history Various aspects of Babylonian life and culture are dealt with throughout this volume and it is shown that the growth of science and art was stimulated by unwholesome and crude superstitions Many rank weeds flourished beside the brightest blossoms of the human intellect that wooed the sun in that fertile valley of rivers As in Egypt civilization made progress when wealth was accumulated in sufficient abundance to permit of a leisured class devoting time to study and research The endowed priests who performed temple ceremonies were the teachers of the people and the patrons of culture We may think little of their religious beliefs regarding which after all we have only a superficial knowledge for we have yet discovered little more than the fragments of the shell which held the pearl the faded petals that were once a rose but we must recognize that they provided inspiration for the artists and sculptors whose achievements compel our wonder and admiration moved statesmen to inaugurate and administer humanitarian laws and exalted Right above Might These civilizations of the old world among which the Mesopotamian and the Nilotic were the earliest were built on no unsound foundations They made possible the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome and it is only within recent years that we have begun to realize how incalculable is the debt which the modern world owes to them CHAPTER I THE RACES AND EARLY CIVILIZATION OF BABYLONIA Prehistoric Babylonia The

Women in Early Communities Their Legal Status in Ancient Babylonia Influence in Social and Religious Life The Woman s Language Goddess who inspired Poets Before the dawn of the historical period Ancient Babylonia was divided into a number of independent city states similar to those which existed in pre Dynastic Egypt Ultimately these were grouped into loose confederacies The northern cities were embraced in the territory known as Akkad and the southern in the land of Sumer or Shumer This division had a racial as well as a geographical significance The Akkadians were late comers who had achieved political ascendency in the north when the area they occupied was called Uri or Kiuri and Sumer was known as Kengi They were a people of Semitic speech with pronounced Semitic affinities From the earliest times the sculptors depicted them with abundant locks long full beards and the prominent distinctive noses and full lips which we usually associate with the characteristic Jewish type and also attired in long flounced robes suspended from their left shoulders and reaching down to their ankles In contrast the Sumerians had clean shaven faces and scalps and noses of Egyptian and Grecian rather than Semitic type while they wore short pleated kilts and went about with the upper part of their bodies quite bare like the Egyptian noblemen of the Old Kingdom period They spoke a non Semitic language and were the oldest inhabitants of Babylonia of whom we have any knowledge Sumerian civilization was rooted in the agricultural mode of life and appears to have been well developed before the Semites became numerous and influential in the land Cities had been built chiefly of sun dried and fire baked bricks distinctive pottery was manufactured with much skill the people were governed by humanitarian laws which formed the nucleus of the Hammurabi code and had in use a system of cuneiform writing which was still in process of development from earlier pictorial characters The distinctive feature of their agricultural methods was the engineering skill which was displayed in extending the cultivatable area by the construction of irrigating canals and ditches There are also indications that they possessed some knowledge of navigation and traded on the Persian Gulf According to one of their own traditions Eridu originally a seaport was their racial cradle The Semitic Akkadians adopted the distinctive culture of these Sumerians after settlement and exercised an influence on its subsequent growth Much controversy has been waged regarding the original home of the Sumerians and the particular racial type which they represented One theory connects them with the lank haired and beardless Mongolians and it is asserted on the evidence afforded by early sculptural reliefs that they were similarly oblique eyed As they also spoke an agglutinative language it is suggested that they were descended from the same parent stock as the Chinese in an ancient Parthian homeland If however the oblique eye was not the result of faulty and primitive art it is evident that the Mongolian type which is invariably found to be remarkably persistent in racial blends did not survive in the Tigris and Euphrates valleys for in the finer and more exact sculpture work of the later Sumerian period the eyes of the ruling classes are found to be similar to those of the Ancient Egyptians and southern Europeans Other facial characteristics suggest that a Mongolian racial connection is highly improbable the prominent Sumerian nose for instance is quite unlike the Chinese which is diminutive Nor can far reaching conclusions be drawn from the scanty linguistic evidence at our disposal Although the languages of the Sumerians and long headed Chinese are of the agglutinative variety so are those also which are spoken by the broad headed Turks and Magyars of Hungary the broad headed and long headed dark and fair Finns and the brunet and short statured Basques with pear shaped faces who are regarded as a variation of the Mediterranean race with distinctive characteristics developed in isolation Languages afford no sure indication of racial origins or affinities Another theory connects the Sumerians with the broad headed peoples of the Western Asian plains and plateaus who are vaguely grouped as Ural Altaic stock and are represented by the present day Turks and the dark variety of Finns It is assumed that they migrated southward in remote times in consequence of tribal pressure caused by changing climatic conditions and abandoned a purely pastoral for an agricultural life The late Sumerian sculpture work again presents difficulties in this connection for the faces and bulging occiputs suggest rather a long headed than a broad headed type and the theory no longer obtains that new habits of life alter skull forms which are usually associated with other distinctive traits in the structure of skeletons These broad headed nomadic peoples of the Steppes are allied to Tatar stock and distinguished from the pure Mongols by their abundance of wavy hair and beard The fact that the Sumerians shaved their scalps and faces is highly suggestive in this connection From the earliest times it has been the habit of most peoples to emphasize their racial characteristics so as to be able one may suggest to distinguish readily a friend from a foeman At any rate this fact is generally recognized by ethnologists The Basques for instance shave their pointed chins and sometimes grow short side whiskers to increase the distinctive pear shape which is given to their faces by their prominent temples In contrast their neighbours the Andalusians grow chin whiskers to broaden their already rounded chins and to distinguish them markedly from the Basques twelve Another example of similar character is afforded in Asia Minor where the skulls of the children of long headed Kurds are narrowed and those of the children of broad headed Armenians made flatter behind as a result of systematic pressure applied by using cradle boards In this way these rival peoples accentuate their contrasting head forms which at times may no doubt show a tendency towards variation as a result of the crossment of types When it is found therefore that the Sumerians like the Ancient Egyptians were in the habit of shaving their ethnic affinities should be looked for among a naturally glabrous rather than a heavily bearded people A Central Asiatic source for Sumerian culture has also been urged of late with much circumstantial detail It breaks quite fresh and interesting ground Recent scientific expeditions in Russian and Chinese Turkestan have accumulated important archaeological data which clearly establish that vast areas of desert country were at a remote period most verdurous and fruitful and thickly populated by organized and apparently progressive communities From these ancient centres of civilization wholesale migrations must have been impelled from time to time in consequence of the gradual encroachment of wind distributed sand and the increasing shortage of water At Anau in Russian Turkestan where excavations were conducted by the Pumpelly expedition abundant traces were found of an archaic and forgotten civilization reaching back to the Late Stone Age The pottery is decorated with geometric designs and resembles somewhat other Neolithic specimens found as far apart as Susa the capital of ancient Elam on the borders of Babylonia Boghaz Koei in Asia Minor the seat of Hittite administration round the Black Sea to the north and at points in the southern regions of the Balkan Peninsula It is suggested that these various finds are scattered evidences of early racial drifts from the Central Asian areas which were gradually being rendered uninhabitable Among the Copper Age artifacts at Anau are clay votive statuettes resembling those which were used in Sumeria for religious purposes These however cannot be held to prove a racial connection but they are important in so far as they afford evidence of early trade relations in a hitherto unsuspected direction and the long distances over which cultural influence extended before the dawn of history Further we cannot go No inscriptions have yet been discovered to render articulate this mysterious Central Asian civilization or to suggest the original source of early Sumerian picture writing Nor is it possible to confirm mister Pumpelly s view that from the Anau district the Sumerians and Egyptians first obtained barley and wheat and some of their domesticated animals If as Professor Elliot Smith believes copper was first used by the Ancient Egyptians it may be on the other hand that a knowledge of this metal reached Anau through Sumeria and that the elements of the earlier culture were derived from the same quarter by an indirect route The evidence obtainable in Egypt is of interest in this connection Large quantities of food have been taken from the stomachs and intestines of sun dried bodies which have lain in their pre Dynastic graves for over sixty centuries This material has been carefully examined and has yielded among other things husks of barley and millet and fragments of mammalian bones including those no doubt of the domesticated sheep and goats and cattle painted on the pottery thirteen It is therefore apparent that at an extremely remote period a knowledge of agriculture extended throughout Egypt and we have no reason for supposing that it was not shared by the contemporary inhabitants of Sumer The various theories which have been propounded regarding the outside source of Sumerian culture are based on the assumption that it commenced abruptly and full grown Its rude beginnings cannot be traced on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates but although no specimens of the earliest form of picture writing have been recovered from the ruins of Sumerian and Akkadian cities neither have any been found elsewhere The possibility remains therefore that early Babylonian culture was indigenous A great deal of ingenuity has been displayed by many scholars says Professor Elliot Smith with the object of bringing these Sumerians from somewhere else as immigrants into Sumer but no reasons have been advanced to show that they had not been settled at the head of the Persian Gulf for long generations before they first appeared on the stage of history The argument that no early remains have been found is futile not only because such a country as Sumer is no more favourable to the preservation of such evidence than is the Delta of the Nile but also upon the more general grounds that negative statements of this sort cannot be assigned a positive evidence for an immigration fourteen This distinguished ethnologist is frankly of opinion that the Sumerians were the congeners of the pre Dynastic Egyptians of the Mediterranean or Brown race the eastern branch of which reaches to India and the western to the British Isles and Ireland In the same ancient family are included the Arabs whose physical characteristics distinguish them from the Semites of Jewish type Some light may be thrown on the Sumerian problem by giving consideration to the present day racial complexion of Western Asia The importance of evidence of this character has been emphasized elsewhere In Egypt for instance doctor C S Myers has ascertained that the modern peasants have skull forms which are identical with those of their pre Dynastic ancestors mister Hawes has also demonstrated that the ancient inhabitants of Crete are still represented on that famous island But even more remarkable is the fact that the distinctive racial type which occupied the Palaeolithic caves of the Dordogne valley in France continues to survive in their vicinity after an interval of over twenty thousand years fifteen It is noteworthy therefore to find that in south western Asia at the present day one particular racial type predominates over all others Professor Ripley who summarizes a considerable mass of data in this connection refers to it as the Iranian and says It includes the Persians and Kurds possibly the Ossetes in the Caucasus and farther to the east a large number of Asiatic tribes from the Afghans to the Hindus These peoples are all primarily long headed and dark brunets They incline to slenderness of habit although varying in stature according to circumstances In them we recognize at once undoubted congeners of our Mediterranean race in Europe The area of their extension runs off into Africa through the Egyptians who are clearly of the same race Not only the modern peoples but the Ancient Egyptians and the Phoenicians also have been traced to the same source By far the largest portion of this part of Western Asia is inhabited by this eastern branch of the Mediterranean race The broad headed type occurs sporadically among a few ethnic remnants in Syria and Mesopotamia sixteen The exhaustive study of thousands of ancient crania in London and Cambridge collections has shown that Mediterranean peoples having alien traits the result of early admixture were distributed between Egypt and the Punjab seventeen Where blending took place the early type apparently continued to predominate and it appears to be reasserting itself in our own time in Western Asia as elsewhere It seems doubtful therefore that the ancient Sumerians differed racially from the pre Dynastic inhabitants of Egypt and the Pelasgians and Iberians of Europe Indeed the statuettes from Tello the site of the Sumerian city of Lagash display distinctively Mediterranean skull forms and faces Some of the plump figures of the later period suggest however the particular alien strain which in Egypt and elsewhere is always associated with a tendency to the development of fat in contrast to the lean and sinewy appearance of most representatives of the Brown race eighteen This change may be accounted for by the presence of the Semites in northern Babylonia Whence then came these invading Semitic Akkadians of Jewish type It is generally agreed that they were closely associated with one of the early outpourings of nomadic peoples from Arabia a country which is favourable for the production of a larger population than it is able to maintain permanently especially when its natural resources are restricted by a succession of abnormally dry years In tracing the Akkadians from Arabia however we are confronted at the outset with the difficulty that its prehistoric and many of its present day inhabitants are not of the characteristic Semitic type On the Ancient Egyptian pottery and monuments the Arabs are depicted as men who closely resembled the representatives of the Mediterranean race in the Nile valley and elsewhere They shaved neither scalps nor faces as did the historic Sumerians and Egyptians but grew the slight moustache and chin tuft beard like the Libyans on the north and the majority of the men whose bodies have been preserved in pre Dynastic graves in the Nile valley If writes Professor Elliot Smith the generally accepted view is true that Arabia was the original home of the Semites the Arab must have undergone a profound change in his physical characters after he left his homeland and before he reached Babylonia This authority is of opinion that the Arabians first migrated into Palestine and northern Syria where they mingled with the southward migrating Armenoid peoples from Asia Minor This blend of Arabs kinsmen of the proto Egyptians and Armenoids would then form the big nosed long bearded Semites so familiar not only on the ancient Babylonian and Egyptian monuments but also in the modern Jews nineteen Such a view is in accord with doctor Hugo Winckler s contention that the flow of Arabian migrations was northwards towards Syria ere it swept through Mesopotamia It can scarcely be supposed that these invasions of settled districts did not result in the fusion and crossment of racial types and the production of a sub variety with medium skull form and marked facial characteristics Of special interest in this connection is the evidence afforded by Palestine and Egypt The former country has ever been subject to periodic ethnic disturbances and changes Its racial history has a remote beginning in the Pleistocene Age Palaeolithic flints of Chellean and other primitive types have been found in large numbers and a valuable collection of these is being preserved in a French museum at Jerusalem In a northern cave fragments of rude pottery belonging to an early period in the Late Stone Age have been discovered in association with the bones of the woolly rhinoceros To a later period belong the series of Gezer cave dwellings which according to Professor Macalister the well known Palestinian authority were occupied by a non Semitic people of low stature with thick skulls and showing evidence of the great muscular strength that is essential to savage life twenty These people are generally supposed to be representatives of the Mediterranean race which Sergi has found to have been widely distributed throughout Syria and a part of Asia Minor twenty one An interesting problem however is raised by the fact that in one of the caves there are evidences that the dead were cremated This was not a Mediterranean custom nor does it appear to have prevailed outside the Gezer area If however it does not indicate that the kinsmen of the Ancient Egyptians came into contact with the remnants of an earlier people it may be that the dead of a later people were burned there The possibility that unidentified types may have contributed to the Semitic blend however remains The Mediterraneans mingled in Northern Syria and Asia Minor with the broad headed Armenoid peoples who are represented in Europe by the Alpine race With them they ultimately formed the great Hittite confederacy These Armenoids were moving southwards at the very dawn of Egyptian history and nothing is known of their conquests and settlements Their pioneers who were probably traders appear to have begun to enter the Delta region before the close of the Late Stone Age twenty two The earliest outpourings of migrating Arabians may have been in progress about the same time This early southward drift of Armenoids might account for the presence in southern Palestine early in the Copper Age of the tall race referred to in the Bible as the Rephaim or Anakim whose power was broken only by the Hebrew invaders twenty three Joshua drove them out of Hebron twenty four in the neighbourhood of which Abraham had purchased a burial cave from Ephron the Hittite twenty five Apparently a system of land laws prevailed in Palestine at this early period It is of special interest for us to note that in Abraham s day and afterwards the landed proprietors in the country of the Rephaim were identified with the aliens from Asia Minor the tall variety in the Hittite confederacy Little doubt need remain that the Arabians during their sojourn in Palestine and Syria met with distinctive types and if not with pure Armenoids at any rate with peoples having Armenoid traits The consequent multiplication of tribes and the gradual pressure exercised by the constant stream of immigrants from Arabia and Asia Minor must have kept this part of Western Asia in a constant state of unrest Fresh migrations of the surplus stock were evidently propelled towards Egypt in one direction and the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates in another The Semites of Akkad were probably the conquerors of the more highly civilized Sumerians who must have previously occupied that area It is possible that they owed their success to the possession of superior weapons Professor Elliot Smith suggests in this connection that the Arabians had become familiar with the use of copper as a result of contact with the Egyptians in Sinai There is no evidence however that the Sumerians were attacked before they had begun to make metal weapons It is more probable that the invading nomads had superior military organization and considerable experience in waging war against detached tribal units They may have also found some of the northern Sumerian city states at war with one another and taken advantage of their unpreparedness to resist a common enemy The rough Dorians who overran Greece and the fierce Goths who shattered the power of Rome were similarly in a lower state of civilization than the peoples whom they subdued The Sumerians however ultimately achieved an intellectual conquest of their conquerors Although the leaders of invasion may have formed military aristocracies in the cities which they occupied it was necessary for the great majority of the nomads to engage their activities in new directions after settlement The Semitic Akkadians therefore adopted Sumerian habits of life which were best suited for the needs of the country and they consequently came under the spell of Sumerian modes of thought This is shown by the fact that the native speech of ancient Sumer continued long after the dawn of history to be the language of Babylonian religion and culture like Latin in Europe during the Middle Ages For centuries the mingling peoples must have been bilingual as are many of the inhabitants of Ireland Wales and the Scottish Highlands in the present age but ultimately the language of the Semites became the prevailing speech in Sumer and Akkad This change was the direct result of the conquests and the political supremacy achieved by the northern people A considerable period elapsed however ere this consummation was reached and Ancient Babylonia became completely Semitized No doubt its brilliant historical civilization owed much of its vigour and stability to the organizing genius of the Semites but the basis on which it was established had been laid by the ingenious and imaginative Sumerians who first made the desert to blossom like the rose The culture of Sumer was a product of the Late Stone Age which should not be regarded as necessarily an age of barbarism During its vast periods there were great discoveries and great inventions in various parts of Asia Africa and Europe The Neoliths made pottery and bricks we know that they invented the art of spinning for spindle whorls are found even in the Gezer caves to which we have referred while in Egypt the pre Dynastic dead were sometimes wrapped in finely woven linen their deftly chipped flint implements are eloquent of artistic and mechanical skill and undoubted mathematical ability must be credited to the makers of smoothly polished stone hammers which are so perfectly balanced that they revolve on a centre of gravity In Egypt and Babylonia the soil was tilled and its fertility increased by irrigation Wherever man waged a struggle with Nature he made rapid progress and consequently we find that the earliest great civilizations were rooted in the little fields of the Neolithic farmers Their mode of life necessitated a knowledge of Nature s laws they had to take note of the seasons and measure time So Egypt gave us the Calendar and Babylonia the system of dividing the week into seven days and the day into twelve double hours The agricultural life permitted large communities to live in river valleys and these had to be governed by codes of laws settled communities required peace and order for their progress and prosperity All great civilizations have evolved from the habits and experiences of settled communities Law and religion were closely associated and the evidence afforded by the remains of stone circles and temples suggests that in the organization and division of labour the influence of religious teachers was pre eminent Early rulers indeed were priest kings incarnations of the deity who owned the land and measured out the span of human life We need not assume that Neolithic man led an idyllic existence his triumphs were achieved by slow and gradual steps his legal codes were no doubt written in blood and his institutions welded in the fires of adversity But disciplined by laws which fostered humanitarian ideals Neolithic man especially of the Mediterranean race had reached a comparatively high state of civilization long ages before the earliest traces of his activities can be obtained When this type of mankind is portrayed in Ancient Sumeria Ancient Egypt and Ancient Crete we find that the faces are refined and intellectual and often quite modern in aspect The skulls show that in the Late Stone Age the human brain was fully developed and that the racial types were fixed In every country in Europe we still find the direct descendants of the ancient Mediterranean race as well as the descendants of the less highly cultured conquerors who swept westward out of Asia at the dawn of the Bronze Age and everywhere there are evidences of crossment of types in varying degrees Even the influence of Neolithic intellectual life still remains The comparative study of mythology and folk beliefs reveals that we have inherited certain modes of thought from our remote ancestors who were the congeners of the Ancient Sumerians and the Ancient Egyptians In this connection it is of interest therefore to refer to the social ideals of the early peoples who met and mingled on the southern plains of the Tigris and Euphrates and especially the position occupied by women which is engaging so much attention at the present day It would appear that among the Semites and other nomadic peoples woman was regarded as the helpmate rather than the companion and equal of man The birth of a son was hailed with joy it was miserable to have a daughter as a Hindu sage reflected in various countries it was the custom to expose female children after birth and leave them to die A wife had no rights other than those accorded to her by her husband who exercised over her the power of life and death Sons inherited family possessions the daughters had no share allotted to them and could be sold by fathers and brothers Among the peoples who observed male right social life was reflected in the conception of controlling male deities accompanied by shadowy goddesses who were often little else than figures of speech The Ancient Sumerians on the other hand like the Mediterranean peoples of Egypt and Crete reverenced and exalted motherhood in social and religious life Women were accorded a legal status and marriage laws were promulgated by the State Wives could possess private property in their own right as did the Babylonian Sarah wife of Abraham who owned the Egyptian slave Hagar twenty six A woman received from her parents a marriage dowry and in the event of separation from her husband she could claim its full value Some spinsters or wives were accustomed to enter into business partnerships with men or members of their own sex and could sue and be sued in courts of law Brothers and sisters were joint heirs of the family estate Daughters might possess property over which their fathers exercised no control they could also enter into legal agreements with their parents in business matters when they had attained to years of discretion Young women who took vows of celibacy and lived in religious institutions could yet make business investments as surviving records show There is only one instance of a Sumerian woman ascending the throne like Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt Women therefore were not rigidly excluded from official life Dungi II an early Sumerian king appointed two of his daughters as rulers of conquered cities in Syria and Elam Similarly Shishak the Egyptian Pharaoh handed over the city of Gezer which he had subdued to his daughter Solomon s wife twenty seven In the religious life of ancient Sumeria the female population exercised an undoubted influence and in certain temples there were priestesses The oldest hymns give indication of the respect shown to women by making reference to mixed assemblies as females and males just as present day orators address themselves to ladies and gentlemen In the later Semitic adaptations of these productions it is significant to note this conventional reference was altered to male and female If influences however were at work to restrict the position of women they did not meet with much success because when Hammurabi codified existing laws the ancient rights of women received marked recognition There were two dialects in ancient Sumeria and the invocatory hymns were composed in what was known as the women s language It must not be inferred however that the ladies of Sumeria had established a speech which differed from that used by men The reference would appear to be to a softer and homelier dialect perhaps the oldest of the two in which poetic emotion found fullest and most beautiful expression In these ancient days as in our own the ideal of womanhood was the poet s chief source of inspiration and among the hymns the highest reach of poetic art was attained in the invocation of Ishtar the Babylonian Venus The following hymn is addressed to that deity in her Valkyrie like character as a goddess of war but her more feminine traits are not obscured HYMN TO ISHTAR To thee I cry O lady of the gods Lady of ladies goddess without peer Ishtar who shapes the lives of all mankind Thou stately world queen sovran of the sky And lady ruler of the host of heaven Illustrious is thy name O light divine Gleaming in lofty splendour o er the earth Heroic daughter of the moon oh

6782_61316_000000_000000	train-clean-360	Ancient Babylonia was for over four thousand years the garden of Western Asia 
none	none	In the days of Hezekiah and Isaiah when it had come under the sway of the younger civilization of Assyria on the north it was a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey twenty eight 
6782_61316_000000_000002	train-clean-360	Herodotus found it still flourishing and extremely fertile 
6782_61316_000000_000003	train-clean-360	 This territory he wrote is of all that we know the best by far for producing grain it is so good that it returns as much as two hundredfold for the average and when it bears at its best it produces three hundredfold 
none	none	The blades of the wheat and barley there grow to be full four fingers broad and from millet and sesame seed how large a tree grows I know myself but shall not record being well aware that even what has already been said relating to the crops produced has been enough to cause disbelief in those who have not visited Babylonia twenty nine To day great tracts of undulating moorland which aforetime yielded two and three crops a year are in summer partly barren wastes and partly jungle and reedy swamp Bedouins camp beside sandy heaps which were once populous and thriving cities and here and there the shrunken remnants of a people once great and influential eke out precarious livings under the oppression of Turkish tax gatherers who are scarcely less considerate than the plundering nomads of the desert 
6782_61316_000001_000000	train-clean-360	This historic country is bounded on the east by Persia and on the west by the Arabian desert 
none	none	In shape somewhat resembling a fish it lies between the two great rivers the Tigris and the Euphrates one hundred miles wide at its broadest part and narrowing to thirty five miles towards the tail in the latitude of Baghdad the head converges to a point above Basra where the rivers meet and form the Shatt el Arab which pours into the Persian Gulf after meeting the Karun and drawing away the main volume of that double mouthed river The distance from Baghdad to Basra is about three hundred miles and the area traversed by the Shatt el Arab is slowly extending at the rate of a mile every thirty years or so as a result of the steady accumulation of silt and mud carried down by the Tigris and Euphrates When Sumeria was beginning to flourish these two rivers had separate outlets and Eridu the seat of the cult of the sea god Ea which now lies one hundred twenty five miles inland was a seaport at the head of the Persian Gulf 
6782_61316_000001_000004	train-clean-360	A day s journey separated the river mouths when Alexander the Great broke the power of the Persian Empire 
6782_61316_000002_000000	train-clean-360	In the days of Babylonia s prosperity the Euphrates was hailed as the soul of the land and the Tigris as the bestower of blessings Skilful engineers had solved the problem of water distribution by irrigating sun parched areas and preventing the excessive flooding of those districts which are now rendered impassable swamps when the rivers overflow 
6782_61316_000002_000001	train-clean-360	A network of canals was constructed throughout the country which restricted the destructive tendencies of the Tigris and Euphrates and developed to a high degree their potentialities as fertilizing agencies 
6782_61316_000002_000002	train-clean-360	The greatest of these canals appear to have been anciently river beds 
none	none	One which is called Shatt en Nil to the north and Shatt el Kar to the south curved eastward from Babylon and sweeping past Nippur flowed like the letter S towards Larsa and then rejoined the river 
6782_61316_000002_000004	train-clean-360	It is believed to mark the course followed in the early Sumerian period by the Euphrates river which has moved steadily westward many miles beyond the sites of ancient cities that were erected on its banks 
6782_61316_000002_000005	train-clean-360	Another important canal the Shatt el Hai crossed the plain from the Tigris to its sister river which lies lower at this point and does not run so fast 
none	none	Where the artificial canals were constructed on higher levels than the streams which fed them the water was raised by contrivances known as shaddufs the buckets or skin bags were roped to a weighted beam with the aid of which they were swung up by workmen and emptied into the canals It is possible that this toilsome mode of irrigation was substituted in favourable parts by the primitive water wheels which are used in our own day by the inhabitants of the country who cultivate strips of land along the river banks In Babylonia there are two seasons the rainy and the dry Rain falls from November till March and the plain is carpeted in spring by patches of vivid green verdure and brilliant wild flowers Then the period of drought ensues the sun rapidly burns up all vegetation and everywhere the eye is wearied by long stretches of brown and yellow desert Occasional sandstorms darken the heavens sweeping over sterile wastes and piling up the shapeless mounds which mark the sites of ancient cities 
6782_61316_000003_000004	train-clean-360	Meanwhile the rivers are increasing in volume being fed by the melting snows at their mountain sources far to the north 
6782_61316_000003_000005	train-clean-360	The swift Tigris which is eleven forty six miles long begins to rise early in March and reaches its highest level in May before the end of June it again subsides 
6782_61316_000003_000006	train-clean-360	More sluggish in movement the Euphrates which is seventeen eighty miles long shows signs of rising a fortnight later than the Tigris and is in flood for a more extended period it does not shrink to its lowest level until early in September 
6782_61316_000003_000007	train-clean-360	By controlling the flow of these mighty rivers preventing disastrous floods and storing and distributing surplus water the ancient Babylonians developed to the full the natural resources of their country and made it what it may once again become one of the fairest and most habitable areas in the world 
6782_61316_000003_000008	train-clean-360	Nature conferred upon them bountiful rewards for their labour trade and industries flourished and the cities increased in splendour and strength 
none	none	Then as now the heat was great during the long summer but remarkably dry and unvarying while the air was ever wonderfully transparent under cloudless skies of vivid blue The nights were cool and of great beauty whether in brilliant moonlight or when ponds and canals were jewelled by the lustrous displays of clear and numerous stars which glorified that homeland of the earliest astronomers 
6782_61316_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Babylonia is a treeless country and timber had to be imported from the earliest times 
6782_61316_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The date palm was probably introduced by man as were certainly the vine and the fig tree which were widely cultivated especially in the north 
6782_61316_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Stone suitable for building was very scarce and limestone alabaster marble and basalt had to be taken from northern Mesopotamia where the mountains also yield copper and lead and iron 
6782_61316_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Except Eridu where ancient workers quarried sandstone from its sea shaped ridge all the cities were built of brick an excellent clay being found in abundance 
6782_61316_000004_000004	train-clean-360	When brick walls were cemented with bitumen they were given great stability 
6782_61316_000004_000005	train-clean-360	This resinous substance is found in the north and south 
6782_61316_000004_000006	train-clean-360	It bubbles up through crevices of rocks on river banks and forms small ponds 
6782_61316_000004_000007	train-clean-360	Two famous springs at modern Hit on the Euphrates have been drawn upon from time immemorial 
6782_61316_000004_000008	train-clean-360	 From one writes a traveller flows hot water black with bitumen while the other discharges intermittently bitumen or after a rainstorm bitumen and cold water 
none	none	Where rocks crop out in the plain above Hit they are full of seams of bitumen thirty Present day Arabs call it kiyara and export it for coating boats and roofs they also use it as an antiseptic and apply it to cure the skin diseases from which camels suffer Sumeria had many surplus products including corn and figs pottery fine wool and woven garments to offer in exchange for what it most required from other countries 
6782_61316_000005_000001	train-clean-360	It must therefore have had a brisk and flourishing foreign trade at an exceedingly remote period 
none	none	No doubt numerous alien merchants were attracted to its cities and it may be that they induced or encouraged Semitic and other raiders to overthrow governments and form military aristocracies so that they themselves might obtain necessary concessions and achieve a degree of political ascendancy 
6782_61316_000005_000003	train-clean-360	It does not follow however that the peasant class was greatly affected by periodic revolutions of this kind which brought little more to them than a change of rulers 
6782_61316_000005_000004	train-clean-360	The needs of the country necessitated the continuance of agricultural methods and the rigid observance of existing land laws indeed these constituted the basis of Sumerian prosperity 
6782_61316_000005_000005	train-clean-360	Conquerors have ever sought reward not merely in spoil but also the services of the conquered 
6782_61316_000005_000006	train-clean-360	In northern Babylonia the invaders apparently found it necessary to conciliate and secure the continued allegiance of the tillers of the soil 
6782_61316_000005_000007	train-clean-360	Law and religion being closely associated they had to adapt their gods to suit the requirements of existing social and political organizations A deity of pastoral nomads had to receive attributes which would give him an agricultural significance one of rural character had to be changed to respond to the various calls of city life 
6782_61316_000005_000008	train-clean-360	Besides local gods could not be ignored on account of their popularity 
none	none	As a result imported beliefs and religious customs must have been fused and absorbed according to their bearing on modes of life in various localities It is probable that the complex character of certain deities was due to the process of adjustment to which they were subjected in new environments 
6782_61316_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The petty kingdoms of Sumeria appear to have been tribal in origin Each city was presided over by a deity who was the nominal owner of the surrounding arable land farms were rented or purchased from the priesthood and pasture was held in common 
none	none	As in Egypt where we find for instance the artisan god Ptah supreme at Memphis the sun god Ra at Heliopolis and the cat goddess Bast at Bubastis the various local Sumerian and Akkadian deities had distinctive characteristics and similarly showed a tendency to absorb the attributes of their rivals 
6782_61316_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The chief deity of a state was the central figure in a pantheon which had its political aspect and influenced the growth of local theology 
none	none	Cities however did not as a rule bear the names of deities which suggests that several were founded when Sumerian religion was in its early animistic stages and gods and goddesses were not sharply defined from the various spirit groups A distinctive and characteristic Sumerian god was Ea who was supreme at the ancient sea deserted port of Eridu He is identified with the Oannes of Berosus thirty one who referred to the deity as a creature endowed with reason with a body like that of a fish with feet below like those of a man with a fish s tail 
6782_61316_000007_000002	train-clean-360	This description recalls the familiar figures of Egyptian gods and priests attired in the skins of the sacred animals from whom their powers were derived and the fairy lore about swan maids and men and the seals and other animals who could divest themselves of their skin coverings and appear in human shape 
none	none	Originally Ea may have been a sacred fish 
6782_61316_000007_000004	train-clean-360	The Indian creative gods Brahma and Vishnu had fish forms 
none	none	In Sanskrit literature Manu the eponymous first man is instructed by the fish to build a ship in which to save himself when the world would be purged by the rising waters Ea befriended in similar manner the Babylonian Noah called Pir napishtim advising him to build a vessel so as to be prepared for the approaching Deluge Indeed the Indian legend appears to throw light on the original Sumerian conception of Ea 
6782_61316_000007_000008	train-clean-360	It relates that when the fish was small and in danger of being swallowed by other fish in a stream it appealed to Manu for protection 
6782_61316_000007_000009	train-clean-360	The sage at once lifted up the fish and placed it in a jar of water 
6782_61316_000007_000010	train-clean-360	It gradually increased in bulk and he transferred it next to a tank and then to the river Ganges 
6782_61316_000007_000011	train-clean-360	In time the fish complained to Manu that the river was too small for it so he carried it to the sea 
none	none	For these services the god in fish form instructed Manu regarding the approaching flood and afterwards piloted his ship through the weltering waters until it rested on a mountain top thirty two If this Indian myth is of Babylonian origin as appears probable it may be that the spirit of the river Euphrates the soul of the land was identified with a migrating fish 
6782_61316_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The growth of the fish suggests the growth of the river rising in flood 
6782_61316_000008_000002	train-clean-360	In Celtic folk tales high tides and valley floods are accounted for by the presence of a great beast in sea loch or river 
none	none	In a class of legends specially connected with the worship of Atargatis wrote Professor Robertson Smith the divine life of the waters resides in the sacred fish that inhabit them Atargatis and her son according to a legend common to Hierapolis and Ascalon plunged into the waters in the first case the Euphrates in the second the sacred pool at the temple near the town and were changed into fishes 
6782_61316_000008_000005	train-clean-360	The idea is that where a god dies that is ceases to exist in human form his life passes into the waters where he is buried and this again is merely a theory to bring the divine water or the divine fish into harmony with anthropomorphic ideas 
none	none	The same thing was sometimes effected in another way by saying that the anthropomorphic deity was born from the water as Aphrodite sprang from sea foam or as Atargatis in another form of the Euphrates legend was born of an egg which the sacred fishes found in the Euphrates and pushed ashore thirty three As Shar Apsi Ea was the King of the Watery Deep The reference however according to Jastrow is not to the salt ocean but the sweet waters flowing under the earth which feed the streams and through streams and canals irrigate the fields thirty four As Babylonia was fertilized by its rivers Ea the fish god was a fertilizing deity In Egypt the Mother of Mendes is depicted carrying a fish upon her head she links with Isis and Hathor her husband is Ba neb Tettu a form of Ptah Osiris and Ra and as a god of fertility he is symbolized by the ram 
6782_61316_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Another Egyptian fish deity was the god Rem whose name signifies to weep he wept fertilizing tears and corn was sown and reaped amidst lamentations 
none	none	He may be identical with Remi who was a phase of Sebek the crocodile god a developed attribute of Nu the vague primitive Egyptian deity who symbolized the primordial deep 
6782_61316_000009_000004	train-clean-360	The connection between a fish god and a corn god is not necessarily remote when we consider that in Babylonia and Egypt the harvest was the gift of the rivers 
6782_61316_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The Euphrates indeed was hailed as a creator of all that grew on its banks 
none	none	O thou River who didst create all things When the great gods dug thee out They set prosperity upon thy banks Within thee Ea the King of the Deep created his dwelling Thou judgest the cause of mankind O River thou art mighty O River thou art supreme O River thou art righteous thirty five In serving Ea the embodiment or the water spirit by leading him as the Indian Manu led the Creator and Preserver in fish form from river to water pot water pot to pond or canal and then again to river and ocean the Babylonians became expert engineers and experienced agriculturists the makers of bricks the builders of cities the framers of laws Indeed their civilization was a growth of Ea worship Ea was their instructor Berosus states that as Oannes he lived in the Persian Gulf and every day came ashore to instruct the inhabitants of Eridu how to make canals to grow crops to work metals to make pottery and bricks and to build temples he was the artisan god Nun ura god of the potter Kuski banda god of goldsmiths c the divine patron of the arts and crafts Ea knoweth everything chanted the hymn maker 
6782_61316_000012_000005	train-clean-360	He taught the people how to form and use alphabetic signs and instructed them in mathematics he gave them their code of laws 
none	none	Like the Egyptian artisan god Ptah and the linking deity Khnumu Ea was the potter or moulder of gods and man 
6782_61316_000012_000007	train-clean-360	Ptah moulded the first man on his potter s wheel he also moulded the sun and moon he shaped the universe and hammered out the copper sky 
none	none	Ea built the world as an architect builds a house thirty six Similarly the Vedic Indra who wielded a hammer like Ptah fashioned the universe after the simple manner in which the Aryans made their wooden dwellings thirty seven Like Ptah Ea also developed from an artisan god into a sublime Creator in the highest sense not merely as a producer of crops 
6782_61316_000013_000001	train-clean-360	His word became the creative force he named those things he desired to be and they came into existence 
none	none	Who but Ea creates things exclaimed a priestly poet This change from artisan god to creator Nudimmud may have been due to the tendency of early religious cults to attach to their chief god the attributes of rivals exalted at other centres Ea whose name is also rendered Aa was identified with Ya Ya u or Au the Jah of the Hebrews In Ya Daganu Jah is Dagon writes Professor Pinches we have the elements reversed showing a wish to identify Jah with Dagon rather than Dagon with Jah whilst another interesting name Au Aa shows an identification of Jah with Aa two names which have every appearance of being etymologically connected Jah s name is one of the words for god in the Assyro Babylonian language thirty eight Ea was Enki lord of the world or lord of what is beneath Amma ana ki lord of heaven and earth Sa kalama ruler of the land as well as Engur god of the abyss Naqbu the deep and Lugal ida king of the river 
6782_61316_000015_000001	train-clean-360	As rain fell from the waters above the firmament the god of waters was also a sky and earth god 
6782_61316_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The Indian Varuna was similarly a sky as well as an ocean god before the theorizing and systematizing Brahmanic teachers relegated him to a permanent abode at the bottom of the sea 
none	none	It may be that Ea Oannes and Varuna were of common origin Another Babylonian deity named Dagan is believed to be identical with Ea 
6782_61316_000017_000001	train-clean-360	His worship was certainly of great antiquity 
none	none	Hammurabi writes Professor Pinches seems to speak of the Euphrates as being the boundary of Dagan whom he calls his creator In later inscriptions the form Daguna which approaches nearer to the West Semitic form Dagon of the Philistines is found in a few personal names thirty nine It is possible that the Philistine deity Dagon was a specialized form of ancient Ea who was either imported from Babylonia or was a sea god of more than one branch of the Mediterranean race The authorities are at variance regarding the form and attributes of Dagan 
6782_61316_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Our knowledge regarding him is derived mainly from the Bible 
6782_61316_000018_000003	train-clean-360	He was a national rather than a city god 
none	none	There are references to a Beth dagon forty house or city of Dagon he had also a temple at Gaza and Samson destroyed it by pulling down the two middle pillars which were its main support forty one A third temple was situated in Ashdod When the captured ark of the Israelites was placed in it the image of Dagon fell on his face with the result that the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold only the stump of Dagon was left forty two A further reference to the threshold of Dagon suggests that the god had feet like Ea Oannes Those who hold that Dagon had a fish form derive his name from the Semitic dag a fish and suggest that after the idol fell only the fishy part dago was left On the other hand it was argued that Dagon was a corn god and that the resemblance between the words Dagan and Dagon are accidental Professor Sayce makes reference in this connection to a crystal seal from Phoenicia in the Ashmolean Museum Oxford bearing an inscription which he reads as Baal dagon 
6782_61316_000018_000009	train-clean-360	Near the name is an ear of corn and other symbols such as the winged solar disc a gazelle and several stars but there is no fish 
6782_61316_000018_000010	train-clean-360	It may be of course that Baal dagon represents a fusion of deities 
none	none	As we have seen in the case of Ea Oannes and the deities of Mendes a fish god may also be a corn god a land animal god and a god of ocean and the sky The offering of golden mice representing your mice that mar the land forty three made by the Philistines suggests that Dagon was the fertilizing harvest god among other things whose usefulness had been impaired as they believed by the mistake committed of placing the ark of Israel in the temple at Ashdod 
6782_61316_000018_000013	train-clean-360	The Philistines came from Crete and if their Dagon was imported from that island he may have had some connection with Poseidon whose worship extended throughout Greece 
6782_61316_000018_000014	train-clean-360	This god of the sea who is somewhat like the Roman Neptune carried a lightning trident and caused earthquakes 
6782_61316_000018_000015	train-clean-360	He was a brother of Zeus the sky and atmosphere deity and had bull and horse forms 
none	none	As a horse he pursued Demeter the earth and corn goddess and like Ea he instructed mankind but especially in the art of training horses 
6782_61316_000018_000017	train-clean-360	In his train were the Tritons half men half fishes and the water fairies the Nereids 
none	none	Bulls boars and rams were offered to this sea god of fertility Amphitrite was his spouse An obscure god Shony the Oannes of the Scottish Hebrides received oblations from those who depended for their agricultural prosperity on his gifts of fertilizing seaweed He is referred to in Martin s Western Isles and is not yet forgotten The Eddic sea god Njord of Noatun was the father of Frey the harvest god Dagda the Irish corn god had for wife Boann the goddess of the river Boyne 
6782_61316_000019_000004	train-clean-360	Osiris and Isis of Egypt were associated with the Nile 
6782_61316_000019_000005	train-clean-360	The connection between agriculture and the water supply was too obvious to escape the early symbolists and many other proofs of this than those referred to could be given 
none	none	Ea s faithful spouse was the goddess Damkina who was also called Nin ki lady of the earth May Ea make thee glad chanted the priests May Damkina queen of the deep illumine thee with her countenance may Merodach Marduk the mighty overseer of the Igigi heavenly spirits exalt thy head Merodach was their son in time he became the Bel or Lord of the Babylonian pantheon Like the Indian Varuna the sea god Ea Oannes had control over the spirits and demons of the deep The ferryman who kept watch over the river of death was called Arad Ea servant of Ea There are also references to sea maidens the Babylonian mermaids or Nereids We have a glimpse of sea giants which resemble the Indian Danavas and Daityas of ocean in the chant Seven are they seven are they In the ocean deep seven are they Battening in heaven seven are they Bred in the depths of ocean Of these seven the first is the south wind The second a dragon with mouth agape forty four 
6782_61316_000023_000000	train-clean-360	A suggestion of the Vedic Vritra and his horde of monsters 
none	none	These seven demons were also the messengers of Anu who although specialized as a sky god in more than one pantheon appears to have been closely associated with Ea in the earliest Sumerian period His name signifying the high one is derived from ana heaven he was the city god of Erech Uruk 
6782_61316_000024_000002	train-clean-360	It is possible that he was developed as an atmospheric god with solar and lunar attributes 
6782_61316_000024_000003	train-clean-360	The seven demons who were his messengers recall the stormy Maruts the followers of Indra 
6782_61316_000024_000004	train-clean-360	They are referred to as

6782_61316_000026_000002	train-clean-360	 Evil spirits according to a Babylonian chant were the bitter venom of the gods 
6782_61316_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Those attached to a deity as attendants appear to represent the original animistic group from which he evolved 
none	none	In each district the character of the deity was shaped to accord with local conditions At Nippur which was situated on the vague and shifting boundary line between Sumer and Akkad the chief god was Enlil whose name is translated lord of mist lord of might and lord of demons by various authorities He was a storm god and a war god and lord of heaven and earth like Ea and Anu An atmospheric deity he shares the attributes of the Indian Indra the thunder and rain god and Vayu the wind god he also resembles the Semitic Adad or Rimman who links with the Hittite Tarku All these are deities of tempest and the mountains Wild Huntsmen in the Raging Host The name of Enlil s temple at Nippur has been translated as mountain house or like a mountain and the theory obtained for a time that the god must therefore have been imported by a people from the hills But as the ideogram for mountain and land was used in the earliest times as King shows with reference to foreign countries forty six it is more probable that Enlil was exalted as a world god who had dominion over not only Sumer and Akkad but also the territories occupied by the rivals and enemies of the early Babylonians Enlil is known as the older Bel lord to distinguish him from Bel Merodach of Babylon He was the chief figure in a triad in which he figured as earth god with Anu as god of the sky and Ea as god of the deep This classification suggests that Nippur had either risen in political importance and dominated the cities of Erech and Eridu or that its priests were influential at the court of a ruler who was the overlord of several city states 
6782_61316_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Associated with Bel Enlil was Beltis later known as Beltu the lady 
none	none	She appears to be identical with the other great goddesses Ishtar Nana Zerpanitu m c a Great Mother or consort of an early god with whom she was equal in power and dignity 
6782_61316_000030_000000	train-clean-360	In the later systematized theology of the Babylonians we seem to trace the fragments of a primitive mythology which was vague in outline for the deities were not sharply defined and existed in groups 
6782_61316_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Enneads were formed in Egypt by placing a local god at the head of a group of eight elder deities 
none	none	The sun god Ra was the chief figure of the earliest pantheon of this character at Heliopolis while at Hermopolis the leader was the lunar god Thoth Professor Budge is of opinion that both the Sumerians and the early Egyptians derived their primeval gods from some common but exceedingly ancient source for he finds in the Babylonian and Nile valleys that there is a resemblance between two early groups which seems to be too close to be accidental forty seven The Egyptian group comprises four pairs of vague gods and goddesses Nu and his consort Nut Hehu and his consort Hehut Kekui and his consort Kekuit and Kerh and his consort Kerhet Man always has fashioned he says and probably always will fashion his god or gods in his own image and he has always having reached a certain stage in development given to his gods wives and offspring but the nature of the position taken by the wives of the gods depends upon the nature of the position of women in the households of those who write the legends and the traditions of the gods The gods of the oldest company in Egypt were the writer believes invented by people in whose households women held a high position and among whom they possessed more power than is usually the case with Oriental peoples forty eight 
6782_61316_000032_000000	train-clean-360	We cannot say definitely what these various deities represent 
none	none	Nu was the spirit of the primordial deep and Nut of the waters above the heavens the mother of moon and sun and the stars 
6782_61316_000032_000002	train-clean-360	The others were phases of light and darkness and the forces of nature in activity and repose 
none	none	Nu is represented in Babylonian mythology by Apsu Rishtu and Nut by Mummu Tiamat or Tiawath the next pair is Lachmu and Lachamu and the third Anshar and Kishar The fourth pair is missing but the names of Anu and Ea as Nudimmud are mentioned in the first tablet of the Creation series and the name of a third is lost Professor Budge thinks that the Assyrian editors substituted the ancient triad of Anu Ea and Enlil for the pair which would correspond to those found in Egypt Originally the wives of Anu and Ea may have made up the group of eight primitive deities There can be little doubt but that Ea as he survives to us is of later characterization than the first pair of primitive deities who symbolized the deep 
6782_61316_000034_000001	train-clean-360	The attributes of this beneficent god reflect the progress and the social and moral ideals of a people well advanced in civilization

none	none	In brief he was the dragon slayer a distinction by the way which was attached in later times to his son Merodach the Babylonian god although Ea was still credited with the victory over the dragon s husband When Ea was one of the pre Babylonian group the triad of Bel Enlil Anu and Ea he resembled the Indian Vishnu the Preserver while Bel Enlil resembled Shiva the Destroyer and Anu the father supreme Brahma the Creator and Father of All the difference in exact adjustment being due perhaps to Sumerian political conditions Ea as we have seen symbolized the beneficence of the waters their destructive force was represented by Tiamat or Tiawath the dragon and Apsu her husband the arch enemy of the gods 
6782_61316_000036_000001	train-clean-360	We shall find these elder demons figuring in the Babylonian Creation myth which receives treatment in a later chapter 
none	none	The ancient Sumerian city of Eridu which means on the seashore was invested with great sanctity from the earliest times and Ea the great magician of the gods was invoked by workers of spells the priestly magicians of historic Babylonia Excavations have shown that Eridu was protected by a retaining wall of sandstone of which material many of its houses were made

none	none	It is referred to in the fragments of early literature which have survived as the splendid house shady as the forest that none may enter The mythological spell exercised by Eridu in later times suggests that the civilization of Sumeria owed much to the worshippers of Ea

6782_61316_000037_000007	train-clean-360	The Egyptians obtained from that sacred land incense bearing trees which had magical potency 
6782_61316_000037_000008	train-clean-360	In a fragmentary Babylonian charm there is a reference to a sacred tree or bush at Eridu 
6782_61316_000037_000009	train-clean-360	Professor Sayce has suggested that it is the Biblical Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden 
none	none	His translations of certain vital words however is sharply questioned by mister R Campbell Thompson of the British Museum who does not accept the theory forty nine It may be that Ea s sacred bush or tree is a survival of tree and water worship 
6782_61316_000038_000000	train-clean-360	If Eridu was not the cradle of the Sumerian race it was possibly the cradle of Sumerian civilization

6918_61317_000003_000000	train-clean-360	In dealing with the city cults of Sumer and Akkad consideration must be given to the problems involved by the rival mythological systems Pantheons not only varied in detail but were presided over by different supreme gods 
6918_61317_000003_000001	train-clean-360	One city s chief deity might be regarded as a secondary deity at another centre 
none	none	Although Ea for instance was given first place at Eridu and was so pronouncedly Sumerian in character the moon god Nannar remained supreme at Ur while the sun god whose Semitic name was Shamash presided at Larsa and Sippar Other deities were similarly exalted in other states 
6918_61317_000004_000000	train-clean-360	As has been indicated a mythological system must have been strongly influenced by city politics 
none	none	To hold a community in sway it was necessary to recognize officially the various gods worshipped by different sections so as to secure the constant allegiance of all classes to their rulers Alien deities were therefore associated with local and tribal deities those of the nomads with those of the agriculturists those of the unlettered folks with those of the learned people 
6918_61317_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Reference has been made to the introduction of strange deities by conquerors

6918_61317_000004_000006	train-clean-360	When they came as military allies to assist a city folk against a fierce enemy they were naturally much admired and praised honoured by the women and the bards and rewarded by the rulers 
none	none	In the epic of Gilgamesh the Babylonian Hercules we meet with Ea bani a Goliath of the wilds who is entreated to come to the aid of the besieged city of Erech when it seemed that its deities were unable to help the people against their enemies The gods of walled round Erech To flies had turned and buzzed in the streets The winged bulls of walled round Erech Were turned to mice and departed through the holes 
6918_61317_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Ea bani was attracted to Erech by the gift of a fair woman for wife The poet who lauded him no doubt mirrored public opinion 
none	none	We can see the slim shaven Sumerians gazing with wonder and admiration on their rough heroic ally All his body was covered with hair His locks were like a woman s Thick as corn grew his abundant hair He was a stranger to the people and in that land Clad in a garment like Gira the god He had eaten grass with the gazelles He had drunk water with savage beasts His delight was to be among water dwellers 
6918_61317_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Like the giant Alban the eponymous ancestor of a people who invaded prehistoric Britain Ea bani appears to have represented in Babylonian folk legends a certain type of foreign settlers in the land 
none	none	No doubt the city dwellers who were impressed by the prowess of the hairy and powerful warriors were also ready to acknowledge the greatness of their war gods and to admit them into the pantheon The fusion of beliefs which followed must have stimulated thought and been productive of speculative ideas Nowhere remarks Professor Jastrow does a high form of culture arise without the commingling of diverse ethnic elements We must also take into account the influence exercised by leaders of thought like En we dur an ki the famous high priest of Sippar whose piety did much to increase the reputation of the cult of Shamesh the sun god 
6918_61317_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The teachings and example of Buddha for instance revolutionized Brahmanic religion in India

6918_61317_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The religious attitude of a particular community therefore must have been largely dependent on its needs and experiences 
6918_61317_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The food supply was a first consideration 
6918_61317_000012_000002	train-clean-360	At Eridu as we have seen it was assured by devotion to Ea and obedience to his commands as an instructor Elsewhere it might happen however that Ea s gifts were restricted or withheld by an obstructing force the raging storm god or the parching pestilence bringing deity of the sun 
6918_61317_000012_000003	train-clean-360	It was necessary therefore for the people to win the favour of the god or goddess who seemed most powerful and was accordingly considered to be the greatest in a particular district 
6918_61317_000012_000004	train-clean-360	A rain god presided over the destinies of one community and a god of disease and death over another a third exalted the war god no doubt because raids were frequent and the city owed its strength and prosperity to its battles and conquests 
none	none	The reputation won by a particular god throughout Babylonia would depend greatly on the achievements of his worshippers and the progress of the city civilization over which he presided Bel Enlil s fame as a war deity was probably due to the political supremacy of his city of Nippur and there was probably good reason for attributing to the sun god a pronounced administrative and legal character he may have controlled the destinies of exceedingly well organized communities in which law and order and authority were held in high esteem 
6918_61317_000013_000000	train-clean-360	In accounting for the rise of distinctive and rival city deities we should also consider the influence of divergent conceptions regarding the origin of life in mingled communities 
6918_61317_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Each foreign element in a community had its own intellectual life and immemorial tribal traditions which reflected ancient habits of life and perpetuated the doctrines of eponymous ancestors 
none	none	Among the agricultural classes the folk religion which entered so intimately into their customs and labours must have remained essentially Babylonish in character In cities however where official religions were formulated foreign ideas were more apt to be imposed especially when embraced by influential teachers 
6918_61317_000013_000004	train-clean-360	It is not surprising therefore to find that in Babylonia as in Egypt there were differences of opinion regarding the origin of life and the particular natural element which represented the vital principle 
6918_61317_000014_000000	train-clean-360	One section of the people who were represented by the worshippers of Ea appear to have believed that the essence of life was contained in water 
6918_61317_000014_000001	train-clean-360	The god of Eridu was the source of the water of life

6918_61317_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Even the gods required water and food they were immortal because they had drunk ambrosia and eaten from the plant of life 
none	none	When the goddess Ishtar was in the Underworld the land of the dead the servant of Ea exclaimed Hail lady may the well give me of its waters so that I may drink The goddess of the dead commanded her servant to sprinkle the lady Ishtar with the water of life and bid her depart The sacred water might also be found at a confluence of rivers Ea bade his son Merodach to draw water from the mouth of two streams and on this water to put his pure spell 
6918_61317_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The worship of rivers and wells which prevailed in many countries was connected with the belief that the principle of life was in moisture In India water was vitalized by the intoxicating juice of the Soma plant which inspired priests to utter prophecies and filled their hearts with religious fervour 
6918_61317_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Drinking customs had originally a religious significance

6918_61317_000037_000002	train-clean-360	It is possible that this conception was popularized by the Semites Inspiration was perhaps derived from these deities by burning incense which if we follow evidence obtained elsewhere induced a prophetic trance

6918_61317_000039_000000	train-clean-360	It is possible of course that fire was regarded as the vital principle by some city cults which were influenced by imported ideas If so the belief never became prevalent 
none	none	The most enduring influence in Babylonian religion was the early Sumerian and as Sumerian modes of thought were the outcome of habits of life necessitated by the character of the country they were bound sooner or later to leave a deep impress on the minds of foreign peoples who settled in the Garden of Western Asia It is not surprising therefore to find that imported deities assumed Babylonian characteristics and were identified or associated with Babylonian gods in the later imperial pantheon 
6918_61317_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Moon worship appears to have been as ancient as water worship with which as we have seen it was closely associated

none	none	During the winter Tammuz dwelt in Hades and at the beginning of spring Ishtar descended to search for him among the shades sixty seven But the burning summer sun was symbolized as a destroyer a slayer of men and therefore a war god As Ninip or Nirig the son of Enlil who was made in the likeness of Anu he waged war against the earth spirits and was furiously hostile towards the deities of alien peoples as befitted a god of battle Even his father feared him and when he was advancing towards Nippur sent out Nusku messenger of the gods to soothe the raging deity with soft words Ninip was symbolized as a wild bull was connected with stone worship like the Indian destroying god Shiva and was similarly a deity of Fate

6918_61317_000046_000003	train-clean-360	He was the chief deity of the city of Cuthah which Jastrow suggests was situated beside a burial place of great repute like the Egyptian Abydos 
none	none	The two great cities of the sun in ancient Babylonia were the Akkadian Sippar and the Sumerian Larsa In these the sun god Shamash or Babbar was the patron deity 
6918_61317_000047_000002	train-clean-360	He was a god of Destiny the lord of the living and the dead and was exalted as the great Judge the lawgiver who upheld justice he was the enemy of wrong he loved righteousness and hated sin he inspired his worshippers with rectitude and punished evildoers 
6918_61317_000047_000003	train-clean-360	The sun god also illumined the world and his rays penetrated every quarter he saw all things and read the thoughts of men nothing could be concealed from Shamash

none	none	In the Babylonian Flood legend it is the sun god Shamash who appointed the time when the heavens were to rain destruction in the night and commanded Pir napishtim Enter into the midst of thy ship and shut thy door 
6918_61317_000050_000007	train-clean-360	The solar deity thus appears as a form of Anu god of the sky and upper atmosphere who controls the seasons and the various forces of nature

none	none	It is possible that the close resemblances between Mithra and Mitra of the Aryan speaking peoples of India and the Iranian plateau and the sun god of the Babylonians the Semitic Shamash the Sumerian Utu were due to early contact and cultural influence through the medium of Elam As a solar and corn god the Persian Mithra links with Tammuz as a sky and atmospheric deity with Anu and as a god of truth righteousness and law with Shamash We seem to trace in the sublime Vedic hymns addressed by the Indian Aryans to Mitra and Varuna the impress of Babylonian religious thought Whate er exists within this earth and all within the sky Yea all that is beyond King Varuna perceives Rigveda iv sixteen seventy two

6918_61317_000060_000001	train-clean-360	At Erech she had a shrine in the temple of the sky god Anu 
6918_61317_000061_000000	train-clean-360	We can trace in Babylonia as in Egypt the early belief that life in the Universe had a female origin 
6918_61317_000061_000001	train-clean-360	Nin sun links with Ishtar whose Sumerian name is Nana 
6918_61317_000061_000002	train-clean-360	Ishtar appears to be identical with the Egyptian Hathor who as Sekhet slaughtered the enemies of the sun god Ra 
6918_61317_000061_000003	train-clean-360	She was similarly the goddess of maternity and is depicted in this character like Isis and other goddesses of similar character suckling a babe 
none	none	Another Babylonian lady of the gods was Ama Mama or Mami the creatress of the seed of mankind and was probably so called as the mother of all things seventy six A characteristic atmospheric deity was Ramman the Rimmon of the Bible the Semitic Addu Adad Hadad or Dadu He was not a presiding deity in any pantheon but was identified with Enlil at Nippur 
6918_61317_000062_000002	train-clean-360	As a hammer god he was imported by the Semites from the hills 
6918_61317_000062_000003	train-clean-360	He was a wind and thunder deity a rain bringer a corn god and a god of battle like Thor Jupiter Tarku Indra and others who were all sons of the sky 
none	none	In this brief review of the representative deities of early Babylonia it will be seen that most gods link with Anu Ea and Enlil whose attributes they symbolized in various forms 
6918_61317_000063_000001	train-clean-360	The prominence accorded to an individual deity depended on local conditions experiences and influences 
none	none	Ceremonial practices no doubt varied here and there but although one section might exalt Ea and another Shamash the religious faith of the people as a whole did not differ to any marked extent they served the gods according to their lights so that life might be prolonged and made prosperous for the land of death and no return was regarded as a place of gloom and misery When the Babylonians appear before us in the early stages of the historical period they had reached that stage of development set forth so vividly in the Orations of Isocrates Those of the gods who are the source to us of good things have the title of Olympians those whose department is that of calamities and punishments have harsher titles to the first class both private persons and states erect altars and temples the second is not worshipped either with prayers or burnt sacrifices but in their case we perform ceremonies of riddance seventy seven 
6918_61317_000065_000000	train-clean-360	The Sumerians like the Ancient Egyptians developed their deities who reflected the growth of culture from vague spirit groups which like ghosts were hostile to mankind 
none	none	Those spirits who could be propitiated were exalted as benevolent deities those who could not be bargained with were regarded as evil gods and goddesses A better understanding of the character of Babylonian deities will therefore be obtained by passing the demons and evil spirits under review CHAPTER IV DEMONS FAIRIES AND GHOSTS Spirits in Everything and Everywhere The Bringers of

preached by Paul to the Athenians when he stood in the midst of Mars hill could have been addressed with equal appropriateness to the ancient Sumerians and Akkadians I perceive he declared that in all things ye are too superstitious God that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with men s hands as though he needed any thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said For we are also his offspring Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and man s device seventy eight Babylonian temples were houses of the gods in the literal sense the gods were supposed to dwell in them their spirits having entered into the graven images or blocks of stone It is probable that like the Ancient Egyptians they believed a god had as many spirits as he had attributes The gods as we have said appear to have evolved from early spirit groups All the world swarmed with spirits which inhabited stones and trees mountains and deserts rivers and ocean the air the sky the stars and the sun and moon The spirits controlled Nature they brought light and darkness sunshine and storm summer and winter they were manifested in the thunderstorm the sandstorm the glare of sunset and the wraiths of mist rising from the steaming marshes They controlled also the lives of men and women The good spirits were the source of luck The bad spirits caused misfortunes and were ever seeking to work evil against the Babylonian Darkness was peopled by demons and ghosts of the dead The spirits of disease were ever lying in wait to clutch him with cruel invisible hands Some modern writers who are too prone to regard ancient peoples from a twentieth century point of view express grave doubts as to whether intelligent Babylonians really believed that spirits came down in the rain and entered the soil to rise up before men s eyes as stalks of barley or wheat There is no reason for supposing that they thought otherwise The early folks based their theories on the accumulated knowledge of their age They knew nothing regarding the composition of water or the atmosphere of the cause of thunder and lightning or of the chemical changes effected in soils by the action of bacteria They attributed all natural phenomena to the operations of spirits or gods In believing that certain demons caused certain diseases they may be said to have achieved distinct progress for they anticipated the germ theory They made discoveries too which have been approved and elaborated in later times when they lit sacred fires bathed in sacred waters and used oils and herbs to charm away spirits of pestilence Indeed many folk cures which were originally associated with magical ceremonies are still practised in our own day They were found to be effective by early observers although they were unable to explain why and how cures were accomplished like modern scientific investigators In peopling the Universe with spirits the Babylonians like other ancient folks betrayed that tendency to symbolize everything which has ever appealed to the human mind Our painters and poets and sculptors are greatest when they symbolize their ideals and ideas and impressions and by so doing make us respond to their moods Their beauty and their terror are sublime But what may seem poetic to us was invariably a grim reality to the Babylonians The statue or picture was not merely a work of art but a manifestation of the god or demon As has been said they believed that the spirit of the god inhabited the idol the frown of the brazen image was the frown of the wicked demon They entertained as much dread of the winged and human headed bulls guarding the entrance to the royal palace as do some of the Arab workmen who in our own day assist excavators to rescue them from sandy mounds in which they have been hidden for long centuries When an idol was carried away from a city by an invading army it was believed that the god himself had been taken prisoner and was therefore unable any longer to help his people In the early stages of Sumerian culture the gods and goddesses who formed groups were indistinguishable from demons They were vaguely defined and had changing shapes When attempts were made to depict them they were represented in many varying forms Some were winged bulls or lions with human heads others had even more remarkable composite forms The dragon of Babylon for instance which was portrayed on walls of temples had a serpent s head a body covered with scales the fore legs of a lion hind legs of an eagle and a long wriggling serpentine tail Ea had several monster forms The following description of one of these is repulsive enough The head is the head of a serpent From his nostrils mucus trickles His mouth is beslavered with water The ears are like those of a basilisk His horns are twisted into three curls He wears a veil in his head band The body is a suh fish full of stars The base of his feet are claws The sole of his foot has no heel His name is Sassu wunnu A sea monster a form of Ea R C Thompson s Translation seventy nine Even after the gods were given beneficent attributes to reflect the growth of culture and were humanized they still retained many of their savage characteristics Bel Enlil and his fierce son Nergal were destroyers of mankind the storm god desolated the land the sky god deluged it with rain the sea raged furiously ever hungering for human victims the burning sun struck down its victims and the floods played havoc with the dykes and houses of human beings In Egypt the sun god Ra was similarly a producer of calamity the composite monster god Sokar was the lord of fear eighty Osiris in prehistoric times had been a dangerous god and some of the Pharaohs sought protection against him in the charms inscribed in their tombs eighty one The Indian Shiva the Destroyer in the old religious poems has also primitive attributes of like character The Sumerian gods never lost their connection with the early spirit groups These continued to be represented by their attendants who executed a deity s stern and vengeful decrees In one of the Babylonian charms the demons are referred to as the spleen of the gods the symbols of their wrathful emotions and vengeful desires Bel Enlil the air and earth god was served by the demons of disease the beloved sons of Bel which issued from the Underworld to attack mankind Nergal the sulky and ill tempered lord of death and destruction who never lost his demoniac character swept over the land followed by the spirits of pestilence sunstroke weariness and destruction Anu the sky god had spawned at creation the demons of cold and rain and darkness Even Ea and his consort Damkina were served by groups of devils and giants which preyed upon mankind in bleak and desolate places when night fell In the ocean home of Ea were bred the seven evil spirits of tempest the gaping dragon the leopard which preyed upon children the great Beast the terrible serpent c In Indian mythology Indra was similarly followed by the stormy Maruts and fierce Rudra by the tempestuous Rudras In Teutonic mythology Odin is the Wild Huntsman in the Raging Host In Greek mythology the ocean furies attend upon fickle Poseidon Other examples of this kind could be multiplied As we have seen Chapter II the earliest group of Babylonian deities consisted probably of four pairs of gods and goddesses as in Egypt The first pair was Apsu Rishtu and Tiamat who personified the primordial deep Now the elder deities in most mythologies the grandsires and grandmothers and fathers and mothers are ever the most powerful and most vengeful They appear to represent primitive layers of savage thought The Greek Cronos devours even his own children and as the late Andrew Lang has shown there are many parallels to this myth among primitive peoples in various parts of the world Lang regarded the Greek survival as an example of the conservatism of the religious instinct eighty two The grandmother of the Teutonic deity Tyr was a fierce giantess with nine hundred heads his father was an enemy of the gods In Scotland the hag mother of winter and storm and darkness is the enemy of growth and all life and she raises storms to stop the grass growing to slay young animals and prevent the union of her son with his fair bride Similarly the Babylonian chaos spirits Apsu and Tiamat the father and mother of the gods resolve to destroy their offspring because they begin to set the Universe in order Tiamat the female dragon is more powerful than her husband Apsu who is slain by his son Ea She summons to her aid the gods of evil and creates also a brood of monsters serpents dragons vipers fish men raging hounds c so as to bring about universal and enduring confusion and evil Not until she is destroyed can the beneficent gods establish law and order and make the earth habitable and beautiful But although Tiamat was slain the everlasting battle between the forces of good and evil was ever waged in the Babylonian world Certain evil spirits were let loose at certain periods and they strove to accomplish the destruction of mankind and his works These invisible enemies were either charmed away by performing magical ceremonies or by invoking the gods to thwart them and bind them Other spirits inhabited the bodies of animals and were ever hovering near The ghosts of the dead and male and female demons were birds like the birds of Fate which sang to Siegfried When the owl raised its melancholy voice in the darkness the listener heard the spirit of a departed mother crying for her child Ghosts and evil spirits wandered through the streets in darkness they haunted empty houses they fluttered through the evening air as bats they hastened moaning dismally across barren wastes searching for food or lay in wait for travellers they came as roaring lions and howling jackals hungering for human flesh The shedu was a destructive bull which might slay man wantonly or as a protector of temples Of like character was the lamassu depicted as a winged bull with human head the protector of palaces the alu was a bull like demon of tempest and there were also many composite distorted or formless monsters which were vaguely termed seizers or overthrowers the Semitic labashu and ach chazu the Sumerian dimmea and dimme kur A dialectic form of gallu or devil was mulla Professor Pinches thinks it not improbable that mulla may be connected with the word mula meaning star and suggests that it referred to a will o the wisp eighty three In these islands according to an old rhyme Some call him Robin Good fellow Hob goblin or mad Crisp And some againe doe tearme him oft By name of Will the Wisp Other names are Kitty Peg and Jack with a lantern Poor Robin sang I should indeed as soon expect That Peg a lantern would direct Me straightway home on misty night As wand ring stars quite out of sight In Shakespeare s Tempest eighty four a sailor exclaims Your fairy which you say is a harmless fairy has done little better than played the Jack with us doctor Johnson commented that the reference was to Jack with a lantern Milton wrote also of the wandering fire Which oft they say some evil spirit attends Hovering and blazing with delusive light Misleads th amaz d night wand rer from his way To bogs and mires and oft through pond or pool There swallowed up and lost from succour far eighty five When we stick in the mire sang Drayton he doth with laughter leave us These fires were also fallen stars death fires and fire drakes So have I seen a fire drake glide along Before a dying man to point his grave And in it stick and hide eighty six Pliny referred to the wandering lights as stars eighty seven The Sumerian mulla was undoubtedly an evil spirit In some countries the fire drake is a bird with gleaming breast in Babylonia it assumed the form of a bull and may have had some connection with the bull of lshtar Like the Indian Dasyu and Dasa eighty eight Gallu was applied in the sense of foreign devil to human and superhuman adversaries of certain monarchs Some of the supernatural beings resemble our elves and fairies and the Indian Rakshasas Occasionally they appear in comely human guise at other times they are vaguely monstrous The best known of this class is Lilith who according to Hebrew tradition preserved in the Talmud was the demon lover of Adam She has been immortalized by Dante Gabriel Rossetti Of Adam s first wife Lilith it is told The witch he loved before the gift of Eve That ere the snake s her sweet tongue could deceive And her enchanted hair was the first gold And still she sits young while the earth is old And subtly of herself contemplative Draws men to watch the bright web she can weave Till heart and body and life are in its hold The rose and poppy are her flowers for where Is he not found O Lilith whom shed scent And soft shed kisses and soft sleep shall snare Lo as that youth s eyes burned at thine so went Thy spell through him and left his straight neck bent And round his heart one strangling golden hair Lilith is the Babylonian Lilithu a feminine form of Lilu the Sumerian Lila She resembles Surpanakha of the Ramayana who made love to Rama and Lakshmana and the sister of the demon Hidimva who became enamoured of Bhima one of the heroes of the Mahabharata eighty nine and the various fairy lovers of Europe who lured men to eternal imprisonment inside mountains or vanished for ever when they were completely under their influence leaving them demented The elfin Lilu similarly wooed young women like the Germanic Laurin of the Wonderful Rose Garden ninety who carried away the fair lady Kunhild to his underground dwelling amidst the Tyrolese mountains or left them haunting the place of their meetings searching for him in vain A savage place as holy and enchanted As ere beneath the waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon lover His flashing eyes his floating hair Weave a circle round him thrice And close your eyes with holy dread For he on honey dew hath fed And drunk the milk of Paradise Coleridge s Kubla Khan Another materializing spirit of this class was Ardat Lili who appears to have wedded human beings like the swan maidens the mermaids and Nereids of the European folk tales and the goddess Ganga who for a time was the wife of King Shantanu of the Mahabharata ninety one The Labartu to whom we have referred was a female who haunted mountains and marshes like the fairies and hags of Europe she stole or afflicted children who accordingly had to wear charms round their necks for protection Seven of these supernatural beings were reputed to be daughters of Anu the sky god The Alu a storm deity was also a spirit which caused nightmare It endeavoured to smother sleepers like the Scandinavian hag Mara and similarly deprived them of power to move In Babylonia this evil spirit might also cause sleeplessness or death by hovering near a bed In shape it might be as horrible and repulsive as the Egyptian ghosts which caused children to die from fright or by sucking out the breath of life As most representatives of the spirit world were enemies of the living so were the ghosts of dead men and women Death chilled all human affections it turned love to hate the deeper the love had been the deeper became the enmity fostered by the ghost Certain ghosts might also be regarded as particularly virulent and hostile if they happened to have left the body of one who was ceremonially impure The most terrible ghost in Babylonia was that of a woman who had died in childbed She was pitied and dreaded her grief had demented her she was doomed to wail in the darkness her impurity clung to her like poison No spirit was more prone to work evil against mankind and her hostility was accompanied by the most tragic sorrow In Northern India the Hindus like the ancient Babylonians regard as a fearsome demon the ghost of a woman who died while pregnant or on the day of the child s birth ninety two A similar belief prevailed in Mexico In Europe there are many folk tales of dead mothers who return to avenge themselves on the cruel fathers of neglected children A sharp contrast is presented by the Mongolian Buriats whose outlook on the spirit world is less gloomy than was that of the ancient Babylonians According to mister Jeremiah Curtin this interesting people are wont to perform a ceremony with purpose to entice the ghost to return to the dead body a proceeding which is dreaded in the Scottish Highlands ninety three The Buriats address the ghost saying You shall sleep well Come back to your natural ashes Take pity on your friends It is necessary to live a real life Do not wander along the mountains Do not be like bad spirits Return to your peaceful home Come back and work for your children How can you leave the little ones If it is a mother these words have great effect sometimes the spirit moans and sobs and the Buriats tell that there have been instances of it returning to the body ninety four In his Arabia Deserta ninety five Doughty relates that Arab women and children mock the cries of the owl One explained to him It is a wailful woman seeking her lost child she has become this forlorn bird So do immemorial beliefs survive to our own day The Babylonian ghosts of unmarried men and women and of those without offspring were also disconsolate night wanderers Others who suffered similar fates were the ghosts of men who died in battle far from home and were left unburied the ghosts of travellers who perished in the desert and were not covered over the ghosts of drowned men which rose from the water the ghosts of prisoners starved to death or executed the ghosts of people who died violent deaths before their appointed time The dead required to be cared for to have libations poured out to be fed so that they might not prowl through the streets or enter houses searching for scraps of food and pure water The duty of giving offerings to the dead was imposed apparently on near relatives As in India it would appear that the eldest son performed the funeral ceremony a dreadful fate therefore awaited the spirit of the dead Babylonian man or woman without offspring In Sanskrit literature there is a reference to a priest who was not allowed to enter Paradise although he had performed rigid penances because he had no children ninety six There were hags and giants of mountain and desert of river and ocean Demons might possess the pig the goat the horse the lion or the ibis the raven or the hawk The seven spirits of tempest fire and destruction rose from the depths of ocean and there were hosts of demons which could not be overcome or baffled by man without the assistance of the gods to whom they were hostile Many were sexless having no offspring they were devoid of mercy and compassion They penetrated everywhere The high enclosures the broad enclosures like a flood they pass through From house to house they dash along No door can shut them out No bolt can turn them back Through the door like a snake they glide Through the hinge like the wind they storm Tearing the wife from the embrace of the man Driving the freedman from his family home ninety seven These furies did not confine their unwelcomed attentions to mankind alone They hunt the doves from their cotes And drive the birds from their nests And chase the marten from its hole Through the gloomy street by night they roam Smiting sheepfold and cattle pen Shutting up the land as with door and bolt R C Thompson s Translation The Babylonian poet like Burns was filled with pity for the animals which suffered in the storm List ning the doors an winnocks rattle I thought me o the ourie cattle Or silly sheep wha bide this brattle O winter war Ilk happing bird wee helpless thing That in the merry months o spring Delighted me to hear thee sing What comes o thee Whare wilt thou cow r thy chittering wing And close thy e e According to Babylonian belief the great storms directed from heaven were caused by demons Mankind heard them loudly roaring above gibbering below ninety eight The south wind was raised by Shutu a plumed storm demon resembling Hraesvelgur of the Icelandic Eddas Corpse swallower sits at the end of heaven A Joetun in eagle form From his wings they say comes the wind which fares Over all the dwellers of earth ninety nine The northern story of Thor s fishing when he hooked and wounded the Midgard serpent is recalled by the Babylonian legend of Adapa son of the god Ea This hero was engaged catching fish when Shutu the south wind upset his boat In his wrath Adapa immediately attacked the storm demon and shattered her pinions Anu the sky god was moved to anger against Ea s son and summoned him to the Celestial Court Adapa however appeared in garments of mourning and was forgiven Anu offered him the water of life and the bread of life which would have made him immortal but Ea s son refused to eat or drink believing as his father had warned him that the sky god desired him to partake of the bread of death and to drink of the water of death Another terrible atmospheric demon was the south west wind which caused destructive storms and floods and claimed many human victims like the Icelandic corpse swallower She was depicted with lidless staring eyes broad flat nose mouth gaping horribly and showing tusk like teeth and with high cheek bones heavy eyebrows and low bulging forehead In Scotland the hag of the south west wind is similarly a bloodthirsty and fearsome demon She is most virulent in the springtime At Cromarty she is quaintly called Gentle Annie by the fisher folks who repeat the saying When Gentle Annie is skyawlan yelling roond the heel of Ness a promontory wi a white feather on her hat the foam of big billows they the spirits will be harrying robbing the crook that is the pot which hangs from the crook is empty during the spring storms which prevent fishermen going to sea In England the wind hag is Black Annis who dwells in a Leicestershire hill cave She may be identical with the Irish hag Anu associated with the Paps of Anu According to Gaelic lore this wind demon of spring is the Cailleach old wife She gives her name in the Highland calendar to the stormy period of late spring she raises gale after gale to prevent the coming of summer Angerboda the Icelandic hag is also a storm demon but represents the east wind A Tyrolese folk tale tells of three magic maidens who dwelt on Jochgrimm mountain where they brewed the winds Their demon lovers were Ecke he who causes fear Vasolt he who causes dismay and the scornful Dietrich in his mythical character of Donar or Thunor Thor the thunderer Another Sumerian storm demon was the Zu bird which is represented among the stars by Pegasus and Taurus A legend relates that this worker of evil who raised the head of evil once aspired to rule the gods and stole from Bel the lord of deities the Tablets of Destiny which gave him his power over the Universe as controller of the fates of all The Zu bird escaped with the Tablets and found shelter on its mountain top in Arabia Anu called on Ramman the thunderer to attack the Zu bird but he was afraid other gods appear to have shrunk from the conflict How the rebel was overcome is not certain because the legend survives in fragmentary form There is a reference however to the moon god setting out towards the mountain in Arabia with purpose to outwit the Zu bird and recover the lost Tablets How he fared it is impossible to ascertain In another legend that of Etana the mother serpent addressing the sun god Shamash says Thy net is like unto the broad earth Thy snare is like unto the distant heaven Who hath ever escaped from thy net Even Zu the worker of evil who raised the head of evil did not escape L W King s Translation In Indian mythology Garuda half giant half eagle robs the Amrita ambrosia of the gods which gives them their power and renders them immortal It had assumed a golden body bright as the sun Indra the thunderer flung his bolt in vain he could not wound Garuda and only displaced a single feather Afterwards however he stole the moon goblet containing the Amrita which Garuda had delivered to his enemies the serpents to free his mother from bondage This Indian eagle giant became the vehicle of the god Vishnu and according to the Mahabharata mocked the wind with his fleetness It would appear that the Babylonian Zu bird symbolized the summer sandstorms from the Arabian desert Thunder is associated with the rainy season and it may have been assumed therefore that the thunder god was powerless against the sandstorm demon who was chased however by the moon and finally overcome by the triumphant sun when it broke through the darkening sand drift and brightened heaven and earth netting the rebellious demon who desired to establish the rule of evil over gods and mankind In the Legend of Etana the Eagle another demon which links with the Indian Garuda slayer of serpents devours the brood of the Mother Serpent For this offence against divine law Shamash the sun god pronounces the Eagle s doom He instructs the Mother Serpent to slay a wild ox and conceal herself in its entrails The Eagle comes to feed on the carcass unheeding the warning of one of his children who says The serpent lies in this wild ox He swooped down and stood upon the wild ox The Eagle examined the flesh He looked about carefully before and behind him He again examined the flesh He looked about carefully before and behind him Then moving swiftly he made for the hidden parts When he entered into the midst The serpent seized him by his wing In vain the Eagle appealed for mercy to the Mother Serpent who was compelled to execute the decree of Shamash she tore off the Eagle s pinions wings and claws and threw him into a pit where he perished from hunger and thirst one hundred This myth may refer to the ravages of a winged demon of disease who was thwarted by the sacrifice of an ox The Mother Serpent appears to be identical with an ancient goddess of maternity resembling the Egyptian Bast the serpent mother of Bubastis According to Sumerian belief Nintu a form of the goddess Ma was half a serpent On her head there is a horn she is girt about the loins her left arm holds a babe suckling her breast From her head to her loins The body is that of a naked woman From the loins to the sole of the foot Scales like those of a snake are visible R C Thompson s Translation The close association of gods and demons is illustrated in an obscure myth which may refer to an eclipse of the moon or a night storm at the beginning of the rainy season The demons go to war against the high gods and are assisted by Adad Ramman the thunderer Shamash the sun and Ishtar They desire to wreck the heavens the home of Anu They clustered angrily round the crescent of the moon god And won over to their aid Shamash the mighty and Adad the warrior And Ishtar who with Anu the King Hath founded a shining dwelling The moon god Sin the seed of mankind was darkened by the demons who raged rushing loose over the land like to the wind Bel called upon his messenger whom he sent to Ea in the ocean depths saying My son Sin hath been grievously bedimmed Ea lamented and dispatched his son Merodach to net the demons by magic using a two coloured cord from the hair of a virgin kid and from the wool of a virgin lamb one hundred one As in India where Shitala the Bengali goddess of smallpox for instance is worshipped when the dreaded disease she controls becomes epidemic so in Babylonia the people sought to secure immunity from attack by worshipping spirits of disease A tablet relates that Ura a plague demon once resolved to destroy all life but ultimately consented to spare those who praised his name and exalted him in recognition of his bravery and power This could be accomplished by reciting a formula Indian serpent worshippers believe that their devotions destroy all danger proceeding from snakes one hundred two Like the Ancient Egyptians the Babylonians also had their kindly spirits who brought luck and the various enjoyments of life A good labartu might attend on a human being like a household fairy of India or Europe a friendly shedu could protect a household against the attacks of fierce demons and human enemies Even the spirits of Fate who served Anu god of the sky and that Norn of the Underworld Eresh ki gal queen of Hades might sometimes be propitious if the deities were successfully invoked they could cause the Fates to smite spirits of disease and bringers of ill luck Damu a friendly fairy goddess was well loved because she inspired pleasant dreams relieved the sufferings of the afflicted and restored to good health those patients whom she selected to favour In the Egyptian Book of the Dead the kindly spirits are overshadowed by the evil ones because the various magical spells which were put on record were directed against those supernatural beings who were enemies of mankind Similarly in Babylonia the fragments of this class of literature which survive deal mainly with wicked and vengeful demons It appears probable however that the highly emotional Sumerians and Akkadians were on occasion quite as cheerful a people as the inhabitants of ancient Egypt Although they were surrounded by bloodthirsty furies who desired to shorten their days and their nights were filled with vague lowering phantoms which inspired fear they no doubt shared in their charm protected houses a comfortable feeling of security after performing magical ceremonies and were happy enough when they gathered round flickering lights to listen to ancient song and story and gossip about crops and traders the members of the royal house and the family affairs of their acquaintances The Babylonian spirit world it will be seen was of complex character Its inhabitants were numberless but often vaguely defined and one class of demons linked with another Like the European fairies of folk belief the Babylonian spirits were extremely hostile and irresistible at certain seasonal periods and they were fickle and perverse and difficult to please even when inclined to be friendly They were also similarly manifested from time to time in various forms Sometimes they were comely and beautiful at other times they were apparitions of horror The Jinn of present day Arabians are of like character these may be giants cloudy shapes comely women serpents or cats goats or pigs Some of the composite monsters of Babylonia may suggest the vague and exaggerated recollections of terror stricken people who have had glimpses of unfamiliar wild beasts in the dusk or amidst reedy marshes But they cannot be wholly accounted for in this way While animals were often identified with supernatural beings and foreigners were called devils it would be misleading to assert that the spirit world reflects confused folk memories of human and bestial enemies Even when a demon was given concrete human form it remained essentially non human no ordinary weapon could inflict an injury and it was never controlled by natural laws The spirits of disease and tempest and darkness were creations of fancy they symbolized moods they were the causes which explained effects A sculptor or storyteller who desired to convey an impression of a spirit of storm or pestilence created monstrous forms to inspire terror Sudden and unexpected visits of fierce and devastating demons were accounted for by asserting that they had wings like eagles were nimble footed as gazelles cunning and watchful as serpents that they had claws to clutch horns to gore and powerful fore legs like a lion to smite down victims Withal they drank blood like ravens and devoured corpses like hyaenas Monsters were all the more repulsive when they were partly human The human headed snake or the snake headed man and the man with the horns of a wild bull and the legs of a goat were horrible in the extreme Evil spirits might sometimes achieve success by practising deception They might appear as beautiful girls or handsome men and seize unsuspecting victims in deathly embrace or leave them demented and full of grief or come as birds and suddenly assume awesome shapes Fairies and elves and other half human demons are sometimes regarded as degenerate gods It will be seen however that while certain spirits developed into deities others remained something between these two classes of supernatural beings they might attend upon gods and goddesses or operate independently now against mankind and now against deities even The namtaru for instance was a spirit of fate the son of Bel Enlil and Eresh ki gal queen of Hades Apparently writes Professor Pinches he executed the instructions given him concerning the fate of men and could also have power over certain of the gods one hundred three To this middle class belong the evil gods who rebelled against the beneficent deities According to Hebridean folk belief the fallen angels are divided into three classes the fairies the nimble men aurora borealis and the blue men of the Minch In Beowulf the brood of Cain includes monsters and elves and sea devils giants also who long time fought with God for which he gave them their reward one hundred four Similarly the Babylonian spirit groups are liable to division and subdivision The various classes may be regarded as relics of the various stages of development from crude animism to sublime monotheism in the fragmentary legends we trace the floating material from which great mythologies have been framed CHAPTER V MYTHS OF TAMMUZ AND ISHTAR Forms of Tammuz The Weeping Ceremony Tammuz the Patriarch and the Dying God Common Origin of Tammuz and other Deities from an Archaic God The Mediterranean Racial Myth Animal Forms of Gods of Fertility Two Legends of the Death of Tammuz Attis Adonis and Diarmid Slain by a Boar Laments for Tammuz His Soul in Underworld and

sheri and the Mother Ishtar The Egyptian Isis and Nepthys Goddesses as Mothers Sisters and Wives Great Mothers of Babylonia Immortal Goddesses and Dying Gods The Various Indras Celtic Goddess with Seven Periods of Youth Lovers of Germanic and Classic Goddesses The Lovers of Ishtar Racial Significance of Goddess Cult The Great Fathers and their Worshippers Process of Racial and Religious Fusion Ishtar and Tiamat Mother Worship in Palestine Women among Goddess Worshippers Among the gods of Babylonia none achieved wider and more enduring fame than Tammuz who was loved by Ishtar the amorous Queen of Heaven the beautiful youth who died and was mourned for and came to life again He does not figure by his popular name in any of the city pantheons but from the earliest times of which we have knowledge until the passing of Babylonian civilization he played a prominent part in the religious life of the people Tammuz like Osiris of Egypt was an agricultural deity and as the Babylonian harvest was the gift of the rivers it is probable that one of his several forms was Dumu zi abzu Tammuz of the Abyss He was also the child the heroic lord the sentinel the healer and the patriarch who reigned over the early Babylonians for a considerable period Tammuz of the Abyss was one of the members of the family of Ea god of the Deep whose other sons in addition to Merodach were Nira an obscure deity Ki gulla world destroyer Burnunta sa broad ear and Bara and Baragulla probably revealers or oracles In addition there was a daughter Khi dimme azaga child of the renowned spirit She may have been identical with Belit sheri who is referred to in the Sumerian hymns as the sister of Tammuz This family group was probably formed by symbolizing the attributes of Ea and his spouse Damkina Tammuz in his character as a patriarch may have been regarded as a hostage from the gods the human form of Ea who instructed mankind like King Osiris how to grow corn and cultivate fruit trees As the youth who perished annually he was the corn spirit He is referred to in the Bible by his Babylonian name When Ezekiel detailed the various idolatrous practices of the Israelites which included the worship of the sun and every form of creeping things and abominable beasts a suggestion of the composite monsters of Babylonia he was brought to the door of the gate of the Lord s house which was towards the north and behold there sat women weeping for Tammuz one hundred five The weeping ceremony was connected with agricultural rites Corn deities were weeping deities they shed fertilizing tears and the sowers simulated the sorrow of divine mourners when they cast seed in the soil to die so that it might spring up as corn This ancient custom like many others contributed to the poetic imagery of the Bible They that sow in tears David sang shall reap in joy He that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him one hundred six In Egypt the priestesses who acted the parts of Isis and Nepthys mourned for the slain corn god Osiris Gods and men before the face of the gods are weeping for thee at the same time when they behold me All thy sister goddesses are at thy side and behind thy couch Calling upon thee with weeping yet thou are prostrate upon thy bed Live before us desiring to behold thee one hundred seven It was believed to be essential that human beings should share the universal sorrow caused by the death of a god If they remained unsympathetic the deities would punish them as enemies Worshippers of nature gods therefore based their ceremonial practices on natural phenomena The dread of the worshippers that the neglect of the usual ritual would be followed by disaster is particularly intelligible writes Professor Robertson Smith if they regarded the necessary operations of agriculture as involving the violent extinction of a particle of divine life one hundred eight By observing their ritual the worshippers won the sympathy and company operation of deities or exercised a magical control over nature The Babylonian myth of Tammuz the dying god bears a close resemblance to the Greek myth of Adonis It also links with the myth of Osiris According to Professor Sayce Tammuz is identical with Daonus or Daos the shepherd of Pantibibla referred to by Berosus as the ruler of one of the mythical ages of Babylonia We have therefore to deal with Tammuz in his twofold character as a patriarch and a god of fertility The Adonis version of the myth may be summarized briefly Ere the god was born his mother who was pursued by her angry sire as the river goddesses of the folk tales are pursued by the well demons transformed herself into a tree Adonis sprang from the trunk of this tree and Aphrodite having placed the child in a chest committed him to the care of Persephone queen of Hades who resembles the Babylonian Eresh ki gal Persephone desired to retain the young god and Aphrodite Ishtar appealed to Zeus Anu who decreed that Adonis should spend part of the year with one goddess and part of the year with the other It is suggested that the myth of Adonis was derived in post Homeric times by the Greeks indirectly from Babylonia through the Western Semites the Semitic title Adon meaning lord having been mistaken for a proper name This theory however cannot be accepted without qualifications It does not explain the existence of either the Phrygian myth of Attis which was developed differently from the Tammuz myth or the Celtic story of Diarmid and the boar which belongs to the archaeological Hunting Period There are traces in Greek mythology of pre Hellenic myths about dying harvest deities like Hyakinthos and Erigone for instance who appear to have been mourned for There is every possibility therefore that the Tammuz ritual may have been attached to a harvest god of the pre Hellenic Greeks who received at the same time the new name of Adonis Osiris of Egypt resembles Tammuz but his Mesopotamian origin has not been proved It would appear probable that Tammuz Attis Osiris and the deities represented by Adonis and Diarmid were all developed from an archaic god of fertility and vegetation the central figure of a myth which was not only as ancient as the knowledge and practice of agriculture but had existence even in the Hunting Period Traces of the Tammuz Osiris story in various forms are found all over the area occupied by the Mediterranean or Brown race from Sumeria to the British Isles Apparently the original myth was connected with tree and water worship and the worship of animals Adonis sprang from a tree the body of Osiris was concealed in a tree which grew round the sea drifted chest in which he was concealed Diarmid concealed himself in a tree when pursued by Finn The blood of Tammuz Osiris and Adonis reddened the swollen rivers which fertilized the soil Various animals were associated with the harvest god who appears to have been manifested from time to time in different forms for his spirit pervaded all nature In Egypt the soul of Osiris entered the Apis bull or the ram of Mendes Tammuz in the hymns is called the pre eminent steer of heaven and a popular sacrifice was a white kid of the god Tammuz which however might be substituted by a sucking pig Osiris had also associations with swine and the Egyptians according to Herodotus sacrificed a pig to him annually When Set at full moon hunted the boar in the Delta marshes he probably hunted the boar form of Osiris whose human body had been recovered from the sacred tree by Isis As the soul of Bata the hero of the Egyptian folk tale one hundred nine migrated from the blossom to the bull and the bull to the tree so apparently did the soul of Osiris pass from incarnation to incarnation Set the demon slayer of the harvest god had also a boar form he was the black pig who devoured the waning moon and blinded the Eye of Ra In his character as a long lived patriarch Tammuz the King Daonus or Daos of Berosus reigned in Babylonia for thirty six thousand years When he died he departed to Hades or the Abyss Osiris after reigning over the Egyptians became Judge of the Dead Tammuz of the Sumerian hymns however is the Adonis like god who lived on earth for a part of the year as the shepherd and agriculturist so dearly beloved by the goddess Ishtar Then he died so that he might depart to the realm of Eresh ki gal Persephone queen of Hades According to one account his death was caused by the fickle Ishtar When that goddess wooed Gilgamesh the Babylonian Hercules he upbraided her saying On Tammuz the spouse of thy youth Thou didst lay affliction every year King s Translation References in the Sumerian hymns suggest that there also existed a form of the legend which gave an account of the slaying of the young god by someone else than Ishtar The slayer may have been a Set like demon perhaps Nin shach who appears to have symbolized the destroying influence of the sun He was a war deity and his name Professor Pinches says is conjectured to mean lord of the wild boar There is no direct evidence however to connect Tammuz s slayer with the boar which killed Adonis Ishtar s innocence is emphasized by the fact that she mourned for her youthful lover crying Oh hero my lord ah me I will say Food I eat not water I drink not Because of the exalted one of the nether world him of the radiant face yea radiant Of the exalted one of the nether world him of the dove like voice yea dove like one hundred ten The Phrygian Attis met his death according to one legend by self mutilation under a sacred tree Another account sets forth however that he was slain by a boar The Greek Adonis was similarly killed by a boar This animal was a form of Ares Mars god of war and tempest who also loved Aphrodite Ishtar The Celtic Diarmid in his character as a love god with lunar attributes was slain by the green boar which appears to have been one of the animals of a ferocious Hag an earth and air mother with various names In one of the many Fingalian stories the animal is That venomous boar and he so fierce That Grey Eyebrows had with her herd of swine one hundred eleven Diarmid had eloped with the wife of Finn mac Coul Fingal who like Ares plotted to bring about his rival s death and accordingly set the young hero to hunt the boar As a thunder god Finn carried a hammer with which he smote his shield the blows were heard in Lochlann Scandinavia Diarmid like Tammuz the god of the tender voice and shining eyes had much beauty When he expired Finn cried No maiden will raise her eye Since the mould has gone over thy visage fair Blue without rashness in thine eye Passion and beauty behind thy curls Oh yesternight it was green the hillock Red is it this day with Diarmid s blood one hundred twelve Tammuz died with the dying vegetation and Diarmid expired when the hills apparently were assuming their purple tints one hundred thirteen The month of Tammuz wailings was from twentieth June till twentieth July when the heat and dryness brought forth the demons of pestilence The mourners chanted He has gone he has gone to the bosom of the earth And the dead are numerous in the land Men are filled with sorrow they stagger by day in gloom In the month of thy year which brings not peace hast thou gone Thou hast gone on a journey that makes an end of thy people The following extract contains a reference to the slaying of the god The holy one of Ishtar in the middle of the year the fields languish The shepherd the wise one the man of sorrows why have they slain In his temple in his inhabited domain The child lord of knowledge abides no more In the meadows verily verily the soul of life perishes There is wailing for Tammuz at the sacred cedar where the mother bore thee a reference which connects the god like Adonis and Osiris with tree worship The wailing is for the herbs the first lament is they are not produced The wailing is for the grain ears are not produced The wailing is for the habitations for the flocks which bring forth no more The wailing is for the perishing wedded ones for the perishing children the dark headed people create no more The wailing is also for the shrunken river the parched meadows the fishpools the cane brakes the forests the plains the gardens and the palace which all suffer because the god of fertility has departed The mourner cries How long shall the springing of verdure be restrained How long shall the putting forth of leaves be held back Whither went Tammuz His destination has already been referred to as the bosom of the earth and in the Assyrian version of the Descent of Ishtar he dwells in the house of darkness among the dead where dust is their nourishment and their food mud and the light is never seen the gloomy Babylonian Hades In one of the Sumerian hymns however it is stated that Tammuz upon the flood was cast out The reference may be to the submarine house of Ea or the Blessed Island to which the Babylonian Noah was carried In this Hades bloomed the nether garden of Adonis The following extract refers to the garden of Damu Tammuz one hundred fourteen Damu his youth therein slumbers Among the garden flowers he slumbers among the garden flowers he is cast away Among the tamarisks he slumbers with woe he causes us to be satiated Although Tammuz of the hymns was slain he returned again from Hades Apparently he came back as a child He is wailed for as child Lord Gishzida as well as my hero Damu In his lunar character the Egyptian Osiris appeared each month as the child surpassingly beautiful the Osiris bull was also a child of the moon it was begotten says Plutarch by a ray of generative light falling from the moon When the bull of Attis was sacrificed his worshippers were drenched with its blood and were afterwards ceremonially fed with milk as they were supposed to have renewed their youth and become children The ancient Greek god Eros Cupid was represented as a wanton boy or handsome youth Another god of fertility the Irish Angus who resembles Eros is called the ever young he slumbers like Tammuz and awakes in the Spring Apparently it was believed that the child god Tammuz returned from the earlier Sumerian Paradise of the Deep and grew into full manhood in a comparatively brief period like Vyasa and other super men of Indian mythology A couplet from a Tammuz hymn says tersely In his infancy in a sunken boat he lay In his manhood in the submerged grain he lay one hundred fifteen The boat may be the chest in which Adonis was concealed by Aphrodite when she confided him to the care of Persephone queen of Hades who desired to retain the young god but was compelled by Zeus to send him back to the goddess of love and vegetation The fact that Ishtar descended to Hades in quest of Tammuz may perhaps explain the symbolic references in hymns to mother goddesses being in sunken boats also when their powers were in abeyance as were those of the god for part of each year It is possible too that the boat had a lunar and a solar significance Khonsu the Egyptian moon god for instance was associated with the Spring sun being a deity of fertility and therefore a corn spirit he was a form of Osiris the Patriarch who sojourned on earth to teach mankind how to grow corn and cultivate fruit trees In the Egyptian legend Osiris received the corn seeds from Isis which suggests that among Great Mother worshipping peoples it was believed that agricultural civilization had a female origin The same myths may have been attached to corn gods and corn goddesses associated with water sun moon and stars That there existed in Babylonia at an extremely remote period an agricultural myth regarding a Patriarch of divine origin who was rescued from a boat in his childhood is suggested by the legend which was attached to the memory of the usurper King Sargon of Akkad It runs as follows I am Sargon the mighty King of Akkad My mother was a vestal priestess my father an alien whose brother inhabited the mountain When my mother had conceived me she bare me in a hidden place She laid me in a vessel of rushes stopped the door thereof with pitch and cast me adrift on the river The river floated me to Akki the water drawer who in drawing water drew me forth Akki the water drawer educated me as his son and made me his gardener As a gardener I was beloved by the goddess Ishtar It is unlikely that this story was invented by Sargon Like the many variants of it found in other countries it was probably founded on a form of the Tammuz Adonis myth Indeed a new myth would not have suited Sargon s purpose so well as the adaptation of an old one which was more likely to make popular appeal when connected with his name The references to the goddess Ishtar and Sargon s early life as a gardener suggest that the king desired to be remembered as an agricultural Patriarch if not of divine at any rate of semi divine origin What appears to be an early form of the widespread Tammuz myth is the Teutonic legend regarding the mysterious child who came over the sea to inaugurate a new era of civilization and instruct the people how to grow corn and become great warriors The Northern peoples as archaeological evidence suggests derived their knowledge of agriculture and therefore their agricultural myths from the Neolithic representatives of the Mediterranean race with whom they came into contact There can be no doubt but that the Teutonic legend refers to the introduction of agriculture The child is called Scef or Sceaf which signifies Sheaf or Scyld the son of Sceaf Scyld is the patriarch of the Scyldings the Danes a people of mixed origin In the Anglo Saxon Beowulf poem the reference is to Scyld but Ethelweard William of Malmesbury and others adhered to Sceaf as the name of the Patriarch of the Western Saxons The legend runs that one day a boat was seen approaching the shore it was not propelled by oars or sail In it lay a child fast asleep his head pillowed upon a sheaf of grain He was surrounded by armour treasure and various implements including the fire borer The child was reared by the people who found him and he became a great instructor and warrior and ruled over the tribe as king In Beowulf Scyld is the father of the elder Beowulf whose grandson Hrothgar built the famous Hall The poem opens with a reference to the patriarch Scyld of the Sheaf When he died his body according to the request he had made was laid in a ship which was set adrift Upon his breast lay many treasures which were to travel with him into the power of the flood Certainly they the mourners furnished him with no less of gifts of tribal treasures than those had done who in his early days started him over the sea alone child as he was Moreover they set besides a gold embroidered standard high above his head and let the flood bear him gave him to the sea Their soul was sad their spirit sorrowful Who received that load men chiefs of council heroes under heaven cannot for certain tell one hundred sixteen Sceaf or Scyld is identical with Yngve the patriarch of the Ynglings with Frey the harvest and boar god son of Njord one hundred seventeen the sea god and with Hermod referred to as follows in the Eddic Lay of Hyndla To some grants he wealth to his children war fame Word skill to many and wisdom to men Fair winds to sea farers song craft to skalds And might of manhood to many a warrior Tammuz is similarly the heroic lord of the land the wise one the lord of knowledge and the sovereign lord of invocation Heimdal watchman of the Teutonic gods also dwelt for a time among men as Rig and had human offspring his son Thrall being the ancestor of the Thralls his son Churl of churls and Jarl of noblemen Tammuz like Heimdal is also a guardian He watches the flocks and herds whom he apparently guards against the Gallu demons as Heimdal guards the world and the heavens against attacks by giants and monsters The flocks of Tammuz Professor Pinches suggests recall the flocks of the Greek sun god Helios These were the clouds illuminated by the sun which were likened to sheep indeed one of the early Sumerian expressions for fleece was sheep of the sky The name of Tammuz in Sumerian is Dumu zi or in its rare fullest form Dumuzida meaning true or faithful son There is probably some legend attached to this which is at present unknown one hundred eighteen So the Sumerian hymn chanters lamented Like an herdsman the sentinel place of sheep and cattle he Tammuz has forsaken From his home from his inhabited domain the son he of wisdom pre eminent steer of heaven The hero unto the nether herding place has taken his way one hundred nineteen Agni the Aryo Indian god who as the sky sentinel has points of resemblance to Heimdal also links with Tammuz especially in his Mitra character Agni has been established among the tribes of men the son of the waters Mitra acting in the right way Rigveda iii five three Agni who has been looked and longed for in Heaven who has been looked for on earth he who has been looked for has entered all herbs Rigveda i ninety eight one hundred twenty Tammuz like the Egyptian lunar and solar god Khonsu is the healer and Agni drives away all disease Tammuz is the god of sonorous voice Agni roars like a bull and Heimdal blows a horn when the giants and demons threaten to attack the citadel of the gods As the spring sun god Tammuz is a youthful warrior says Jastrow triumphing over the storms of winter one hundred twenty one The storms of course were symbolized as demons Tammuz the heroic lord was therefore a demon slayer like Heimdal and Agni Each of these gods appear to have been developed in isolation from an archaic spring god of fertility and corn whose attributes were symbolized In Teutonic mythology for instance Heimdal was the warrior form of the patriarch Scef while Frey was the deified agriculturist who came over the deep as a child In Saxo s mythical history of Denmark Frey as Frode is taken prisoner by a storm giant Beli the howler and is loved by his hag sister in the Teutonic Hades as Tammuz is loved by Eresh ki gal spouse of the storm god Nergal in the Babylonian Hades Frode returns to earth like Tammuz in due season It is evident that there were various versions of the Tammuz myth in Ancient Babylonia In one the goddess Ishtar visited Hades to search for the lover of her youth A part of this form of the legend survives in the famous Assyrian hymn known as The Descent of Ishtar It was first translated by the late mister George Smith of the British Museum A box containing inscribed tablets had been sent from Assyria to London and mister Smith with characteristic patience and skill arranged and deciphered them giving to the world a fragment of ancient literature infused with much sublimity and imaginative power Ishtar is depicted descending to dismal Hades where the souls of the dead exist in bird forms I spread like a bird my hands I descend I descend to the house of darkness the dwelling of the god Irkalla To the house out of which there is no exit To the road from which there is no return To the house from whose entrance the light is taken The place where dust is their nourishment and their food mud Its chiefs also are like birds covered with feathers The light is never seen in darkness they dwell Over the door and bolts is scattered dust When the goddess reaches the gate of Hades she cries to the porter Keeper of the waters open thy gate Open thy gate that I may enter If thou openest not the gate that I may enter I will strike the door the bolts I will shatter I will strike the threshold and will pass through the doors I will raise up the dead to devour the living Above the living the dead shall exceed in numbers The porter answers that he must first consult the Queen of Hades here called Allatu to whom he accordingly announces the arrival of the Queen of Heaven Allatu s heart is filled with anger and makes reference to those whom Ishtar caused to perish Let me weep over the strong who have left their wives Let me weep over the handmaidens who have lost the embraces of their husbands Over the only son let me mourn who ere his days are come is taken away Then she issues abruptly the stern decree Go keeper open the gate to her Bewitch her according to the ancient rules that is Deal with her as you deal with others who come here As Ishtar enters through the various gates she is stripped of her ornaments and clothing At the first gate her crown was taken off at the second her ear rings at the third her necklace of precious stones at the fourth the ornaments of her breast at the fifth her gemmed waist girdle one hundred twenty two at the sixth the bracelets of her hands and feet and at the seventh the covering robe of her body Ishtar asks at each gate why she is thus dealt with and the porter answers Such is the command of Allatu After descending for a prolonged period the Queen of Heaven at length stands naked before the Queen of Hades Ishtar is proud and arrogant and Allatu desiring to punish her rival whom she cannot humble commands the plague demon Namtar to strike her with disease in all parts of her body The effect of Ishtar s fate was disastrous upon earth growth and fertility came to an end Meanwhile Pap sukal messenger of the gods hastened to Shamash the sun deity to relate what had occurred The sun god immediately consulted his lunar father Sin and Ea god of the deep Ea then created a man lion named Nadushu namir to rescue Ishtar giving him power to pass through the seven gates of Hades When this being delivered his message Allatu struck her breast she bit her thumb She turned again a request she asked not In her anger she cursed the rescuer of the Queen of Heaven May I imprison thee in the great prison May the garbage of the foundations of the city be thy food May the drains of the city be thy drink May the darkness of the dungeon be thy dwelling May the stake be thy seat May hunger and thirst strike thy offspring She was compelled however to obey the high gods and addressed Namtar saying Unto Ishtar give the waters of life and bring her before me Thereafter the Queen of Heaven was conducted through the various gates and at each she received her robe and the ornaments which were taken from her on entering Namtar says Since thou hast not paid a ransom for thy deliverance to her Allatu so to her again turn back For Tammuz the husband of thy youth The glistening waters of life pour over him In splendid clothing dress him with a ring of crystal adorn him Ishtar mourns for the wound of Tammuz smiting her breast and she did not ask for the precious eye stones her amulets which were apparently to ransom Tammuz The poem concludes with Ishtar s wail O my only brother Tammuz thou dost not lament for me In the day that Tammuz adorned me with a ring of crystal With a bracelet of emeralds together with himself he adorned me one hundred twenty three With himself he adorned me may men mourners and women mourners On a bier place him and assemble the wake one hundred twenty four A Sumerian hymn to Tammuz throws light on this narrative It sets forth that Ishtar descended to Hades to entreat him to be glad and to resume care of his flocks but Tammuz refused or was unable to return His spouse unto her abode he sent back She then instituted the wailing ceremony The amorous Queen of Heaven sits as one in darkness one hundred twenty five mister Langdon also translates a hymn Tammuz III which appears to contain the narrative on which the Assyrian version was founded The goddess who descends to Hades however is not Ishtar but the sister Belit sheri She is accompanied by various demons the gallu demon the slayer c and holds a conversation with Tammuz which however is unintelligible and badly broken Apparently however he promises to return to earth I will go up as for me I will depart with thee I will return unto my mother let us go back Probably two goddesses originally lamented for Tammuz as the Egyptian sisters Isis and Nepthys lamented for Osiris their brother Ishtar is referred to as my mother Isis figures alternately in the Egyptian chants as mother wife sister and daughter of Osiris She cries Come thou to thy wife in peace her heart fluttereth for thy love I am thy wife made as thou art the elder sister soul of her brother Come thou to us as a babe Lo thou art as the Bull of the two goddesses come thou child growing in peace our lord Lo the Bull begotten of the two cows Isis and Nepthys Come thou to the two widowed goddesses Oh child lord first maker of the body Father Osiris one hundred twenty six As Ishtar and Belit sheri weep for Tammuz so do Isis and Nepthys weep for Osiris Calling upon thee with weeping yet thou art prostrate upon thy bed Gods and men are weeping for thee at the same time when they behold me Isis Lo I invoke thee with wailing that reacheth high as heaven Isis is also identified with Hathor Ishtar the Cow The cow weepeth for thee with her voice one hundred twenty seven There is another phase however to the character of the mother goddess which explains the references to the desertion and slaying of Tammuz by Ishtar She is says Jastrow the goddess of the human instinct or passion which accompanies human love Gilgamesh reproaches her with abandoning the objects of her passion after a brief period of union At Ishtar s temple public maidens accepted temporary partners assigned to them by Ishtar one hundred twenty eight The worship of all mother goddesses in ancient times was accompanied by revolting unmoral rites which are referred to in condemnatory terms in various passages in the Old Testament especially in connection with the worship of Ashtoreth who was identical with Ishtar and the Egyptian Hathor Ishtar in the process of time overshadowed all the other female deities of Babylonia as did Isis in Egypt Her name indeed which is Semitic became in the plural Ishtarate a designation for goddesses in general But although she was referred to as the daughter of the sky Anu or the daughter of the moon Sin or Nannar she still retained traces of her ancient character Originally she was a great mother goddess who was worshipped by those who believed that life and the universe had a female origin in contrast to those who believed in the theory of male origin Ishtar is identical with Nina the fish goddess a creature who gave her name to the Sumerian city of Nina and the Assyrian city of Nineveh Other forms of the Creatrix included Mama or Mami or Ama mother Aruru Bau Gula and Zerpanitu m These were all Preservers and healers At the same time they were Destroyers like Nin sun and the Queen of Hades Eresh ki gal or Allatu They were accompanied by shadowy male forms ere they became wives of strongly individualized gods or by child gods their sons who might be regarded as brothers or husbands of their mothers to use the paradoxical Egyptian term Similarly Great Father deities had vaguely defined wives The Semitic Baal the lord was accompanied by a female reflection of himself Beltu the lady Shamash the sun god had for wife the shadowy Aa As has been shown Ishtar is referred to in a Tammuz hymn as the mother of the child god of fertility In an Egyptian hymn the sky goddess Nut the mother of Osiris is stated to have built up life from her own body one hundred twenty nine Sri or Lakshmi the Indian goddess who became the wife of Vishnu as the mother goddess Saraswati a tribal deity became the wife of Brahma was according to a Purana commentator the mother of the world eternal and undecaying one hundred thirty The gods on the other hand might die annually the goddesses alone were immortal Indra was supposed to perish of old age but his wife Indrani remained ever young There were fourteen Indras in every day of Brahma a reference apparently to the ancient conception of Indra among the Great Mother worshipping sections of the Aryo Indians one hundred thirty one In the Mahabharata the god Shiva as Mahadeva commands Indra on one of the peaks of Himavat where they met to lift up a stone and join the Indras who had been before him And Indra on removing that stone beheld a cave on the breast of that king of mountains in which were four others resembling himself Indra exclaimed in his grief Shall I be even like these These five Indras like the Seven Sleepers awaited the time when they would be called forth They were ultimately reborn as the five Pandava warriors one hundred thirty two The ferocious black faced Scottish mother goddess Cailleach Bheur who appears to be identical with Mala Lith Grey Eyebrows of Fingalian story and the English Black Annis figures in Irish song and legend as The Old Woman of Beare This old woman Cailleach had says Professor Kuno Meyer seven periods of youth one after another so that every man who had lived with her came to die of old age and her grandsons and great grandsons were tribes and races When old age at length came upon her she sang her swan song from which the following lines are extracted Ebb tide to me as of the sea Old age causes me reproach It is riches Ye love it is not men In the time when we lived It was men we loved My arms when they are seen Are bony and thin Once they would fondle They would be round glorious kings I must take my garment even in the sun The time is at hand that shall renew me one hundred thirty three Freyja the Germanic mother goddess whose car was drawn by cats had similarly many lovers In the Icelandic poem Lokasenna Loki taunts her saying Silence Freyja Full well I know thee And faultless art thou not found Of the gods and elves who here are gathered Each one hast thou made thy mate Idun the keeper of the apples of immortal youth which prevent the gods growing old is similarly addressed Silence Idun I swear of all women Thou the most wanton art Who couldst fling those fair washed arms of thine About thy brother s slayer Frigg wife of Odin is satirized as well Silence Frigg Earth s spouse for a husband And hast ever yearned after men one hundred thirty four The goddesses of classic mythology had similar reputations Aphrodite Venus had many divine and mortal lovers She links closely with Astarte and Ashtoreth Ishtar and reference has already been made to her relations with Adonis Tammuz These love deities were all as cruel as they were wayward When Ishtar wooed the Babylonian hero Gilgamesh he spurned her advances as has been indicated saying On Tammuz the spouse of thy youth Thou didst lay affliction every year Thou didst love the brilliant Allalu bird But thou didst smite him and break his wing He stands in the woods and cries O my wing He likewise charged her with deceiving the lion and the horse making reference to obscure myths Thou didst also love a shepherd of the flock Who continually poured out for thee the libation And daily slaughtered kids for thee But thou didst smite him and didst change him into a leopard So that his own sheep boy hunted him And his own hounds tore him to pieces one hundred thirty five These goddesses were ever prone to afflict human beings who might offend them or of whom they wearied Demeter Ceres changed Ascalaphus into an owl and Stellio into a lizard Rhea Ops resembled The tow red Cybele Mother of a hundred gods the wanton who loved Attis Adonis Artemis Diana slew her lover Orion changed Actaeon into a stag which was torn to pieces by his own dogs and caused numerous deaths by sending a boar to ravage the fields of Oeneus king of Calydon Human sacrifices were frequently offered to the bloodthirsty mothers The most famous victim of Artemis was the daughter of Agamemnon divinely tall and most divinely fair one hundred thirty six Agamemnon had slain a sacred stag and the goddess punished him by sending a calm when the war fleet was about to sail for Troy with the result that his daughter had to be sacrificed Artemis thus sold breezes like the northern wind hags and witches It used to be customary to account for the similarities manifested by the various mother goddesses by assuming that there was constant cultural contact between separate nationalities and as a result a not inconsiderable amount of religious borrowing Greece was supposed to have received its great goddesses from the western Semites who had come under the spell of Babylonian religion Archaeological evidence however tends to disprove this theory The most recent researches into Mesopotamian history writes doctor Farnell establish with certainty the conclusion that there was no direct political contact possible between the powers in the valley of the Euphrates and the western shores of the Aegean in the second millennium B C In fact between the nascent Hellas and the great world of Mesopotamia there were powerful and possibly independent strata of cultures interposing one hundred thirty seven The real connection appears to be the racial one Among the Mediterranean Neolithic tribes of Sumeria Arabia and Europe the goddess cult appears to have been influential Mother worship was the predominant characteristic of their religious systems so that the Greek goddesses were probably of pre Hellenic origin the Celtic of Iberian the Egyptian of proto Egyptian and the Babylonian of Sumerian The northern hillmen on the other hand who may be identified with the Aryans of the philologists were father worshippers The Vedic Aryo Indians worshipped father gods one hundred thirty eight as did also the Germanic peoples and certain tribes in the Hittite confederacy Earth spirits were males like the Teutonic elves the Aryo Indian Ribhus and the Burkans masters of the present day Buriats a Mongolian people When the father worshipping peoples invaded the dominions of the mother worshipping peoples they introduced their strongly individualized gods but they did not displace the mother goddesses The Aryan Hellenes says doctor Farnell were able to plant their Zeus and Poseidon on the high hill of Athens but not to overthrow the supremacy of Athena in the central shrine and in the aboriginal soul of the Athenian people one hundred thirty nine As in Egypt the beliefs of the father worshippers represented by the self created Ptah were fused with the beliefs of the mother worshippers who adored Isis Mut Neith and others In Babylonia this process of racial and religious fusion was well advanced before the dawn of history Ea who had already assumed manifold forms may have originally been the son or child lover of Damkina Lady of the Deep as was Tammuz of Ishtar As the fish Ea was the offspring of the mother river The mother worshippers recognized male as well as female deities but regarded the great goddess as the First Cause Although the primeval spirits were grouped in four pairs in Egypt and apparently in Babylonia also the female in the first pair was more strongly individualized than the male The Egyptian Nu is vaguer than his consort Nut and the Babylonian Apsu than his consort Tiamat Indeed in the narrative of the Creation Tablets of Babylon which will receive full treatment in a later chapter Tiamat the great mother is the controlling spirit She is more powerful and ferocious than Apsu and lives longer After Apsu s death she elevates one of her brood named Kingu to be her consort a fact which suggests that in the Ishtar Tammuz myth survives the influence of exceedingly ancient modes of thought Like Tiamat Ishtar is also a great battle heroine and in this capacity she was addressed as the lady of majestic rank exalted over all gods This was no idle flattery on the part of worshippers but a memory of her ancient supremacy Reference has been made to the introduction of Tammuz worship into Jerusalem Ishtar as Queen of Heaven was also adored by the backsliding Israelites as a deity of battle and harvest When Jeremiah censured the people for burning incense and serving gods whom they knew not he said neither they ye nor your fathers they made answer Since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her we have wanted all things and have been consumed by the sword and the famine The women took a leading part in these practices but refused to accept all the blame saying When we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings unto her did we make our cakes and pour out drink offerings unto her without our men one hundred forty That the husbands and the children even assisted at the ceremony is made evident in another reference to goddess worship The children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead the dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven one hundred forty one Jastrow suggests that the women of Israel wept for Tammuz offered cakes to the mother goddess c because in all religious bodies women represent the conservative element among them religious customs continue in practice after they have been abandoned by men one hundred forty two The evidence of Jeremiah however shows that the men certainly company operated at the archaic ceremonials In lighting the fires with the vital spark they apparently acted in imitation of the god of fertility The women on the other hand represented the reproductive harvest goddess in providing the food supply In recognition of her gift they rewarded the goddess by offering her the cakes prepared from the newly ground wheat and barley the first fruits of the harvest As the corn god came as a child the children began the ceremony by gathering the wood for the sacred fire When the women mourned for Tammuz they did so evidently because the death of the god was lamented by the goddess Ishtar It would appear therefore that the suggestion regarding the conservative element should really apply to the immemorial practices of folk religion These differed from the refined ceremonies of the official cult in Babylonia where there were suitable temples and organized bands of priests and priestesses But the official cult received no recognition in Palestine the cakes intended for a goddess were not offered up in the temple of Abraham s God but in the streets of Jerusalem and those of other cities one hundred forty three The obvious deduction seems to be that in ancient times women everywhere played a prominent part in the ceremonial folk worship of the Great Mother goddess while the men took the lesser part of the god whom she had brought into being and afterwards received as husband of his mother This may account for the high social status of women among goddess worshippers like the representatives of the Mediterranean race whose early religion was not confined to temples but closely associated with the acts of everyday life CHAPTER VI WARS OF THE CITY STATES OF SUMER AND AKKAD Civilization well advanced The Patesi Prominent City States Surroundings of Babylonia The Elamites Biblical References to Susa The Sumerian Temperament Fragmentary Records City States of Kish and Opis A Shopkeeper who became a Queen Goddess Worship Tammuz as Nin Girsu Great Dynasty of Lagash Ur Nina and his Descendants A Napoleonic Conqueror Golden Age of Sumerian Art The First Reformer in History His Rise and Fall The Dynasty of Erech Sargon of Akkad The Royal Gardener Sargon Myth in India A Great Empire The King who Purchased Land Naram Sin the Conqueror Disastrous Foreign Raid Lagash again Prominent Gudea the Temple Builder Dynasty of Ur Dynasty of Isin Another Gardener becomes King Rise of Babylon Humanized Deities Why Sumerian Gods wore Beards When the curtain rises to reveal the drama of Babylonian civilization we find that we have missed the first act and its many fascinating scenes Sumerians and Akkadians come and go but it is not always possible to distinguish between them Although most Semites are recognizable by their flowing beards prominent noses and long robes some have so closely imitated the Sumerians as to suffer almost complete loss of identity It is noticeable that in the north the Akkadians are more Semitic than their contemporaries in the south but it is difficult at times to say whether a city is controlled by the descendants of the indigenous people or those of later settlers Dynasties rise and fall and as in Egypt at times the progress of the fragmentary narrative is interrupted by a sudden change of scene ere we have properly grasped a situation and realized its significance What we know for certain is that civilization is well advanced Both in the north and the south there are many organized and independent city states and not unfrequently these wage war one against another Occasionally ambitious rulers tower among their fellows conduct vigorous military campaigns and become overlords of wide districts As a rule a subjugated monarch who has perforce to acknowledge the suzerainty of a powerful king is allowed to remain in a state of semi independence on condition that he pays a heavy annual tribute of grain His own laws continue in force and the city deities remain supreme although recognition may also be given to the deities of his conqueror He styles himself a Patesi a priest king or more literally servant of the chief deity But as an independent monarch may also be a pious Patesi it does not always follow when a ruler is referred to by that title he is necessarily less powerful than his neighbours When the historical narrative begins Akkad included the cities of Babylon Cutha Kish Akkad and Sippar and north of Babylonia proper is Semitic Opis Among the cities of Sumer were Eridu Ur Lagash Larsa Erech Shuruppak and probably Nippur which was situated on the border On the north Assyria was yet in the making and shrouded in obscurity A vague but vast area above Hit on the Euphrates and extending to the Syrian coast was known as the land of the Amorites The fish shaped Babylonian valley lying between the rivers where walled towns were surrounded by green fields and numerous canals flashed in the sunshine was bounded on the west by the bleak wastes of the Arabian desert where during the dry season the rocks branded the body and occasional sandstorms swept in blinding folds towards the plain of Shinar Sumer like demon hosts who sought to destroy the world To the east the skyline was fretted by the Persian Highlands and amidst the southern mountains dwelt the fierce Elamites the hereditary enemies of the Sumerians although a people apparently of the same origin Like the Nubians and the Libyans who kept watchful eyes on Egypt the Elamites seemed ever to be hovering on the eastern frontier of Sumeria longing for an opportunity to raid and plunder The capital of the Elamites was the city of Susa where excavations have revealed traces of an independent civilization which reaches back to an early period in the Late Stone Age Susa is referred to in the Old Testament The words of Nehemiah I was in Shushan the palace one hundred forty four An Assyrian plan of the city shows it occupying a strategic position at a bend of the Shawur river which afforded protection against Sumerian attacks from the west while a canal curved round its northern and eastern sides so that Susa was completely surrounded by water Fortifications had been erected on the river and canal banks and between these and the high city walls were thick clumps of trees That the kings of Elam imitated the splendours of Babylonian courts in the later days of Esther and Haman and Mordecai is made evident by the Biblical references to the gorgeous palace which had white green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble one hundred forty five Beyond Elam were the plains plateaus and grassy steppes occupied by the Medes and other peoples of Aryan speech Cultural influences came and went like spring winds between the various ancient communities For ten long centuries Sumer and Akkad flourished and prospered ere we meet with the great Hammurabi whose name has now become almost as familiar as that of Julius Caesar But our knowledge of the leading historical events of this vast period is exceedingly fragmentary The Sumerians were not like the later Assyrians or their Egyptian contemporaries a people with a passion for history When inscriptions were composed and cut on stone or impressed upon clay tablets and bricks the kings selected as a general rule to record pious deeds rather than to celebrate their victories and conquests Indeed the average monarch had a temperament resembling that of Keats who declared The silver flow Of Hero s tears the swoon of Imogen Fair Pastorella in the bandits den Are things to brood on with more ardency Than the death day of empires The Sumerian king was emotionally religious as the great English poet was emotionally poetical The tears of Ishtar for Tammuz and the afflictions endured by the goddess imprisoned in Hades to which she had descended for love of her slain husband seemed to have concerned the royal recorder to a greater degree than the memories of political upheavals and the social changes which passed over the land like the seasons which alternately brought greenness and gold barrenness and flood City chronicles as a rule are but indices of obscure events to which meagre references were sometimes also made on mace heads vases tablets stelae and sculptured monoliths Consequently present day excavators and students have often reason to be grateful that the habit likewise obtained of inscribing on bricks in buildings and the stone sockets of doors the names of kings and others These records render obscure periods faintly articulate and are indispensable for comparative purposes Historical clues are also obtained from lists of year names Each city king named a year in celebration of a great event his own succession to the throne the erection of a new temple or of a city wall or mayhap the defeat of an invading army from a rival state Sometimes too a monarch gave the name of his father in an official inscription or happily mentioned several ancestors Another may be found to have made an illuminating statement regarding a predecessor who centuries previously erected the particular temple that he himself has piously restored A reckoning of this kind however cannot always be regarded as absolutely correct It must be compared with and tested by other records for in these ancient days calculations were not unfrequently based on doubtful inscriptions or mere oral traditions perhaps Nor can implicit trust be placed on every reference to historical events for the memoried deeds of great rulers were not always unassociated with persistent and cumulative myths It must be recognized therefore that even portions of the data which had of late been sifted and systematized by Oriental scholars in Europe may yet have to be subjected to revision Many interesting and important discoveries which will throw fresh light on this fascinating early period remain to be made in that ancient and deserted land which still lies under the curse of the Hebrew prophet who exclaimed Babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the Chaldees excellency shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah It shall never be inhabited neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there neither shall the shepherds make their fold there But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and owls shall dwell there and satyrs shall dance there And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces one hundred forty six The curtain rises as has been indicated after civilization had been well advanced To begin with our interests abide with Akkad and during a period dated approximately between three thousand B C and twenty eight hundred B C when Egypt was already a united kingdom and the Cretans were at the dawn of the first early Minoan period and beginning to use bronze In Kish Sumerian and Akkadian elements had apparently blended and the city was the centre of a powerful and independent government After years have fluttered past dimly and with them the shadow shapes of vigorous rulers it is found that Kish came under the sway of the pronouncedly Semitic city of Opis which was situated farthest north and on the western bank of the river Tigris A century elapsed ere Kish again threw off the oppressor s yoke and renewed the strength of its youth The city of Kish was one of the many ancient centres of goddess worship The Great Mother appears to have been the Sumerian Bau whose chief seat was at Lagash If tradition is to be relied upon Kish owed its existence to that notable lady Queen Azag Bau Although floating legends gathered round her memory as they have often gathered round the memories of famous men like Sargon of Akkad Alexander the Great and Theodoric the Goth who became Emperor of Rome it is probable that the queen was a prominent historical personage She was reputed to have been of humble origin and to have first achieved popularity and influence as the keeper of a wine shop Although no reference survives to indicate that she was believed to be of miraculous birth the Chronicle of Kish gravely credits her with a prolonged and apparently prosperous reign of a hundred years Her son who succeeded her sat on the throne for a quarter of a century These calculations are certainly remarkable If the Queen Azag Bau founded Kish when she was only twenty and gave birth to the future ruler in her fiftieth year he must have been an elderly gentleman of seventy when he began to reign When it is found further that the dynasty in which mother and son flourished was supposed to have lasted for five hundred eighty six years divided between eight rulers one of whom reigned for only three years two for six and two for eleven it becomes evident that the historian of Kish cannot be absolutely relied upon in detail It seems evident that the memory of this lady of forceful character who flourished about thirteen hundred years before the rise of Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt has overshadowed the doubtful annals of ancient Kish at a period when Sumerian and Semite were striving in the various states to achieve political ascendancy Meanwhile the purely Sumerian city of Lagash had similarly grown powerful and aggressive For a time it acknowledged the suzerainty of Kish but ultimately it threw off the oppressor s yoke and asserted its independence The cumulative efforts of a succession of energetic rulers elevated Lagash to the position of a metropolis in Ancient Babylonia The goddess Bau the mother of Lagash was worshipped in conjunction with other deities including the god Nin Girsu an agricultural deity and therefore a deity of war who had solar attributes One of the titles of Nin Girsu was En Mersi which according to Assyrian evidence was another name of Tammuz the spring god who slew the storm and winter demons and made the land fertile so that man might have food Nin Girsu was it would seem a developed form of Tammuz like the Scandinavian Frey god of harvest or Heimdal the celestial warrior Bau was one of the several goddesses whose attributes were absorbed by the Semitic Ishtar She was a Great Mother a creatrix the source of all human and bestial life and of course a harvest goddess She was identified with Gula the great one who cured diseases and prolonged life Evidently the religion of Lagash was based on the popular worship of the Queen of Heaven and her son the dying god who became husband of his mother The first great and outstanding ruler of Lagash was Ur Nina who appears to have owed his power to the successful military operations of his predecessors It is uncertain whether or not he himself engaged in any great war His records are silent in that connection but judging from what we know of him it may be taken for granted that he was able and fully prepared to give a good account of himself in battle He certainly took steps to make secure his position for he caused a strong wall to be erected round Lagash His inscriptions are eloquent of his piety which took practical shape for he repaired and built temples dedicated offerings to deities and increased the wealth of religious bodies and the prosperity of the State by cutting canals and developing agriculture In addition to serving local deities he also gave practical recognition to Ea at Eridu and Enlil at Nippur He however overlooked Anu at Erech a fact which suggests that he held sway over Eridu and Nippur but had to recognize Erech as an independent city state Among the deities of Lagash Ur Nina favoured most the goddess Nina whose name he bore As she was a water deity and perhaps identical with Belit sheri sister of Tammuz of the Abyss and daughter of Ea one of the canals was dedicated to her She was also honoured with a new temple in which was probably placed her great statue constructed by special order of her royal worshipper Like the Egyptian goddess the Mother of Mendes Nina received offerings of fish not only as a patroness of fishermen but also as a corn spirit and a goddess of maternity She was in time identified with Ishtar A famous limestone plaque which is preserved in the Louvre Paris depicts on its upper half the pious King Ur Nina engaged in the ceremony of laying the foundations of a temple dedicated either to the goddess Nina or to the god Nin Girsu His face and scalp are clean shaven and he has a prominent nose and firm mouth eloquent of decision The folds of neck and jaw suggest Bismarckian traits He is bare to the waist and wears a pleated kilt with three flounces which reaches almost to his ankles On his long head he has poised deftly a woven basket containing the clay with which he is to make the first brick In front of him stand five figures The foremost is honoured by being sculptured larger than the others except the prominent monarch Apparently this is a royal princess for her head is unshaven and her shoulder dress or long hair drops over one of her arms Her name is Lida and the conspicuous part she took in the ceremony suggests that she was the representative of the goddess Nina She is accompanied by her brothers and at least one official Anita the cup bearer or high priest The concluding part of this ceremony or another ceremonial act is illustrated on the lower part of the plaque Ur Nina is seated on his throne not as would seem at first sight raising the wine cup to his lips and toasting to the success of the work but pouring out a libation upon the ground The princess is not present the place of honour next to the king is taken by the crown prince Possibly in this case it is the god Nin Girsu who is being honoured Three male figures perhaps royal sons accompany the prominent crown prince The cup bearer is in attendance behind the throne The inscription on this plaque which is pierced in the centre so as to be nailed to a sacred shrine refers to the temples erected by Ur Nina including those of Nina and Nin Girsu After Ur Nina s prosperous reign came to a close his son Akurgal ascended the throne He had trouble with Umma a powerful city which lay to the north west of Lagash between the Shatt el Kai and Shatt el Hai canals An army of raiders invaded his territory and had to be driven back The next king whose name was Eannatum had Napoleonic characteristics He was a military genius with great ambitions and was successful in establishing by conquest a small but brilliant empire Like his grandfather he strengthened the fortifications of Lagash then he engaged in a series of successful campaigns Umma had been causing anxiety in Lagash but Eannatum stormed and captured that rival city appropriated one of its fertile plains and imposed an annual tribute to be paid in kind An army of Elamites swept down from the hills but Ur Nina s grandson inflicted upon these bold foreigners a crushing defeat and pursued them over the frontier Several cities were afterwards forced to come under the sway of triumphant Lagash including Erech and Ur and as his suzerainty was already acknowledged at Eridu Eannatum s power in Sumeria became as supreme as it was firmly established Evidently Zuzu king of the northern city of Opis considered that the occasion was opportune to overcome the powerful Sumerian conqueror and at the same time establish Semitic rule over the subdued and war wasted cities He marched south with a large army but the tireless and ever watchful Eannatum hastened to the fray scattered the forces of Opis and captured the foolhardy Zuzu Eannatum s activities however were not confined to battlefields At Lagash he carried out great improvements in the interests of agriculture he constructed a large reservoir and developed the canal system He also extended and repaired existing temples in his native city and at Erech Being a patron of the arts he encouraged sculpture work and the finest Sumerian examples belong to his reign Eannatum was succeeded by his brother Enannatum I Apparently the new monarch did not share the military qualities of his royal predecessor for there were signs of unrest in the loose confederacy of states Indeed Umma revolted From that city an army marched forth and took forcible possession of the plain which Eannatum had appropriated removing and breaking the landmarks and otherwise challenging the supremacy of the sovran state A Lagash force defeated the men of Umma but appears to have done little more than hold in check their aggressive tendencies No sooner had Entemena the next king ascended the throne than the flame of revolt burst forth again The Patesi of Umma was evidently determined to free once and for all his native state from the yoke of Lagash But he had gravely miscalculated the strength of the vigorous young ruler Entemena inflicted upon the rebels a crushing defeat and following up his success entered the walled city and captured and slew the patesi Then he took steps to stamp out the embers of revolt in Umma by appointing as its governor one of his own officials named Ili who was duly installed with great ceremony Other military successes followed including the sacking of Opis and Kish which assured the supremacy of Lagash for many years Entemena with characteristic vigour engaged himself during periods of peace in strengthening his city fortifications and in continuing the work of improving and developing the irrigation system He lived in the golden age of Sumerian art and to his reign belongs the exquisite silver vase of Lagash which was taken from the Tello mound and is now in the Louvre This votive offering was placed by the king in the temple of Nin Girsu It is exquisitely shaped and has a base of copper The symbolic decorations include the lion headed eagle which was probably a form of the spring god of war and fertility the lion beloved by the Mother goddess and deer and ibexes which recall the mountain herds of Astarte In the dedicatory inscription the king is referred to as a patesi and the fact that the name of the high priest Dudu is given may be taken as an indication of the growing power of an aggressive priesthood After a brilliant reign of twenty nine years the king died and was succeeded by his son Enannatum II who was the last ruler of Ur Nina s line An obscure period ensued Apparently there had been a city revolt which may have given the enemies of Lagash the desired opportunity to gather strength for the coming conflict There is a reference to an Elamite raid which although repulsed may be regarded as proof of disturbed political conditions One or two priests sat on the throne of Lagash in brief succession and then arose to power the famous Urukagina the first reformer in history He began to rule as patesi but afterwards styled himself king What appears certain is that he was the leader of a great social upheaval which received the support of a section of the priesthood for he recorded that his elevation was due to the intercession of the god Nin Girsu Other deities who were sons and daughters of Nin Girsu and Nina had been given recognition by his predecessors and it is possible that the orthodox section of Lagash and especially the agricultural classes supported the new ruler in sweeping away innovations to which they were hostile Like Khufu and his descendants the Pyramid kings of Egypt s fourth dynasty the vigorous and efficient monarchs of the Ur Nina dynasty of Lagash were apparently remembered and execrated as tyrants and oppressors of the people To maintain many endowed temples and a standing army the traders and agriculturists had been heavily taxed Each successive monarch who undertook public works on a large scale for the purpose of extending and developing the area under cultivation appears to have done so mainly to increase the revenue of the exchequer so as to conserve the strength of the city and secure its pre eminence as a metropolis A leisured class had come into existence with the result that culture was fostered and civilization advanced Lagash seems to have been intensely modern in character prior to twenty eight hundred B C but with the passing of the old order of things there arose grave social problems which never appear to have been seriously dealt with All indications of social unrest were it would appear severely repressed by the iron gloved monarchs of Ur Nina s dynasty The people as a whole groaned under an ever increasing burden of taxation Sumeria was overrun by an army of officials who were notoriously corrupt they do not appear to have been held in check as in Egypt by royal auditors In the domain of Nin Girsu one of Urukagina s tablets sets forth there were tax gatherers down to the sea They not only attended to the needs of the exchequer but enriched themselves by sheer robbery while the priests followed their example by doubling their fees and appropriating temple offerings to their own use The splendid organization of Lagash was crippled by the dishonesty of those who should have been its main support Reforms were necessary and perhaps overdue but unfortunately for Lagash Urukagina s zeal for the people s cause amounted to fanaticism Instead of gradually readjusting the machinery of government so as to secure equality of treatment without impairing its efficiency as a defensive force in these perilous times he inaugurated sweeping and revolutionary social changes of far reaching character regardless of consequences Taxes and temple fees were cut down and the number of officials reduced to a minimum Society was thoroughly disorganized The army which was recruited mainly from the leisured and official classes went practically out of existence so that traders and agriculturists obtained relief from taxation at the expense of their material security Urukagina s motives were undoubtedly above reproach and he showed an example to all who occupied positions of trust by living an upright life and denying himself luxuries He was disinterestedly pious and built and restored temples and acted as the steward of his god with desire to promote the welfare and comfort of all true worshippers His laws were similar to those which over two centuries afterwards were codified by Hammurabi and like that monarch he was professedly the guardian of the weak and the helper of the needy he sought to establish justice and liberty in the kingdom But his social Arcadia vanished like a dream because he failed to recognize that Right must be supported by Might In bringing about his sudden social revolution Urukagina had at the same time unwittingly let loose the forces of disorder Discontented and unemployed officials and many representatives of the despoiled leisured and military classes of Lagash no doubt sought refuge elsewhere and fostered the spirit of revolt which ever smouldered in subject states At any rate Umma remembering the oppressions of other days was not slow to recognize that the iron hand of Lagash had become unnerved The zealous and iconoclastic reformer had reigned but seven years when he was called upon to defend his people against the invader He appears to have been utterly unprepared to do so The victorious forces of Umma swept against the stately city of Lagash and shattered its power in a single day Echoes of the great disaster which ensued rise from a pious tablet inscription left by a priest who was convinced that the conquerors would be called to account for the sins they had committed against the great god Nin Girsu He lamented the butchery and robbery which had taken place We gather from his composition that blood was shed by the raiders of Umma even in the sacred precincts of temples that statues were shattered that silver and precious stones were carried away that granaries were plundered and standing crops destroyed and that many buildings were set on fire Amidst these horrors of savagery and vengeance the now tragic figure of the great reformer suddenly vanishes from before our eyes Perhaps he perished in a burning temple perhaps he found a nameless grave with the thousands of his subjects whose bodies had lain scattered about the blood stained streets With Urukagina the glory of Lagash departed Although the city was rebuilt in time and was even made more stately than before it never again became the metropolis of Sumeria The vengeful destroyer of Lagash was Lugal zaggisi Patesi of Umma a masterful figure in early Sumerian history We gather from the tablet of the unknown scribe who regarded him as a sinner against the god Nin Girsu that his city goddess was named Nidaba He appears also to have been a worshipper of Enlil of Nippur to whose influence he credited his military successes But Enlil was not his highest god he was the interceder who carried the prayers of Lugal zaggisi to the beloved father Anu god of the sky No doubt Nin Girsu represented a school of theology which was associated with unpleasant memories in Umma The sacking and burning of the temples of Lagash suggests as much Having broken the power of Lagash Lugal zaggisi directed his attention to the rival city of Kish where Semitic influence was predominating When Nanizak the last monarch of the line of the famous Queen Azag Bau had sat upon the throne for but three years he perished by the sword of the Umma conqueror Nippur likewise came under his sway and he also subdued the southern cities Lugal zaggisi chose for his capital ancient Erech the city of Anu and of his daughter the goddess Nana who afterwards was identified with Ishtar Anu s spouse was Anatu and the pair subsequently became abstract deities like Anshar and Kishar their parents who figure in the Babylonian Creation story Nana was worshipped as the goddess of vegetation and her relation to Anu was similar to that of Belit sheri to Ea at Eridu Anu and Ea were originally identical but it would appear that the one was differentiated as the god of the waters above the heaven and the other as god of the waters beneath the earth both being forms of Anshar Elsewhere the chief god of the spring sun or the moon the lover of the goddess became pre eminent displacing the elder god like Nin Girsu at Lagash At Sippar the sun god Babbar whose Semitic name was Shamash was exalted as the chief deity while the moon god remained supreme at Ur This specializing process which was due to local theorizing and the influence of alien settlers has been dealt with in a previous chapter In referring to himself as the favoured ruler of various city deities Lugal zaggisi appears as a ruler of all Sumeria How far his empire extended it is impossible to determine with certainty He appears to have overrun Akkad and even penetrated to the Syrian coast for in one inscription it is stated that he made straight his path from the Lower Sea the Persian Gulf over the Euphrates and Tigris to the Upper Sea the Mediterranean The allegiance of certain states however depended on the strength of the central power One of his successors found it necessary to attack Kish which was ever waiting for an opportunity to regain its independence According to the Chronicle of Kish the next ruler of Sumer and Akkad after Lugal zaggisi was the famous Sargon I It would appear that he was an adventurer or usurper and that he owed his throne indirectly to Lugal zaggisi who had dethroned the ruler of Akkad Later traditions which have been partly confirmed by contemporary inscriptions agree that Sargon was of humble birth In the previous chapter reference was made to the Tammuz like myth attached to his memory His mother was a vestal virgin dedicated to the sun god Shamash and his father an unknown stranger from the mountains a suggestion of immediate Semitic affinities Perhaps Sargon owed his rise to power to the assistance received by bands of settlers from the land of the Amorites which Lugal zaggisi had invaded According to the legend Sargon s birth was concealed He was placed in a vessel which was committed to the river Brought up by a commoner he lived in obscurity until the Semitic goddess Ishtar gave him her aid A similar myth was attached in India to the memory of Karna the Hector of that great Sanskrit epic the Mahabharata Kama s mother the Princess Pritha who afterwards became a queen was loved by the sun god Surya When in secret she gave birth to her son she placed him in an ark of wickerwork which was set adrift on a stream Ultimately it reached the Ganges and it was borne by that river to the country of Anga where the child was rescued by a woman and afterwards reared by her and her husband a charioteer In time Karna became a great warrior and was crowned King of Anga by the Kaurava warriors one hundred forty seven Before he became king Sargon of Akkad the Sharrukin of the texts was according to tradition a gardener and watchman attached to the temple of the war god Zamama of Kish This deity was subsequently identified with Merodach son of Ea Ninip son of Enlil and Nin Girsu of Lagash He was therefore one of the many developed forms of Tammuz a solar corn and military deity and an interceder for mankind The goddess of Kish appears to have been a form of Bau as is testified by the name of Queen Azag Bau the legendary founder of the city Unfortunately our knowledge of Sargon s reign is of meagre character It is undoubted that he was a distinguished general and able ruler He built up an empire which included Sumer and Akkad and also Amurru the western land or land of the Amorites The Elamites gave him an opportunity to extend his conquests eastward They appear to have attacked Opis but he drove them back and on more than one occasion penetrated their country over the western part of which known as Anshan he ultimately imposed his rule Thither went many Semitic settlers who had absorbed the culture of Sumeria During Sargon s reign Akkad attained to a splendour which surpassed that of Babylon In an omen text the monarch is lauded as the highly exalted one without a peer Tradition relates that when he was an old man all the Babylonian states rose in revolt against him and besieged Akkad But the old warrior led forth his army against the combined forces and achieved a shattering victory Manishtusu who succeeded Sargon I had similarly to subdue a great confederacy of thirty two city states and must therefore have been a distinguished general But he is best known as the monarch who purchased several large estates adjoining subject cities his aim having been probably to settle on these Semitic allies who would be less liable to rebel against him than the workers they displaced For the latter however he found employment elsewhere These transactions which were recorded on a monument subsequently carried off with other spoils by the Elamites and discovered at Susa show that at this early period about twenty six hundred B C even a conquering monarch considered it advisable to observe existing land laws Urumush one hundred forty eight the next ruler also achieved successes in Elam and elsewhere but his life was cut short by a palace revolution The prominent figure of Naram Sin a later king of Akkad bulks largely in history and tradition According to the Chronicle of Kish he was a son of Sargon Whether he was or not it is certain that he inherited the military and administrative genius of that famous ex gardener The arts flourished during his reign One of the memorable products of the period was an exquisitely sculptured monument celebrating one of Naram Sin s victories which was discovered at Susa It is one of the most wonderful examples of Babylonian stone work which has come to light A successful campaign had been waged against a mountain people The stele shows the warrior king leading his army up a steep incline and round the base of a great peak surmounted by stars His enemies flee in confusion before him One lies on the ground clutching a spear which has penetrated his throat two are falling over a cliff while others apparently sue for mercy Trees have been depicted to show that part of the conquered territory is wooded Naram Sin is armed with battleaxe and bow and his helmet is decorated with horns The whole composition is spirited and finely grouped and the military bearing of the disciplined troops contrasts sharply with the despairing attitudes of the fleeing remnants of the defending army During this period the Semitized mountaineers to the north east of Babylonia became the most aggressive opponents of the city states The two most prominent were the Gutium or men of Kutu and the Lulubu Naram Sin s great empire included the whole of Sumer and Akkad Amurru and northern Palestine and part of Elam and the district to the north He also penetrated Arabia probably by way of the Persian Gulf and caused diorite to be quarried there One of his steles which is now in the Imperial Ottoman Museum at Constantinople depicts him as a fully bearded man with Semitic characteristics During his lifetime he was deified a clear indication of the introduction of foreign ideas for the Sumerians were not worshippers of kings and ancestors Naram Sin was the last great king of his line Soon after his death the power of Akkad went to pieces and the Sumerian city of Erech again became the centre of empire Its triumph however was shortlived After a quarter of a century had elapsed Akkad and Sumer were overswept by the fierce Gutium from the north eastern mountains They sacked and burned many cities including Babylon where the memory of the horrors perpetrated by these invaders endured until the Grecian Age An obscure period like the Egyptian Hyksos Age ensued but it was of comparatively brief duration When the mists cleared away the city Lagash once more came to the front having evidently successfully withstood the onslaughts of the Gutium but it never recovered the place of eminence it occupied under the brilliant Ur Nina dynasty It is manifest that it must have enjoyed under the various overlords during the interval a considerable degree of independence for its individuality remained unimpaired Of all its energetic and capable patesis the most celebrated was Gudea who reigned sometime before twenty four hundred B C In contrast to the Semitic Naram Sin he was beardless and pronouncedly Sumerian in aspect His favoured deity the city god Nin Girsu again became prominent having triumphed over his jealous rivals after remaining in obscurity for three or four centuries Trade flourished and the arts were fostered Gudea had himself depicted in one of the most characteristic sculptures of his age as an architect seated reverently with folded hands with a temple plan lying on his knees and his head uplifted as if watching the builders engaged in materializing the dream of his life The temple in which his interests were centred was erected in honour of Nin Girsu Its ruins suggest that it was of elaborate structure and great beauty Like Solomon in later days Gudea procured material for his temple from many distant parts cedar from Lebanon marble from Amurru diorite from Arabia copper from Elam and so forth Apparently the King of Lagash was strong enough or wealthy enough to command respect over a wide area Another city which also rose into prominence amidst the shattered Sumerian states was Ur the centre of moon worship After Gudea s death its kings exercised sway over Lagash and Nippur and farther south over Erech and Larsa as well This dynasty endured for nearly a hundred and twenty years during which Ur flourished like Thebes in Egypt Its monarchs styled themselves as Kings of the Four Regions The worship of Nannar Sin became officially recognized at Nippur the seat of Enlil during the reign of King Dungi of Ur while at Erech the high priest of Anu the sky god became the high priest of the moon god Apparently matriarchal ideas associated with lunar worship again came into prominence for the king appointed two of his daughters to be rulers of conquered states in Elam and Syria In the latter half of his reign Dungi the conqueror was installed as high priest at Eridu It would thus appear that there was a renascence of early Sumerian religious ideas Ea the god of the deep had long been overshadowed but a few years before Dungi s death a temple was erected to him at Nippur where he was worshipped as Dagan Until the very close of his reign which lasted for fifty eight years this great monarch of tireless activity waged wars of conquest built temples and palaces and developed the natural resources of Sumer and Akkad Among his many reforms was the introduction of standards of weights which received divine sanction from the moon god who as in Egypt was the measurer and regulator of human transactions and human life To this age also belongs many of the Sumerian business and legal records which were ultimately carried off to Susa where they have been recovered by French excavators About half a century after Dungi s death the Dynasty of Ur came to an end its last king having been captured by an Elamite force At some time subsequent to this period Abraham migrated from Ur to the northern city of Harran where the moon god was also the chief city deity the Baal or lord It is believed by certain Egyptologists that Abraham sojourned in Egypt during its Twelfth Dynasty which according to the Berlin system of minimum dating extended from about two thousand B C till seventeen eighty B C The Hebrew patriarch may therefore have been a contemporary of Hammurabi s who is identified with Amraphel king of Shinar Sumer in the Bible one hundred forty nine But after the decline of Ur s ascendancy and long before Babylon s great monarch came to the throne the centre of power in Sumeria was shifted to Isin where sixteen kings flourished for two and a quarter centuries Among the royal names recognition was given to Ea and Dagan Sin Enlil and Ishtar indicating that Sumerian religion in its Semitized form was receiving general recognition The sun god was identical with Ninip and Nin Girsu a god of fertility harvest and war but now more fully developed and resembling Babbar the shining one the solar deity of Akkadian Sippar whose Semitic name was Shamash As Shamash was ultimately developed as the god of justice and righteousness it would appear that his ascendancy occurred during the period when well governed communities systematized their religious beliefs to reflect social conditions The first great monarch of the Isin dynasty was Ishbi Urra who reigned for thirty two years Like his successors he called himself King of Sumer and Akkad and it appears that his sway extended to the city of Sippar where solar worship prevailed Traces of him have also been found at Eridu Ur Erech and Nippur so that he must have given recognition to Ea Sin Anu and Enlil In this period the early national pantheon may have taken shape Bel Enlil being the chief deity Enlil was afterwards displaced by Merodach of Babylon Before twenty two hundred B C there occurred a break in the supremacy of Isin Gungunu King of Ur combined with Larsa whose sun temple he restored and declared himself ruler of Sumer and Akkad But Isin again gathered strength under Ur Ninip who was not related to his predecessor Perhaps he came from Nippur where the god Ninip was worshipped as the son of Bel Enlil According to a Babylonian document a royal grandson of Ur Ninip s having no direct heir selected as his successor his gardener Enlil bani He placed the crown on the head of this obscure individual abdicated in his favour and then died a mysterious death within his palace It is highly probable that Enlil bani whose name signifies Enlil is my creator was a usurper like Sargon of Akkad and he may have similarly circulated a myth regarding his miraculous origin to justify his sudden rise to power The truth appears to be that he came to the throne as the leader of a palace revolution at a time of great unrest But he was not allowed to remain in undisputed possession A rival named Sin ikisha evidently a moon worshipper and perhaps connected with Ur displaced the usurper and proclaimed himself king After a brief reign of six months he was overthrown however by Enlil bani who piously credited his triumph over his enemy to the chief god of Nippur whose name he bore Although he took steps to secure his position by strengthening the fortifications of Isin and reigned for about a quarter of a century he was not succeeded by his heir if he had one King Zambia who was no relation followed him but his reign lasted for only three years The names of the next two kings are unknown Then came Sin magir who was succeeded by Damik ilishu the last King of Isin Towards the close of Damik ilishu s reign of twenty four years he came under the suzerainty of Larsa whose ruler was Rim Sin Then Isin was captured by Sin muballit King of Babylon the father of the great Hammurabi Rim Sin was an Elamite Afterwards the old order of things passed away Babylon became the metropolis the names of Sumer and Akkad dropped out of use and the whole country between the rivers was called Babylonia one hundred fifty The various systems of law which obtained in the different states were then codified by Hammurabi who appointed governors in all the cities which came under his sway to displace the patesis and kings A new national pantheon of representative character was also formed over which Merodach Marduk the city god of Babylon presided How this younger deity was supposed to rise to power is related in the Babylonian legend of Creation which is dealt with in the next chapter one hundred fifty one In framing this myth from the fragments of older myths divine sanction was given to the supremacy achieved by Merodach s city The allegiance of future generations was thus secured not only by the strong arm of the law but also by the combined influence of the reorganized priesthoods at the various centres of administration An interesting problem which should be referred to here arises in connection with the sculptured representations of deities before and after the rise of Akkad as a great Power It is found although the Sumerians shaved their scalps and faces at the dawn of the historical age that they worshipped gods who had long hair and also beards which were sometimes square and sometimes pointed At what period the Sumerian deities were given human shape it is impossible to determine As has been shown Chapters II and III all the chief gods and goddesses had animal forms and composite monster forms before they became anthropomorphic deities Ea had evidently a fish shape ere he was clad in the skin of a fish as an Egyptian god was simply a bull before he was depicted in human shape wearing a bull s skin The archaic Sumerian animal and composite monster gods of animistic and totemic origin survived after the anthropomorphic period as mythical figures which were used for decorative or magical purposes and as symbols A form of divine headdress was a cap enclosed in horns between which appeared the soaring lion headed eagle which symbolized Nin Girsu This god had also lion and antelope forms which probably figured in lost myths perhaps they were like the animals loved by Ishtar and referred to in the Gilgamesh epic Similarly the winged bull was associated with the moon god Nannar or Sin of Ur who was a horned steer On various cylinder seals appear groups of composite monsters and rearing wild beasts which were evidently representations of gods and demons in conflict Suggestive data for comparative study is afforded in this connection by ancient Egypt Sokar the primitive Memphite deity retained until the end his animal and composite monster forms Other gods were depicted with human bodies and the heads of birds serpents and crocodiles thus forming links between the archaic demoniac and the later anthropomorphic deities A Sumerian example is the deified Ea bani who like Pan has the legs and hoofs of a goat The earliest representations of Sumerian humanized deities appear on reliefs from Tello the site of Lagash These examples of archaic gods however are not bearded in Semitic fashion On the contrary their lips and cheeks are shaved while an exaggerated chin tuft is retained The explanation suggested is that the Sumerians gave their deities human shape before they themselves were clean shaven and that the retention of the characteristic facial hair growth of the Mediterranean Race is another example of the conservatism of the religious instinct In Egypt the clean shaven Pharaohs who represented gods wore false chin tuft beards even Queen Hatshepsut considered it necessary to assume a beard on state occasions Ptah Osiris retained his archaic beard until the Ptolemaic period It seems highly probable that in similarly depicting their gods with beards the early Sumerians were not influenced by the practices of any alien people or peoples Not until the period of Gudea the Patesi of Lagash did they give their gods heavy moustaches side whiskers and flowing beards of Semitic type It may be however that by then they had completely forgotten the significance of an ancient custom Possibly too the sculptors of Lagash were working under the influence of the Akkadian school of art which had produced the exquisite stele of victory for Naram Sin and consequently adopted the conventional Semitic treatment of bearded figures At any rate they were more likely to study and follow the artistic triumphs of Akkad than the crude productions of the archaic period Besides they lived in an age when Semitic kings were deified and the Semitic overlords had attained to great distinction and influence The Semitic folks were not so highly thought of in the early Sumerian period It is not likely that the agricultural people regarded as models of gods the plunderers who descended from the hills and after achieving successes returned home with their spoils More probably they regarded them as foreign devils Other Semites however who came as traders bringing wood stone and especially copper and formed communities in cities may well have influenced Sumerian religious thought The god Ramman for instance who was given recognition all through Babylonia was a god of hill folks as far north as Asia Minor and throughout Syria He may have been introduced by settlers who adopted Sumerian habits of life and shaved scalp and face But although the old cities could never have existed in a complete state of isolation from the outer world it is unlikely that their inhabitants modelled their deities on those worshipped by groups of aliens A severe strain is imposed on our credulity if we are expected to believe that it was due to the teachings and example of uncultured nomads that the highly civilized Sumerians developed their gods from composite monsters to anthropomorphic deities Such a supposition at any rate is not supported by the evidence of Ancient Egypt CHAPTER VII CREATION LEGEND MERODACH THE DRAGON SLAYER Elder Spirits of the Primordial Deep Apsu and the Tiamat Dragon Plot to Destroy the Beneficent Gods Ea overcomes Apsu and Muminu The Vengeful Preparations of the Dragon Anshar s Appeal to Merodach The Festival of the High Gods Merodach exalted as Ruler of the Universe Dragon slain and Host taken captive Merodach rearranges the Pantheon Creation of Man Merodach as Asari The Babylonian Osiris The Chief Purpose of Mankind Tiamat as Source of Good and Evil The Dragon as the Serpent or Worm Folk Tale aspect of Creation Myth British Neolithic Legends German and Egyptian Contracts Biblical references to Dragons The Father and Son theme Merodach and Tammuz Monotheistic Tendency Bi sexual Deities In the beginning the whole universe was a sea Heaven on high had not been named nor the earth beneath Their begetter was Apsu the father of the primordial Deep and their mother was Tiamat the spirit of Chaos No plain was yet formed no marsh could be seen the gods had no existence nor had their fates been determined Then there was a movement in the waters and the deities issued forth The first who had being were the god Lachmu and the goddess Lachamu Long ages went past Then were created the god Anshar and the goddess Kishar When the days of these deities had increased and extended they were followed by Anu god of the sky whose consort was Anatu and Ea most wise and all powerful who was without an equal Now Ea god of the deep was also Enki lord of earth and his eternal spouse Damkina was Gashan ki lady of earth The son of Ea and Damkina was Bel the lord who in time created mankind one hundred fifty two Thus were the high gods established in power and in glory Now Apsu and Tiamat remained amidst confusion in the deeps of chaos They were troubled because their offspring the high gods aspired to control the universe and set it in order one hundred fifty three Apsu was still powerful and fierce and Tiamat snarled and raised tempests smiting herself Their purpose was to work evil amidst eternal confusion Then Apsu called upon Mummu his counsellor the son who shared his desires and said O Mummu thou who art pleasing unto me let us go forth together unto Tiamat and speak with her So the two went forth and prostrated themselves before the Chaos Mother to consult with her as to what should be done to prevent the accomplishment of the purpose of the high gods Apsu opened his mouth and spake saying O Tiamat thou gleaming one the purpose of the gods troubles me I cannot rest by day nor can I repose by night I will thwart them and destroy their purpose I will bring sorrow and mourning so that we may lie down undisturbed by them Tiamat heard these words and snarled She raised angry and roaring tempests in her furious grief she uttered a curse and then spake to Apsu saying What shall we do so that their purpose may be thwarted and we may lie down undisturbed again Mummu the counsellor addressing Apsu made answer and said Although the gods are powerful thou canst overcome them although their purpose is strong thou canst thwart it Then thou shalt have rest by day and peace by night to lie down The face of Apsu grew bright when he heard these words spoken by Mummu yet he trembled to think of the purpose of the high gods to whom he was hostile With Tiamat he lamented because the gods had changed all things the plans of the gods filled their hearts with dread they sorrowed and spake with Mummu plotting evil Then Ea who knoweth all drew near he beheld the evil ones conspiring and muttering together He uttered a pure incantation and accomplished the downfall of Apsu and Mummu who were taken captive one hundred fifty four Kingu who shared the desires of Tiamat spake unto her words of counsel saying Apsu and Mummu have been overcome and we cannot repose Thou shalt be their Avenger O Tempestuous One Tiamat heard the words of this bright and evil god and made answer saying On my strength thou canst trust So let war be waged Then were the hosts of chaos and the deep gathered together By day and by night they plotted against the high gods raging furiously making ready for battle fuming and storming and taking no rest Mother Chuber one hundred fifty five the creator of all provided irresistible weapons She also brought into being eleven kinds of fierce monsters giant serpents sharp of tooth with unsparing fangs whose bodies were filled with poison instead of blood snarling dragons clad with terror and of such lofty stature that whoever saw them was overwhelmed with fear nor could any escape their attack when they lifted themselves up vipers and pythons and the Lachamu hurricane monsters raging hounds scorpion men tempest furies fish men and mountain rams These she armed with fierce weapons and they had no fear of war Then Tiamat whose commands are unchangeable and mighty exalted Kingu who had come to her aid above all the evil gods she made him the leader to direct the army in battle to go in front to open the attack Robing Kingu in splendour she seated him on high and spoke saying I have established thy command over all the gods Thou shalt rule over them Be mighty thou my chosen husband and let thy name be exalted over all the spirits of heaven and spirits of earth Unto Kingu did Tiamat deliver the tablets of fate she laid them in his bosom and said Thy commands cannot be changed thy words shall remain firm Thus was Kingu exalted he was vested with the divine power of Anu to decree the fate of the gods saying Let thy mouth open to thwart the fire god be mighty in battle nor brook resistance Then had Ea knowledge of Tiamat s doings how she had gathered her forces together and how she had prepared to work evil against the high gods with purpose to avenge Apsu The wise god was stricken with grief and he moaned for many days Thereafter he went and stood before his father Anshar and spake saying Our mother Tiamat hath turned against us in her wrath She hath gathered the gods about her and those thou didst create are with her also When Anshar heard all that Ea revealed regarding the preparations made by Tiamat he smote his loins and clenched his teeth and was ill at ease In sorrow and anger he spoke and said Thou didst go forth aforetime to battle thou didst bind Mummu and smite Apsu Now Kingu is exalted and there is none who can oppose Tiamat one hundred fifty six Anshar called his son Anu before him and spoke saying O mighty one without fear whose attack is irresistible go now before Tiamat and speak so that her anger may subside and her heart be made merciful But if she will not hearken unto thee speak thou for me so that she may be reconciled Anu was obedient to the commands of Anshar He departed and descended by the path of Tiamat until he beheld her fuming and snarling but he feared to approach her and turned back Then Ea was sent forth but he was stricken with terror and turned back also one hundred fifty seven Anshar then called upon Merodach son of Ea and addressed him saying My son who softeneth my heart thou shalt go forth to battle and none shall stand against thee The heart of Merodach was made glad at these words He stood before Anshar who kissed him because that he banished fear Merodach spake saying O lord of the gods withdraw not thy words let me go forth to do as is thy desire What man hath challenged thee to battle Anshar made answer and said No man hath challenged me It is Tiamat the woman who hath resolved to wage war against us But fear not and make merry for thou shalt bruise the head of Tiamat O wise god thou shalt overcome her with thy pure incantation Tarry not but hasten forth she cannot wound thee thou shalt come back again The words of Anshar delighted the heart of Merodach who spake saying O lord of the gods O fate of the high gods if I the avenger am to subdue Tiamat and save all then proclaim my greatness among the gods Let all the high gods gather together joyfully in Upshukinaku the Council Hall so that my words like thine may remain unchanged and what I do may never be altered Instead of thee I will decree the fates of the gods Then Anshar called unto his counsellor Gaga and addressing him said O thou who dost share my desires thou who dost understand the purpose of my heart go unto Lachmu and Lachamu and summon all the high gods to come before me to eat bread and drink wine Repeat to them all I tell you of Tiamat s preparations for war of my commands to Anu and Ea who turned back fearing the dragon of my choice of Merodach to be our avenger and his desire to be equipped with my power to decree fate so that he may be made strong to combat against our enemy As Anshar commanded so did Gaga do He went unto Lachmu and Lachamu and prostrated himself humbly before them Then he rose and delivered the message of Anshar their son adding Hasten and speedily decide for Merodach your fate Permit him to depart to meet your powerful foe When Lachmu and Lachamu heard all that Gaga revealed unto them they uttered lamentations while the Igigi heavenly spirits sorrowed bitterly and said What change hath happened that Tiamat hath become hostile to her own offspring We cannot understand her deeds All the high gods then arose and went unto Anshar They filled his council chamber and kissed one another Then they sat down to eat bread and drink sesame wine And when they were made drunk and were merry and at their ease they decreed the fate for Merodach In the chamber of Anshar they honoured the Avenger He was exalted as a prince over them all and they said Among the high gods thou art the highest thy command is the command of Anu Henceforth thou wilt have power to raise up and to cast down None of the gods will dispute thy authority O Merodach our avenger we give thee sovereignty over the entire Universe Thy weapon will ever be irresistible Smite down the gods who have raised revolt but spare the lives of those who repose their trust in thee Then the gods laid down a garment before Merodach saying Open thy mouth and speak words of command so that the garment may be destroyed speak again and it will be brought back Merodach spake with his mouth and the garment vanished he spake again and the garment was reproduced All the gods rejoiced and they prostrated themselves and cried out Merodach is King Thereafter they gave him the sceptre and the throne and the insignia of royalty and also an irresistible weapon one hundred fifty eight with which to overcome his enemies saying Now O Merodach hasten and slay Tiamat Let the winds carry her blood to hidden places So was the fate of Merodach decreed by the gods so was a path of prosperity and peace prepared for him He made ready for battle he strung his bow and hung his quiver he slung a dart over his shoulder and he grasped a club in his right hand before him he set lightning and with flaming fire he filled his body Anu gave unto him a great net with which to snare his enemies and prevent their escape Then Merodach created seven winds the wind of evil the uncontrollable wind the sandstorm and the whirlwind the fourfold wind the sevenfold wind and the wind that has no equal and they went after him Next he seized his mighty weapon the thunderstone and leapt into his storm chariot to which were yoked four rushing and destructive steeds of rapid flight with foam flecked mouths and teeth full of venom trained for battle to overthrow enemies and trample them underfoot A light burned on the head of Merodach and he was clad in a robe of terror He drove forth and the gods his fathers followed after him the high gods clustered around and followed him hastening to battle Merodach drove on and at length he drew nigh to the secret lair of Tiamat and he beheld her muttering with Kingu her consort For a moment he faltered and when the gods who followed him beheld this their eyes were troubled Tiamat snarled nor turned her head She uttered curses and said O Merodach I fear not thy advance as chief of the gods My allies are assembled here and are more powerful than thou art Merodach uplifted his arm grasping the dreaded thunderstone and spake unto Tiamat the rebellious one saying Thou hast exalted thyself and with wrathful heart hath prepared for war against the high gods and their fathers whom thou dost hate in thy heart of evil Unto Kingu thou hast given the power of Anu to decree fate because thou art hostile to what is good and loveth what is sinful Gather thy forces together and arm thyself and come forth to battle When Tiamat heard these mighty words she raved and cried aloud like one who is possessed all her limbs shook and she muttered a spell The gods seized their weapons Tiamat and Merodach advanced to combat against one another They made ready for battle The lord of the high gods spread out the net which Anu had given him He snared the dragon and she could not escape Tiamat opened her mouth which was seven miles wide and Merodach called upon the evil wind to smite her he caused the wind to keep her mouth agape so that she could not close it All the tempests and the hurricanes entered in filling her body and her heart grew weak she gasped overpowered Then the lord of the high gods seized his dart and cast it through the lower part of her body it tore her inward parts and severed her heart So was Tiamat slain Merodach overturned the body of the dead dragon and stood upon it All the evil gods who had followed her were stricken with terror and broke into flight But they were unable to escape Merodach caught them in his great net and they stumbled and fell uttering cries of distress and the whole world resounded with their wailing and lamentations The lord of the high gods broke the weapons of the evil gods and put them in bondage Then he fell upon the monsters which Tiamat had created he subdued them divested them of their powers and trampled them under his feet Kingu he seized with the others From this god great Merodach took the tablets of fate and impressing upon them his own seal placed them in his bosom So were the enemies of the high gods overthrown by the Avenger Ansar s commands were fulfilled and the desires of Ea fully accomplished Merodach strengthened the bonds which he had laid upon the evil gods and then returned to Tiamat He leapt upon the dragon s body he clove her skull with his great club he opened the channels of her blood which streamed forth and caused the north to carry her blood to hidden places The high gods his fathers clustered around they raised shouts of triumph and made merry Then they brought gifts and offerings to the great Avenger Merodach rested a while gazing upon the dead body of the dragon He divided the flesh of Ku pu one hundred fifty nine and devised a cunning plan Then the lord of the high gods split the body of the dragon like that of a mashde fish into two halves With one half he enveloped the firmament he fixed it there and set a watchman to prevent the waters falling down one hundred sixty With the other half he made the earth one hundred sixty one Then he made the abode of Ea in the deep and the abode of Anu in high heaven The abode of Enlil was in the air Merodach set all the great gods in their several stations He also created their images the stars of the Zodiac and fixed them all He measured the year and divided it into months for twelve months he made three stars each After he had given starry images of the gods separate control of each day of the year he founded the station of Nibiru Jupiter his own star to determine the limits of all stars so that none might err or go astray He placed beside his own the stations of Enlil and Ea and on each side he opened mighty gates fixing bolts on the left and on the right He set the zenith in the centre Merodach decreed that the moon god should rule the night and measure the days and each month he was given a crown Its various phases the great lord determined and he commanded that on the evening of its fullest brilliancy it should stand opposite the sun one hundred sixty two He placed his bow in heaven as a constellation and his net also We have now reached the sixth tablet which begins with a reference to words spoken to Merodach by the gods Apparently Ea had conceived in his heart that mankind should be created The lord of the gods read his thoughts and said I will shed my blood and fashion bone I will create man to dwell on the earth so that the gods may be worshipped and shrines erected for them I will change the pathways of the gods The rest of the text is fragmentary and many lines are missing Berosus states however that Belus Bel Merodach severed his head from his shoulders His blood flowed forth and the gods mixed it with earth and formed the first man and various animals In another version of the creation of man it is related that Merodach laid a reed upon the face of the waters he formed dust and poured it out beside the reed That he might cause the gods to dwell in the habitation of their heart s desire he formed mankind The goddess Aruru a deity of Sippar and one of the forms of the lady of the gods is associated with Merodach as the creatrix of the seed of mankind The beasts of the field and living creatures in the field he formed He also created the Tigris and Euphrates rivers grass reeds herbs and trees lands marshes and swamps cows goats c one hundred sixty three In the seventh tablet Merodach is praised by the gods the Igigi spirits of heaven As he has absorbed all their attributes he is addressed by his fifty one names henceforth each deity is a form of Merodach Bel Enlil for instance is Merodach of lordship and domination Sin the moon god is Merodach as ruler of night Shamash is Merodach as god of law and holiness Nergal is Merodach of war and so on The tendency to monotheism appears to have been most marked among the priestly theorists of Babylon Merodach is hailed to begin with as Asari the introducer of agriculture and horticulture the creator of grain and plants He also directs the decrees of Anu Bel and Ea but having rescued the gods from destruction at the hands of Kingu and Tiamat he was greater than his fathers the elder gods He set the Universe in order and created all things anew He is therefore Tutu the creator a merciful and beneficent god The following are renderings of lines twenty five to thirty two Tutu Aga azaga the glorious crown may he make the crowns glorious The lord

enemies For their forgiveness did he create mankind The Merciful One with whom it is to bestow life May his deeds endure may they never be forgotten In the mouth of mankind whom his hands have made King s Translation one hundred sixty five Apparently the Babylonian doctrine set forth that mankind was created not only to worship the gods but also to bring about the redemption of the fallen gods who followed Tiamat Those rebel angels ili gods He prohibited return He stopped their service He removed them unto the gods ili who were His enemies In their room he created mankind one hundred sixty six Tiamat the chaos dragon is the Great Mother She has a dual character As the origin of good she is the creatrix of the gods Her beneficent form survived as the Sumerian goddess Bau who was obviously identical with the Phoenician Baau mother of the first man Another name of Bau was Ma and Nintu a form of the goddess Ma was half a woman and half a serpent and was depicted with a babe suckling her breast Chapter IV The Egyptian goddesses Neheb kau and Uazit were serpents and the goddesses Isis and Nepthys had also serpent forms The serpent was a symbol of fertility and as a mother was a protector Vishnu the Preserver of the Hindu Trinity sleeps on the world serpent s body Serpent charms are protective and fertility charms As the origin of evil Tiamat personified the deep and tempests In this character she was the enemy of order and good and strove to destroy the world I have seen The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds one hundred sixty seven Tiamat was the dragon of the sea and therefore the serpent or leviathan The word dragon is derived from the Greek drakon the serpent known as the seeing one or looking one whose glance was the lightning The Anglo Saxon fire drake draca Latin draco is identical with the flying dragon In various countries the serpent or worm is a destroyer which swallows the dead The worm shall eat them like wool exclaimed Isaiah in symbolic language one hundred sixty eight It lies in the ocean which surrounds the world in Egyptian Babylonian Greek Teutonic Indian and other mythologies The Irish call it moruach and give it a mermaid form like the Babylonian Nintu In a Scottish Gaelic poem Tiamat figures as The Yellow Muilearteach who is slain by Finn mac Coul assisted by his warrior band There was seen coming on the top of the waves The crooked clamouring shivering brave Her face was blue black of the lustre of coal And her bone tufted tooth was like rusted bone one hundred sixty nine The serpent figures in folk tales When Alexander the Great according to Ethiopic legend was lowered in a glass cage to the depths of the ocean he saw a great monster going past and sat for two days watching for its tail and hinder parts to appear one hundred seventy An Argyllshire Highlander had a similar experience He went to fish one morning on a rock He was not long there when he saw the head of an eel pass He continued fishing for an hour and the eel was still passing He went home worked in the field all day and having returned to the same rock in the evening the eel was still passing and about dusk he saw her tail disappearing one hundred seventy one Tiamat s sea brood is referred to in the Anglo Saxon epic Beowulf as nickers The hero slew by night sea monsters on the waves line four hundred twenty two The well dragon the French draco also recalls the Babylonian water monsters There was a dragon well near Jerusalem one hundred seventy two From China to Ireland rivers are dragons or goddesses who flee from the well dragons The demon of the Rhone is called the drac Floods are also referred to as dragons and the Hydra or water serpent slain by Hercules belongs to this category Water was the source of evil as well as good To the Sumerians the ocean especially was the abode of monsters They looked upon it as did Shakespeare s Ferdinand when leaping into the sea he cried Hell is empty and all the devils are here one hundred seventy three There can be little doubt but that in this Babylonian story of Creation we have a glorified variation of the widespread Dragon myth Unfortunately however no trace can be obtained of the pre existing Sumerian oral version which the theorizing priests infused with such sublime symbolism No doubt it enjoyed as great popularity as the immemorial legend of Perseus and Andromeda which the sages of Greece attempted to rationalize and parts of which the poets made use of and developed as these appealed to their imaginations The lost Sumerian story may be summarized as follows There existed in the savage wilds or the ocean a family of monsters antagonistic to a group of warriors represented in the Creation legend by the gods Ea the heroic king sets forth to combat with the enemies of man and slays the monster father Apsu and his son Mummu But the most powerful demon remains to be dealt with This is the mother Tiamat who burns to avenge the deaths of her kindred To wage war against her the hero makes elaborate preparations and equips himself with special weapons The queen of monsters cannot be overcome by ordinary means for she has great cunning and is less vulnerable than were her husband and son Although Ea may work spells against her she is able to thwart him by working counter spells Only a hand to hand combat can decide the fray Being strongly protected by her scaly hide she must be wounded either on the under part of her body or through her mouth by a weapon which will pierce her liver the seat of life It will be noted in this connection that Merodach achieved success by causing the winds which followed him to distend the monster s jaws so that he might be able to inflict the fatal blow and prevent her at the same time from uttering spells to weaken him This type of story in which the mother monster is greater and more powerful than her husband or son is exceedingly common in Scottish folklore In the legend which relates the adventures of Finn in the Kingdom of Big Men the hero goes forth at night to protect his allies against the attacks of devastating sea monsters Standing on the beach he saw the sea advancing in fiery kilns and as a darting serpent A huge monster came up and looking down below where he Finn was exclaimed What little speck do I see here Finn aided by his fairy dog slew the water monster On Finn aided by his fairy dog slew the water monster On the following night a bigger monster the father came ashore and he also was slain But the most powerful enemy had yet to be dealt with The next night a Big Hag came ashore and the tooth in the front of her mouth would make a distaff You killed my husband and son she said Finn acknowledged that he did and they began to fight After a prolonged struggle in which Finn was almost overcome the Hag fell and her head was cut off one hundred seventy four The story of Finlay the Changeling has similar features The hero slew first a giant and then the giant s father Thereafter the Hag came against him and exclaimed Although with cunning and deceitfulness you killed my husband last night and my son on the night before last I shall certainly kill you to night A fierce wrestling match ensued on the bare rock The Hag was ultimately thrown down She then offered various treasures to ransom her life including a gold sword in my cave regarding which she says never was it drawn to man or to beast whom it did not overcome one hundred seventy five In other Scottish stories of like character the hero climbs a tree and says something to induce the hag to open her mouth so that he may plunge his weapon down her throat The Grendel story in Beowulf one hundred seventy six the Anglo Saxon epic is of like character A male water monster preys nightly upon the warriors who sleep in the great hall of King Hrothgar Beowulf comes over the sea as did Finn to the Kingdom of Big Men to sky Grendel He wrestles with this man eater and mortally wounds him Great rejoicings ensue but they have to be brought to an abrupt conclusion because the mother of Grendel has meanwhile resolved to go a sorry journey and avenge the death of her son The narrative sets forth that she enters the Hall in the darkness of night Quickly she grasped one of the nobles tight and then she went towards the fen towards her submarine cave Beowulf follows in due course and fully armoured dives through the waters and ultimately enters the monster s lair In the combat the water wife proves to be a more terrible opponent than was her son Indeed Beowulf was unable to slay her until he possessed himself of a gigantic sword adorned with treasure which was hanging in the cave With this magic weapon he slays the mother monster whose poisonous blood afterwards melts the damasked blade Like Finn he subsequently returns with the head of one of the monsters An interesting point about this story is that it does not appear in any form in the North German cycle of Romance Indeed the poet who included in his epic the fiery dragon story which links the hero Beowulf with Sigurd and Siegfried appears to be doubtful about the mother monster s greatness as if dealing with unfamiliar material for he says The terror caused by Grendel s mother was less by just so much as woman s strength woman s war terror is measured by fighting men one hundred seventy seven Yet in the narrative which follows the Amazon is proved to be the stronger monster of the two Traces of the mother monster survive in English folklore especially in the traditions about the mythical Long Meg of Westminster referred to by Ben Jonson in his masque of the Fortunate Isles Westminster Meg With her long leg As long as a crane And feet like a plane With a pair of heels As broad as two wheels Meg has various graves One is supposed to be marked by a huge stone in the south side of the cloisters of Westminster Abbey it probably marks the trench in which some plague victims regarded perhaps as victims of Meg were interred Meg was also reputed to have been petrified like certain Greek and Irish giants and giantesses At Little Salkeld near Penrith a stone circle is referred to as Long Meg and her Daughters Like Long Tom the famous giant Mons Meg gave her name to big guns in early times all hags and giants having been famous in floating folk tales as throwers of granite boulders balls of hard clay quoits and other gigantic missiles The stories about Grendel s mother and Long Meg are similar to those still repeated in the Scottish Highlands These contrast sharply with characteristic Germanic legends in which the giant is greater than the giantess and the dragon is a male like Fafner who is slain by Sigurd and Regin whom Siegfried overcomes It is probable therefore that the British stories of female monsters who were more powerful than their husbands and sons are of Neolithic and Iberian origin immemorial relics of the intellectual life of the western branch of the Mediterranean race In Egypt the dragon survives in the highly developed mythology of the sun cult of Heliopolis and as sun worship is believed to have been imported and the sun deity is a male it is not surprising to find that the night demon Apep was a personification of Set This god who is identical with Sutekh a Syrian and Asia Minor deity was apparently worshipped by a tribe which was overcome in the course of early tribal struggles in pre dynastic times Being an old and discredited god he became by a familiar process the demon of the conquerors In the eighteenth dynasty however his ancient glory was revived for the Sutekh of Rameses II figures as the dragon slayer one hundred seventy eight It is in accordance with Mediterranean modes of thought however to find that in Egypt there is a great celestial battle heroine This is the goddess Hathor Sekhet the Eye of Ra one hundred seventy nine Similarly in India the post Vedic goddess Kali is a destroyer while as Durga she is a guardian of heroes one hundred eighty Kali Durga and Hathor Sekhet link with the classical goddesses of war and also with the Babylonian Ishtar who as has been shown retained the outstanding characteristics of Tiamat the fierce old Great Mother of primitive Sumerian folk religion It is possible that in the Babylonian dragon myth the original hero was Ea As much may be inferred from the symbolic references in the Bible to Jah s victory over the monster of the deep Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab and wounded the dragon one hundred eighty one Thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness one hundred eighty two He divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud Rahab By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand hath formed or pierced the crooked serpent one hundred eighty three Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces as one that is slain thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm one hundred eighty four In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing or stiff serpent even leviathan that crooked serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea one hundred eighty five In the Babylonian Creation legend Ea is supplanted as dragon slayer by his son Merodach Similarly Ninip took the place of his father Enlil as the champion of the gods In other words writes doctor Langdon later theology evolved the notion of the son of the earth god who acquires the attributes of the father and becomes the god of war It is he who stood forth against the rebellious monsters of darkness who would wrest the dominion of the world from the gods who held their conclave on the mountain The gods offer him the Tablets of Fate the right to utter decrees is given unto him This development is of extreme importance for studying the growth of the idea of father and son as creative and active principles of the world one hundred eighty six In Indian mythology Indra similarly takes the place of his bolt throwing father Dyaus the sky god who so closely resembles Zeus Andrew Lang has shown that this myth is of widespread character one hundred eighty seven Were the Babylonian theorists guided by the folk lore clue Now Merodach as the son of Ea whom he consulted and received spells from was a brother of Tammuz of the Abyss It seems that in the great god of Babylon we should recognize one of the many forms of the primeval corn spirit and patriarch the shepherd youth who was beloved by Ishtar As the deity of the spring sun Tammuz slew the winter demons of rain and tempest so that he was an appropriate spouse for the goddess of harvest and war Merodach may have been a development of Tammuz in his character as a demon slayer When he was raised to the position of Bel the Lord by the Babylonian conquerors Merodach supplanted the older Bel Enlil of Nippur Now Enlil who had absorbed all the attributes of rival deities and become a world god was the Lord of the harvest lands lord of the grain fields being lord of the anunnaki or earth spirits As agriculturists in early times went to war so as to secure prisoners who could be sacrificed to feed the corn spirit Enlil was a god of war and was adored as such The haughty the hostile land thou dost humiliate With thee who ventureth to make war He was also the bull of goring horns Enlil the bull the god of fertility as well as of battle one hundred eighty eight Asari one of Merodach s names links him with Osiris the Egyptian Tammuz who was supplanted by his son Horus As the dragon slayer he recalls among others Perseus the Grecian hero of whom it was prophesied that he would slay his grandfather Perseus like Tammuz and Osiris was enclosed in a chest which was cast into the sea to be rescued however by a fisherman on the island of Seriphos This hero afterwards slew Medusa one of the three terrible sisters the Gorgons a demon group which links with Tiamat In time Perseus returned home and while an athletic contest was in progress he killed his grandfather with a quoit There is no evidence however to show that the displacement of Enlil by Merodach had any legendary sanction of like character The god of Babylon absorbed all other deities apparently for political purposes and in accordance with the tendency of the thought of the times when raised to supreme rank in the national pantheon and he was depicted fighting the winged dragon flapping his own storm wings and carrying the thunder weapon associated with Ramman Merodach s spouse Zer panitu m was significantly called the lady of the Abyss a title which connects her with Damkina the mother and Belit sheri the sister of Tammuz Damkina was also a sky goddess like Ishtar Zer panitu m was no pale reflection of her Celestial husband but a goddess of sharply defined character with independent powers Apparently she was identical with Aruru creatrix of the seed of mankind who was associated with Merodach when the first man and the first woman were brought into being Originally she was one of the mothers in the primitive spirit group and so identical with Ishtar and the other prominent goddesses As all goddesses became forms of Ishtar so did all gods become forms of Merodach Sin was Merodach as illuminator of night Nergal was Merodach of war Addu Ramman was Merodach of rain and so on A colophon which contains a text in which these identifications are detailed appears to be a copy says Professor Pinches of an old inscription which he thinks may go back as far as two thousand B C This is the period at which the name Yau m ilu Jah is god is found together with references to ilu as the name for the one great god and is also roughly the date of Abraham who it may be noted was a Babylonian of Ur of the Chaldees one hundred eighty nine In one of the hymns Merodach is addressed as follows Who shall escape from before thy power Thy will is an eternal mystery Thou makest it plain in heaven And in the earth Command the sea And the sea obeyeth thee Command the tempest And the tempest becometh a calm Command the winding course Of the Euphrates And the will of Merodach Shall arrest the floods Lord thou art holy Who is like unto thee Merodach thou art honoured Among the gods that bear a name The monotheistic tendency which was a marked feature of Merodach worship had previously become pronounced in the worship of Bel Enlil of Nippur Although it did not affect the religion of the masses it serves to show that among the ancient scholars and thinkers of Babylonia religious thought had at an early period risen far above the crude polytheism of those who bargained with their deities and propitiated them with offerings and extravagant flattery or exercised over them a magical influence by the performance of seasonal ceremonies like the backsliders in Jerusalem censured so severely by Jeremiah who baked cakes to reward the Queen of Heaven for an abundant harvest and wept with her for the slain Tammuz when he departed to Hades Perhaps it was due to the monotheistic tendency if not to the fusion of father worshipping and mother worshipping peoples that bi sexual deities were conceived of Nannar the moon god was sometimes addressed as father and mother in one and Ishtar as a god as well as a goddess In Egypt Isis is referred to in a temple chant as the woman who was made a male by her father Osiris and the Nile god Hapi was depicted as a man with female breasts CHAPTER VIII DEIFIED HEROES ETANA AND GILGAMESH God and Heroes and the Seven Sleepers Quests of Etana

none	none	When a great national hero appealed by reason of his achievements to the imagination of a people all the floating legends of antiquity were attached to his memory and he became identified with gods and giants and knight errants old in story In Scotland for instance the boulder throwing giant of Eildon hills bears the name of Wallace the Edinburgh giant of Arthur s Seat is called after an ancient Celtic king one hundred ninety and Thomas the Rhymer takes the place in an Inverness fairy mound called Tom na hurich of Finn Fingal as chief of the Seven Sleepers Similarly Napoleon sleeps in France and Skobeleff in Russia as do also other heroes elsewhere In Germany the myths of Thunor Thor were mingled with hazy traditions of Theodoric the Goth Dietrich while in Greece Egypt and Arabia Alexander the Great absorbed a mass of legendary matter of great antiquity and displaced in the memories of the people the heroes of other Ages as those heroes had previously displaced the humanized spirits of fertility and growth who alternately battled fiercely against the demons of spring made love gorged and drank deep and went to sleep the sleep of winter

none	none	There are two great heroes of Babylonian fame who link with Perseus and Hercules Sigurd and Siegfried Dietrich and Finn mac Coul These are Etana and Gilgamesh two legendary kings who resemble Tammuz the Patriarch referred to by Berosus a form of Tammuz the Sleeper of the Sumerian psalms One journeys to the Nether World to obtain the Plant of Birth and the other to obtain the Plant of Life 
6458_61323_000002_000003	train-clean-360	The floating legends with which they were associated were utilized and developed by the priests when engaged in the process of systematizing and symbolizing religious beliefs with purpose to unfold the secrets of creation and the Otherworld

6458_61323_000002_000005	train-clean-360	As Vishnu the Indian god rides on the back of Garuda so does Etana ride on the back of the Babylonian Eagle 
6458_61323_000002_000006	train-clean-360	In one fragmentary legend which was preserved in the tablet library of Ashur banipal the Assyrian monarch Etana obtained the assistance of the Eagle to go in quest of the Plant of Birth 
6458_61323_000002_000007	train-clean-360	His wife was about to become a mother and was accordingly in need of magical aid 
none	none	A similar belief caused birth girdles of straw or serpent skins and eagle stones found in eagles nests to be used in ancient Britain and elsewhere throughout Europe apparently from the earliest times one hundred ninety one 
6458_61323_000003_000000	train-clean-360	On this or another occasion Etana desired to ascend to highest heaven He asked the Eagle to assist him and the bird assented saying Be glad my friend 
none	none	Let me bear thee to the highest heaven Lay thy breast on mine and thine arms on my wings and let my body be as thy body Etana did as the great bird requested him and together they ascended towards the firmament After a flight which extended over two hours the Eagle asked Etana to gaze downwards He did so and beheld the ocean surrounding the earth and the earth seemed like a mountainous island The Eagle resumed its flight and when another two hours had elapsed it again asked Etana to look downwards Then the hero saw that the sea resembled a girdle which clasped the land Two hours later Etana found that he had been raised to a height from which the sea appeared to be no larger than a pond By this time he had reached the heaven of Anu Bel and Ea and found there rest and shelter 
6458_61323_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Here the text becomes fragmentary 
none	none	Further on it is gathered from the narrative that Etana is being carried still higher by the Eagle towards the heaven of Ishtar Queen of Heaven the supreme mother goddess Three times at intervals of two hours the Eagle asks Etana to look downwards towards the shrinking earth 
6458_61323_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Then some disaster happens for further onwards the broken tablet narrates that the Eagle is falling 
none	none	Down and down eagle and man fall together until they strike the earth and the Eagle s body is shattered The Indian Garuda eagle one hundred ninety two never met with such a fate but on one occasion Vishnu overpowered it with his right arm which was heavier than the whole universe and caused many feathers to fall off In the story of Rama s wanderings however as told in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata there are interesting references in this connection to Garuda s two sons One was mortally wounded by Ravana the demon king of Ceylon The other bird related to Rama who found it disabled Once upon a time we two brothers with the desire of outstripping each other flew towards the sun

none	none	The narrative states that he was carried to heaven in a chest borne by four monstrous birds but after wandering for some time through the air he fell down on a mountain with such a force that he made it shake A reference in the Koran to contrivances which make mountains tremble is believed to allude to Nimrod s vain attempt one hundred ninety four Alexander the Great was also reputed to have ascended on the back of an eagle 
6458_61323_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Among the myths attached to his memory in the Ethiopic history is one which explains how he knew and comprehended the length and breadth of the earth and how he obtained knowledge regarding the seas and mountains he would have to cross

none	none	I grew stronger and more active he adds than I had ever been before one hundred ninety six The eagle figures in various mythologies and appears to have been at one time worshipped as the god or goddess of fertility and storm and lightning as the bringer of children and the deity who carried souls to Hades It was also the symbol of royalty because the earthly ruler represented the controlling deity 
6458_61323_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Nin Girsu the god of Lagash who was identified with Tammuz was depicted as a lion headed eagle 
none	none	Zeus the Greek sky and air god was attended by an eagle and may at one time have been simply an eagle In Egypt the place of the eagle is taken by Nekhebit the vulture goddess whom the Greeks identified with Eileithyia the goddess of birth she was usually represented as a vulture hovering over the king one hundred ninety seven The double headed eagle of the Hittites which figures in the royal arms of Germany and Russia appears to have symbolized the deity of whom the king was an incarnation or son

none	none	When the childless Indian sage Mandapala of the Mahabharata was refused admittance to heaven until a son was born to him he pondered deeply and came to know that of all creatures birds alone were blest with fecundity so he became a bird It is of interest therefore to find the Etana eagle figuring as a symbol of royalty at Rome The deified Roman Emperor s waxen image was burned on a pyre after his death and an eagle was let loose from the great pile to carry his soul to heaven one hundred ninety nine This custom was probably a relic of seasonal fire worship which may have been introduced into Northern and Western Syria and Asia Minor by the mysterious Mitanni rulers if it was not an archaic Babylonian custom two hundred associated with fire and water magical ceremonies represented in the British Isles by May Day and Midsummer fire and water festivals Sandan the mythical founder of Tarsus was honoured each year at that city by burning a great bonfire and he was identified with Hercules Probably he was a form of Moloch and Melkarth two hundred one Doves were burned to Adonis 
6458_61323_000012_000004	train-clean-360	The burning of straw figures representing gods of fertility on May Day bonfires may have been a fertility rite and perhaps explains the use of straw birth girdles 
none	none	According to the commentators of the Koran Nimrod the Babylonian king who cast victims in his annual bonfires at Cuthah died on the eighth day of the Tammuz month which according to the Syrian calendar fell on thirteenth July two hundred two It is related that gnats entered Nimrod s brain causing the membrane to grow larger He suffered great pain and to relieve it had his head beaten with a mallet Although he lived for several hundred years like other agricultural patriarchs including the Tammuz of Berosus it is possible that he was ultimately sacrificed and burned The beating of Nimrod recalls the beating of the corn spirit of the agricultural legend utilized by Burns in his ballad of John Barleycorn which gives a jocular account of widespread ancient customs that are not yet quite extinct even in Scotland two hundred three They laid him down upon his back And cudgelled him full sore They hung him up before a storm And turned him o er and o er

none	none	Hercules after performing many mythical exploits had himself burned alive on the pyre which he built upon Mount Oeta and was borne to Olympus amidst peals of thunder Gilgamesh the Babylonian Hercules who links with Etana Nimrod and Sandan is associated with the eagle which in India as has been shown was identified with the gods of fertility fire and death According to a legend related by Aelian two hundred four the guards of the citadel of Babylon threw down to the ground a child who had been conceived and brought forth in secret and who afterwards became known as Gilgamos This appears to be another version of the Sargon Tammuz myth and may also refer to the sacrifice of children to Melkarth and Moloch who were burned or slain in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks two hundred five to ensure fertility and feed the corn god Gilgamesh however did not perish A keen eyed eagle saw the child falling and before it touched the ground the bird flew under it and received it on its back and carried it away to a garden and laid it down gently Here we have it would appear Tammuz among the flowers and Sargon the gardener in the Garden of Adonis

6458_61323_000019_000001	train-clean-360	He was apparently of great antiquity so that it is impossible to identify him with any forerunner of Sargon of Akkad or Alexander the Great 
none	none	His exploits were depicted on cylinder seals of the Sumerian period and he is shown wrestling with a lion as Hercules wrestled with the monstrous lion in the valley of Nemea The story of his adventures was narrated on twelve clay tablets which were preserved in the library of Ashur banipal the Assyrian emperor In the first tablet which is badly mutilated Gilgamesh is referred to as the man who beheld the world and had great wisdom because he peered into the mysteries

none	none	It is possible therefore that an ancient myth of Eridu forms the basis of the narrative Ea bani is depicted on the cylinder seals as a hairy man monster resembling the god Pan He ate grass with the gazelles and drank water with wild beasts and he is compared to the corn god which suggests that he was an early form of Tammuz and of character somewhat resembling the Egyptian Bast the half bestial god of fertility A hunter was sent out from Erech to search for the man monster and found him beside a stream in a savage place drinking with his associates the wild animals The description of Ea bani recalls that of Nebuchadnezzar when he was stricken with madness He was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs were grown like eagles feathers and his nails like birds claws two hundred seven The hunter had no desire to combat with Ea bani so he had him lured from the wilds by a beautiful woman Love broke the spell which kept Ea bani in his savage state and the wild beasts fled from him 
6458_61323_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Then the temptress pleaded with him to go with her to Erech where Anu and Ishtar had their temples and the mighty Gilgamesh lived in his palace 
none	none	Ea bani deserted by his bestial companions felt lonely and desired human friendship So he consented to accompany his bride Having heard of Gilgamesh from the hunter he proposed to test his strength in single combat but Shamash god of the sun warned Ea bani that he was the protector of Gilgamesh who had been endowed with great knowledge by Bel and Anu and Ea Gilgamesh was also counselled in a vision of night to receive Ea bani as an ally Ea bani was not attracted by city life and desired to return to the wilds but Shamash prevailed upon him to remain as the friend of Gilgamesh promising that he would be greatly honoured and exalted to high rank The two heroes became close friends and when the narrative becomes clear again they are found to be setting forth to wage war against Chumbaba two hundred eight the King of Elam Their journey was long and perilous In time they entered a thick forest and wondered greatly at the numerous and lofty cedars They saw the great road which the king had caused to be made the high mountain and the temple of the god Beautiful were the trees about the mountain and there were many shady retreats that were fragrant and alluring At this point the narrative breaks off for the tablet is mutilated When it is resumed a reference is made to the head of Chumbaba who has apparently been slain by the heroes

6458_61323_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Ishtar s heart was filled with wrath when she heard the words which Gilgamesh had spoken and she prevailed upon her father Anu to create a fierce bull which she sent against the lord of Erech

6458_61323_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Ishtar cursed Gilgamesh 
6458_61323_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Ea bani then defied her and threatened to deal with her as he had dealt with the bull with the result that he was cursed by the goddess also

none	none	A festival was held and afterwards the heroes lay down to sleep Then Ea bani dreamt a dream of ill omen He met his death soon afterwards apparently in a battle and Gilgamesh lamented over him From the surviving fragments of the narrative it would appear that Gilgamesh resolved to undertake a journey for he had been stricken by disease He wept and cried out Oh let me not die like Ea bani for death is fearful I will seek the aid of mine ancestor Pir napishtim the Babylonian Noah who was believed to be dwelling on an island which corresponds to the Greek Island of the Blessed The Babylonian island lay in the ocean of the Nether World It seems that Gilgamesh not only hoped to obtain the Water of Life and the Plant of Life to cure his own disease but also to restore to life his dead friend Ea bani whom he loved Gilgamesh set out on his journey and in time reached a mountain chasm Gazing on the rugged heights he beheld fierce lions and his heart trembled

6458_61323_000039_000004	train-clean-360	When Gilgamesh beheld them he swooned with terror

6458_61323_000040_000000	train-clean-360	When Gilgamesh revived he realized that the monsters regarded him with eyes of sympathy 
none	none	Addressing the scorpion giant he told that he desired to visit his ancestor Pir napishtim who sat in the council of the gods and had divine attributes The giant warned him of the dangers which he would encounter saying that the mountain passage was twelve miles long and beamless and black 
6458_61323_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Gilgamesh however resolved to encounter any peril for he was no longer afraid and he was allowed to go forward 
none	none	So he entered through the monster guarded mountain door and plunged into thick unbroken darkness For twice twelve hours he groped blindly onward until he saw a ray of light Quickening his steps he then escaped from the dreadful tunnel and once more rejoiced in the rays of the sun He found himself in an enchanted garden and in the midst of it he saw a divine and beautiful tree towards which he hastened On its gleaming branches hung clusters of precious stones and its leaves were of lapis lazuli His eyes were dazzled but he did not linger there 
6458_61323_000040_000009	train-clean-360	Passing many other wonderful trees he came to a shoreland and he knew that he was drawing nigh to the Sea of Death 
none	none	The country which he entered was ruled over by the sea lady whose name was Sabitu When she saw the pilgrim drawing nigh she entered her palace and shut the door Gilgamesh called out requesting that he should be allowed to enter and mingled his entreaties with threats to break open the door In the end Sabitu appeared and spoke saying Gilgamesh whither hurriest thou The life that thou seekest thou wilt not find When the gods created man They fixed death for mankind Life they took in their own hand Thou O Gilgamesh let thy belly be filled Day and night be merry Daily celebrate a feast Day and night dance and make merry Clean be thy clothes Thy head be washed bathe in water Look joyfully on the child that grasps thy hand Be happy with the wife in thine arms two hundred eleven

human thought and sent their ideas rippling in widening circles to far distant shores CHAPTER IX DELUGE LEGEND THE ISLAND OF THE BLESSED AND HADES Babylonian Story of the Flood The Two Immortals on the Island of the Blessed Deluge Legends in the Old and New Worlds How Babylonian Culture reached India Theory of Cosmic Periods Gilgamesh resembles the Indian Yama and Persian Yimeh Links with Varuna and Mitra The Great Winter in Persian and Teutonic Mythologies Babylonian Hades compared with the Egyptian Greek Indian Teutonic and Celtic Otherworlds Legend of Nergal and the Queen of Death Underworld originally the Grave Why Weapons c were Buried with the Dead Japanese and Roman Beliefs Palaeolithic Burial Customs Our Graves are our Houses Importance of Babylonian Funerary Ceremonies Doctrine of Eternal Bliss in Egypt and India Why Suppressed in Babylonia Heavy Burial Fees Various Burial Customs The story of the Deluge which was related to Gilgamesh by Pir napishtim runs as follows Hear me O Gilgamesh and I will make revelation regarding the hidden doings of the high gods As thou knowest the city of Shurippak is situated upon the bank of the Euphrates The gods were within it there they assembled together in council Anu the father was there and Bel the counsellor and warrior Ninip the messenger and Ennugi the governor Ea the wise lord sat also with them In their hearts the gods agreed together to send a great deluge Thereafter Ea made known the purpose of the divine rulers in the hut of reeds saying two hundred twenty four O hut of reeds hear O wall understand O man of Shurippak son of Umbara Tutu tear down thy house and build a ship leave all thou dost possess and save thy life and preserve in the ship the living seed of every kind The ship that thou wilt build must be of goodly proportions in length and height It must be floated on the great deep I heard the command of Ea and understood and I made answer saying O wise lord as thou hast said so will I do for thy counsel is most excellent But how shall I give reason for my doings to the young men and the elders Ea opened his mouth and said unto me his servant What thou shalt say unto them is this It hath been revealed unto me that Bel doth hate me therefore I cannot remain any longer in his domain this city of Shurippak so I must depart unto the domain of Ea and dwell with him Unto you will Bel send abundance of rain so that you may obtain birds and fishes in plenty and have a rich harvest But Shamash hath appointed a time for Ramman to pour down destruction from the heavens two hundred twenty five Ea then gave instructions to Pir napishtim how to build the ship in which he should find refuge So far as can be gathered from the fragmentary text it appears that this vessel was to have a deck house six stories high with nine apartments in each story According to another account Ea drew a plan of the great ship upon the sand Pir napishtim set to work and made a flat bottomed vessel which was one hundred twenty cubits wide and one hundred twenty cubits in height He smeared it with bitumen inside and pitch outside and on the seventh day it was ready Then he carried out Ea s further instructions Continuing his narrative to Gilgamesh he said I gathered together all that I possessed my silver and gold and seeds of every kind and my goods also These I placed in the ship Then I caused to go aboard all my family and house servants the animals of the field and the beasts of the field and the workers every one of them I sent up The god Shamash appointed the time saying I will cause the Night Lord to send much rain and bring destruction Then enter thou the ship and shut thy door At the appointed time the Night Lord sent at even time much rain I saw the beginning of the deluge and I was afraid to look up I entered the ship and shut the door I appointed Buzur Kurgala the sailor to be captain and put under his command the great vessel and all that it contained At the dawn of day I saw rising athwart the heavens a dark cloud and in the midst of it Ramman thundered Nebo and Merodach went in front speeding like emissaries over hills and plains The cables of the ship were let loose Then Ninip the tempest god came nigh and the storm broke in fury before him All the earth spirits leapt up with flaming torches and the whole land was aflare The thunder god swept over the heavens blotting out the sunlight and bringing thick darkness Rain poured down the whole day long and the earth was covered with water the rivers were swollen the land was in confusion men stumbled about in the darkness battling with the elements Brothers were unable to see brothers no man could recognize his friends The spirits above looked down and beheld the rising flood and were afraid they fled away and in the heaven of Anu they crouched like to hounds in the protecting enclosures In time Ishtar the lady of the gods cried out distressfully saying The elder race hath perished and turned to clay because that I have consented to evil counsel in the assembly of the gods Alas I have allowed my people to be destroyed I gave being to man but where is he Like the offspring of fish he cumbers the deep The earth spirits were weeping with Ishtar they sat down cowering with tightened lips and spake not they mourned in silence Six days and six nights went past and the tempest raged over the waters which gradually covered the land But when the seventh day came the wind fell the whirling waters grew peaceful and the sea retreated The storm was over and the rain of destruction had ceased I looked forth I called aloud over the waters But all mankind had perished and turned to clay Where fields had been I saw marshes only Then I opened wide the window of the ship and the sunlight suffused my countenance I was dazzled and sank down weeping and the tears streamed over my face Everywhere I looked I saw water At length land began to appear The ship drifted towards the country of Nitsir and then it was held fast by the mountain of Nitsir Six days went past and the ship remained stedfast On the seventh day I sent forth a dove and she flew away and searched this way and that but found no resting place so she returned I then sent forth a swallow and she returned likewise Next I sent forth a raven and she flew away She saw that the waters were shrinking and gorged and croaked and waded but did not come back Then I brought forth all the animals into the air of heaven An offering I made on the mountain I poured out a libation I set up incense vessels seven by seven on heaped up reeds and used cedar wood with incense The gods smelt the sweet savour and they clustered like flies about the sacrificer Thereafter Ishtar Sirtu drew nigh Lifting up the jewels which the god Anu had fashioned for her according to her desire she spake saying Oh these gods I vow by the lapis lazuli gems upon my neck that I will never forget I will remember these days for ever and ever Let all the gods come hither to the offering save Bel Enlil alone because that he ignored my counsel and sent a great deluge which destroyed my people But Bel Enlil came also and when he beheld the ship he paused His heart was filled with wrath against the gods and the spirits of heaven Angrily he spake and said Hath one escaped It was decreed that no human being should survive the deluge Ninip son of Bel spoke saying Who hath done this save Ea alone He knoweth all things Ea god of the deep opened his mouth and said unto the warrior Bel Thou art the lord of the gods O warrior But thou wouldst not hearken to my counsel and caused the deluge to be Now punish the sinner for his sins and the evil doer for his evil deed but be merciful and do not destroy all mankind May there never again be a flood Let the lion come and men will decrease May there never again be a flood Let the leopard come and men will decrease May there never again be a flood Let famine come upon the land let Ura god of pestilence come and snatch off mankind I did not reveal the secret purpose of the mighty gods but I caused Atra chasis Pir napishtim to dream a dream in which he had knowledge of what the gods had decreed Having pondered a time over these words Bel entered the ship alone He grasped my hand and led me forth even me and he led forth my wife also and caused her to kneel down beside me Then he stood between us and gave his blessing He spoke saying In time past Pir napishtim was a man Henceforth Pir napishtim and his wife will be like unto deities even us Let them dwell apart beyond the river mouths Thereafter Bel carried me hither beyond the mouths of rivers Flood myths are found in many mythologies both in the Old World and the New The violent and deceitful men of the mythical Bronze Age of Greece were destroyed by a flood It is related that Zeus said on one occasion to Hermes I will send a great rain such as hath not been since the making of the world and the whole race of men shall perish I am weary of their iniquity For receiving with hospitable warmth these two gods in human guise Deucalion an old man and his wife Pyrrha were spared however Zeus instructed his host to build an ark of oak and store it well with food When this was done the couple entered the vessel and shut the door Then Zeus broke up all the fountains of the deep and opened the well springs of heaven and it rained for forty days and forty nights continually The Bronze folk perished not even those who fled to the hilltops could escape The ark rested on Parnassus and when the waters ebbed the old couple descended the mountain and took up their abode in a cave two hundred twenty six In Indian mythology the world is destroyed by a flood at the end of each Age of the Universe There are four ages the Krita or Perfect Age the Treta Age the Dwapara Age and the Kali or Wicked Age These correspond closely to the Greek and Celtic ages two hundred twenty seven There are also references in Sanskrit literature to the destruction of the world because too many human beings lived upon it When the increase of population had been so frightful a sage related the Earth oppressed with the excessive burden sank down for a hundred Yojanas Suffering pain in all her limbs and being deprived of her senses by excessive pressure the Earth in distress sought the protection of Narayana the foremost of the gods two hundred twenty eight Manu s account of the flood has been already referred to Chapter II The god in fish shape informed him The time is ripe for purging the world Build a strong and massive ark and furnish it with a long rope When the waters rose the horned fish towed the ark over the roaring sea until it grounded on the highest peak of the Himavat which is still called Naubandha the harbour Manu was accompanied by seven rishis two hundred twenty nine In the Celtic Irish account of the flood Cessair granddaughter of Noah was refused a chamber for herself in the ark and fled to the western borders of the world as advised by her idol two hundred thirty Her fleet consisted of three ships but two foundered before Ireland was reached The survivors in addition to Cessair were her father Bith two other men Fintan and Ladru and fifty women All of these perished on the hills except Fintan who slept on the crest of a great billow and lived to see Partholon the giant arriving from Greece There is a deluge also in Egyptian mythology When Ra the sun god grew old as an earthly king men began to mutter words against him He called the gods together and said I will not slay them his subjects until I have heard what ye say concerning them Nu his father who was the god of primeval waters advised the wholesale destruction of mankind Said Ra Behold men flee unto the hills their heart is full of fear because of that which they said The goddess Hathor Sekhet the Eye of Ra then went forth and slew mankind on the hills Thereafter Ra desiring to protect the remnant of humanity caused a great offering to be made to the goddess consisting of corn beer mixed with herbs and human blood This drink was poured out during the night And the goddess came in the morning she found the fields inundated she rejoiced thereat she drank thereof her heart was rejoiced she went about drunken and took no more cognizance of men two hundred thirty one It is obvious that the Egyptian myth refers to the annual inundation of the Nile the human blood in the beer being the blood of the slain corn god or of his earthly representative It is probable that the flood legends of North and South America similarly reflected local phenomena although the possibility that they were of Asiatic origin like the American Mongoloid tribes cannot be overlooked Whether or not Mexican civilization which was flourishing about the time of the battle of Hastings received any cultural stimulus from Asia is a question regarding which it would be unsafe to dogmatize owing to the meagre character of the available data The Mexican deluge was caused by the water sun which suddenly discharged the moisture it had been drawing from the earth in the form of vapour through long ages All life was destroyed A flood legend among the Nahua tribes resembles closely the Babylonian story as told by Pir napishtim The god Titlacahuan instructed a man named Nata to make a boat by hollowing out a cypress tree so as to escape the coming deluge with his wife Nena This pair escaped destruction They offered up a fish sacrifice in the boat and enraged the deity who visited them displaying as much indignation as did Bel when he discovered that Pir napishtim had survived the great disaster Nata and Nena had been instructed to take with them one ear of maize only which suggests that they were harvest spirits In Brazil Monan the chief god sent a great fire to burn up the world and its wicked inhabitants To extinguish the flames a magician caused so much rain to fall that the earth was flooded The Californian Indians had a flood legend and believed that the early race was diminutive and the Athapascan Indians of the north west professed to be descendants of a family who escaped the deluge Indeed deluge myths were widespread in the New World The American belief that the first beings who were created were unable to live on earth was shared by the Babylonians According to Berosus the first creation was a failure because the animals could not bear the light and they all died two hundred thirty two Here we meet with the germs of the Doctrine of the World s Ages which reached its highest development in Indian Greek and Celtic Irish mythologies The Biblical account of the flood is familiar to readers It forms says Professor Pinches a good subject for comparison with the Babylonian account with which it agrees so closely in all the main points and from which it differs so much in many essential details two hundred thirty three The drift of Babylonian culture was not only directed westward towards the coast of Palestine and from thence to Greece during the Phoenician period but also eastward through Elam to the Iranian plateau and India Reference has already been made to the resemblances between early Vedic and Sumerian mythologies When the new songs of the Aryan invaders of India were being composed the sky and ocean god Varuna who resembles Ea Oannes and Mitra who links with Shamash were already declining in splendour Other cultural influences were at work Certain of the Aryan tribes for instance buried their dead in Varuna s house of clay while a growing proportion cremated their dead and worshipped Agni the fire god At the close of the Vedic period there were fresh invasions into middle India and the late comers introduced new beliefs including the doctrines of the Transmigration of Souls and of the Ages of the Universe Goddesses also rose into prominence and the Vedic gods became minor deities and subject to Brahma Vishnu and Shiva These late comers had undoubtedly been influenced by Babylonian ideas before they entered India In their Doctrine of the World s Ages or Yugas for instance we are forcibly reminded of the Euphratean ideas regarding space and time mister Robert Brown junr who is an authority in this connection shows that the system by which the Day of Brahma was calculated in India resembles closely an astronomical system which obtained in Babylonia where apparently the theory of cosmic periods had origin two hundred thirty four The various alien peoples however who came under the spell of Babylonian modes of thought did not remain in a state of intellectual bondage Thought was stimulated rather than arrested by religious borrowing and the development of ideas regarding the mysteries of life and death proceeded apace in areas over which the ritualistic and restraining priesthood of Babylonia exercised no sway As much may be inferred from the contrasting conceptions of the Patriarchs of Vedic and Sumerian mythologies Pir napishtim the Babylonian Noah and the semi divine Gilgamesh appear to be represented in Vedic mythology by Yama god of the dead Yama was the first man and like Gilgamesh he set out on a journey over mountains and across water to discover Paradise He is lauded in the Vedic hymns as the explorer of the path or way to the Land of the Pitris Fathers the Paradise to which the Indian uncremated dead walked on foot Yama never lost his original character He is a traveller in the Epics as in the Vedas two hundred thirty five Him who along the mighty heights departed Him who searched and spied the path for many Son of Vivasvat gatherer of the people Yama the King with sacrifices worship Rigveda x fourteen one two hundred thirty six To Yama mighty King be gifts and homage paid He was the first of men that died the first to brave Death s rapid rushing stream the first to point the road To heaven and welcome others to that bright abode Sir M Monier Williams Translation two hundred thirty seven Yama and his sister Yami were the first human pair They are identical with the Persian Celestial twins Yima and Yimeh Yima resembles Mitra Mithra Varuna the twin brother of Mitra in fact carries the noose associated with the god of death two hundred thirty eight The Indian Yama who was also called Pitripati lord of the fathers takes Mitra s place in the Paradise of Ancestors beside Varuna god of the sky and the deep He sits below a tree playing on a flute and drinking the Soma drink which gives immortality When the descendants of Yama reached Paradise they assumed shining forms refined and from all taint set free two hundred thirty nine In Persian mythology Yima says Professor Moulton reigns over a community which may well have been composed of his own descendants for he lived yet longer than Adam To render them immortal he gives them to eat forbidden food being deceived by the Daevas demons What was this forbidden food May we connect it with another legend whereby at the Regeneration Mithra is to make men immortal by giving them to eat the fat of the Ur Kuh the primeval cow from whose slain body according to the Aryan legends adopted by Mithraism mankind was first created Yima is punished for presumptuously grasping at immortality for himself and mankind on the suggestion of an evil power instead of waiting Ahura s good time Professor Moulton wonders if this story which he endeavours to reconstruct owed anything to Babylon Yima like the Babylonian Pir napishtim is also a revealer of the secrets of creation He was appointed to be Guardian Overseer Watcher over my Creation by Ahura the supreme god Three hundred years went past Then the earth became abounding Full of flocks and full of cattle Full of men of birds dogs likewise Full of fires all bright and blazing Nor did men flocks herds of cattle Longer find them places in it Jackson s Translation The earth was thereafter cloven with a golden arrow Yima then built a refuge in which mankind and the domesticated animals might find shelter during a terrible winter The picture says Professor Moulton strongly tempts us to recognize the influence of the Babylonian Flood Legend two hundred forty The Fimbul winter of Germanic mythology is also recalled Odin asks in one of the Icelandic Eddie poems What beings shall live when the long dread winter Comes o er the people of earth two hundred forty one In another Eddie poem the Voluspa the Vala tells of a Sword Age an Axe Age a Wind Age and a Wolf Age which is to come ere the world sinks After the battle of the gods and demons The sun is darkened earth sinks in the sea In time however a new world appears I see uprising a second time Earth from the Ocean green anew The waters fall on high the eagle Flies o er the fell and catches fish When the surviving gods return they will talk according to the Vala prophetess of the great world serpent Tiamat The fields will be sown and Balder will come two hundred forty two apparently as Tammuz came The association of Balder with corn suggests that like Nata of the Nahua tribes he was a harvest spirit among other things Leaving meantime the many problems which arise from consideration of the Deluge legends and their connection with primitive agricultural myths the attention of readers may be directed to the Babylonian conception of the Otherworld Pir napishtim who escaped destruction at the Flood resides in an Island Paradise which resembles the Greek Islands of the Blessed and the Irish Tir nan og or Land of the Young situated in the western ocean and identical with the British two hundred forty three island valley of Avilion Where falls not hail or rain or any snow Nor ever wind blows loudly but it lies Deep meadow d happy fair with orchard lawns And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea two hundred forty four Only two human beings were permitted to reside on the Babylonian island paradise however These were Pir napishtim and his wife Apparently Gilgamesh could not join them there His gods did not transport heroes and other favoured individuals to a happy isle or isles like those of the Greeks and Celts and Aryo Indians There was no Heaven for the Babylonian dead All mankind were doomed to enter the gloomy Hades of the Underworld the land of darkness and the shadow of death a land of darkness as darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order and where the light is darkness as Job exclaimed in the hour of despair lamenting his fate two hundred forty five This gloomy habitation of the dead resembles the Greek Hades the Teutonic Nifelhel and the Indian Put No detailed description of it has been found The references however in the Descent of Ishtar and the Gilgamesh epic suggest that it resembled the hidden regions of the Egyptians in which souls were tortured by demons who stabbed them plunged them in pools of fire and thrust them into cold outer darkness where they gnashed their teeth or into places of horror swarming with poisonous reptiles Ishtar was similarly tortured by the plague demon Namtar when she boldly entered the Babylonian Underworld to search for Tammuz Other sufferings were no doubt in store for her resembling those perhaps with which the giant maid in the Eddic poem Skirnismal was threatened when she refused to marry Frey the god of fertility and harvest Trolls shall torment thee from morn till eve In the realms of the Jotun race Each day to the dwellings of Frost giants must thou Creep helpless creep hopeless of love Thou shalt weeping have in the stead of joy And sore burden bear with tears May madness and shrieking bondage and yearning Burden thee with bondage and tears two hundred forty six In like manner too the inhabitants of the Indian Hell suffered endless and complicated tortures two hundred forty seven The Persephone of the Babylonian Underworld was Eresh ki gal who was also called Allatu A myth which was found among the Egyptian Tel el Amarna Letters sets forth that on one occasion the Babylonian gods held a feast All the deities attended it except Eresh ki gal She was unable to leave her gloomy Underworld and sent her messenger the plague demon Namtar to obtain her share The various deities honoured Namtar except Nergal by standing up to receive him When Eresh ki gal was informed of this slight she became very angry and demanded that Nergal should be delivered up to her so that he might be put to death The storm god at once hastened to the Underworld accompanied by his own group of fierce demons whom he placed as guardians at the various doors so as to prevent the escape of Eresh ki gal Then he went boldly towards the goddess clutched her by the hair and dragged her from her throne After a brief struggle she found herself overpowered Nergal made ready to cut off her head but she cried for mercy and said Do not kill me my brother Let me speak to thee This appeal indicated that she desired to ransom her life like the hags in the European folk tales so Nergal unloosed his hold Then Eresh ki gal continued Be thou my husband and I will be thy wife On thee I confer sovereignty over the wide earth giving thee the tablet of wisdom Thou shalt be my lord and I will be thy lady Nergal accepted these terms by kissing the goddess Affectionately drying her tears he spoke saying Thou shalt now have from me what thou hast demanded during these past months In other words Nergal promises to honour her as she desired after becoming her husband and equal In the Descent of Ishtar the Babylonian Underworld is called Cuthah This city had a famous cemetery like Abydos in Egypt where many pious and orthodox worshippers sought sepulture The local god was Nergal who symbolized the destructive power of the sun and the sand storm he was a gloomy vengeful deity attended by the spirits of tempest weariness pestilence and disease and was propitiated because he was dreaded In Nether Cuthah as Ea bani informed Gilgamesh the worm devoured the dead amidst the dust and thick darkness It is evident that this Underworld was modelled on the grave In early times men believed that the spirits of the dead hovered in or about the place of sepulture They were therefore provided with houses to protect them in the same manner as the living were protected in their houses above the ground The enemies of the human ghosts were the earth spirits Weapons were laid beside the dead in their graves so that they might wage war against demons when necessary The corpse was also charmed against attack by the magical and protecting ornaments which were worn by the living necklaces armlets ear rings c Even face paint was provided probably as a charm against the evil eye and other subtle influences So long as corpses were left in their graves the spirits of the dead were it would appear believed to be safe But they required food and refreshment Food vessels and drinking urns were therefore included in the funerary furniture and the dead were given food offerings at regular intervals Once a year the living held feasts in the burial ground and invited the ghosts to share in the repast This custom was observed in Babylonia and is not yet obsolete in Egypt Moslems and Coptic Christians alike hold annual all night feasts in their cemeteries The Japanese Land of Yomi is similarly an underworld or great grave where ghosts mingle with the demons of disease and destruction Souls reach it by the pass of Yomi The Mikado however may be privileged to ascend to heaven and join the gods in the Eternal Land Among the ancient Romans the primitive belief survived that the spirit of the dead just sank into the earth where it rested and returned from time to time to the upper world through certain openings in the ground mundi whose solemn uncovering was one of the regular observances of the festal calendar two hundred forty eight According to Babylonian belief the dead who were not properly buried roamed through the streets searching for food eating refuse and drinking impure water Prior to the period of ceremonial burials the dead were interred in the houses in which they had lived a custom which has made it possible for present day scientists to accumulate much valuable data regarding primitive races and their habits of life The Palaeolithic cave dwellers of Europe were buried in their caves These were then deserted and became the haunts of wild animals After a long interval a deserted cave was occupied by strangers In certain characteristic caves the various layers containing human remains represent distinct periods of the vast Pleistocene Age When Mediterranean man moved northward through Europe he utilized some of these caves and constructed in them well built graves for his dead digging down through older layers In thus making a house within a house he has provided us with a link between an old custom and a new Apparently he was influenced by local practices and beliefs for he met and mingled in certain localities with the men of the Late Palaeolithic Age The primitive house burial rite is referred to in the Ethiopic version of the life of Alexander the Great The Two horned as the hero was called conversed with Brahmans when he reached India He spoke to one of them saying Have ye no tombs wherein to bury any man among ye who may die And an interpreter made answer to him saying Man and woman and child grow up and arrive at maturity and become old and when any one of them dieth we bury him in the place wherein he lived thus our graves are our houses And our God knoweth that we desire this more than the lust for food and meat which all men have this is our life and manner of living in the darkness of our tombs When Alexander desired to make a gift to these Brahmans and asked them what they desired most their answer was Give us immortality two hundred forty nine In the Gilgamesh epic the only ray of hope which relieves the gloomy closing passages is Ea bani s suggestion that the sufferings endured by the dead may be alleviated by the performance of strict burial rites Commenting on this point Professor Jastrow says A proper burial with an affectionate care of the corpse ensures at least a quiet repose Such a one rests on a couch and drinks pure water But he whose shade has no rest in the earth as I have seen and you will see His shade has no rest in the earth Whose shade no one cares for What is left over in the pot remains of food That are thrown in the street he eats two hundred fifty Gilgamesh Epic By disseminating the belief that the dead must be buried with much ceremony the priests secured great power over the people and extracted large fees In Egypt on the other hand the teachers of the sun cult sold charms and received rewards to perform ceremonies so that chosen worshippers might enter the sun barque of Ra while the Osirian priests promised the just and righteous that they would reach an agricultural Paradise where they could live and work as on earth but receive a greater return for their labour the harvests of the Otherworld being of unequalled abundance In the sacred books of India a number of Paradises are referred to No human beings however entered the Paradise of Varuna who resembles the Sumerian Ea Oannes The souls of the dead found rest and enjoyment in the Paradise of Yama while those kings that yield up their lives without turning their backs on the field of battle attain as the sage told a hero to the mansion of Indra which recalls the Valhal of Odin It will thus be seen that belief in immortality was a tenet of the Indian cults of Indra and Yama It is possible that the Gilgamesh epic in one of its forms concluded when the hero reached the island of Pir napishtim like the Indian Yama who searched and spied the path for many The Indian Land of the Pitris Ancestors over which Yama presided may be compared to the Egyptian heaven of Osiris It contains we are told all kinds of enjoyable articles and also sweet juicy agreeable and delicious edibles floral wreaths of the most delicious fragrance and trees that yield fruits that are desired of them Thither go all sinners among human beings as also those that have died during the winter solstice two hundred fifty one a suggestion that this Paradise was not unconnected with the Tammuz like deity who took up his abode in the spirit land during the barren season The view may be urged that in the Gilgamesh epic we have a development of the Tammuz legend in its heroic form Like Ishtar when she descended to Hades the King of Erech could not return to earth until he had been sprinkled by the water of life No doubt an incident of this character occurred also in the original Tammuz legend The life of the god had to be renewed before he could return Did he slumber like one of the Seven Sleepers in Ea s house and not awake again until he arrived as a child in his crescent moon boat the sunken boat of the hymns like Scef who came over the waves to the land of the Scyldings It seems remarkable that the doctrine of Eternal Bliss which obtained in Egypt on the one hand and in India on the other should never have been developed among the Babylonians Of course our knowledge in this connection is derived from the orthodox religious texts Perhaps the great thinkers whose influence can be traced in the tendencies towards monotheism which became marked at various periods believed in a Heaven for the just and good If they did their teachings must have been suppressed by the mercenary priests It was extremely profitable for these priests to perpetuate the belief that the spirits of the dead were consigned to a gloomy Hades where the degree of suffering which they endured depended on the manner in which their bodies were disposed of upon earth An orthodox funeral ceremony was costly at all times This is made evident by the inscriptions which record the social reforms of Urukagina the ill fated patesi of Lagash When he came to the throne he cut down the burial fees by more than a half In the case of an ordinary burial writes mister King when a corpse was laid in a grave it had been the custom for the presiding priest to demand as a fee for himself seven urns of wine or strong drink four hundred and twenty loaves of bread one hundred and twenty measures of corn a garment a kid a bed and a seat The reformer reduced the perquisites to three urns of wine eighty loaves of bread a bed and a kid while the fee of his the priest s assistant was cut down from sixty to thirty measures of corn two hundred fifty two The conservative element in Babylonian religion is reflected by the burial customs These did not change greatly after the Neolithic period Prehistoric Sumerian graves resemble closely those of pre Dynastic Egypt The bodies of the dead were laid on their sides in crouching posture with a beaker or drinking cup urn beside the right hand Other vessels were placed near the head In this connection it may be noted that the magic food prepared for Gilgamesh by Pir napishtim s wife when he lay asleep was also placed near his head The corpse was always decked with various ornaments including rings necklaces and armlets As has been indicated these were worn by the living as charms and no doubt they served the same purpose for the dead This charm wearing custom was condemned by the Hebrew teachers On one occasion Jacob commanded his household to put away the strange gods which were in their hand and all the ear rings which were in their ears and Jacob buried them under the oak which was by Shechem two hundred fifty three To Jacob personal ornaments had quite evidently an idolatrous significance A very typical class of grave furniture writes mister King consisted of palettes or colour dishes made of alabaster often of graceful shape and sometimes standing on four feet There is no doubt as to their use for colour still remains in many of them generally black and yellow but sometimes a light rose and light green Palettes for face paint have also been found in many early Egyptian graves The gods had their faces painted like the living and the dead and were similarly adorned with charms In the course of the daily service in the Egyptian temples an important ceremony was dressing the god with white green bright red and dark red sashes and supplying two kinds of ointment and black and green eye paint two hundred fifty four In the word picture of the Aryo Indian Varuna s heaven in the Mahabharata the deity is depicted attired in celestial robes and decked with celestial ornaments and jewels His attendants the Adityas appear adorned with celestial garlands and perfumed with celestial scents and besmeared with paste of celestial fragrance two hundred fifty five Apparently the paste like the face paint of the Babylonians and Egyptians had protective qualities The Picts of Scotland may have similarly painted themselves to charm their bodies against magical influences and the weapons of their enemies A painted man was probably regarded as one who was likely to have good luck being guarded against bad luck Weapons and implements were also laid in the Sumerian graves indicating a belief that the spirits of the dead could not only protect themselves against their enemies but also provide themselves with food The funerary gifts of fish hooks suggests that spirits were expected to catch fish and thus obtain clean food instead of returning to disturb the living as they searched for the remnants of the feast like the Scottish Gunna perched alone On a chilly old grey stone Nibbling nibbling at a bone That we ll maybe throw away Some bodies which were laid in Sumerian graves were wrapped up in reed matting a custom which suggests that the reeds afforded protection or imparted magical powers Magical ceremonies were performed in Babylonian reed huts As we have seen Ea revealed the purpose of the gods when they resolved to send a flood by addressing the reed hut in which Pir napishtim lay asleep Possibly it was believed that the dead might also have visions in their dreams which would reveal the purpose of demons who were preparing to attack them In Syria it was customary to wrap the dead in a sheep skin two hundred fifty six As priests and gods were clad in the skins of animals from which their powers were derived it is probable that the dead were similarly supposed to receive inspiration in their skin coverings The Highland seer was wrapped in a bull s skin and left all night beside a stream so as to obtain knowledge of the future This was a form of the Taghairm ceremony which is referred to by Scott in his Lady of the Lake two hundred fifty seven The belief in the magical influence of sacred clothing gave origin to the priestly robes When David desired to ascertain what Saul intended to do he said Bring hither the ephod Then he came to know that his enemy had resolved to attack Keilah two hundred fifty eight Elisha became a prophet when he received Elijah s mantle two hundred fifty nine Sometimes the bodies of the Sumerians were placed in sarcophagi of clay The earlier type was of bath tub shape round and flat bottomed with a rounded lid while the later was the slipper shaped coffin which was ornamented with charms There is a close resemblance between the bath tub coffins of Sumeria and the Egyptian pottery coffins of oval shape found in Third and Fourth Dynasty tombs in rock chambers near Nuerat Certain designs on wooden coffins and tombs as early as the First Dynasty have direct analogies in Babylonia two hundred sixty No great tombs were erected in Sumeria The coffins were usually laid in brick vaults below dwellings or below temples or in trenches outside the city walls On the stele of victory which belongs to the period of Eannatum patesi of Lagash the dead bodies on the battlefield are piled up in pairs quite naked and earth is being heaped over them this is a specimen of mound burial According to Herodotus the Babylonians buried their dead in honey and had funeral lamentations like the Egyptians two hundred sixty one The custom of preserving the body in this manner does not appear to have been an ancient one and may have resulted from cultural contact with the Nile valley during the late Assyrian period So long as the bones were undisturbed the spirit was supposed to be assured of rest in the Underworld This archaic belief was widespread and finds an echo in the quaint lines over Shakespeare s grave in Stratford church Good friend for Jesus sake forbeare To dig the dust enclosed heare Blest be the man that spares these stones And curst be he that moves my bones In Babylonia the return of the spirits of the dead was greatly dreaded Ishtar once uttered the terrible threat I will cause the dead to rise they will then eat and live The dead will be more numerous than the living When a foreign country was invaded it was a common custom to break open the tombs and scatter the bones they contained Probably it was believed when such acts of vandalism were committed that the offended spirits would plague their kinsfolk Ghosts always haunted the homes they once lived in and were as malignant as demons It is significant to find in this connection that the bodies of enemies who were slain in battle were not given decent burial but mutilated and left for birds and beasts of prey to devour The demons that plagued the dead might also attack the living A fragmentary narrative which used to be referred to as the Cuthean Legend of Creation two hundred sixty two and has been shown by mister L W King to have no connection with the struggle between Merodach and the dragon two hundred sixty three deals with a war waged by an ancient king against a horde of evil spirits led by the lord of heights lord of the Anunaki earth spirits Some of the supernatural warriors had bodies like birds others had raven faces and all had been suckled by Tiamat For three years the king sent out great armies to attack the demons but none returned alive Then he decided to go forth himself to save his country from destruction So he prepared for the conflict and took the precaution of performing elaborate and therefore costly religious rites so as to secure the company operation of the gods His expedition was successful for he routed the supernatural army On his return home he recorded his great victory on tablets which were placed in the shrine of Nergal at Cuthah This myth may be an echo of Nergal s raid against Eresh ki gal Or being associated with Cuthah it may have been composed to encourage burial in that city s sacred cemetery which had been cleared by the famous old king of the evil demons which tormented the dead and made seasonal attacks against the living CHAPTER X BUILDINGS AND LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF BABYLON Decline and Fall of Sumerian Kingdoms Elamites and Semites strive for Supremacy Babylon s Walls Gates Streets and Canals The Hanging Gardens Merodach s Great Temple The Legal Code of Hammurabi The Marriage Market Position of Women Marriage brought Freedom Vestal Virgins Breach of Promise and Divorce Rights of Children Female Publicans The Land Laws Doctors legislated out of Existence Folk Cures Spirits of Disease expelled by Magical Charms The Legend of the Worm Touch Iron Curative Water Magical Origin of Poetry and Music The rise of Babylon inaugurated a new era in the history of Western Asia Coincidentally the political power of the Sumerians came to an end It had been paralysed by the Elamites who towards the close of the Dynasty of Isin successfully overran the southern district and endeavoured to extend their sway over the whole valley Two Elamite kings Warad Sin and his brother Rim Sin struggled with the rulers of Babylon for supremacy and for a time it appeared as if the intruders from the East were to establish themselves permanently as a military aristocracy over Sumer and Akkad But the Semites were strongly reinforced by new settlers of the same blended stock who swarmed from the land of the Amorites Once again Arabia was pouring into Syria vast hordes of its surplus population with the result that ethnic disturbances were constant and widespread This migration is termed the Canaanitic or Amorite it flowed into Mesopotamia and across Assyria while it supplied the driving power which secured the ascendancy of the Hammurabi Dynasty at Babylon Indeed the ruling family which came into prominence there is believed to have been of Canaanitic origin Once Babylon became the metropolis it retained its pre eminence until the end Many political changes took place during its long and chequered history but no rival city in the south ever attained to its splendour and greatness Whether its throne was occupied by Amorite or Kassite Assyrian or Chaldean it was invariably found to be the most effective centre of administration for the lower Tigro Euphrates valley Some of the Kassite monarchs however showed a preference for Nippur Of its early history little is known It was overshadowed in turn by Kish and Umma Lagash and Erech and may have been little better than a great village when Akkad rose into prominence Sargon I the royal gardener appears to have interested himself in its development for it was recorded that he cleared its trenches and strengthened its fortifications The city occupied a strategic position and probably assumed importance on that account as well as a trading and industrial centre Considerable wealth had accumulated at Babylon when the Dynasty of Ur reached the zenith of its power It is recorded that King Dungi plundered its famous Temple of the High Head E sagila which some identify with the Tower of Babel so as to secure treasure for Ea s temple at Eridu which he specially favoured His vandalistic raid like that of the Gutium or men of Kutu was remembered for long centuries afterwards and the city god was invoked at the time to cut short his days No doubt Hammurabi s Babylon closely resembled the later city so vividly described by Greek writers although it was probably not of such great dimensions According to Herodotus it occupied an exact square on the broad plain and had a circumference of sixty of our miles While such is its size the historian wrote in magnificence there is no other city that approaches to it Its walls were eighty seven feet thick and three hundred and fifty feet high and each side of the square was fifteen miles in length The whole city was surrounded by a deep broad canal or moat and the river Euphrates ran through it Here continued Herodotus I may not omit to tell the use to which the mould dug out of the great moat was turned nor the manner in which the wall was wrought As fast as they dug the moat the soil which they got from the cutting was made into bricks and when a sufficient number were completed they baked the bricks in kilns Then they set to building and began with bricking the borders of the moat after which they proceeded to construct the wall itself using throughout for their cement hot bitumen and interposing a layer of wattled reeds at every thirtieth course of the bricks On the top along the edges of the wall they constructed buildings of a single chamber facing one another leaving between them room for a four horse chariot to turn In the circuit of the wall are a hundred gates all of brass with brazen lintels and side posts two hundred sixty four These were the gates referred to by Isaiah when God called Cyrus I will loose the loins of kings to open before him the two leaved gates and the gates shall not be shut I will go before thee and make the crooked places straight I will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder the bars of iron two hundred sixty five The outer wall was the main defence of the city but there was also an inner wall less thick but not much inferior in strength In addition a fortress stood in each division of the city The king s palace and the temple of Bel Merodach were surrounded by walls All the main streets were perfectly straight and each crossed the city from gate to gate a distance of fifteen miles half of them being interrupted by the river which had to be ferried As there were twenty five gates on each side of the outer wall the great thoroughfares numbered fifty in all and there were six hundred and seventy six squares each over two miles in circumference From Herodotus we gather that the houses were three or four stories high suggesting that the tenement system was not unknown and according to Q Curtius nearly half of the area occupied by the city was taken up by gardens within the squares In Greek times Babylon was famous for the hanging or terraced gardens of the new palace which had been erected by Nebuchadnezzar II These occupied a square which was more than a quarter of a mile in circumference Great stone terraces resting on arches rose up like a giant stairway to a height of about three hundred and fifty feet and the whole structure was strengthened by a surrounding wall over twenty feet in thickness So deep were the layers of mould on each terrace that fruit trees were grown amidst the plants of luxuriant foliage and the brilliant Asian flowers Water for irrigating the gardens was raised from the river by a mechanical contrivance to a great cistern situated on the highest terrace and it was prevented from leaking out of the soil by layers of reeds and bitumen and sheets of lead Spacious apartments luxuriously furnished and decorated were constructed in the spaces between the arches and were festooned by flowering creepers A broad stairway ascended from terrace to terrace The old palace stood in a square nearly four miles in circumference and was strongly protected by three walls which were decorated by sculptures in low relief representing battle scenes and scenes of the chase and royal ceremonies Winged bulls with human heads guarded the main entrance Another architectural feature of the city was E sagila the temple of Bel Merodach known to the Greeks as Jupiter Belus The high wall which enclosed it had gates of solid brass In the middle of the precinct wrote Herodotus there was a tower of solid masonry a furlong in length and breadth upon which was raised a second tower and on that a third and so on up to eight The ascent to the top is on the outside by a path which winds round all the towers When one is about halfway up one finds a resting place and seats where persons are wont to sit some time on their way to the summit On the topmost tower there is a spacious temple and inside the temple stands a couch of unusual size richly adorned with a golden table by its side There is no statue of any kind set up in the place nor is the chamber occupied of nights by anyone but a single native woman who as the Chaldaeans the priests of this god affirm is chosen for himself by the deity out of all the women of the land A woman who was the wife of Amon also slept in that god s temple at Thebes in Egypt A similar custom was observed in Lycia Below in the same precinct continued Herodotus there is a second temple in which is a sitting figure of Jupiter all of gold Before the figure stands a large golden table and the throne whereon it sits and the base on which the throne is placed are likewise of pure gold Outside the temple are two altars one of solid gold on which it is only lawful to offer sucklings the other a common altar but of great size on which the full grown animals are sacrificed It is also on the great altar that the Chaldaeans burn the frankincense which is offered to the amount of a thousand talents weight every year at the festival of the god In the time of Cyrus there was likewise in this temple a figure of a man twelve cubits high entirely of solid gold Besides the ornaments which I have mentioned there are a large number of private offerings in this holy precinct two hundred sixty six The city wall and river gates were closed every night and when Babylon was besieged the people were able to feed themselves The gardens and small farms were irrigated by canals and canals also controlled the flow of the river Euphrates A great dam had been formed above the town to store the surplus water during inundation and increase the supply when the river sank to its lowest In Hammurabi s time the river was crossed by ferry boats but long ere the Greeks visited the city a great bridge had been constructed So completely did the fierce Sennacherib destroy the city that most of the existing ruins date from the period of Nebuchadnezzar II two hundred sixty seven Our knowledge of the social life of Babylon and the territory under its control is derived chiefly from the Hammurabi Code of laws of which an almost complete copy was discovered at Susa towards the end of nineteen oh one by the De Morgan expedition The laws were inscribed on a stele of black diorite seven fort three in high with a circumference at the base of six fort two in and at the top of five fort four in This important relic of an ancient law abiding people had been broken in three pieces but when these were joined together it was found that the text was not much impaired On one side are twenty eight columns and on the other sixteen Originally there were in all nearly four thousand lines of inscriptions but five columns comprising about three hundred lines had been erased to give space it is conjectured for the name of the invader who carried the stele away but unfortunately the record was never made On the upper part of the stele which is now one of the treasures of the Louvre Paris King Hammurabi salutes with his right hand reverently upraised the sun god Shamash seated on his throne at the summit of E sagila by whom he is being presented with the stylus with which to inscribe the legal code Both figures are heavily bearded but have shaven lips and chins The god wears a conical headdress and a flounced robe suspended from his left shoulder while the king has assumed a round dome shaped hat and a flowing garment which almost sweeps the ground It is gathered from the Code that there were three chief social grades the aristocracy which included landowners high officials and administrators the freemen who might be wealthy merchants or small landholders and the slaves The fines imposed for a given offence upon wealthy men were much heavier than those imposed upon the poor Lawsuits were heard in courts Witnesses were required to tell the truth affirming before the god what they knew and perjurers were severely dealt with a man who gave false evidence in connection with a capital charge was put to death A strict watch was also kept over the judges and if one was found to have willingly convicted a prisoner on insufficient evidence he was fined and degraded Theft was regarded as a heinous crime and was invariably punished by death Thieves included those who made purchases from minors or slaves without the sanction of elders or trustees Sometimes the accused was given the alternative of paying a fine which might exceed by ten or even thirty fold the value of the article or animal he had appropriated It was imperative that lost property should be restored If the owner of an article of which he had been wrongfully deprived found it in possession of a man who declared that he had purchased it from another evidence was taken in court When it happened that the seller was proved to have been the thief the capital penalty was imposed On the other hand the alleged purchaser was dealt with in like manner if he failed to prove his case Compensation for property stolen by a brigand was paid by the temple and the heirs of a man slain by a brigand within the city had to be compensated by the local authority Of special interest are the laws which relate to the position of women In this connection reference may first be made to the marriage by auction custom which Herodotus described as follows Once a year in each village the maidens of age to marry were collected all together into one place while the men stood round them in a circle Then a herald called up the damsels one by one and offered them for sale He began with the most beautiful When she was sold for no small sum of money he offered for sale the one who came next to her in beauty All of them were sold to be wives The richest of the Babylonians who wished to wed bid against each other for the loveliest maidens while the humbler wife seekers who were indifferent about beauty took the more homely damsels with marriage portions For the custom was that when the herald had gone through the whole number of the beautiful damsels he should then call up the ugliest a cripple if there chanced to be one and offer her to the men asking who would agree to take her with the smallest marriage portion And the man who offered to take the smallest sum had her assigned to him The marriage portions were furnished by the money paid for the beautiful damsels and thus the fairer maidens portioned out the uglier No one was allowed to give his daughter in marriage to the man of his choice nor might anyone carry away the damsel whom he had purchased without finding bail really and truly to make her his wife if however it turned out that they did not agree the money might be paid back All who liked might come even from distant villages and bid for the women two hundred sixty eight This custom is mentioned by other writers but it is impossible to ascertain at what period it became prevalent in Babylonia and by whom it was introduced Herodotus understood that it obtained also in the Illyrian tribe of the Eneti which was reputed to have entered Italy with Antenor after the fall of Troy and has been identified with the Venetians of later times But the ethnic clue thus afforded is exceedingly vague There is no direct reference to the custom in the Hammurabi Code which reveals a curious blending of the principles of Father right and Mother right A girl was subject to her father s will he could dispose of her as he thought best and she always remained a member of his family after marriage she was known as the daughter of so and so rather than the wife of so and so But marriage brought her freedom and the rights of citizenship The power vested in her father was never transferred to her husband A father had the right to select a suitable spouse for his daughter and she could not marry without his consent That this law did not prevent love matches is made evident by the fact that provision was made in the Code for the marriage of a free woman with a male slave part of whose estate in the event of his wife s death could be claimed by his master When a betrothal was arranged the father fixed the bride price which was paid over before the contract could be concluded and he also provided a dowry The amount of the bride price might however be refunded to the young couple to give them a start in life If during the interval between betrothal and marriage the man looked upon another woman and said to his father in law I will not marry your daughter he forfeited the bride price for breach of promise of marriage A girl might also obtain a limited degree of freedom by taking vows of celibacy and becoming one of the vestal virgins or nuns who were attached to the temple of the sun god She did not however live a life of entire seclusion If she received her due proportion of her father s estate she could make business investments within certain limits She was not for instance allowed to own a wineshop and if she even entered one she was burned at the stake Once she took these vows she had to observe them until the end of her days If she married as she might do to obtain the legal status of a married woman and enjoy the privileges of that position she denied her husband conjugal rites but provided him with a concubine who might bear him children as Sarah did to Abraham These nuns must not be confused with the unmoral women who were associated with the temples of Ishtar and other love goddesses of shady repute The freedom secured by a married woman had its legal limitations If she became a widow for instance she could not remarry without the consent of a judge to whom she was expected to show good cause for the step she proposed to take Punishments for breaches of the marriage law were severe Adultery was a capital crime the guilty parties were bound together and thrown into the river If it happened however that the wife of a prisoner went to reside with another man on account of poverty she was acquitted and allowed to return to her husband after his release In cases where no plea of poverty could be urged the erring women were drowned The wife of a soldier who had been taken prisoner by an enemy was entitled to a third part of her husband s estate if her son was a minor the remainder was held in trust The husband could enter into possession of all his property again if he happened to return home Divorce was easily obtained A husband might send his wife away either because she was childless or because he fell in love with another woman Incompatibility of temperament was also recognized as sufficient reason for separation A woman might hate her husband and wish to leave him If the Code sets forth she is careful and is without blame and is neglected by her husband who has deserted her she can claim release from the marriage contract But if she is found to have another lover and is guilty of neglecting her duties she is liable to be put to death A married woman possessed her own property Indeed the value of her marriage dowry was always vested in her When therefore she divorced her husband or was divorced by him she was entitled to have her dowry refunded and to return to her father s house Apparently she could claim maintenance from her father A woman could have only one husband but a man could have more than one wife He might marry a secondary wife or concubine because he was without offspring but the concubine the Code lays down shall not rank with the wife Another reason for second marriage recognized by law was a wife s state of health In such circumstances a man could not divorce his sickly wife He had to support her in his house as long as she lived Children were the heirs of their parents but if a man during his lifetime gifted his property to his wife and confirmed it on a sealed tablet the children could have no claim and the widow was entitled to leave her estate to those of her children she preferred but she could not will any portion of it to her brothers In ordinary cases the children of a first marriage shared equally the estate of a father with those of a second marriage If a slave bore children to her employer their right to inheritance depended on whether or not the father had recognized them as his offspring during his lifetime A father might legally disown his son if the young man was guilty of criminal practices The legal rights of a vestal virgin were set forth in detail If she had received no dowry from her father when she took vows of celibacy she could claim after his death one third of the portion of a son She could will her estate to anyone she favoured but if she died intestate her brothers were her heirs When however her estate consisted of fields or gardens allotted to her by her father she could not disinherit her legal heirs The fields or gardens might be worked during her lifetime by her brothers if they paid rent or she might employ a manager on the share system Vestal virgins and married women were protected against the slanderer Any man who pointed the finger against them unjustifiably was charged with the offence before a judge who could sentence him to have his forehead branded It was not difficult therefore in ancient Babylonia to discover the men who made malicious and unfounded statements regarding an innocent woman Assaults on women were punished according to the victim s rank even slaves were protected Women appear to have monopolized the drink traffic At any rate there is no reference to male wine sellers A female publican had to conduct her business honestly and was bound to accept a legal tender If she refused corn and demanded silver when the value of the silver by grand weight was below the price of corn she was prosecuted and punished by being thrown into the water Perhaps she was simply ducked As much may be inferred from the fact that when she was found guilty of allowing rebels to meet in her house she was put to death The land laws were strict and exacting A tenant could be penalized for not cultivating his holding properly The rent paid was a proportion of the crop but the proportion could be fixed according to the average yield of a district so that a careless or inefficient tenant had to bear the brunt of his neglect or want of skill The punishment for allowing a field to lie fallow was to make a man hoe and sow it and then hand it over to his landlord and this applied even to a man who leased unreclaimed land which he had contracted to cultivate Damage done to fields by floods after the rent was paid was borne by the cultivator but if it occurred before the corn was reaped the landlord s share was calculated in proportion to the amount of the yield which was recovered Allowance was also made for poor harvests when the shortage was not due to the neglect of the tenant but to other causes and no interest was paid for borrowed money even if the farm suffered from the depredations of the tempest god the moneylender had to share risks with borrowers Tenants who neglected their dykes however were not exempted from their legal liabilities and their whole estates could be sold to reimburse their creditors The industrious were protected against the careless Men who were negligent about controlling the water supply and caused floods by opening irrigation ditches which damaged the crops of their neighbours had to pay for the losses sustained the damages being estimated according to the average yield of a district A tenant who allowed his sheep to stray on to a neighbour s pasture had to pay a heavy fine in corn at the harvest season much in excess of the value of the grass cropped by his sheep Gardeners were similarly subject to strict laws All business contracts had to be conducted according to the provisions of the Code and in every case it was necessary that a proper record should be made on clay tablets As a rule a dishonest tenant or trader had to pay sixfold the value of the sum under dispute if the judge decided in court against his claim The law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth was strictly observed in Babylonia A freeman who destroyed an eye of a freeman had one of his own destroyed if he broke a bone he had a bone broken Fines were imposed however when a slave was injured For striking a gentleman a commoner received sixty lashes and the son who smote his father had his hands cut off A slave might have his ears cut off for assaulting his master s son Doctors must have found their profession an extremely risky one No allowance was made for what is nowadays known as a professional error A doctor s hands were cut off if he opened a wound with a metal knife and his patient afterwards died or if a man lost his eye as the result of an operation A slave who died under a doctor s hands had to be replaced by a slave and if a slave lost his eye the doctor had to pay half the man s market value to the owner Professional fees were fixed according to a patient s rank Gentlemen had to pay five shekels of silver to a doctor who set a bone or restored diseased flesh commoners three shekels and masters for their slaves two shekels There was also a scale of fees for treating domesticated animals and it was not over generous An unfortunate surgeon who undertook to treat an ox or ass suffering from a severe wound had to pay a quarter of its price to its owner if it happened to die A shrewd farmer who was threatened with the loss of an animal must have been extremely anxious to engage the services of a surgeon It is not surprising after reviewing this part of the Hammurabi Code to find Herodotus stating bluntly that the Babylonians had no physicians When a man is ill he wrote they lay him in the public square and the passers by come up to him and if they have ever had his disease themselves or have known anyone who has suffered from it they give him advice recommending him to do whatever they found good in their own case or in the case known to them and no one is allowed to pass the sick man in silence without asking him what his ailment is One might imagine that Hammurabi had legislated the medical profession out of existence were it not that letters have been found in the Assyrian library of Ashur banipal which indicate that skilled physicians were held in high repute It is improbable however that they were numerous The risks they ran in Babylonia may account for their ultimate disappearance in that country No doubt patients received some benefit from exposure in the streets in the sunlight and fresh air and perhaps too from some of the old wives remedies which were gratuitously prescribed by passers by In Egypt where certain of the folk cures were recorded on papyri quite effective treatment was occasionally given although the medicines were exceedingly repugnant as a rule ammonia for instance was taken with the organic substances found in farmyards Elsewhere some wonderful instances of excellent folk cures have come to light especially among isolated peoples who have received them interwoven in their immemorial traditions A medical man who has investigated this interesting subject in the Scottish Highlands has shown that the simple observation of the people was the starting point of our fuller knowledge however complete we may esteem it to be For dropsy and heart troubles foxglove broom tops and juniper berries which have reputations as old as the hills are the most reliable medicines in our scientific armoury at the present time These discoveries of the ancient folks have been merely elaborated in later days Ancient cures for indigestion are still in use Tar water which was a remedy for chest troubles especially for those of a consumptive nature has endless imitations in our day it was also the favourite remedy for skin diseases No doubt the present inhabitants of Babylonia who utilize bitumen as a germicide are perpetuating an ancient folk custom This medical man who is being quoted adds The whole matter may be summed up that we owe infinitely more to the simple nature study of our people in the great affair of health than we owe to all the later science two hundred sixty nine Herodotus commenting on the custom of patients taking a census of folk cures in the streets said it was one of the wisest institutions of the Babylonian people It is to be regretted that he did not enter into details regarding the remedies which were in greatest favour in his day His data would have been useful for comparative purposes So far as can be gathered from the clay tablets faith cures were not unknown and there was a good deal of quackery If surgery declined as a result of the severe restrictions which hampered progress in an honourable profession magic flourished like tropical fungi Indeed the worker of spells was held in high repute and his operations were in most cases allowed free play There are only two paragraphs in the Hammurabi Code which deal with magical practices It is set forth that if one man cursed another and the curse could not be justified the perpetrator of it must suffer the death penalty Provision was also made for discovering whether a spell had been legally imposed or not The victim was expected to plunge himself in a holy river If the river carried him away it was held as proved that he deserved his punishment and the layer of the spell was given possession of the victim s house A man who could swim was deemed to be innocent he claimed the residence of the layer of the spell who was promptly put to death With this interesting glimpse of ancient superstition the famous Code opens and then strikes a modern note by detailing the punishments for perjury and the unjust administration of law in the courts The poor sufferers who gathered at street corners in Babylon to make mute appeal for cures believed that they were possessed by evil spirits Germs of disease were depicted by lively imaginations as invisible demons who derived nourishment from the human body When a patient was wasted with disease growing thinner and weaker and more bloodless day by day it was believed that a merciless vampire was sucking his veins and devouring his flesh It had therefore to be expelled by performing a magical ceremony and repeating a magical formula The demon was either driven or enticed away A magician had to decide in the first place what particular demon was working evil He then compelled its attention and obedience by detailing its attributes and methods of attack and perhaps by naming it Thereafter he suggested how it should next act by releasing a raven so that it might soar towards the clouds like that bird or by offering up a sacrifice which it received for nourishment and as compensation Another popular method was to fashion a waxen figure of the patient and prevail upon the disease demon to enter it The figure was then carried away to be thrown in the river or burned in a fire Occasionally a quite effective cure was included in the ceremony As much is suggested by the magical treatment of toothache First of all the magician identified the toothache demon as the worm Then he recited its history which is as follows After Anu created the heavens the heavens created the earth the earth created the rivers the rivers created the canals the canals created the marshes and last of all the marshes created the worm This display of knowledge compelled the worm to listen and no doubt the patient was able to indicate to what degree it gave evidence of its agitated mind The magician continued Came the worm and wept before Shamash Before Ea came her tears What wilt thou give me for my food What wilt thou give me to devour One of the deities answered I will give thee dried bones and scented wood but the hungry worm protested Nay what are these dried bones of thine to me Let me drink among the teeth And set me on the gums That I may devour the blood of the teeth And of their gums destroy their strength Then shall I hold the bolt of the door The magician provided food for the worm and the following is his recipe Mix beer the plant sa kil bir and oil together put it on the tooth and repeat Incantation No doubt this mixture soothed the pain and the sufferer must have smiled gladly when the magician finished his incantation by exclaiming So must thou say this O Worm May Ea smite thee with the might of his fist two hundred seventy Headaches were no doubt much relieved when damp cloths were wrapped round a patient s head and scented wood was burned beside him while the magician in whom so much faith was reposed droned out a mystical incantation The curative water was drawn from the confluence of two streams and was sprinkled with much ceremony In like manner the evil eye curers who still operate in isolated districts in these islands draw water from under bridges over which the dead and the living pass two hundred seventy one and mutter charms and lustrate victims Headaches were much dreaded by the Babylonians They were usually the first symptoms of fevers and the demons who caused them were supposed to be bloodthirsty and exceedingly awesome According to the charms these invisible enemies of man were of the brood of Nergal No house could be protected against them They entered through keyholes and chinks of doors and windows they crept like serpents and stank like mice they had lolling tongues like hungry dogs Magicians baffled the demons by providing a charm If a patient touched iron meteoric iron which was the metal of heaven relief could be obtained Or perhaps the sacred water would dispel the evil one as the drops trickled from the patient s face so would the fever spirit trickle away When a pig was offered up in sacrifice as a substitute for a patient the wicked spirit was commanded to depart and allow a kindly spirit to take its place an indication that the Babylonians like the Germanic peoples believed that they were guarded by spirits who brought good luck The numerous incantations which were inscribed on clay tablets and treasured in libraries do not throw much light on the progress of medical knowledge for the genuine folk cures were regarded as of secondary importance and were not as a rule recorded But these metrical compositions are of special interest in so far as they indicate how poetry originated and achieved widespread popularity among ancient peoples Like the religious dance the earliest poems were used for magical purposes They were composed in the first place by men and women who were supposed to be inspired in the literal sense that is possessed by spirits Primitive man associated spirit with breath which was the air of life and identical with wind The poetical magician drew in a spirit and thus received inspiration as he stood on some sacred spot on the mountain summit amidst forest solitudes beside a whispering stream or on the sounding shore As Burns has sung The muse nae poet ever fand her Till by himsel he learn d to wander Adown some trottin burn s meander An no think lang O sweet to stray an pensive ponder A heart felt sang Or perhaps the bard received inspiration by drinking magic water from the fountain called Hippocrene or the skaldic mead which dripped from the moon The ancient poet did not sing for the mere love of singing he knew nothing about Art for Art s sake His object in singing appears to have been intensely practical The world was inhabited by countless hordes of spirits which were believed to be ever exercising themselves to influence mankind The spirits caused suffering they slew victims they brought misfortune they were also the source of good or luck Man regarded spirits emotionally he conjured them with emotion he warded off their attacks with emotion and his emotions were given rhythmical expression by means of metrical magical charms Poetic imagery had originally a magical significance if the ocean was compared to a dragon it was because it was supposed to be inhabited by a storm causing dragon the wind whispered because a spirit whispered in it Love lyrics were charms to compel the love god to wound or possess a maiden s heart to fill it as an Indian charm sets forth with the yearning of the Apsaras fairies satires conjured up evil spirits to injure a victim and heroic narratives chanted at graves were statements made to the god of battle so that he might award the mighty dead by transporting him to the Valhal of Odin or Swarga of Indra Similarly music had magical origin as an imitation of the voices of spirits of the piping birds who were Fates of the wind high and low of the thunder roll of the bellowing sea So the god Pan piped on his reed bird like notes Indra blew his thunder horn Thor used his hammer like a drumstick Neptune imitated on his wreathed horn the voice of the deep the Celtic oak god Dagda twanged his windy wooden harp and Angus the Celtic god of spring and love came through budding forest ways with a silvern harp which had strings of gold echoing the tuneful birds the purling streams the whispering winds and the rustling of scented fir and blossoming thorn Modern day poets and singers who voice their moods and cast the spell of their moods over readers and audiences are the representatives of ancient magicians who believed that moods were caused by the spirits which possessed them the rhythmical wind spirits those harpers of the forest and songsters of ocean The following quotations from mister R C Thompson s translations of Babylonian charms will serve to illustrate their poetic qualities Fever like frost hath come upon the land Fever hath blown upon the man as the wind blast It hath smitten the man and humbled his pride Headache lieth like the stars of heaven in the desert and hath no praise Pain in the head and shivering like a scudding cloud turn unto the form of man Headache whose course like the dread windstorm none knoweth Headache roareth over the desert blowing like the wind Flashing like lightning it is loosed above and below It cutteth off him who feareth not his god like a reed From amid mountains it hath descended upon the land Headache a rushing hag demon Granting no rest nor giving kindly sleep Whose shape is as the whirlwind Its appearance is as the darkening heavens And its face as the deep shadow of the forest Sickness breaking the fingers as a rope of wind Flashing like a heavenly star it cometh like the dew These early poets had no canons of Art and there were no critics to disturb their meditations Many singers had to sing and die ere a critic could find much to say In ancient times therefore poets had their Golden Age they were a law unto themselves Even the minors were influential members of society CHAPTER XI THE GOLDEN AGE OF BABYLONIA Rise of the Sun God Amorites and Elamites struggle for Ascendancy The Conquering Ancestors of Hammurabi Sumerian Cities Destroyed Widespread Race Movements Phoenician Migration from Persian Gulf Wanderings of Abraham and Lot Biblical References to Hittites and Amorites Battles of Four Kings with Five Amraphel Arioch and Tidal Hammurabi s Brilliant Reign Elamite Power Stamped Out Babylon s Great General and Statesman The Growth of Commerce Agriculture and Education An Ancient School Business and Private Correspondence A Love Letter Postal System Hammurabi s Successors The Earliest Kassites The Sealand Dynasty Hittite Raid on Babylon and Hyksos Invasion of Egypt Sun worship came into prominence in its most fully developed form during the obscure period which followed the decline of the Dynasty of Isin This was probably due to the changed political conditions which brought about the ascendancy for a time of Larsa the seat of the Sumerian sun cult and of Sippar the seat of the Akkadian sun cult Larsa was selected as the capital of the Elamite conquerors while their rivals the Amorites appear to have first established their power at Sippar Babbar the sun god of Sippar whose Semitic name was Shamash must have been credited with the early successes of the Amorites who became domiciled under his care and it was possibly on that account that the ruling family subsequently devoted so much attention to his worship in Merodach s city of Babylon where a sun temple was erected and Shamash received devout recognition as an abstract deity of righteousness and law who reflected the ideals of well organized and firmly governed communities The first Amoritic king was Sumu abum but little is known regarding him except that he reigned at Sippar He was succeeded by Sumu la ilu a deified monarch who moved from Sippar to Babylon the great wall of which he either repaired or entirely reconstructed in his fifth year With these two monarchs began the brilliant Hammurabi or First Dynasty of Babylonia which endured for three centuries Except Sumu abum who seems to stand alone all its kings belonged to the same family and son succeeded father in unbroken succession Sumu la ilu was evidently a great general and conqueror of the type of Thothmes III of Egypt His empire it is believed included the rising city states of Assyria and extended southward as far as ancient Lagash Of special interest on religious as well as political grounds was his association with Kish That city had become the stronghold of a rival family of Amoritic kings some of whom were powerful enough to assert their independence They formed the Third Dynasty of Kish The local god was Zamama the Tammuz like deity who like Nin Girsu of Lagash was subsequently identified with Merodach of Babylon But prominence was also given to the moon god Nannar to whom a temple had been erected a fact which suggests that sun worship was not more pronounced among the Semites than the Arabians and may not indeed have been of Semitic origin at all Perhaps the lunar temple was a relic of the influential Dynasty of Ur Sumu la ilu attacked and captured Kish but did not slay Bunutakhtunila its king who became his vassal Under the overlordship of Sumu la ilu the next ruler of Kish whose name was Immerum gave prominence to the public worship of Shamash Politics and religion went evidently hand in hand Sumu la ilu strengthened the defences of Sippar restored the wall and temple of Cuthah and promoted the worship of Merodach and his consort Zerpanitu m at Babylon He was undoubtedly one of the forceful personalities of his dynasty His son Zabium had a short but successful reign and appears to have continued the policy of his father in consolidating the power of Babylon and securing the allegiance of subject cities He enlarged Merodach s temple E sagila restored the Kish temple of Zamama and placed a golden image of himself in the temple of the sun god at Sippar Apil Sin his son surrounded Babylon with a new wall erected a temple to Ishtar and presented a throne of gold and silver to Shamash in that city while he also strengthened Borsippa renewed Nergal s temple at Cuthah and dug canals The next monarch was Sin muballit son of Apil Sin and father of Hammurabi He engaged himself in extending and strengthening the area controlled by Babylon by building city fortifications and improving the irrigation system It is recorded that he honoured Shamash with the gift of a shrine and a golden altar adorned with jewels Like Sumu la ilu he was a great battle lord and was specially concerned in challenging the supremacy of Elam in Sumeria and in the western land of the Amorites For a brief period a great conqueror named Rim Anum had established an empire which extended from Kish to Larsa but little is known regarding him Then several kings flourished at Larsa who claimed to have ruled over Ur The first monarch with an Elamite name who became connected with Larsa was Kudur Mabug son of Shimti Shilkhak the father of Warad Sin and Rim Sin It was from one of these Elamite monarchs that Sin muballit captured Isin and probably the Elamites were also the leaders of the army of Ur which he had routed before that event took place He was not successful however in driving the Elamites from the land and possibly he arranged with them a treaty of peace or perhaps of alliance Much controversy has been waged over the historical problems connected with this disturbed age The records are exceedingly scanty because the kings were not in the habit of commemorating battles which proved disastrous to them and their fragmentary references to successes are not sufficient to indicate what permanent results accrued from their various campaigns All we know for certain is that for a considerable period extending perhaps over a century a tremendous and disastrous struggle was waged at intervals which desolated middle Babylonia At least five great cities were destroyed by fire as is testified by the evidence accumulated by excavators These were Lagash Umma Shurruppak Kisurra and Adab The ancient metropolis of Lagash whose glory had been revived by Gudea and his kinsmen fell soon after the rise of Larsa and lay in ruins until the second century B C when during the Seleucid Period it was again occupied for a time From its mound at Tello and the buried ruins of the other cities most of the relics of ancient Sumerian civilization have been recovered It was probably during one of the intervals of this stormy period that the rival kings in Babylonia joined forces against a common enemy and invaded the Western Land Probably there was much unrest there Great ethnic disturbances were in progress which were changing the political complexion of Western Asia In addition to the outpourings of Arabian peoples into Palestine and Syria which propelled other tribes to invade Mesopotamia northern Babylonia and Assyria there was also much unrest all over the wide area to north and west of Elam Indeed the Elamite migration into southern Babylonia may not have been unconnected with the southward drift of roving bands from Media and the Iranian plateau It is believed that these migrations were primarily due to changing climatic conditions a prolonged Dry Cycle having caused a shortage of herbage with the result that pastoral peoples were compelled to go farther and farther afield in quest of fresh woods and pastures new Innumerable currents and cross currents were set in motion once these race movements swept towards settled districts either to flood them with human waves or surround them like islands in the midst of tempest lashed seas fretting the frontiers with restless fury and ever groping for an inlet through which to flow with irresistible force The Elamite occupation of Southern Babylonia appears to have propelled migrations of not inconsiderable numbers of its inhabitants No doubt the various sections moved towards districts which were suitable for their habits of life Agriculturists for instance must have shown preference for those areas which were capable of agricultural development while pastoral folks sought grassy steppes and valleys and seafarers the shores of alien seas Northern Babylonia and Assyria probably attracted the tillers of the soil But the movements of seafarers must have followed a different route It is possible that about this time the Phoenicians began to migrate towards the Upper Sea According to their own traditions their racial cradle was on the northern shore of the Persian Gulf So far as we know they first made their appearance on the Mediterranean coast about two thousand B C where they subsequently entered into competition as sea traders with the mariners of ancient Crete Apparently the pastoral nomads pressed northward through Mesopotamia and towards Canaan As much is suggested by the Biblical narrative which deals with the wanderings of Terah Abraham and Lot Taking with them their flocks and herds and tents and accompanied by wives and families and servants they migrated it is stated from the Sumerian city of Ur northwards to Haran and dwelt there After Terah s death the tribe wandered through Canaan and kept moving southward unable it would seem to settle permanently in any particular district At length there was a famine in the land an interesting reference to the Dry Cycle and the wanderers found it necessary to take refuge for a time in Egypt There they appear to have prospered Indeed so greatly did their flocks and herds increase that when they returned to Canaan they found that the land was not able to bear them although the conditions had improved somewhat during the interval There was as a result strife between the herdmen of Abram s cattle and the herdmen of Lot s cattle It is evident that the area which these pastoral flocks were allowed to occupy must have been strictly circumscribed for more than once it is stated significantly that the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled in the land The two kinsmen found it necessary therefore to part company Lot elected to go towards Sodom in the plain of Jordan and Abraham then moved towards the plain of Mamre the Amorite in the Hebron district two hundred seventy two With Mamre and his brothers Eshcol and Aner the Hebrew patriarch formed a confederacy for mutual protection two hundred seventy three Other tribes which were in Palestine at this period included the Horites the Rephaims the Zuzims the Zamzummims and the Emims These were probably representatives of the older stocks Like the Amorites the Hittites or children of Heth were evidently late comers and conquerors When Abraham purchased the burial cave at Hebron the landowner with whom he had to deal was one Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite two hundred seventy four This illuminating statement agrees with what we know regarding Hittite expansion about two thousand B C The Hatti or Khatti had constituted military aristocracies throughout Syria and extended their influence by forming alliances Many of their settlers were owners of estates and traders who intermarried with the indigenous peoples and the Arabian invaders As has been indicated Chapter I the large nosed Armenoid section of the Hittite confederacy appear to have contributed to the racial blend known vaguely as the Semitic Probably the particular group of Amorites with whom Abraham became associated had those pronounced Armenoid traits which can still be traced in representatives of the Hebrew people Of special interest in this connection is Ezekiel s declaration regarding the ethnics of Jerusalem Thy birth and thy nativity he said is of the land of Canaan thy father was an Amorite and thy mother an Hittite two hundred seventy five It was during Abraham s residence in Hebron that the Western Land was raided by a confederacy of Babylonian and Elamite battle lords The Biblical narrative which deals with this episode is of particular interest and has long engaged the attention of European scholars And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel Hammurabi king of Shinar Sumer Arioch Eri aku or Warad Sin king of Ellasar Larsa Chedor laomer Kudur Mabug king of Elam and Tidal Tudhula king of nations that these made war with Bera king of Sodom and with Birsha king of Gomorrah Shinab king of Admah and Shemeber king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela which is Zoar All these joined together in the vale of Siddim which is the salt sea Twelve years they served Chedor laomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled two hundred seventy six Apparently the Elamites had conquered part of Syria after entering southern Babylonia Chedor laomer and his allies routed the Rephaims the Zuzims the Emims the Horites and others and having sacked Sodom and Gomorrah carried away Lot and his goods On hearing of this disaster Abraham collected a force of three hundred and eighteen men all of whom were no doubt accustomed to guerrilla warfare and delivered a night attack on the tail of the victorious army which was withdrawing through the area afterwards allotted to the Hebrew tribe of Dan The surprise was complete Abraham smote the enemy and pursued them unto Hobah which is on the left hand of Damascus And he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother Lot and his goods and the women also and the people two hundred seventy seven The identification of Hammurabi with Amraphel is now generally accepted At first the guttural h which gives the English rendering Khammurabi presented a serious difficulty but in time the form Ammurapi which appears on a tablet became known and the conclusion was reached that the softer h sound was used and not the guttural The l in the Biblical Amraphel has suggested Ammurapi ilu Hammurabi the god but it has been argued on the other hand that the change may have been due to western habitual phonetic conditions or perhaps the slight alteration of an alphabetical sign Chedor laomer identified with Kudur Mabug may have had several local names One of his sons either Warad Sin or Rim Sin but probably the former had his name Semitized as Eri Aku and this variant appears in inscriptions Tidal king of nations has not been identified The suggestion that he was King of the Gutium remains in the realm of suggestion Two late tablets have fragmentary inscriptions which read like legends with some historical basis One mentions Kudur lahmal Chedor laomer and the other gives the form Kudur lahgumal and calls him King of the land of Elam Eri Eaku Eri aku and Tudhula Tidal are also mentioned Attacks had been delivered on Babylon and the city and its great temple E sagila were flooded It is asserted that the Elamites exercised sovereignty in Babylon for a period These interesting tablets have been published by Professor Pinches The fact that the four leaders of the expedition to Canaan are all referred to as kings in the Biblical narrative need not present any difficulty Princes and other subject rulers who governed under an overlord might be and as a matter of fact were referred to as kings I am a king son of a king an unidentified monarch recorded on one of the two tablets just referred to Kudur Mabug King of Elam during his lifetime called his son Warad Sin Eri Aku Arioch King of Larsa It is of interest to note too in connection with the Biblical narrative regarding the invasion of Syria and Palestine that he styled himself overseer of the Amurru Amorites No traces have yet been found in Palestine of its conquest by the Elamites nor have the excavators been able to substantiate the claim of Lugal zaggizi of a previous age to have extended his empire to the shores of the Mediterranean Any relics which these and other eastern conquerors may have left were possibly destroyed by the Egyptians and Hittites When Hammurabi came to the throne he had apparently to recognize the overlordship of the Elamite king or his royal son at Larsa Although Sin muballit had captured Isin it was retaken probably after the death of the Babylonian war lord by Rim Sin who succeeded his brother Warad Sin and for a time held sway in Lagash Nippur and Erech as well as Larsa It was not until the thirty first year of his reign that Hammurabi achieved ascendancy over his powerful rival Having repulsed an Elamite raid which was probably intended to destroy the growing power of Babylon he smote down Rim Sin whose power he reduced almost to vanishing point For about twenty years afterwards that subdued monarch lived in comparative obscurity then he led a force of allies against Hammurabi s son and successor Samsu iluna who defeated him and put him to death capturing in the course of his campaign the revolting cities of Emutbalum Erech and Isin So was the last smouldering ember of Elamite power stamped out in Babylonia Hammurabi statesman and general is one of the great personalities of the ancient world No more celebrated monarch ever held sway in Western Asia He was proud of his military achievements but preferred to be remembered as a servant of the gods a just ruler a father of his people and the shepherd that gives peace In the epilogue to his code of laws he refers to the burden of royalty and declares that he cut off the enemy and lorded it over the conquered so that his subjects might have security Indeed his anxiety for their welfare was the most pronounced feature of his character I carried all the people of Sumer and Akkad in my bosom he declared in his epilogue By my protection I guided in peace its brothers By my wisdom I provided for them He set up his stele on which the legal code was inscribed so that the great should not oppress the weak and to counsel the widow and orphan and to succour the injured The king that is gentle king of the city exalted am I two hundred seventy eight Hammurabi was no mere framer of laws but a practical administrator as well He acted as supreme judge and his subjects could appeal to him as the Romans could to Caesar Nor was any case too trivial for his attention The humblest man was assured that justice would be done if his grievance were laid before the king Hammurabi was no respecter of persons and treated alike all his subjects high and low He punished corrupt judges protected citizens against unjust governors reviewed the transactions of moneylenders with determination to curb extortionate demands and kept a watchful eye on the operations of taxgatherers There can be little doubt but that he won the hearts of his subjects who enjoyed the blessings of just administration under a well ordained political system He must also have endeared himself to them as an exemplary exponent of religious tolerance He respected the various deities in whom the various groups of people reposed their faith restored despoiled temples and re endowed them with characteristic generosity By so doing he not only afforded the pious full freedom and opportunity to perform their religious ordinances but also promoted the material welfare of his subjects for the temples were centres of culture and the priests were the teachers of the young Excavators have discovered at Sippar traces of a school which dates from the Hammurabi Dynasty Pupils learned to read and write and received instruction in arithmetic and mensuration They copied historical tablets practised the art of composition and studied geography Although there were many professional scribes a not inconsiderable proportion of the people of both sexes were able to write private and business letters Sons wrote from a distance to their fathers when in need of money then as now and with the same air of undeserved martyrdom and subdued but confident appeal One son indited a long complaint regarding the quality of the food he was given in his lodgings Lovers appealed to forgetful ladies showing great concern regarding their health Inform me how it fares with thee one wrote four thousand years ago I went up to Babylon so that I might meet thee but did not and was much depressed Let me know why thou didst go away so that I may be made glad And do come hither Ever have care of thy health remembering me Even begging letter writers were not unknown An ancient representative of this class once wrote to his employer from prison He expressed astonishment that he had been arrested and having protested his innocence he made touching appeal for little luxuries which were denied to him adding that the last consignment which had been forwarded had never reached him Letters were often sent by messengers who were named but there also appears to have been some sort of postal system Letter carriers however could not have performed their duties without the assistance of beasts of burden Papyri were not used as in Egypt Nor was ink required Babylonian letters were shapely little bricks resembling cushions The angular alphabetical characters bristling with thorn like projections were impressed with a wedge shaped stylus on tablets of soft clay which were afterwards carefully baked in an oven Then the letters were placed in baked clay envelopes sealed and addressed or wrapped in pieces of sacking transfixed by seals If the ancient people had a festive season which was regarded like the European Yuletide or the Indian Durga fortnight as an occasion suitable for the general exchange of expressions of goodwill the Babylonian streets and highways must have been greatly congested by the postal traffic while muscular postmen worked overtime distributing the contents of heavy and bulky letter sacks Door to door deliveries would certainly have presented difficulties Wood being dear everyone could not afford doors and some houses were entered by stairways leading to the flat and partly open roofs King Hammurabi had to deal daily with a voluminous correspondence He received reports from governors in all parts of his realm legal documents containing appeals and private communications from relatives and others He paid minute attention to details and was probably one of the busiest men in Babylonia Every day while at home after worshipping Merodach at E sagila he dictated letters to his scribes gave audiences to officials heard legal appeals and issued interlocutors and dealt with the reports regarding his private estates He looks a typical man of affairs in sculptured representations shrewd resolute and unassuming feeling the burden of royalty but ever ready and well qualified to discharge his duties with thoroughness and insight His grasp of detail was equalled only by his power to conceive of great enterprises which appealed to his imagination It was a work of genius on his part to weld together that great empire of miscellaneous states extending from southern Babylonia to Assyria and from the borders of Elam to the Mediterranean coast by a universal legal Code which secured tranquillity and equal rights to all promoted business and set before his subjects the ideals of right thinking and right living Hammurabi recognized that conquest was of little avail unless followed by the establishment of a just and well arranged political system and the inauguration of practical measures to secure the domestic industrial and commercial welfare of the people as a whole He engaged himself greatly therefore in developing the natural resources of each particular district The network of irrigating canals was extended in the homeland so that agriculture might prosper these canals also promoted trade for they were utilized for travelling by boat and for the distribution of commodities As a result of his activities Babylon became not only the administrative but also the commercial centre of his Empire the London of Western Asia and it enjoyed a spell of prosperity which was never surpassed in subsequent times Yet it never lost its pre eminent position despite the attempts of rival states jealous of its glory and influence to suspend its activities It had been too firmly established during the Hammurabi Age which was the Golden Age of Babylonia as the heartlike distributor and controller of business life through a vast network of veins and arteries to be displaced by any other Mesopotamian city to pleasure even a mighty monarch For two thousand years from the time of Hammurabi until the dawn of the Christian era the city of Babylon remained amidst many political changes the metropolis of Western Asiatic commerce and culture and none was more eloquent in its praises than the scholarly pilgrim from Greece who wondered at its magnificence and reverenced its antiquities Hammurabi s reign was long as it was prosperous There is no general agreement as to when he ascended the throne some say in twenty one twenty three B C others hold that it was after two thousand B C but it is certain that he presided over the destinies of Babylon for the long period of forty three years There are interesting references to the military successes of his reign in the prologue to the legal Code It is related that when he avenged Larsa the seat of Rim Sin he restored there the temple of the sun god Other temples were built up at various ancient centres so that these cultural organizations might contribute to the welfare of the localities over which they held sway At Nippur he thus honoured Enlil at Eridu the god Ea at Ur the god Sin at Erech the god Anu and the goddess Nana Ishtar at Kish the god Zamama and the goddess Ma ma at Cuthah the god Nergal at Lagash the god Nin Girsu while at Adab and Akkad celebrated for its wide squares and other centres he carried out religious and public works In Assyria he restored the colossus of Ashur which had evidently been carried away by a conqueror and he developed the canal system of Nineveh Apparently Lagash and Adab had not been completely deserted during his reign although their ruins have not yielded evidence that they flourished after their fall during the long struggle with the aggressive and plundering Elamites Hammurabi referred to himself in the Prologue as a king who commanded obedience in all the four quarters He was the sort of benevolent despot whom Carlyle on one occasion clamoured vainly for not an Oriental despot in the commonly accepted sense of the term As a German writer puts it his despotism was a form of Patriarchal Absolutism When Marduk Merodach as the great king recorded brought me to direct all people and commissioned me to give judgment I laid down justice and right in the provinces I made all flesh to prosper two hundred seventy nine That was the keynote of his long life he regarded himself as the earthly representative of the Ruler of all Merodach the lord god of right who carried out the decrees of Anu the sky god of Destiny The next king Samsu iluna reigned nearly as long as his illustrious father and similarly lived a strenuous and pious life Soon after he came to the throne the forces of disorder were let loose but as has been stated he crushed and slew his most formidable opponent Rim Sin the Elamite king who had gathered together an army of allies During his reign a Kassite invasion was repulsed The earliest Kassites a people of uncertain racial affinities began to settle in the land during Hammurabi s lifetime Some writers connect them with the Hittites and others with the Iranians vaguely termed as Indo European or Indo Germanic folk Ethnologists as a rule regard them as identical with the Cossaei whom the Greeks found settled between Babylon and Media east of the Tigris and north of Elam The Hittites came south as raiders about a century later It is possible that the invading Kassites had overrun Elam and composed part of Rim Sin s army After settled conditions were secured many of them remained in Babylonia where they engaged like their pioneers in agricultural pursuits No doubt they were welcomed in that capacity for owing to the continuous spread of culture and the development of commerce rural labour had become scarce and dear Farmers had a long standing complaint The harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are few two hundred eighty Despite the existence of slaves who were for the most part domestic servants there was writes mister Johns considerable demand for free labour in ancient Babylonia This is clear from the large number of contracts relating to hire which have come down to us As a rule the man was hired for the harvest and was free directly after But there are many examples in which the term of service was different one month half a year or a whole year Harvest labour was probably far dearer than any other because of its importance the skill and exertion demanded and the fact that so many were seeking for it at once When a farm worker was engaged he received a shekel for earnest money or arles and was penalized for non appearance or late arrival two hundred eighty one So great was the political upheaval caused by Rim Sin and his allies and imitators in southern Babylonia that it was not until the seventeenth year of his reign that Samsu iluna had recaptured Erech and Ur and restored their walls Among other cities which had to be chastised was ancient Akkad where a rival monarch endeavoured to establish himself Several years were afterwards spent in building new fortifications setting up memorials in temples and cutting and clearing canals On more than one occasion during the latter part of his reign he had to deal with aggressive bands of Amorites The greatest danger to the Empire however was threatened by a new kingdom which had been formed in Bit Jakin a part of Sealand which was afterwards controlled by the mysterious Chaldeans Here may have collected evicted and rebel bands of Elamites and Sumerians and various gentlemen of fortune who were opposed to the Hammurabi regime After the fall of Rim Sin it became powerful under a king called Ilu ma ilu Samsu iluna conducted at least two campaigns against his rival but without much success Indeed he was in the end compelled to retreat with considerable loss owing to the difficult character of that marshy country Abeshu the next Babylonian king endeavoured to shatter the cause of the Sealanders and made it possible for himself to strike at them by damming up the Tigris canal He achieved a victory but the wily Ilu ma ilu eluded him and after a reign of sixty years was succeeded by his son Kiannib The Sealand Dynasty of which little is known lasted for over three and a half centuries and certain of its later monarchs were able to extend their sway over part of Babylonia but its power was strictly circumscribed so long as Hammurabi s descendants held sway During Abeshu s reign of twenty eight years of which but scanty records survive he appears to have proved an able statesman and general He founded a new city called Lukhaia and appears to have repulsed a Kassite raid His son Ammiditana who succeeded him apparently inherited a prosperous and well organized Empire for during the first fifteen years of his reign he attended chiefly to the adornment of temples and other pious undertakings He was a patron of the arts with archaeological leanings and displayed traits which suggest that he inclined like Sumu la ilu to ancestor worship Entemena the pious patesi of Lagash whose memory is associated with the famous silver vase decorated with the lion headed eagle form of Nin Girsu had been raised to the dignity of a god and Ammiditana caused his statue to be erected so that offerings might be made to it He set up several images of himself also and celebrated the centenary of the accession to the throne of his grandfather Samsu iluna the warrior lord by unveiling his statue with much ceremony at Kish About the middle of his reign he put down a Sumerian rising and towards its close had to capture a city which is believed to be Isin but the reference is too obscure to indicate what political significance attached to this incident His son Ammizaduga reigned for over twenty years quite peacefully so far as is known and was succeeded by Samsuditana whose rule extended over a quarter of a century Like Ammiditana these two monarchs set up images of themselves as well as of the gods so that they might be worshipped no doubt They also promoted the interests of agriculture and commerce and incidentally increased the revenue from taxation by paying much attention to the canals and extending the cultivatable areas But the days of the brilliant Hammurabi Dynasty were drawing to a close It endured for about a century longer than the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt which came to an end according to the Berlin calculations in seventeen eighty eight B C Apparently some of the Hammurabi and Amenemhet kings were contemporaries but there is no evidence that they came into direct touch with one another It was not until at about two centuries after Hammurabi s day that Egypt first invaded Syria with which however it had for a long period previously conducted a brisk trade Evidently the influence of the Hittites and their Amoritic allies predominated between Mesopotamia and the Delta frontier of Egypt and it is significant to find in this connection that the Khatti or Hatti were referred to for the first time in Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty and in Babylonia during the Hammurabi Dynasty sometime shortly before or after two thousand B C About eighteen hundred B C a Hittite raid resulted in the overthrow of the last king of the Hammurabi family at Babylon The Hyksos invasion of Egypt took place after seventeen eighty eight B C CHAPTER XII RISE OF THE HITTITES MITANNIANS KASSITES HYKSOS AND ASSYRIANS The War God of

Overlords Tell el Amarna Letters Fall of Mitanni Rise of Hittite and Assyrian Empires Egypt in Eclipse Assyrian and Babylonian Rivalries When the Hammurabi Dynasty like the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt is found to be suffering languid decline the gaps in the dulled historical records are filled with the echoes of the thunder god whose hammer beating resounds among the northern mountains As this deity comes each year in Western Asia when vegetation has withered and after fruits have dropped from trees bringing tempests and black rainclouds to issue in a new season of growth and fresh activity so he descended from the hills in the second millennium before the Christian era as the battle lord of invaders and the stormy herald of a new age which was to dawn upon the ancient world He was the war god of the Hittites as well as of the northern Amorites the Mitannians and the Kassites and he led the Aryans from the Iranian steppes towards the verdurous valley of the Punjab His worshippers engraved his image with grateful hands on the beetling cliffs of Cappadocian chasms in Asia Minor where his sway was steadfast and pre eminent for long centuries In one locality he appears mounted on a bull wearing a fringed and belted tunic with short sleeves a conical helmet and upturned shoes while he grasps in one hand the lightning symbol and in the other a triangular bow resting on his right shoulder In another locality he is the bringer of grapes and barley sheaves But his most familiar form is the bearded and thick set mountaineer armed with a ponderous thunder hammer a flashing trident and a long two edged sword with a hemispherical knob on the hilt which dangles from his belt while an antelope or goat wearing a pointed tiara prances beside him This deity is identical with bluff impetuous Thor of northern Europe Indra of the Himalayas Tarku of Phrygia and Teshup or Teshub of Armenia and northern Mesopotamia Sandan the Hercules of Cilicia Adad or Hadad of Amurru and Assyria and Ramman who at an early period penetrated Akkad and Sumer in various forms His Hittite name is uncertain but in the time of Rameses II he was identified with Sutekh Set He passed into southern Europe as Zeus and became the lord of the deities of the Aegean and Crete The Hittites who entered Babylon about eighteen hundred B C and overthrew the last king of the Hammurabi Dynasty may have been plundering raiders like the European Gauls of a later age or a well organized force of a strong consolidated power which endured for a period of uncertain duration They were probably the latter for although they carried off Merodach and Zerpanitu m these idols were not thrust into the melting pot but retained apparently for political reasons These early Hittites are a people of the mist More than once in ancient history casual reference is made to them but on most of these occasions they soon vanish suddenly behind their northern mountains The explanation appears to be that at various periods great leaders arose who were able to weld together the various tribes and make their presence felt in Western Asia But when once the organization broke down either on account of internal rivalries or the influence of an outside power they lapsed back again into a state of political insignificance in the affairs of the ancient world It is possible that about eighteen hundred B C the Hittite confederacy was controlled by an ambitious king who had dreams of a great empire and was accordingly pursuing a career of conquest Judging from what we know of the northern worshippers of the hammer god in later times it would appear that when they were referred to as the Hatti or Khatti the tribe of that name was the dominating power in Asia Minor and north Syria The Hatti are usually identified with the broad headed mountaineers of Alpine or Armenoid type the ancestors of the modern Armenians Their ancient capital was at Boghaz Koei the site of Pteria which was destroyed according to the Greeks by Croesus the last King of Lydia in the sixth century B C It was strongly situated in an excellent pastoral district on the high breezy plateau of Cappadocia surrounded by high mountains and approached through narrow river gorges which in winter were blocked with snow Hittite civilization was of great antiquity Excavations which have been conducted at an undisturbed artificial mound at Sakje Geuzi have revealed evidences of a continuous culture which began to flourish before three thousand B C two hundred eighty two In one of the lower layers occurred that particular type of Neolithic yellow painted pottery with black geometric designs which resembles other specimens of painted fabrics found in Turkestan by the Pumpelly expedition in Susa the capital of Elam and its vicinity by De Morgan in the Balkan peninsula by Schliemann in a First Dynasty tomb at Abydos in Egypt by Petrie and in the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age Minoan strata of Crete by Evans It may be that these interesting relics were connected with the prehistoric drift westward of the broad headed pastoral peoples who ultimately formed the Hittite military aristocracy According to Professor Elliot Smith broad headed aliens from Asia Minor first reached Egypt at the dawn of history There they blended with the indigenous tribes of the Mediterranean or Brown Race A mesocephalic skull then became common It is referred to as the Giza type and has been traced by Professor Elliot Smith from Egypt to the Punjab but not farther into India two hundred eighty three During the early dynasties this skull with alien traits was confined chiefly to the Delta region and the vicinity of Memphis the city of the pyramid builders It is not improbable that the Memphite god Ptah may have been introduced into Egypt by the invading broad heads This deity is a world artisan like Indra and is similarly associated with dwarfish artisans he hammers out the copper sky and therefore links with the various thunder gods Tarku Teshup Adad Ramman c of the Asian mountaineers Thunderstorms were of too rare occurrence in Egypt to be connected with the food supply which has always depended on the river Nile Ptah s purely Egyptian characteristics appear to have been acquired after fusion with Osiris Seb the Nilotic gods of inundation earth and vegetation The ancient god Set Sutekh who became a demon and was ultimately re exalted as a great deity during the Nineteenth Dynasty may also have had some connection with the prehistoric Hatti Professor Elliot Smith who has found alien traits in the mummies of the Rameses kings is convinced that the broad headed folks who entered Europe by way of Asia Minor and Egypt through the Delta at the close of the Neolithic Age represent two streams of the same Asiatic folk two hundred eighty four The opinion of such an authority cannot be lightly set aside The earliest Egyptian reference to the Kheta as the Hittites were called was made in the reign of the first Amenemhet of the Twelfth Dynasty who began to reign about two thousand B C Some authorities including Maspero two hundred eighty five are of opinion that the allusion to the Hatti which is found in the Babylonian Book of Omens belongs to the earlier age of Sargon of Akkad and Naram Sin but Sayce favours the age of Hammurabi Others would connect the Gutium or men of Kutu with the Kheta or Hatti Sayce has expressed the opinion that the Biblical Tidal identified with Tudkhul or Tudhula king of nations the ally of Arioch Amraphel and Chedor laomer was a Hittite king the nations being the confederacy of Asia Minor tribes controlled by the Hatti In the fragments of the Babylonian story of Chedor laomer published by doctor Pinches says Professor Sayce the name of Tid al is written Tudkhul and he is described as King of the Umman Manda or Nations of the North of which the Hebrew Goyyim is a literal translation Now the name is Hittite In the account of the campaign of Rameses II against the Hittites it appears as Tid al and one of the Hittite kings of Boghaz Koei bears the same name which is written as Dud khaliya in cuneiform two hundred eighty six One of the racial types among the Hittites wore pigtails These head adornments appear on figures in certain Cappadocian sculptures and on Hittite warriors in the pictorial records of a north Syrian campaign of Rameses II at Thebes It is suggestive therefore to find that on the stele of Naram Sin of Akkad the mountaineers who are conquered by that battle lord wear pigtails also Their split robes are unlike the short fringed tunics of the Hittite gods but resemble the long split mantles worn over their tunics by high dignitaries like King Tarku dimme who figures on a famous silver boss of an ancient Hittite dagger Naram Sin inherited the Empire of Sargon of Akkad which extended to the Mediterranean Sea If his enemies were not natives of Cappadocia they may have been the congeners of the Hittite pigtailed type in another wooded and mountainous country It has been suggested that these wearers of pigtails were Mongolians But although high cheek bones and oblique eyes occurred in ancient times and still occur in parts of Asia Minor suggesting occasional Mongolian admixture with Ural Altaic broad heads the Hittite pigtailed warriors must not be confused with the true small nosed Mongols of north eastern Asia The Egyptian sculptors depicted them with long and prominent noses which emphasize their strong Armenoid affinities Other tribes in the Hittite confederacy included the representatives of the earliest settlers from North Africa of Mediterranean racial stock These have been identified with the Canaanites and especially the agriculturists among them for the Palestinian Hittites are also referred to as Canaanites in the Bible and in one particular connection under circumstances which afford an interesting glimpse of domestic life in those far off times When Esau Isaac s eldest son was forty years of age he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite two hundred eighty seven Apparently the Hittite ladies considered themselves to be of higher caste than the indigenous peoples and the settlers from other countries for when Ezekiel declared that the mother of Jerusalem was a Hittite he said Thou art thy mother s daughter that lotheth her husband and her children two hundred eighty eight Esau s marriage was a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah two hundred eighty seven The Hebrew mother seems to have entertained fears that her favourite son Jacob would fall a victim to the allurements of other representatives of the same stock as her superior and troublesome daughters in law for she said to Isaac I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth such as these which are of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me two hundred eighty nine Isaac sent for Jacob and charged him and said unto him Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan Arise go to Padan aram to the house of Bethuel thy mother s father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother s brother two hundred ninety From these quotations two obvious deductions may be drawn the Hebrews regarded the Hittites of the land as one with the Canaanites the stocks having probably been so well fused and the worried Rebekah had the choosing of Jacob s wife or wives from among her own relations in Mesopotamia who were of Sumerian stock and kindred of Abraham two hundred ninety one It is not surprising to find traces of Sumerian pride among the descendants of the evicted citizens of ancient Ur especially when brought into association with the pretentious Hittites Evidence of racial blending in Asia Minor is also afforded by Hittite mythology In the fertile agricultural valleys and round the shores of that great Eur Asian land bridge the indigenous stock was also of the Mediterranean race as Sergi and other ethnologists have demonstrated The Great Mother goddess was worshipped from the earliest times and she bore various local names At Comana in Pontus she was known to the Greeks as Ma a name which may have been as old as that of the Sumerian Mama the creatrix or Mamitu m goddess of destiny in Armenia she was Anaitis in Cilicia she was Ate Atheh of Tarsus while in Phrygia she was best known as Cybele mother of Attis who links with Ishtar as mother and wife of Tammuz Aphrodite as mother and wife of Adonis and Isis as mother and wife of Osiris The Great Mother was in Phoenicia called Astarte she was a form of Ishtar and identical with the Biblical Ashtoreth In the Syrian city of Hierapolis she bore the name of Atargatis which Meyer with whom Frazer agrees considers to be the Greek rendering of the Aramaic Athar Atheh the god Athar and the goddess Atheh Like the bearded Aphrodite Atargatis may have been regarded as a bisexual deity Some of the specialized mother goddesses whose outstanding attributes reflected the history and politics of the states they represented were imported into Egypt the land of ancient mother deities during the Empire period by the half foreign Rameses kings these included the voluptuous Kadesh and the warlike Anthat In every district colonized by the early representatives of the Mediterranean race the goddess cult came into prominence and the gods and the people were reputed to be descendants of the great Creatrix This rule obtained as far distant as Ireland where the Danann folk and the Danann gods were the children of the goddess Danu Among the Hatti proper that is the broad headed military aristocracy the chief deity of the pantheon was the Great Father the creator the lord of Heaven the Baal As Sutekh Tarku Adad or Ramman he was the god of thunder rain fertility and war and he ultimately acquired solar attributes A famous rock sculpture at Boghaz Koei depicts a mythological scene which is believed to represent the Spring marriage of the Great Father and the Great Mother suggesting a local fusion of beliefs which resulted from the union of tribes of the god cult with tribes of the goddess cult So long as the Hatti tribe remained the predominant partner in the Hittite confederacy the supremacy was assured of the Great Father who symbolized their sway But when in the process of time the power of the Hatti declined their chief god fell from his predominant place in the religion of the interior writes doctor Garstang But the Great Mother lived on being the goddess of the land two hundred ninety two In addition to the Hittite confederacy of Asia Minor and North Syria another great power arose in northern Mesopotamia This was the Mitanni Kingdom Little is known regarding it except what is derived from indirect sources Winckler believes that it was first established by early waves of Hatti people who migrated from the east The Hittite connection is based chiefly on the following evidence One of the gods of the Mitanni rulers was Teshup who is identical with Tarku the Thor of Asia Minor The raiders who in eighteen hundred B C entered Babylon set fire to E sagila and carried off Merodach and his consort Zerpanitu m were called the Hatti The images of these deities were afterwards obtained from Khani Mitanni At a later period when we come to know more about Mitanni from the letters of one of its kings to two Egyptian Pharaohs and the Winckler tablets from Bog haz Koei it is found that its military aristocracy spoke an Indo European language as is shown by the names of their kings Saushatar Artatama Sutarna Artashshumara Tushratta and Mattiuza They worshipped the following deities Mi it ra Uru w na In da ra and Na sa at ti ia Mitra Varuna Indra and Nasatyau the Twin Aswins Castor and Pollux whose names have been deciphered by Winckler These gods were also imported into India by the Vedic Aryans The Mitanni tribe the military aristocracy probably was called Kharri and some philologists are of opinion that it is identical with Arya which was the normal designation in Vedic literature from the Rigveda onwards of an Aryan of the three upper classes two hundred ninety three Mitanni signifies the river lands and the descendants of its inhabitants who lived in Cappadocia were called by the Greeks Mattienoi They are possibly says doctor Haddon the ancestors of the modern Kurds two hundred ninety four a conspicuously long headed people proverbial like the ancient Aryo Indians and the Gauls for their hospitality and their raiding propensities It would appear that the Mitannian invasion of northern Mesopotamia and the Aryan invasion of India represented two streams of diverging migrations from a common cultural centre and that the separate groups of wanderers mingled with other stocks with whom they came into contact Tribes of Aryan speech were associated with the Kassite invaders of Babylon who took possession of northern Babylonia soon after the disastrous Hittite raid It is believed that they came from the east through the highlands of Elam For a period the dating of which is uncertain the Mitannians were overlords of part of Assyria including Nineveh and even Asshur as well as the district called Musri by the Assyrians and part of Cappadocia They also occupied the cities of Harran and Kadesh Probably they owed their great military successes to their cavalry The horse became common in Babylon during the Kassite Dynasty which followed the Hammurabi and was there called the ass of the east a name which suggests whence the Kassites and Mitannians came The westward movement of the Mitannians in the second millennium B C may have been in progress prior to the Kassite conquest of Babylon and the Hyksos invasion of Egypt Their relations in Mesopotamia and Syria with the Hittites and the Amorites are obscure Perhaps they were for a time the overlords of the Hittites At any rate it is of interest to note that when Thothmes III struck at the last Hyksos stronghold during his long Syrian campaign of about twenty years duration his operations were directly against Kadesh on the Orontes which was then held by his fierce enemies the Mitannians of Naharina two hundred ninety five During the Hyksos Age the horse was introduced into Egypt Indeed the Hyksos conquest was probably due to the use of the horse which was domesticated as the Pumpelly expedition has ascertained at a remote period in Turkestan whence it may have been obtained by the horse sacrificing Aryo Indians and the horse sacrificing ancestors of the Siberian Buriats If the Mitanni rulers were not overlords of the Hittites about eighteen hundred B C the two peoples may have been military allies of the Kassites Some writers suggest indeed that the Kassites came from Mitanni Another view is that the Mitannians were the Aryan allies of the Kassites who entered Babylon from the Elamite highlands and that they afterwards conquered Mesopotamia and part of Cappadocia prior to the Hyksos conquest of Egypt A third solution of the problem is that the Aryan rulers of the Mitannian Hittites were the overlords of northern Babylonia which they included in their Mesopotamian empire for a century before the Kassites achieved political supremacy in the Tigro Euphrates valley and that they were also the leaders of the Hyksos invasion of Egypt which they accomplished with the assistance of their Hittite and Amoritic allies The first Kassite king of Babylonia of whom we have knowledge was Gandash He adopted the old Akkadian title king of the four quarters as well as the title king of Sumer and Akkad first used by the rulers of the Dynasty of Ur Nippur appears to have been selected by Gandash as his capital which suggests that his war and storm god Shuqamuna was identified with Bel Enlil who as a world giant has much in common with the northern hammer gods After reigning for sixteen years Gandash was succeeded by his son Agum the Great who sat on the throne for twenty two years The great grandson of Agum the Great was Agum II and not until his reign were the statues of Merodach and his consort Zerpanitu m brought back to the city of Babylon This monarch recorded that in response to the oracle of Shamash the sun god he sent to the distant land of Khani Mitanni for the great deity and his consort Babylon would therefore appear to have been deprived of Merodach for about two centuries The Hittite Mitanni raid is dated about eighteen hundred B C and the rise of Gandash the Kassite about seventeen hundred B C At least a century elapsed between the reigns of Gandash and Agum II These calculations do not coincide it will be noted with the statement in a Babylonian hymn that Merodach remained in the land of the Hatti for twenty four years which however may be either a priestly fiction or a reference to a later conquest The period which followed the fall of the Hammurabi Dynasty of Babylonia is as obscure as the Hyksos Age of Egypt Agum II the Kassite king does not state whether or not he waged war against Mitanni to recover Babylon s god Merodach If however he was an ally of the Mitanni ruler the transference of the deity may have been an ordinary diplomatic transaction The possibility may also be suggested that the Hittites of Mitanni were not displaced by the Aryan military aristocracy until after the Kassites were firmly established in northern Babylonia between seventeen hundred B C and sixteen hundred B C This may account for the statements that Merodach was carried off by the Hatti and returned from the land of Khani The evidence afforded by Egypt is suggestive in this connection There was a second Hyksos Dynasty in that country The later rulers became Egyptianized as the Kassites became Babylonianized but they were all referred to by the exclusive and sullen Egyptians as barbarians and Asiatics They recognized the sun god of Heliopolis but were also concerned in promoting the worship of Sutekh a deity of sky and thunder with solar attributes whom Rameses II identified with the Baal of the Hittites The Mitannians as has been stated recognized a Baal called Teshup who was identical with Tarku of the Western Hittites and with their own tribal Indra also One of the Hyksos kings named Ian or Khian the Ianias of Manetho was either an overlord or the ally of an overlord who swayed a great empire in Asia His name has been deciphered on relics found as far apart as Knossos in Crete and Baghdad on the Tigris which at the time was situated within the area of Kassite control Apparently peaceful conditions prevailed during his reign over a wide extent of Asia and trade was brisk between far distant centres of civilization The very term Hyksos is suggestive in this connection According to Breasted it signifies rulers of countries which compares with the Biblical Tidal king of nations whom Sayce as has been indicated regards as a Hittite monarch When the Hittite hieroglyphics have been read and Mesopotamia thoroughly explored light may be thrown on the relations of the Mitannians the Hittites the Hyksos and the Kassites between eighteen hundred B C and fifteen hundred B C It is evident that a fascinating volume of ancient history has yet to be written The Kassites formed the military aristocracy of Babylonia which was called Karduniash for nearly six centuries Agum II was the first of their kings who became thoroughly Babylonianized and although he still gave recognition to Shuqamuna the Kassite god of battle he re exalted Merodach whose statue he had taken back from Khani and decorated E sagila with gifts of gold jewels rare woods frescoes and pictorial tiles he also re endowed the priesthood During the reign of his successor Burnaburiash I the Dynasty of Sealand came to an end Little is known regarding the relations between Elam and Babylonia during the Kassite period If the Kassite invaders crossed the Tigris soon after the raid of the Mitannian Hittites they must have previously overrun a great part of Elam but strongly situated Susa may have for a time withstood their attacks At first the Kassites held northern Babylonia only while the ancient Sumerian area was dominated by the Sealand power which had gradually regained strength during the closing years of the Hammurabi Dynasty No doubt many northern Babylonian refugees reinforced its army The Elamites or perhaps the Kassites of Elam appear to have made frequent attacks on southern Babylonia At length Ea gamil king of Sealand invaded Elam with purpose no doubt to shatter the power of his restless enemies He was either met there however by an army from Babylon or his country was invaded during his absence Prince Ulamburiash son of Burnaburiash I defeated Ea gamil and brought to an end the Sealand Dynasty which had been founded by Ilu ma ilu the contemporary and enemy of Samsu la ilu son of Hammurabi Ulamburiash is referred to on a mace head which was discovered at Babylon as king of Sealand and he probably succeeded his father at the capital The whole of Babylonia thus came under Kassite sway Agum III a grandson of Ulamburiash found it necessary however to invade Sealand which must therefore have revolted It was probably a centre of discontent during the whole period of Kassite ascendancy After a long obscure interval we reach the period when the Hyksos power was broken in Egypt that is after fifteen eighty B C The great Western Asiatic kingdoms at the time were the Hittite the Mitannian the Assyrian and the Babylonian Kassite Between fifteen fifty seven B C and fifteen oh one B C Thothmes I of Egypt was asserting his sway over part of Syria Many years elapsed however before Thothmes III who died in fourteen forty seven B C established firmly after waging a long war of conquest the supremacy of Egypt between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean coast as far north as the borders of Asia Minor At this period as Professor Flinders Petrie emphasizes the civilization of Syria was equal or superior to that of Egypt Not only was there in the cities luxury beyond that of the Egyptians but also technical work which could teach them The Syrian soldiers had suits of scale armour which afterwards were manufactured in Egypt and they had chariots adorned with gold and silver and highly decorated which were greatly prized by the Egyptians when they captured them and reserved for royalty In the rich wealth of gold and silver vases obtained from captured cities by the Nilotic warriors we see also adds Petrie the sign of a people who were their the Egyptians equals if not their superiors in taste and skill two hundred ninety six It is not to be wondered at therefore when the Pharaohs received tribute from Syria that they preferred it to be carried into Egypt by skilled workmen The keenness with which the Egyptians record all the beautiful and luxurious products of the Syrians shows that the workmen would probably be more in demand than other kinds or slave tribute two hundred ninety seven One of the monarchs with whom Thothmes III corresponded was the king of Assyria The enemies of Egypt in northern Mesopotamia were the Hittites and Mitannians and their allies and these were also the enemies of Assyria But to enable us to deal with the new situation which was created by Egypt in Mesopotamia it is necessary in the first place to trace the rise of Assyria which was destined to become for a period the dominating power in Western Asia and ultimately in the Nile valley also The Assyrian group of cities grew up on the banks of the Tigris to the north of Babylonia the mother country The following Biblical references regarding the origins of the two states are of special interest Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah Shem Ham and Japheth The sons of Ham Cush and Mizraim and Phut and Canaan And Cush begat Nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth He was a mighty hunter before the Lord wherefore it is said Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh in the land of Shinar Out of that land went forth Asshur and builded Nineveh and the city Rehoboth and Calah and Resen between Nineveh and Calah the same is a great city The children of Shem Elam and Asshur Genesis x one twenty two The land of Assyria and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof Micah v six It will be observed that the Sumero Babylonians are Cushites or Hamites and therefore regarded as racially akin to the proto Egyptians of the Mediterranean race an interesting confirmation of recent ethnological conclusions Nimrod the king of Babel Babylon in Shinar Sumer was it would appear a deified monarch who became ultimately identified with the national god of Babylonia Professor Pinches has shown two hundred ninety eight that his name is a rendering of that of Merodach In Sumerian Merodach was called Amaruduk or Amarudu and in the Assyro Babylonian language Marduk By a process familiar to philologists the suffix uk was dropped and the rendering became Marad The Hebrews added ni ni marad assimilating the name to a certain extent to the niphal forms of the Hebrew verbs and making a change says Pinches in conformity with the genius of the Hebrew language Asshur who went out of Nimrod s country to build Nineveh was a son of Shem a Semite and so far as is known it was after the Semites achieved political supremacy in Akkad that the Assyrian colonies were formed Asshur may have been a subject ruler who was deified and became the god of the city of Asshur which probably gave its name to Assyria According to Herodotus Nineveh was founded by King Ninus and Queen Semiramis This lady was reputed to be the daughter of Derceto the fish goddess whom Pliny identified with Atargatis Semiramis was actually an Assyrian queen of revered memory She was deified and took the place of a goddess apparently Nina the prototype of Derceto This Nina perhaps a form of Damkina wife of Ea was the great mother of the Sumerian city of Nina and there and also at Lagash received offerings of fish She was one of the many goddesses of maternity absorbed by Ishtar The Greek Ninus is regarded as a male form of her name like Atargatis she may have become a bisexual deity if she was not always accompanied by a shadowy male form Nineveh Ninua was probably founded or conquered by colonists from Nina or Lagash and called after the fish goddess All the deities of Assyria were imported from Babylonia except as some hold Ashur the national god two hundred ninety nine The theory that Ashur was identical with the Aryo Indian Asura and the Persian Ahura is not generally accepted One theory is that he was an eponymous hero who became the city god of Asshur although the early form of his name Ashir presents a difficulty in this connection Asshur was the first capital of Assyria Its city god may have become the national god on that account At an early period perhaps a thousand years before Thothmes III battled with the Mitannians in northern Syria an early wave of one of the peoples of Aryan speech may have occupied the Assyrian cities mister Johns points out in this connection that the names of Ushpia Kikia and Adasi who according to Assyrian records were early rulers in Asshur are neither Semitic nor Sumerian An ancient name of the goddess of Nineveh was Shaushka which compares with Shaushkash the consort of Teshup the Hittite Mitanni hammer god As many of the Mitannian names are according to mister Johns really Elamitic he suggests an ethnic connection between the early conquerors of Assyria and the people of Elam three hundred Were the pre Semitic Elamites originally speakers of an agglutinative language like the Sumerians and present day Basques who were conquered in prehistoric times by a people of Aryan speech The possibility is urged by mister Johns s suggestion that Assyria may have been dominated in pre Semitic times by the congeners of the Aryan military aristocracy of Mitanni As has been shown it was Semitized by the Amoritic migration which about two thousand B C brought into prominence the Hammurabi Dynasty of Babylon A long list of kings with Semitic names held sway in the Assyrian cities during and after the Hammurabi Age But not until well on in the Kassite period did any of them attain prominence in Western Asia Then Ashur bel nish eshu King of Asshur was strong enough to deal on equal terms with the Kassite ruler Kara indash I with whom he arranged a boundary treaty He was a contemporary of Thothmes III of Egypt After Thothmes III had secured the predominance of Egypt in Syria and Palestine he recognized Assyria as an independent power and supplied its king with Egyptian gold to assist him no doubt in strengthening his territory against their common enemy Gifts were also sent from Assyria to Egypt to fan the flame of cordial relations The situation was full of peril for Saushatar king of Mitanni Deprived by Egypt of tribute paying cities in Syria his exchequer must have been sadly depleted A standing army had to be maintained for although Egypt made no attempt to encroach further on his territory the Hittites were ever hovering on his north western frontier ready when opportunity offered to win back Cappadocia Eastward Assyria was threatening to become a dangerous rival He had himself to pay tribute to Egypt and Egypt was subsidizing his enemy It was imperative on his part therefore to take action without delay The power of Assyria had to be crippled its revenues were required for the Mitannian exchequer So Saushatar raided Assyria during the closing years of the reign of Thothmes III or soon after his successor Amenhotep II ascended the Egyptian throne Nothing is known from contemporary records regarding this campaign but it can be gathered from the references of a later period that the city of Asshur was captured and plundered its king Ashur nadin akhe ceased corresponding and exchanging gifts with Egypt That Nineveh also fell is made clear by the fact that a descendant of Saushatar Tushratta was able to send to a descendant of Thothmes III at Thebes Amenhotep III the image of Ishtar Shaushka of Nineveh Apparently five successive Mitannian kings were overlords of Assyria during a period which cannot be estimated at much less than a hundred years Our knowledge regarding these events is derived chiefly from the Tell el Amarna letters and the tablets found by Professor Hugo Winckler at Boghaz Koei in Cappadocia Asia Minor The Tell el Amarna letters were discovered among the ruins of the palace of the famous Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaton of the Eighteenth Dynasty who died about thirteen fifty eight B C During the winter of eighteen eighty seven eight an Egyptian woman was excavating soil for her garden when she happened upon the cellar of Akhenaton s foreign office in which the official correspondence had been stored The letters were baked clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform alphabetical signs in the Babylonian Assyrian language which like French in modern times was the language of international diplomacy for many centuries in Western Asia after the Hyksos period The Egyptian natives ever so eager to sell antiquities so as to make a fortune and retire for life offered some specimens of the tablets for sale One or two were sent to Paris where they were promptly declared to be forgeries with the result that for a time the inscribed bricks were not a marketable commodity Ere their value was discovered the natives had packed them into sacks with the result that many were damaged and some completely destroyed At length however the majority of them reached the British Museum and the Berlin Museum while others drifted into the museums at Cairo saint Petersburg and Paris When they were deciphered Mitanni was discovered and a flood of light thrown on the internal affairs of Egypt and its relations with various kingdoms in Asia while glimpses were also afforded of the life and manners of the times The letters covered the reigns of Amenhotep III the great grandson of Thothmes III and of his son Akhenaton the dreamer king and included communications from the kings of Babylonia Assyria Mitanni Cyprus the Hittites and the princes of Phoenicia and Canaan The copies of two letters from Amenhotep III to Kallima Sin King of Babylonia had also been preserved One deals with statements made by Babylonian ambassadors whom the Pharaoh stigmatizes as liars Kallima Sin had sent his daughter to the royal harem of Egypt and desired to know if she was alive and well He also asked for much gold to enable him to carry on the work of extending his temple When twenty minas of gold was sent to him he complained in due course that the quantity received was not only short but that the gold was not pure it had been melted in the furnace and less than five minas came out In return he sent to Akhenaton two minas of enamel and some jewels for his daughter who was in the Egyptian royal harem Ashur uballit king of Ashur once wrote intimating to Akhenaton that he was gifting him horses and chariots and a jewel seal He asked for gold to assist in building his palace In your country he added gold is as plentiful as dust He also made an illuminating statement to the effect that no ambassador had gone from Assyria to Egypt since the days of his ancestor Ashur nadin akhe It would therefore appear that Ashur uballit had freed part of Assyria from the yoke of Mitanni The contemporary king of Mitanni was Tushratta He corresponded both with his cousin Amenhotep III and his son in law Akhenaton In his correspondence with Amenhotep III Tushratta tells that his kingdom had been invaded by the Hittites but his god Teshup had delivered them into his hand and he destroyed them not one of them he declared returned to his own country Out of the booty captured he sent Amenhotep several chariots and horses and a boy and a girl To his sister Gilu khipa who was one of the Egyptian Pharaoh s wives he gifted golden ornaments and a jar of oil In another letter Tushratta asked for a large quantity of gold without measure He complained that he did not receive enough on previous occasions and hinted that some of the Egyptian gold looked as if it were alloyed with copper Like the Assyrian king he hinted that gold was as plentiful as dust in Egypt His own presents to the Pharaoh included precious stones gold ornaments chariots and horses and women probably slaves This may have been tribute It was during the third Amenhotep s illness that Tushratta forwarded the Nineveh image of Ishtar to Egypt and he made reference to its having been previously sent thither by his father Sutarna When Akhenaton came to the throne Tushratta wrote to him desiring to continue the friendship which had existed for two or three generations between the kings of Mitanni and Egypt and made complimentary references to the distinguished Queen Tiy Akhenaton s mother who evidently exercised considerable influence in shaping Egypt s foreign policy In the course of his long correspondence with the Pharaohs Tushratta made those statements regarding his ancestors which have provided so much important data for modern historians of his kingdom During the early part of the Tell el Amarna period Mitanni was the most powerful kingdom in Western Asia It was chiefly on that account that the daughters of its rulers were selected to be the wives and mothers of great Egyptian Pharaohs But its numerous enemies were ever plotting to accomplish its downfall Among these the foremost and most dangerous were the Hittites and the Assyrians The ascendancy of the Hittites was achieved in northern Syria with dramatic suddenness There arose in Asia Minor a great conqueror named Subbi luliuma the successor of Hattusil I who established a strong Hittite empire which endured for about two centuries His capital was at Boghaz Koei Sweeping through Cappadocia at the head of a finely organized army remarkable for its mobility he attacked the buffer states which owed allegiance to Mitanni and Egypt City after city fell before him until at length he invaded Mitanni but it is uncertain whether or not Tushratta met him in battle Large numbers of the Mitannians were however evicted and transferred to the land of the Hittites where the Greeks subsequently found them and where they are believed to be represented by the modern Kurds the hereditary enemies of the Armenians In the confusion which ensued Tushratta was murdered by Sutarna II who was recognized by Subbi luliuma The crown prince Mattiuza fled to Babylon where he found protection but was unable to receive any assistance Ultimately when the Hittite emperor had secured his sway over northern Syria he deposed Sutarna II and set Mattiuza as his vassal on the throne of the shrunken Mitanni kingdom Meanwhile the Egyptian empire in Asia had gone to pieces When Akhenaton the dreamer king died in his palace at Tell el Amarna the Khabiri were conquering the Canaanite cities which had paid him tribute and the Hittite ruler was the acknowledged overlord of the Amorites The star of Assyria was also in the ascendant Its king Ashur uballit who had corresponded with Akhenaton was like the Hittite king Subbi luliuma a distinguished statesman and general and similarly laid the foundations of a great empire Before or after Subbi luliuma invaded Tushratta s domains he drove the Mitannians out of Nineveh and afterwards overcame the Shubari tribes of Mitanni on the north west with the result that he added a wide extent of territory to his growing empire He had previously thrust southward the Assyro Babylonian frontier In fact he had become so formidable an opponent of Babylonia that his daughter had been accepted as the wife of Karakhardash the Kassite king of that country In time his grandson Kadashman Kharbe ascended the Babylonian throne This young monarch company operated with his grandfather in suppressing the Suti who infested the trade routes towards the west and plundered the caravans of merchants and the messengers of great monarchs with persistent impunity A reference to these bandits appears in one of the Tell el Amarna letters Writing to Akhenaton Ashur uballit said The lands of Assyria and Egypt are remote therefore let our messengers come and go That your messengers were late in reaching you the reason is that if the Suti had waylaid them they would have been dead men For if I had sent them the Suti would have sent bands to waylay them therefore I have retained them My messengers however may they not for this reason be delayed three hundred one Ashur uballit s grandson extended his Babylonian frontier into Amurru where he dug wells and erected forts to protect traders The Kassite aristocracy however appear to have entertained towards him a strong dislike perhaps because he was so closely associated with their hereditary enemies the Assyrians He had not reigned for long when the embers of rebellion burst into flame and he was murdered in his palace The Kassites then selected as their king a man of humble origin named Nazibugash who was afterwards referred to as the son of nobody Ashur uballit deemed the occasion a fitting one to interfere in the affairs of Babylonia He suddenly appeared at the capital with a strong army overawed the Kassites and seized and slew Nazibugash Then he set on the throne his great grandson the infant Kurigalzu II who lived to reign for fifty five years Ashur uballit appears to have died soon after this event He was succeeded by his son Bel nirari who carried on the policy of strengthening and extending the Assyrian empire For many years he maintained excellent relations with his kinsman Kurigalzu II but ultimately they came into conflict apparently over disputed territory A sanguinary battle was fought in which the Babylonians suffered heavily and were put to rout A treaty of peace was afterwards arranged which secured for the Assyrians a further extension of their frontier from the borders of Mitanni as far as Babylonia The struggle of the future was to be for the possession of Mesopotamia so as to secure control over the trade routes Thus Assyria rose from a petty state in a comparatively brief period to become the rival of Babylonia at a time when Egypt at the beginning of its Nineteenth Dynasty was endeavouring to win back its lost empire in Syria and the Hittite empire was being consolidated in the north CHAPTER XIII ASTROLOGY AND ASTRONOMY Culture and Superstition Primitive Star

only satisfied personal ambition and afforded protection for industrious traders and workers but also incidentally promoted culture and endowed research When a conqueror returned to his capital laden with treasure he made generous gifts to the temples He believed that his successes were rewards for his piety that his battles were won for him by his god or goddess of war It was necessary therefore that he should continue to find favour in the eyes of the deity who had been proved to be more powerful than the god of his enemies Besides he had to make provision during his absence on long campaigns or while absorbed in administrative work for the constant performance of religious rites so that the various deities of water earth weather and corn might be sustained or propitiated with sacrificial offerings or held in magical control by the performance of ceremonial rites Consequently an endowed priesthood became a necessity in all powerful and well organized states Thus came into existence in Babylonia as elsewhere as a result of the accumulation of wealth a leisured official class whose duties tended to promote intellectual activity although they were primarily directed to perpetuate gross superstitious practices Culture was really a by product of temple activities it flowed forth like pure gold from furnaces of thought which were walled up by the crude ores of magic and immemorial tradition No doubt in ancient Babylonia as in Europe during the Middle Ages the men of refinement and intellect among the upper classes were attracted to the temples while the more robust types preferred the outdoor life and especially the life of the soldier three hundred two The permanent triumphs of Babylonian civilization were achieved either by the priests or in consequence of the influence they exercised They were the grammarians and the scribes the mathematicians and the philosophers of that ancient country the teachers of the young and the patrons of the arts and crafts It was because the temples were centres of intellectual activity that the Sumerian language remained the language of culture for long centuries after it ceased to be the everyday speech of the people Reference has already been made to the growth of art and the probability that all the arts had their origin in magical practices and to the growth of popular education necessitated by the centralization of business in the temples It remains with us to deal now with priestly contributions to the more abstruse sciences In India the ritualists among the Brahmans who concerned themselves greatly regarding the exact construction and measurements of altars gave the world algebra the pyramid builders of Egypt who erected vast tombs to protect royal mummies had perforce to lay the groundwork of the science of geometry and the Babylonian priests who elaborated the study of astrology became great astronomers because they found it necessary to observe and record accurately the movements of the heavenly bodies From the earliest times of which we have knowledge the religious beliefs of the Sumerians had vague stellar associations But it does not follow that their myths were star myths to begin with A people who called constellations the ram the bull the lion or the scorpion did not do so because astral groups suggested the forms of animals but rather because the animals had an earlier connection with their religious life At the same time it should be recognized that the mystery of the stars must ever have haunted the minds of primitive men Night with all its terrors appealed more strongly to their imaginations than refulgent day when they felt more secure they were concerned most regarding what they feared most Brooding in darkness regarding their fate they evidently associated the stars with the forces which influenced their lives the ghosts of ancestors of totems the spirits that brought food or famine and controlled the seasons As children see images in a fire so they saw human life reflected in the starry sky To the simple minds of early folks the great moon seemed to be the parent of the numerous twinkling and moving orbs In Babylon indeed the moon was regarded as the father not only of the stars but of the sun also there as elsewhere lunar worship was older than solar worship Primitive beliefs regarding the stars were of similar character in various parts of the world But the importance which they assumed in local mythologies depended in the first place on local phenomena On the northern Eur Asian steppes for instance where stars vanished during summer s blue nights and were often obscured by clouds in winter they did not impress men s minds so persistently and deeply as in Babylonia where for the greater part of the year they gleamed in darkness through a dry transparent atmosphere with awesome intensity The development of an elaborate system of astral myths besides was only possible in a country where the people had attained to a high degree of civilization and men enjoyed leisure and security to make observations and compile records It is not surprising therefore to find that Babylonia was the cradle of astronomy But before this science had destroyed the theory which it was fostered to prove it lay smothered for long ages in the debris of immemorial beliefs It is necessary therefore in dealing with Babylonian astral myths to endeavour to approach within reasonable distance of the point of view or points of view of the people who framed them Babylonian religious thought was of highly complex character Its progress was ever hampered by blended traditions The earliest settlers in the Tigro Euphrates valley no doubt imported many crude beliefs which they had inherited from their Palaeolithic ancestors the modes of thought which were the moulds of new theories arising from new experiences When consideration is given to the existing religious beliefs of various peoples throughout the world in low stages of culture it is found that the highly developed creeds of Babylonia Egypt and other countries where civilization flourished were never divested wholly of their primitive traits Among savage peoples two grades of religious ideas have been identified and classified as Naturalism and Animism In the plane of Naturalism the belief obtains that a vague impersonal force which may have more than one manifestation and is yet manifested in everything controls the world and the lives of human beings An illustration of this stage of religious consciousness is afforded by mister Risley who in dealing with the religion of the jungle dwellers of Chota Nagpur India says that in most cases the indefinite something which they fear and attempt to propitiate is not a person at all in any sense of the word if one must state the case in positive terms I should say that the idea which lies at the root of their religion is that of a power rather than many powers three hundred three Traces of Naturalism appear to have survived in Sumeria in the belief that the spiritual the Zi was that which manifested life The test of the manifestation of life was movement three hundred four All things that moved it was conceived in the plane of Naturalism possessed self power the river was a living thing as was also the fountain a stone that fell from a hill fell of its own accord a tree groaned because the wind caused it to suffer pain This idea that inanimate objects had conscious existence survived in the religion of the Aryo Indians In the Nala story of the Indian epic the Mahabharata the disconsolate wife Damayanti addresses a mountain when searching for her lost husband This the monarch of all mountains ask I of the king of men O all honoured Prince of Mountains with thy heavenward soaring peaks Hast thou seen the kingly Nala in this dark and awful wood Why repliest thou not O Mountain She similarly addresses the Asoka tree Hast thou seen Nishadha s monarch hast thou seen my only love That I may depart ungrieving fair Asoka answer me Many a tree she stood and gazed on three hundred five It will be recognized that when primitive men gave names to mountains rivers or the ocean these possessed for them a deeper significance than they do for us at the present day The earliest peoples of Indo European speech who called the sky dyeus and those of Sumerian speech who called it ana regarded it not as the sky and nothing more but as something which had conscious existence and self power Our remote ancestors resembled in this respect those imaginative children who hold conversations with articles of furniture and administer punishment to stones which they believe have tripped them up voluntarily and with desire to commit an offence In this early stage of development the widespread totemic beliefs appear to have had origin Families or tribes believed that they were descended from mountains trees or wild animals Aesop s fable about the mountain which gave birth to a mouse may be a relic of Totemism so also may be the mountain symbols on the standards of Egyptian ships which appear on pre dynastic pottery the black dwarfs of Teutonic mythology were earth children three hundred six Adonis sprang from a tree his mother may have according to primitive belief been simply a tree Dagda the patriarchal Irish corn god was an oak indeed the idea of a world tree which occurs in Sumerian Vedic Indian Teutonic and other mythologies was probably a product of Totemism Wild animals were considered to be other forms of human beings who could marry princes and princesses as they do in so many fairy tales Damayanti addressed the tiger as well as the mountain and tree saying I approach him without fear Of the beasts art thou the monarch all this forest thy domain Thou O king of beasts console me if my Nala thou hast seen three hundred seven A tribal totem exercised sway over a tribal district In Egypt as Herodotus recorded the crocodile was worshipped in one district and hunted down in another Tribes fought against tribes when totemic animals were slain The Babylonian and Indian myths about the conflicts between eagles and serpents may have originated as records of battles between eagle clans and serpent clans Totemic animals were tabooed The Set pig of Egypt and the devil pig of Ireland Scotland and Wales were not eaten except sacrificially Families were supposed to be descended from swans and were named Swans or from seals and were named Seals like the Gaelic Mac Codrums whose surname signifies son of the seal the nickname of the Campbells sons of the pig may refer to their totemic boar s head crest which commemorated the slaying perhaps the sacrificial slaying of the boar by their ancestor Diarmid mister Garstang in The Syrian Goddess thinks it possible that the boar which killed Adonis was of totemic origin So may have been the fish form of the Sumerian god Ea When an animal totem was sacrificed once a year and eaten sacrificially so that the strength of the clan might be maintained the priest who wrapped himself in its skin was supposed to have transmitted to him certain magical powers he became identified with the totem and prophesied and gave instruction as the totem Ea was depicted clad in the fish s skin Animism the other early stage of human development also produced distinctive modes of thought Men conceived that the world swarmed with spirits that a spirit groaned in the wind shaken tree that the howling wind was an invisible spirit that there were spirits in fountains rivers valleys hills and in ocean and in all animals and that a hostile spirit might possess an individual and change his nature The sun and the moon were the abodes of spirits or the vessels in which great spirits sailed over the sea of the sky the stars were all spirits the host of heaven These spirits existed in groups of seven or groups of three and the multiple of three or in pairs or operated as single individuals Although certain spirits might confer gifts upon mankind they were at certain seasons and in certain localities hostile and vengeful like the grass green fairies in winter or the earth black elves when their gold was sought for in forbidden and secret places These spirits were the artisans of creation and vegetation like the Egyptian Khnumu and the Indian Rhibus they fashioned the grass blades and the stalks of corn but at times of seasonal change they might ride on their tempest steeds or issue forth from flooding rivers and lakes Man was greatly concerned about striking bargains with them to secure their services and about propitiating them or warding off their attacks with protective charms and by performing ceremonies of riddance The ghosts of the dead being spirits were similarly propitious or harmful on occasion as emissaries of Fate they could injure the living Ancestor worship the worship of ghosts had origin in the stage of Animism But ancestor worship was not developed in Babylonia as in China for instance although traces of it survived in the worship of stars as ghosts in the deification of kings and the worship of patriarchs who might be exalted as gods or identified with a supreme god The Egyptian Pharaoh Unas became the sun god and the constellation of Orion by devouring his predecessors three hundred eight He ate his god as a tribe ate its animal totem he became the bull of heaven There were star totems as well as mountain totems A saint Andrew s cross sign on one of the Egyptian ship standards referred to may represent a star The Babylonian goddess Ishtar was symbolized as a star and she was the world mother Many primitive currents of thought shaped the fretted rocks of ancient mythologies In various countries all round the globe the belief prevailed that the stars were ghosts of the mighty dead of giants kings or princes or princesses or of pious people whom the gods loved or of animals which were worshipped A few instances may be selected at random When the Teutonic gods slew the giant Thjasse he appeared in the heavens as Sirius In India the ghosts of the seven Rishis who were semi divine Patriarchs formed the constellation of the Great Bear which in Vedic times was called the seven bears The wives of the seven Rishis were the stars of the Pleiades In Greece the Pleiades were the ghosts of the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione and in Australia they were and are a queen and six handmaidens In these countries as elsewhere stories were told to account for the lost Pleiad a fact which suggests that primitive men were more constant observers of the heavenly bodies than might otherwise be supposed The Arcadians believed that they were descended as Hesiod recorded from a princess who was transformed by Zeus into a bear in this form Artemis slew her and she became the Great Bear of the sky The Egyptian Isis was the star Sirius whose rising coincided with the beginning of the Nile inundation Her first tear for the dead Osiris fell into the river on the night of the drop The flood which ensued brought the food supply Thus the star was not only the Great Mother of all but the sustainer of all The brightest stars were regarded as being the greatest and most influential In Babylonia all the planets were identified with great deities Jupiter for instance was Merodach and one of the astral forms of Ishtar was Venus Merodach was also connected with the fish of Ea Pisces so that it is not improbable that Ea worship had stellar associations Constellations were given recognition before the planets were identified A strange blending of primitive beliefs occurred when the deities were given astral forms As has been shown Chapter III gods were supposed to die annually The Egyptian priests pointed out to Herodotus the grave of Osiris and also his star There are giants graves also in those countries in which the gods were simply ferocious giants A god might assume various forms he might take the form of an insect like Indra and hide in a plant or become a mouse or a serpent like the gods of Erech in the Gilgamesh epic The further theory that a god could exist in various forms at one and the same time suggests that it had its origin among a people who accepted the idea of a personal god while yet in the stage of Naturalism In Egypt Osiris for instance was the moon which came as a beautiful child each month and was devoured as the wasting old moon by the demon Set he was the young god who was slain in his prime each year he was at once the father husband and son of Isis he was the Patriarch who reigned over men and became the Judge of the Dead he was the earth spirit he was the bisexual Nile spirit he was the spring sun he was the Apis bull of Memphis and the ram of Mendes he was the reigning Pharaoh In his fusion with Ra who was threefold Khepera Ra and Tum he died each day as an old man he appeared in heaven at night as the constellation Orion which was his ghost or was perhaps rather the Sumerian Zi the spiritual essence of life Osiris who resembled Tammuz a god of many forms also was addressed as follows in one of the Isis chants There proceedeth from thee the strong Orion in heaven at evening at the resting of every day Lo it is I Isis at the approach of the Sothis Sirius period who doth watch for him the child Osiris Nor will I leave off watching for him for that which proceedeth from thee the living Osiris is revered An emanation from thee causeth life to gods and men reptiles and animals and they live by means thereof Come thou to us from thy chamber in the day when thy soul begetteth emanations The day when offerings upon offerings are made to thy spirit which causeth the gods and men likewise to live three hundred nine This extract emphasizes how unsafe it is to confine certain deities within narrow limits by terming them simply solar gods lunar gods astral gods or earth gods One deity may have been simultaneously a sun god and moon god an air god and an earth god one who was dead and also alive unborn and also old The priests of Babylonia and Egypt were less accustomed to concrete and logical definitions than their critics and expositors of the twentieth century Simple explanations of ancient beliefs are often by reason of their very simplicity highly improbable Recognition must ever be given to the puzzling complexity of religious thought in Babylonia and Egypt and to the possibility that even to the priests the doctrines of a particular cult which embraced the accumulated ideas of centuries were invariably confusing and vague and full of inconsistencies they were mystical in the sense that the understanding could not grasp them although it permitted their acceptance A god for instance might be addressed at once in the singular and plural perhaps because he had developed from an animistic group of spirits or perhaps for reasons we cannot discover This is shown clearly by the following pregnant extract from a Babylonian tablet Powerful O Sevenfold one are ye mister L W King the translator comments upon it as follows There is no doubt that the name was applied to a group of gods who were so closely connected that though addressed in the plural they could in the same sentence be regarded as forming a single personality three hundred ten Like the Egyptian Osiris the Babylonian Merodach was a highly complex deity He was the son of Ea god of the deep he died to give origin to human life when he commanded that his head should be cut off so that the first human beings might be fashioned by mixing his blood with the earth he was the wind god who gave the air of life he was the deity of thunder and the sky he was the sun of spring in his Tammuz character he was the daily sun and the planets Jupiter and Mercury as well as Sharru Regulus he had various astral associations at various seasons Ishtar the goddess was Iku Capella the water channel star in January February and Merodach was Iku in May June This strange system of identifying the chief deity with different stars at different periods or simultaneously must not be confused with the monotheistic identification of him with other gods Merodach changed his forms with Ishtar and had similarly many forms This goddess for instance was even when connected with one particular heavenly body liable to change According to a tablet fragment she was as the planet Venus a female at sunset and a male at sunrise three hundred eleven that is a bisexual deity like Nannar of Ur the father and mother deity combined and Isis of Egypt Nannar is addressed in a famous hymn Father Nannar Lord God Sin ruler among the gods Mother body which produceth all things Merciful gracious Father in whose hand the life of the whole land is contained One of the Isis chants of Egypt sets forth addressing Osiris There cometh unto thee Isis lady of the horizon who hath begotten herself alone in the image of the gods She hath taken vengeance before Horus the woman who was made a male by her father Osiris three hundred twelve Merodach like Osiris Sokar was a lord of many existences and likewise the mysterious one he who is unknown to mankind three hundred thirteen It was impossible for the human mind a greater than itself to know Evidence has not yet been forthcoming to enable us to determine the period at which the chief Babylonian deities were identified with the planets but it is clear that Merodach s ascendancy in astral form could not have occurred prior to the rise of that city god of Babylon as chief of the pantheon by displacing Enlil At the same time it must be recognized that long before the Hammurabi age the star gazers of the Tigro Euphrates valley must have been acquainted with the movements of the chief planets and stars and no doubt they connected them with seasonal changes as in Egypt where Isis was identified with Sirius long before the Ptolemaic age when Babylonian astronomy was imported Horus was identified not only with the sun but also with Saturn Jupiter and Mars three hundred fourteen Even the primitive Australians as has been indicated have their star myths they refer to the stars Castor and Pollux as two young men like the ancient Greeks while the African Bushmen assert that these stars are two girls It would be a mistake however to assume that the prehistoric Sumerians were exact astronomers Probably they were like the Aryo Indians of the Vedic period not very accurate observers three hundred fifteen It is of special interest to find that the stars were grouped by the Babylonians at the earliest period in companies of seven The importance of this magical number is emphasized by the group of seven demons which rose from the deep to rage over the land p seventy one Perhaps the sanctity of Seven was suggested by Orion the Bears and the Pleiad one of which constellations may have been the Sevenfold deity addressed as one At any rate arbitrary groupings of other stars into companies of seven took place for references are made to the seven Tikshi the seven Lumashi and the seven Mashi which are older than the signs of the Zodiac so far as can be ascertained these groups were selected from various constellations When the five planets were identified they were associated with the sun and moon and connected with the chief gods of the Hammurabi pantheon A bilingual list in the British Museum arranges the sevenfold planetary group in the following order The moon Sin The sun Shamash Jupiter Merodach Venus Ishtar Saturn Ninip Nirig Mercury Nebo Mars Nergal An ancient name of the moon was Aa A or Ai which recalls the Egyptian Aah or Ah The Sumerian moon was Aku the measurer like Thoth of Egypt who in his lunar character as a Fate measured out the lives of men and was a god of architects mathematicians and scribes The moon was the parent of the sun or its spouse and might be male or female or both as a bisexual deity As the bull of light Jupiter had solar associations he was also the shepherd of the stars a title shared by Tammuz as Orion Nin Girsu a developed form of Tammuz was identified with both Orion and Jupiter Ishtar s identification with Venus is of special interest When that planet was at its brightest phase its rays were referred to as the beard of the goddess she was the bearded Aphrodite a bisexual deity evidently The astrologers regarded the bright Venus as lucky and the rayless Venus as unlucky Saturn was Nirig who is best known as Ninip a deity who was displaced by Enlil the elder Bel and afterwards regarded as his son His story has not been recovered but from the references made to it there is little doubt that it was a version of the widespread myth about the elder deity who was slain by his son as Saturn was by Jupiter and Dyaus by Indra It may have resembled the lost Egyptian myth which explained the existence of the two Horuses Horus the elder and Horus the posthumous son of Osiris At any rate it is of interest to find in this connection that in Egypt the planet Saturn was Her Ka Horus the Bull Ninip was also identified with the bull Both deities were also connected with the spring sun like Tammuz and were terrible slayers of their enemies Ninip raged through Babylonia like a storm flood and Horus swept down the Nile slaying the followers of Set As the divine sower of seed Ninip may have developed from Tammuz as Horus did from Osiris Each were at once the father and the son different forms of the same deity at various seasons of the year The elder god was displaced by the son spring and when the son grew old his son slew him in turn As the planet Saturn Ninip was the ghost of the elder god and as the son of Bel he was the solar war god of spring the great wild bull the god of fertility He was also as Ber lord of the wild boar an animal associated with Rimmon three hundred sixteen Nebo Nabu who was identified with Mercury was a god of Borsippa He was a messenger and announcer of the gods as the Egyptian Horus in his connection with Jupiter was Her ap sheta Horus the opener of that which is secret three hundred seventeen Nebo s original character is obscure He appears to have been a highly developed deity of a people well advanced in civilization when he was exalted as the divine patron of Borsippa Although Hammurabi ignored him he was subsequently invoked with Merodach and had probably much in common with Merodach Indeed Merodach was also identified with the planet Mercury Like the Greek Hermes Nebo was a messenger of the gods and an instructor of mankind Jastrow regards him as a counterpart of Ea and says Like Ea he is the embodiment and source of wisdom The art of writing and therefore of all literature is more particularly associated with him A common form of his name designates him as the god of the stylus three hundred eighteen He appears also to have been a developed form of Tammuz who was an incarnation of Ea Professor Pinches shows that one of his names Mermer was also a non Semitic name of Ramman three hundred nineteen Tammuz resembled Ramman in his character as a spring god of war It would seem that Merodach as Jupiter displaced at Babylon Nebo as Saturn the elder god as Bel Enlil displaced the elder Ninip at Nippur The god of Mars was Nergal the patron deity of Cuthah three hundred twenty who descended into the Underworld and forced into submission Eresh ki gal Persephone with whom he was afterwards associated His name says Professor Pinches is supposed to mean lord of the great habitation which would be a parallel to that of his spouse Eresh ki gal three hundred twenty one At Erech he symbolized the destroying influence of the sun and was accompanied by the demons of pestilence Mars was a planet of evil plague and death its animal form was the wolf In Egypt it was called Herdesher the Red Horus and in Greece it was associated with Ares the Roman Mars the war god who assumed his boar form to slay Adonis Tammuz Nergal was also a fire god like the Aryo Indian Agni who as has been shown links with Tammuz as a demon slayer and a god of fertility It may be that Nergal was a specialized form of Tammuz who in a version of the myth was reputed to have entered the Underworld as a conqueror when claimed by Eresh ki gal and to have become like Osiris the lord of the dead If so Nergal was at once the slayer and the slain The various Babylonian deities who were identified with the planets had their characters sharply defined as members of an organized pantheon But before this development took place certain of the prominent heavenly bodies perhaps all the planets were evidently regarded as manifestations of one deity the primeval Tammuz who was a form of Ea or of the twin deities Ea and Anu Tammuz may have been the sevenfold one of the hymns At a still earlier period the stars were manifestations of the Power whom the jungle dwellers of Chota Nagpur attempt to propitiate the world soul of the cultured Brahmans of the post Vedic Indian Age As much is suggested by the resemblances which the conventionalized planetary deities bear to Tammuz whose attributes they symbolized and by the Egyptian conception that the sun Jupiter Saturn and Mars were manifestations of Horus Tammuz and Horus may have been personifications of the Power or World Soul vaguely recognized in the stage of Naturalism The influence of animistic modes of thought may be traced in the idea that the planets and stars were the ghosts of gods who were superseded by their sons These sons were identical with their fathers they became as in Egypt husbands of their mothers This idea was perpetuated in the Aryo Indian Laws of Manu in which it is set forth that the husband after conception by his wife becomes an embryo and is born again of her three hundred twenty two The deities died every year but death was simply change Yet they remained in the separate forms they assumed in their progress round the wide circle of necessity Horus was remembered as various planets as the falcon as the elder sun god and as the son of Osiris and Tammuz was the spring sun the child youth warrior the deity of fertility and the lord of death Orion Nergal and as has been suggested all the planets The stars were also the ghosts of deities who died daily When the sun perished as an old man at evening it rose in the heavens as Orion or went out and in among the stars as the shepherd of the flock Jupiter the planet of Merodach in Babylonia and Attis in Asia Minor The flock was the group of heavenly spirits invisible by day the host of heaven manifestations or ghosts of the emissaries of the controlling power or powers The planets presided over various months of the year Sin the moon was associated with the third month it also controlled the calendar Ninip Saturn was associated with the fourth month Ishtar Venus with the sixth Shamash the sun with the seventh Merodach Jupiter with the eighth Nergal Mars with the ninth and a messenger of the gods probably Nebo Mercury with the tenth Each month was also controlled by a zodiacal constellation In the Creation myth of Babylon it is stated that when Merodach engaged in the work of setting the Universe in order he set all the great gods in their several stations and also created their images the stars of the Zodiac three hundred twenty three and fixed them all p one hundred forty seven Our signs of the Zodiac are of Babylonian origin They were passed on to the Greeks by the Phoenicians and Hittites There was a time says Professor Sayce when the Hittites were profoundly affected by Babylonian civilization religion and art They carried the time worn civilizations of Babylonia and Egypt to the furthest boundary of Egypt and there handed them over to the West in the grey dawn of European history Greek traditions affirmed that the rulers of Mykenae had come from Lydia bringing with them the civilization and treasures of Asia Minor The tradition has been confirmed by modern research While certain elements belonging to the prehistoric culture of Greece as revealed at Mykenae and elsewhere were derived from Egypt and Phoenicia there are others which point to Asia Minor as their source And the culture of Asia Minor was Hittite three hundred twenty four The early Babylonian astronomers did not know of course that the earth revolved round the sun They believed that the sun travelled across the heavens flying like a bird or sailing like a boat three hundred twenty five In studying its movements they observed that it always travelled from west to east along a broad path swinging from side to side of it in the course of the year This path is the Zodiac the celestial circle of necessity The middle line of the sun s path is the Ecliptic The Babylonian scientists divided the Ecliptic into twelve equal parts and grouped in each part the stars which formed their constellations these are also called Signs of the Zodiac Each month had thus its sign or constellation The names borne at the present day by the signs of the Zodiac are easily remembered even by children who are encouraged to repeat the following familiar lines The Ram the Bull the heavenly Twins And next the Crab the Lion shines The Virgin and the Scales The Scorpion Archer and Sea goat The man that holds the water pot And Fish with glitt ring three hundred twenty six tails The table on p three hundred eight shows that our signs are derived from ancient Babylonia The celestial regions were also divided into three or more parts Three fields were allotted to the ancient triad formed by Ea Anu and Bel The zodiacal path ran through these fields Ea s field was in the west and was associated with Amurru the land of the Amorites Anu s field was in the south and was associated with Elam and Bel s central field was associated with the land of Akkad When the rulers of Akkad called themselves kings of the four quarters the reference was to the countries associated with the three divine fields and to Gutium three hundred twenty seven east our north east Was Gutium associated with demons as in Scandinavia the north east

Aquarius the nineteenth January Sebat God with water urn Water Carrier Jan Feb Pisces the eighteenth February Adar Fish tails in canal Fishes Feb March The Babylonian Creation myth states that Merodach having fixed the stars of the Zodiac made three stars for each month p one hundred forty seven mister Robert Brown jun who has dealt as exhaustively with the astronomical problems of Babylonia as the available data permitted him is of opinion that the leading stars of three constellations are referred to viz one the central or zodiacal constellations two the northern constellations and three the southern constellations We have thus a scheme of thirty six constellations The twelve zodiacal stars were flanked on either side by twelve non zodiacal stars mister Brown quotes Diodorus who gave a resume of Babylonian astronomico astrology in this connection He said that the five planets were called Interpreters and in subjection to these were marshalled Thirty Stars which were styled Divinities of the Council The chiefs of the Divinities are twelve in number to each of whom they assign a month and one of the twelve signs of the Zodiac Through these twelve signs sun moon and planets run their courses And with the zodiacal circle they mark out twenty four stars half of which they say are arranged in the north and half in the south three hundred twenty eight mister Brown shows that the thirty stars referred to constituted the original Euphratean Lunar Zodiac the parent of the seven ancient lunar zodiacs which have come down to us namely the Persian Sogdian Khorasmian Chinese Indian Arab and Coptic schemes The three constellations associated with each month had each a symbolic significance they reflected the characters of their months At the height of the rainy season for instance the month of Ramman the thunder god was presided over by the zodiacal constellation of the water urn the northern constellation Fish of the Canal and the southern the Horse In India the black horse was sacrificed at rain getting and fertility ceremonies The months of growth pestilence and scorching sun heat were in turn symbolized The Great Bear was the chariot Charles s Wain and the Milky Way the river of the high cloud the Celestial Euphrates as in Egypt it was the Celestial Nile Of special interest among the many problems presented by Babylonian astronomical lore is the theory of Cosmic periods or Ages of the Universe In the Indian Greek and Irish mythologies there are four Ages the Silvern white Golden yellow the Bronze red and the Iron black As has been already indicated mister R Brown jun shows that the Indian system of Yugas or ages of the world presents many features which forcibly remind us of the Euphratean scheme The Babylonians had ten antediluvian kings who were reputed to have reigned for vast periods the total of which amounted to one hundred twenty saroi or four hundred thirty two thousand years These figures at once recall the Indian Maha yuga of four million three hundred twenty thousand years four hundred thirty two thousand x ten Apparently the Babylonian and Indian systems of calculation were of common origin In both countries the measurements of time and space were arrived at by utilizing the numerals ten and six When primitive man began to count he adopted a method which comes naturally to every schoolboy he utilized his fingers Twice five gave him ten and from ten he progressed to twenty and then on to a hundred and beyond In making measurements his hands arms and feet were at his service We are still measuring by feet and yards standardized strides in this country while those who engage in the immemorial art of knitting and in doing so repeat designs found on neolithic pottery continue to measure in finger breadths finger lengths and hand breadths as did the ancient folks who called an arm length a cubit Nor has the span been forgotten especially by boys in their games with marbles the space from the end of the thumb to the end of the little finger when the hand is extended must have been an important measurement from the earliest times As he made progress in calculations the primitive Babylonian appears to have been struck by other details in his anatomy besides his sets of five fingers and five toes He observed for instance that his fingers were divided into three parts and his thumb into two parts only three hundred twenty nine four fingers multiplied by three gave him twelve and multiplying twelve by three he reached thirty six Apparently the figure six attracted him His body was divided into six parts two arms two legs the head and the trunk his two ears two eyes and mouth and nose also gave him six The basal six multiplied by his ten fingers gave him sixty and sixty x two for his two hands gave him one hundred twenty In Babylonian arithmetic six and sixty are important numbers and it is not surprising to find that in the system of numerals the signs for one and ten combined represent sixty In fixing the length of a mythical period his first great calculation of one hundred twenty came naturally to the Babylonian and when he undertook to measure the Zodiac he equated time and space by fixing on one hundred twenty degrees His first zodiac was the Sumerian lunar zodiac which contained thirty moon chambers associated with the Thirty Stars of the tablets and referred to by Diodorus as Divinities of the Council The chiefs of the Thirty numbered twelve In this system the year began in the winter solstice mister Hewitt has shown that the chief annual festival of the Indian Dravidians begins with the first full moon after the winter festival and mister Brown emphasizes the fact that the list of Tamil Dravidian lunar and solar months are named like the Babylonian constellations three hundred thirty Lunar chronology wrote Professor Max Mailer seems everywhere to have preceded solar chronology three hundred thirty one The later Semitic Babylonian system had twelve solar chambers and the thirty six constellations Each degree was divided into sixty minutes and each minute into sixty seconds The hours of the day and night each numbered twelve Multiplying six by ten pur the Babylonian arrived at sixty soss sixtyxten gave him six hundred ner and six hundredxsix three thousand six hundred sar while three thousand six hundredxten gave him thirty six thousand and thirty six thousandxtwelve four hundred thirty two thousand years or one hundred twenty saroi which is equal to the sar multiplied by the soss xtwo Pur signifies heap the ten fingers closed after being counted and ner signifies foot mister George Bertin suggests that when sixxten fingers gave sixty this number was multiplied by the ten toes with the result that six hundred was afterwards associated with the feet ner The Babylonian sign for ten resembles the impression of two feet with heels closed and toes apart This suggests a primitive record of the first round of finger counting In India this Babylonian system of calculation was developed during the Brahmanical period The four Yugas or Ages representing the four fingers used by the primitive mathematicians totalled twelve thousand divine years a period which was called a Maha yuga it equalled the Babylonian one hundred twenty saroi multiplied by one hundred Ten times a hundred of these periods gave a Day of Brahma Each day of the gods it was explained by the Brahmans was a year to mortals Multiplied by three hundred sixty days twelve thousand divine years equalled four million three hundred twenty thousand human years This Maha yuga multiplied by one thousand gave the Day of Brahma as four billion three hundred twenty million human years The shortest Indian Yuga is the Babylonian one hundred twenty saroi multiplied by ten twelve hundred divine years for the Kali Yuga twice that number gives the Dvapara Yuga of twenty four hundred divine years then the Treta Yuga is twenty four hundred twelve hundred three thousand six hundred divine years and Krita Yuga three thousand six hundred twelve hundred four thousand eight hundred divine years The influence of Babylonia is apparent in these calculations During the Vedic period Yuga usually signified a generation and there are no certain references to the four Ages as such The names Kali Dvapara Treta and Krita occur as the designations of throws of dice three hundred thirty two It was after the arrival of the late comers the post Vedic Aryans that the Yuga system was developed in India three hundred thirty three In Indian Myth and Legend three hundred thirty four it is shown that the Indian and Irish Ages have the same colour sequence one White or Silvern two Red or Bronze three Yellow or Golden and four Black or Iron The Greek order is one Golden two Silvern three Bronze and four Iron The Babylonians coloured the seven planets as follows the moon silvern the sun golden Mars red Saturn black Jupiter orange Venus yellow and Mercury blue As the ten antediluvian kings who reigned for one hundred twenty saroi had an astral significance their long reigns corresponding with the distances separating certain of the principal stars in or near the ecliptic three hundred thirty five it seems highly probable that the planets were similarly connected with mythical ages which were equated with the four quarters of the celestial regions and the four regions of the earth which in Gaelic story are called the four red divisions of the world Three of the planets may have been heralds of change Venus as Dilbat was the Proclaimer and both Jupiter and Mercury were called Face voices of light and Heroes of the rising sun among other names Jupiter may have been the herald of the Golden Age as a morning star This planet was also associated with bronze as Kakkub Urud the star of bronze while Mars was Kakkub Aban Kha urud the star of the bronze fish stone Mercury the lapis lazuli planet may have been connected with the black Saturn the ghost of the dead sun the demoniac elder god in Egypt lapis lazuli was the hair colour of Ra when he grew old and Egyptologists translate it as black three hundred thirty six The rare and regular appearances of Mercury may have suggested the planet s connection with a recurring Age Venus as an evening star might be regarded as the herald of the lunar or silver age she was propitious as a bearded deity and interchanged with Merodach as a seasonal herald Connecting Jupiter with the sun as a propitious planet and with Mars as a destroying planet Venus with the moon and Mercury with Saturn we have left four colour schemes which suggest the Golden Silvern Bronze and Iron Ages The Greek order of mythical ages may have had a solar significance beginning as it does with the golden period On the other hand the Indian and Irish systems begin with the Silvern or white lunar period In India the White Age Treta Yuga was the age of perfect men and in Greece the Golden Age was the age of men who lived like gods Thus the first ages in both cases were Perfect Ages The Bronze Age of Greece was the age of notorious fighters and takers of life in Babylonia the bronze planet Mars was the symbol of the destroying Nergal god of war and pestilence while Jupiter was also a destroyer as Merodach the slayer of Tiamat In India the Black Age is the age of wickedness The Babylonian Saturn as we have seen is black and its god Ninip was the destroying boar which recalls the black boar of the Egyptian demon or elder god Set The Greek Cronos was a destroyer even of his own children All the elder gods had demoniac traits like the ghosts of human beings As the Babylonian lunar zodiac was imported into India before solar worship and the solar zodiac were developed so too may have been the germs of the Yuga doctrine which appears to have a long history Greece on the other hand came under the influence of Babylon at a much later period In Egypt Ra the sun god was an antediluvian king and he was followed by Osiris Osiris was slain by Set who was depicted sometimes red and sometimes black There was also a Horus Age The Irish system of ages suggests an early cultural drift into Europe through Asia Minor and along the uplands occupied by the representatives of the Alpine or Armenoid peoples who have been traced from Hindu Kush to Brittany The culture of Gaul resembles that of India in certain particulars both the Gauls and the post Vedic Aryans for instance believed in the doctrine of Transmigration of Souls and practised suttee After the Roman occupation of Gaul Ireland appears to have been the refuge of Gaulish scholars who imported their beliefs and traditions and laid the foundations of that brilliant culture which shed lustre on the Green Isle in late Pagan and early Christian times The part played by the Mitanni people of Aryan speech in distributing Asiatic culture throughout Europe may have been considerable but we know little or nothing regarding their movements and influence nor has sufficient evidence been forthcoming to connect them with the cremating invaders of the Bronze Age who penetrated as far as northern Scotland and Scandinavia On the other hand it is certain that the Hittites adopted the planetary system of Babylonia and passed it on to Europeans including the Greeks The five planets Ninip Merodach Nergal Ishtar and Nebo were called by the Greeks after their gods Kronos Zeus Ares Aphrodite and Hermes and by the Romans Saturnus Jupiter Mars Venus and Mercurius It must be recognized however that these equations were somewhat arbitrary Ninip resembled Kronos and Saturnus as a father but he was also at the same time a son he was the Egyptian Horus the elder and Horus the younger in one Merodach was similarly of complex character a combination of Ea Anu Enlil and Tammuz who acquired when exalted by the Amoritic Dynasty of Babylon the attributes of the thunder god Adad Ramman in the form of Amurru lord of the mountains During the Hammurabi Age Amurru was significantly popular in personal names It is as Amurru Ramman that Merodach bears comparison with Zeus He also links with Hercules Too much must not be made therefore of the Greek and Roman identifications of alien deities with their own Mulla the Gaulish mule god may have resembled Mars somewhat but it is a far cry from Mars Mulla to Mars Nergal as it is also from the Gaulish Moccus the boar called Mercury to Nebo the god of culture who was the Mercury of the Tigro Euphrates valley Similarly the differences between Jupiter Amon of Egypt and Jupiter Merodach of Babylon were more pronounced than the resemblances The basal idea in Babylonian astrology appears to be the recognition of the astral bodies as spirits or fates who exercised an influence over the gods the world and mankind These were worshipped in groups when they were yet nameless The group addressed Powerful O sevenfold one are ye may have been a constellation consisting of seven stars three hundred thirty seven The worship of stars and planets which were identified and named seems never to have spread says Professor Sayce beyond the learned classes and to have remained to the last an artificial system The mass of the people worshipped the stars as a whole but it was only as a whole and not individually three hundred thirty eight The masses perpetuated ancient animistic beliefs like the pre Hellenic inhabitants of Greece The Pelasgians as I was informed at Dodona wrote Herodotus formerly offered all things indiscriminately to the gods They distinguished them by no name or surname for they were hitherto unacquainted with either but they called them gods which by its etymology means disposers from observing the orderly disposition and distribution of the various parts of the universe three hundred thirty nine The oldest deities are those which bore no individual names They were simply Fates or groups called Sevenfold The crude giant gods of Scotland are Fomhairean Fomorians and do not have individual names as in Ireland Families and tribes were controlled by the Fates or nameless gods which might appear as beasts or birds or be heard knocking or screaming In the Babylonian astral hymns the star spirits are associated with the gods and are revealers of the decrees of Fate Ye brilliant stars ye bright ones to destroy evil did Anu create you At thy command mankind was named created Give thou the Word and with thee let the great gods stand Give thou my judgment make my decision three hundred forty The Indian evidence shows that the constellations and especially the bright stars were identified before the planets Indeed in Vedic literature there is no certain reference to a single planet although constellations are named It seems highly probable that before the Babylonian gods were associated with the astral bodies the belief obtained that the stars exercised an influence over human lives In one of the Indian Forest Books for instance reference is made to a man who was born under the Nakshatra Rohini three hundred forty one Nakshatras are stars in the Rigveda and later and lunar mansions in Brahmanical compositions three hundred forty two Rohini ruddy is the name of a conspicuously reddish star Greek alpha Tauri or Aldebaran and denotes the group of the Hyades three hundred forty three This reference may be dated before six hundred B C perhaps eight hundred B C From Greece comes the evidence of Plutarch regarding the principles of Babylonian astrology Respecting the planets which they call the birth ruling divinities the Chaldeans he wrote lay down that two Venus and Jupiter are propitious and two Mars and Saturn malign and three Sun Moon and Mercury of a middle nature and one common That is mister Brown comments an astrologer would say these three are propitious with the good and may be malign with the bad three hundred forty four Jastrow s views in this connection seem highly controversial He holds that Babylonian astrology dealt simply with national affairs and had no concern with the conditions under which the individual was born it did not predict the fate in store for him He believes that the Greeks transformed Babylonian astrology and infused it with the spirit of individualism which is a characteristic of their religion and that they were the first to give astrology a personal significance Jastrow also perpetuates the idea that astronomy began with the Greeks Several centuries before the days of Alexander the Great he says the Greeks had begun to cultivate the study of the heavens not for purposes of divination but prompted by a scientific spirit as an intellectual discipline that might help them to solve the mysteries of the universe It is possible however to overrate the scientific spirit of the Greeks who like the Japanese in our own day were accomplished borrowers from other civilizations That astronomy had humble beginnings in Greece as elsewhere is highly probable The late mister Andrew Lang wrote in this connection The very oddest example of the survival of the notion that the stars are men and women is found in the Pax of Aristophanes Trygaeus in that comedy has just made an expedition to heaven A slave meets him and asks him Is not the story true then that we become stars when we die The answer is Certainly and Trygaeus points out the star into which Ion of Chios has just been metamorphosed mister Lang added Aristophanes is making fun of some popular Greek superstition The Eskimos Persians Aryo Indians Germans New Zealanders and others had a similar superstition three hundred forty five Jastrow goes on to say that the Greeks imparted their scientific view of the Universe to the East They became the teachers of the East in astronomy as in medicine and other sciences and the credit of having discovered the law of the precession of the equinoxes belongs to Hipparchus the Greek astronomer who announced this important theory about the year one hundred thirty B C three hundred forty six Undoubtedly the Greeks contributed to the advancement of the science of astronomy with which as other authorities believe they became acquainted after it had become well developed as a science by the Assyrians and Babylonians In return for improved methods of astronomical calculation which Jastrow says it may be assumed the italics are ours contact with Greek science gave to the Babylonian astronomers the Greeks accepted from the Babylonians the names of the constellations of the ecliptic three hundred forty seven This is a grudging admission they evidently accepted more than the mere names Jastrow s hypothesis is certainly interesting especially as he is an Oriental linguist of high repute But it is not generally accepted The sudden advance made by the Tigro Euphratean astronomers when Assyria was at the height of its glory may have been due to the discoveries made by great native scientists the Newtons and the Herschels of past ages who had studied the data accumulated by generations of astrologers the earliest recorders of the movements of the heavenly bodies It is hard to believe that the Greeks made much progress as scientists before they had identified the planets and become familiar with the Babylonian constellations through the medium of the Hittites or the Phoenicians What is known for certain is that long centuries before the Greek science was heard of there were scientists in Babylonia During the Sumerian period the forms and relations of geometry says Professor Goodspeed were employed for purposes of augury The heavens were mapped out and the courses of the heavenly bodies traced to determine the bearing of their movements upon human destinies three hundred forty eight Several centuries before Hipparchus was born the Assyrian kings had in their palaces official astronomers who were able to foretell with varying degrees of accuracy when eclipses would take place Instructions were sent to various observatories in the king s name to send in reports of forthcoming eclipses A translation of one of these official documents sent from the observatory of Babylon to Nineveh has been published by Professor Harper The following are extracts from it As for the eclipse of the moon about which the king my lord has written to me a watch was kept for it in the cities of Akkad Borsippa and Nippur We observed it ourselves in the city of Akkad And whereas the king my lord ordered me to observe also the eclipse of the sun I watched to see whether it took place or not and what passed before my eyes I now report to the king my lord It was an eclipse of the moon that took place It was total over Syria and the shadow fell on the land of the Amorites the land of the Hittites and in part on the land of the Chaldees Professor Sayce comments We gather from this letter that there were no less than three observatories in Northern Babylonia one at Akkad near Sippara one at Nippur now Niffer and one at Borsippa within sight of Babylon As Borsippa possessed a university it was natural that one of the three observatories should be established there three hundred forty nine It is evident that before the astronomers at Nineveh could foretell eclipses they had achieved considerable progress as scientists The data at their disposal probably covered nearly two thousand years mister Brown junior calculates that the signs of the Zodiac were fixed in the year twenty eighty four B C three hundred fifty These star groups do not now occupy the positions in which they were observed by the early astronomers because the revolving earth is rocking like a top with the result that the pole does not always keep pointing at the same spot in the heavens Each year the meeting place of the imaginary lines of the ecliptic and equator is moving westward at the rate of about fifty seconds In time ages hence the pole will circle round to the point it spun at when the constellations were named by the Babylonians It is by calculating the period occupied by this world curve that the date twenty eighty four B C has been arrived at As a result of the world rocking process the present day signs of the Zodiac do not correspond with the constellations In March for instance when the sun crosses the equator it enters the sign of the Ram Aries but does not reach the constellation till the twentieth as the comparative table shows on p three hundred eight When the ecliptic was marked off into the twelve regions and the signs of the Zodiac were designated the year of three hundred sixty five and one fourth days was known says Goodspeed though the common year was reckoned according to twelve months of thirty days each three hundred fifty one and equated with the solar year by intercalating a month at the proper times The month was divided into weeks of seven days The clepsydra and the sundial were Babylonian inventions for measuring time three hundred fifty two The sundial of Ahaz was probably of Babylonian design When the shadow went ten degrees backward two Kings xx II ambassadors were sent from Babylon to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land two Chron xxxii thirty one It was believed that the king s illness was connected with the incident According to astronomical calculation there was a partial eclipse of the sun which was visible at Jerusalem on eleventh January six hundred eighty nine B C about eleven point thirty a m When the upper part of the solar disc was obscured the shadow on the dial was strangely affected The Babylonian astrologers in their official documents were more concerned regarding international omens than those which affected individuals They made observations not only of the stars but also the moon which as has been shown was one of their planets and took note of the clouds and the wind likewise As portions of the heavens were assigned to various countries so was the moon divided into four quarters for the same purpose the upper part for the north Gutium the lower for the south Akkad or Babylonia the eastern part for Elam and the western for Amurru The crescent was also divided in like manner looking southward the astrologers assigned the right horn to the west and the left to the east In addition certain days and certain months were connected with the different regions Lunar astrology was therefore of complicated character When the moon was dim at the particular phase which was connected with Amurru it was believed that the fortunes of that region were in decline and if it happened to shine brightly in the Babylonian phase the time was considered auspicious to wage war in the west Great importance was attached to eclipses which were fortunately recorded with the result that the ancient astronomers were ultimately enabled to forecast them The destinies of the various states in the four quarters were similarly influenced by the planets When Venus for instance rose brightly in the field of Anu it was a prosperor for Elam if it were dim it foretold misfortune Much importance was also attached to the positions occupied by the constellations when the planets were propitious or otherwise no king would venture forth on an expedition under a yoke of inauspicious stars Biblical references to the stars make mention of well known Babylonian constellations Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades or loose the bands of Orion Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth the Zodiac in his season or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth Job xxxviii thirty one thirty three Which maketh Arcturus Orion and Pleiades and the chambers of the south Job ix nine Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion and turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night Amos v eight The so called science of astrology which had origin in ancient Babylonia and spread eastward and west is not yet extinct and has its believers even in our own country at the present day although they are not nearly so numerous as when Shakespeare made Malvolio read In my stars I am above thee but be not afraid of greatness some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon em Thy Fates open their hands three hundred fifty three or when Byron wrote Ye stars which are the poetry of heaven If in your bright leaves we would read the fate Of men and empires t is to be forgiven That in our aspirations to be great Our destinies o erleap their mortal state And claim a kindred with you three hundred fifty four Our grave astronomers are no longer astrologers but they still call certain constellations by the names given them in Babylonia Every time we look at our watches we are reminded of the ancient mathematicians who counted on their fingers and multiplied ten by six to give us minutes and seconds and divided the day and the night into twelve hours by multiplying six by the two leaden feet of Time The past lives in the present CHAPTER XIV ASHUR THE NATIONAL GOD OF ASSYRIA Derivation of Ashur Ashur as Anshar and Anu Animal forms of Sky God Anshar as Star God on the Celestial Mount Isaiah s Parable Symbols of World God and World Hill Dance of the Constellations and Dance of Satyrs Goat Gods and Bull Gods Symbols of Gods as High Heads The Winged Disc Human Figure as Soul of the Sun Ashur as Hercules and Gilgamesh Gods differentiated by Cults Fertility Gods as War Gods Ashur s Tree and Animal forms Ashur as Nisroch Lightning Symbol in Disc Ezekiel s Reference to Life Wheel Indian Wheel and Discus Wheels of Shamash and Ahura Mazda Hittite Winged Disc Solar Wheel causes Seasonal Changes Bonfires to stimulate Solar Deity Burning of Gods and Kings Magical Ring and other Symbols of Scotland Ashur s Wheel of Life and Eagle Wings King and Ashur Ashur associated with Lunar Fire and Star Gods The Osirian Clue Hittite and Persian Influences The rise of Assyria brings into prominence the national god Ashur who had been the city god of Asshur the ancient capital When first met with he is found to be a complex and mystical deity and the problem of his origin is consequently rendered exceedingly difficult Philologists are not agreed as to the derivation of his name and present as varied views as they do when dealing with the name of Osiris Some give Ashur a geographical significance urging that its original form was Aushar water field others prefer the renderings Holy the Beneficent One or the Merciful One while not a few regard Ashur as simply a dialectic form of the name of Anshar the god who in the Assyrian version or copy of the Babylonian Creation myth is chief of the host of heaven and the father of Anu Ea and Enlil If Ashur is to be regarded as an abstract solar deity who was developed from a descriptive place name it follows that he had a history like Anu or Ea rooted in Naturalism or Animism We cannot assume that his strictly local character was produced by modes of thought which did not obtain elsewhere The colonists who settled at Asshur no doubt imported beliefs from some cultural area they must have either given recognition to a god or group of gods or regarded the trees hills rivers sun moon and stars and the animals as manifestations of the self power of the Universe before they undertook the work of draining and cultivating the water field and erecting permanent homes Those who settled at Nineveh for instance believed that they were protected by the goddess Nina the patron deity of the Sumerian city of Nina As this goddess was also worshipped at Lagash and was one of the many forms of the Great Mother it would appear that in ancient times deities had a tribal rather than a geographical significance If the view is accepted that Ashur is Anshar it can be urged that he was imported from Sumeria Out of that land Shinar according to the Biblical reference went forth Asshur and builded Nineveh three hundred fifty five Asshur or Ashur identical Delitzsch and Jastrow believe with Ashir three hundred fifty six may have been an eponymous hero a deified king like Etana or Gilgamesh who was regarded as an incarnation of an ancient god As Anshar was an astral or early form of Anu the Sumerian city of origin may have been Erech where the worship of the mother goddess was also given prominence Damascius rendered Anshar s name as Assoros a fact usually cited to establish Ashur s connection with that deity This writer stated that the Babylonians passed over Sige three hundred fifty seven the mother that has begotten heaven and earth and made two Apason Apsu the husband and Tauthe Tiawath or Tiamat whose son was Moymis Mummu From these another progeny came forth Lache and Lachos Lachmu and Lachamu These were followed by the progeny Kissare and Assoros Kishar and Anshar from which were produced Anos Anu Illillos Enlil and Aos Ea And of Aos and Dauke Dawkina or Damkina was born Belos Bel Merodach whom they say is the Demiurge three hundred fifty eight the world artisan who carried out the decrees of a higher being Lachmu and Lachamu like the second pair of the ancient group of Egyptian deities probably symbolized darkness as a reproducing and sustaining power Anshar was apparently an impersonation of the night sky as his son Anu was of the day sky It may have been believed that the soul of Anshar was in the moon as Nannar Sin or in a star or that the moon and the stars were manifestations of him and that the soul of Anu was in the sun or the firmament or that the sun firmament and the wind were forms of this self power If Ashur combined the attributes of Anshar and Anu his early mystical character may be accounted for Like the Indian Brahma he may have been in his highest form an impersonation or symbol of the self power or world soul of developed Naturalism the creator preserver and destroyer in one a god of water earth air and sky of sun moon and stars fire and lightning a god of the grove whose essence was in the fig or the fir cone as it was in all animals The Egyptian god Amon of Thebes who was associated with water earth air sky sun and moon had a ram form and was the hidden one was developed from one of the elder eight gods in the Pyramid Texts he and his consort are the fourth pair When Amon was fused with the specialized sun god Ra he was placed at the head of the Ennead as the Creator We have traces says Jastrow of an Assyrian myth of Creation in which the sphere of creator is given to Ashur three hundred fifty nine Before a single act of creation was conceived of however the early peoples recognized the eternity of matter which was permeated by the self power of which the elder deities were vague phases These were too vague indeed to be worshipped individually The forms of the self power which were propitiated were trees rivers hills or animals As indicated in the previous chapter a tribe worshipped an animal or natural object which dominated its environment The animal might be the source of the food supply or might have to be propitiated to ensure the food supply Consequently they identified the self power of the Universe with the particular animal with which they were most concerned One section identified the spirit of the heavens with the bull and another with the goat In India Dyaus was a bull and his spouse the earth mother Prithivi was a cow The Egyptian sky goddess Hathor was a cow and other goddesses were identified with the hippopotamus the serpent the cat or the vulture Ra the sun god was identified in turn with the cat the ass the bull the ram and the crocodile the various animal forms of the local deities he had absorbed The eagle in Babylonia and India and the vulture falcon and mysterious Phoenix in Egypt were identified with the sun fire wind and lightning The animals associated with the god Ashur were the bull the eagle and the lion He either absorbed the attributes of other gods or symbolized the Self Power of which the animals were manifestations The earliest germ of the Creation myth was the idea that night was the parent of day and water of the earth Out of darkness and death came light and life Life was also motion When the primordial waters became troubled life began to be Out of the confusion came order and organization This process involved the idea of a stable and controlling power and the succession of a group of deities passive deities and active deities When the Babylonian astrologers assisted in developing the Creation myth they appear to have identified with the stable and controlling spirit of the night heaven that steadfast orb the Polar Star Anshar like Shakespeare s Caesar seemed to say I am constant as the northern star Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks They are all fire and every one doth shine But there s but one in all doth hold his place three hundred sixty Associated with the Polar Star was the constellation Ursa Minor the Little Bear called by the Babylonian astronomers the Lesser Chariot There were chariots before horses were introduced A patesi of Lagash had a chariot which was drawn by asses The seemingly steadfast Polar Star was called Ilu Sar the god Shar or Anshar star of the height or Shar the most high It seemed to be situated at the summit of the vault of heaven The god Shar therefore stood upon the Celestial mountain the Babylonian Olympus He was the ghost of the elder god who in Babylonia was displaced by the younger god Merodach as Mercury the morning star or as the sun the planet of day and in Assyria by Ashur as the sun or Regulus or Arcturus or Orion Yet father and son were identical They were phases of the One the self power A deified reigning king was an incarnation of the god after death he merged in the god as did the Egyptian Unas The eponymous hero Asshur may have similarly merged in the universal Ashur who like Horus an incarnation of Osiris had many phases or forms Isaiah appears to have been familiar with the Tigro Euphratean myths about the divinity of kings and the displacement of the elder god by the younger god of whom the ruling monarch was an incarnation and with the idea that the summit of the Celestial mountain was crowned by the north star the symbol of Anshar Thou shalt take up this parable he exclaimed making use of Babylonian symbolism against the king of Babylon and say How hath the oppressor ceased the golden city ceased How art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations For thou hast said in thine heart I will ascend unto heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most High three hundred sixty one The king is identified with Lucifer as the deity of fire and the morning star he is the younger god who aspired to occupy the mountain throne of his father the god Shar the Polar or North Star It is possible that the Babylonian idea of a Celestial mountain gave origin to the belief that the earth was a mountain surrounded by the outer ocean beheld by Etana when he flew towards heaven on the eagle s back In India this hill is Mount Meru the world spine which sustains the earth it is surmounted by Indra s Valhal or the great city of Brahma In Teutonic mythology the heavens revolve round the Polar Star which is called Veraldar nagli three hundred sixty two the world spike while the earth is sustained by the world tree The ded amulet of Egypt symbolized the backbone of Osiris as a world god ded means firm established three hundred sixty three while at burial ceremonies the coffin was set up on end inside the tomb on a small sandhill intended to represent the Mountain of the West the realm of the dead three hundred sixty four The Babylonian temple towers were apparently symbols of the world hill At Babylon the Du azaga holy mound was Merodach s temple E sagila the Temple of the High Head E kur rendered the house or temple of the Mountain was the temple of Bel Enlil at Nippur At Erech the temple of the goddess Ishtar was E anna which connects her as Nina or Ninni with Anu derived from ana heaven Ishtar was Queen of heaven Now Polaris situated at the summit of the celestial mountain was identified with the sacred goat the highest of the flock of night three hundred sixty five Ursa Minor the Little Bear constellation may have been the goat with six heads referred to by Professor Sayce three hundred sixty six The six astral goats or goat men were supposed to be dancing round the chief goat man or Satyr Anshar Even in the dialogues of Plato the immemorial belief was perpetuated that the constellations were moving as in a dance Dancing began as a magical or religious practice and the earliest astronomers saw their dancing customs reflected in the heavens by the constellations whose movements were rhythmical No doubt Isaiah had in mind the belief of the Babylonians regarding the dance of their goat gods when he foretold Their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and owls ghosts shall dwell there and satyrs shall dance there three hundred sixty seven In other words there would be no people left to perform religious dances beside the desolate houses the stars only would be seen dancing round Polaris Tammuz like Anshar as sentinel of the night heaven was a goat as was also Nin Girsu of Lagash A Sumerian reference to a white kid of En Mersi Nin Girsu was translated into Semitic a white kid of Tammuz The goat was also associated with Merodach Babylonians having prayed to that god to take away their diseases or their sins released a goat which was driven into the desert The present Polar Star which was not of course the Polar star of the earliest astronomers the world having rocked westward is called in Arabic Al Jedy the kid In India the goat was connected with Agni and Varuna it was slain at funeral ceremonies to inform the gods that a soul was about to enter heaven Ea the Sumerian lord of water earth and heaven was symbolized as a goat fish Thor the Teutonic fertility and thunder god had a chariot drawn by goats It is of interest to note that the sacred Sumerian goat bore on its forehead the same triangular symbol as the Apis bull of Egypt Ashur was not a goat of heaven but a bull of heaven like the Sumerian Nannar Sin the moon god of Ur Ninip of Saturn and Bel Enlil As the bull however he was like Anshar the ruling animal of the heavens and like Anshar he had associated with him six divinities of council Other deities who were similarly exalted as high heads at various centres and at various periods included Anu Bel Enlil and Ea Merodach Nergal and Shamash A symbol of the first three was a turban on a seat or altar which may have represented the world mountain Ea as the world spine was symbolized as a column with ram s head standing on a throne beside which crouched a goat fish Merodach s column terminated in a lance head and the head of a lion crowned that of Nergal These columns were probably connected with pillar worship and therefore with tree worship the pillar being the trunk of the world tree The symbol of the sun god Shamash was a disc from which flowed streams of water his rays apparently were fertilizing tears like the rays of the Egyptian sun god Ra Horus the Egyptian falcon god was symbolized as the winged solar disc It is necessary to accumulate these details regarding other deities and their symbols before dealing with Ashur The symbols of Ashur must be studied because they are one of the sources of our knowledge regarding the god s origin and character These include one a winged disc with horns enclosing four circles revolving round a middle circle rippling rays fall down from either side of the disc two a circle or wheel suspended from wings and enclosing a warrior drawing his bow to discharge an arrow and three the same circle the warrior s bow however is carried in his left hand while the right hand is uplifted as if to bless his worshippers These symbols are taken from seal cylinders An Assyrian standard which probably represented the world column has the disc mounted on a bull s head with horns The upper part of the disc is occupied by a warrior whose head part of his bow and the point of his arrow protrude from the circle The rippling water rays are V shaped and two bulls treading river like rays occupy the divisions thus formed There are also two heads a lion s and a man s with gaping mouths which may symbolize tempests the destroying power of the sun or the sources of the Tigris and Euphrates Jastrow regards the winged disc as the purer and more genuine symbol of Ashur as a solar deity He calls it a sun disc with protruding rays and says To this symbol the warrior with the bow and arrow was added a despiritualization that reflects the martial spirit of the Assyrian empire three hundred sixty eight The sun symbol on the sun boat of Ra encloses similarly a human figure which was apparently regarded as the soul of the sun the life of the god was in the sun egg In an Indian prose treatise it is set forth Now that man in yonder orb the sun and that man in the right eye truly are no other than Death the soul His feet have stuck fast in the heart and having pulled them out he comes forth and when he comes forth then that man dies whence they say of him who has passed away he has been cut off his life or life string has been severed three hundred sixty nine The human figure did not indicate a process of despiritualization either in Egypt or in India The Horus winged disc was besides a symbol of destruction and battle as well as of light and fertility Horus assumed that form in one legend to destroy Set and his followers three hundred seventy But of course the same symbols may not have conveyed the same ideas to all peoples As Blake put it What to others a trifle appears Fills me full of smiles and tears With my inward Eye t is an old Man grey With my outward a Thistle across my way Indeed it is possible that the winged disc meant one thing to an Assyrian priest and another thing to a man not gifted with what Blake called double vision What seems certain however is that the archer was as truly solar as the wings or rays In Babylonia and Assyria the sun was among other things a destroyer from the earliest times It is not surprising therefore to find that Ashur like Merodach resembled in one of his phases Hercules or rather his prototype Gilgamesh One of Gilgamesh s mythical feats was the slaying of three demon birds These may be identical with the birds of prey which Hercules in performing his sixth labour hunted out of Stymphalus three hundred seventy one In the Greek Hipparcho Ptolemy star list Hercules was the constellation of the Kneeler and in Babylonian Assyrian astronomy he was as Gilgamesh or Merodach Sarru the king The astral Arrow constellation of Sagitta was pointed against the constellations of the Eagle Vulture and Swan In Phoenician astronomy the Vulture was Zither Lyra a weapon with which Hercules identified with Melkarth slew Linos the musician Hercules used a solar arrow which he received from Apollo In various mythologies the arrow is associated with the sun the moon and the atmospheric deities and is a symbol of lightning rain and fertility as well as of famine disease war and death The green faced goddess Neith of Libya compared by the Greeks to Minerva carries in one hand two arrows and a bow three hundred seventy two If we knew as little of Athena Minerva who was armed with a lance a breastplate made of the skin of a goat a shield and helmet as we do of Ashur it might be held that she was simply a goddess of war The archer in the sun disc of the Assyrian standard probably represented Ashur as the god of the people a deity closely akin to Merodach with pronounced Tammuz traits and therefore linking with other local deities like Ninip Nergal and Shamash and partaking also like these of the attributes of the elder gods Anu Bel Enlil and Ea All the other deities worshipped by the Assyrians were of Babylonian origin Ashur appears to have differed from them just as one local Babylonian deity differed from another He reflected Assyrian experiences and aspirations but it is difficult to decide whether the sublime spiritual aspect of his character was due to the beliefs of alien peoples by whom the early Assyrians were influenced or to the teachings of advanced Babylonian thinkers whose doctrines found readier acceptance in a new country than among the conservative ritualists of ancient Sumerian and Akkadian cities New cults were formed from time to time in Babylonia and when they achieved political power they gave a distinctive character to the religion of their city states Others which did not find political support and remained in obscurity at home may have yet extended their influence far and wide Buddhism for instance originated in India but now flourishes in other countries to which it was introduced by missionaries In the homeland it was submerged by the revival of Brahmanism from which it sprung and which it was intended permanently to displace An instance of an advanced cult suddenly achieving prominence as a result of political influence is afforded by Egypt where the fully developed Aton religion was embraced and established as a national religion by Akhenaton the so called dreamer That migrations were sometimes propelled by cults which sought new areas in which to exercise religious freedom and propagate their beliefs is suggested by the invasion of India at the close of the Vedic period by the later comers who laid the foundations of Brahmanism They established themselves in Madhyadesa the Middle Country the land where the Brahmanas and the later Samhitas were produced From this centre went forth missionaries who accomplished the Brahmanization of the rest of India three hundred seventy three It may be therefore that the cult of Ashur was influenced in its development by the doctrines of advanced teachers from Babylonia and that Persian Mithraism was also the product of missionary efforts extended from that great and ancient cultural area Mitra as has been stated was one of the names of the Babylonian sun god who was also a god of fertility But Ashur could not have been to begin with merely a battle and solar deity As the god of a city state he must have been worshipped by agriculturists artisans and traders he must have been recognized as a deity of fertility culture commerce and law Even as a national god he must have made wider appeal than to the cultured and ruling classes Bel Enlil of Nippur was a world god and war god but still remained a local corn god Assyria s greatness was reflected by Ashur but he also reflected the origin and growth of that greatness The civilization of which he was a product had an agricultural basis It began with the development of the natural resources of Assyria as was recognized by the Hebrew prophet who said Behold the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches The waters made him great the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field and his boughs were multiplied and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters when he shot forth All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young and under his shadow dwelt all great nations Thus was he fair in his greatness in the length of his branches for his root was by great waters The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him the fir trees were not like his boughs and the chestnut trees were not like his branches nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty three hundred seventy four Asshur the ancient capital was famous for its merchants It is referred to in the Bible as one of the cities which traded with Tyre in all sorts of things in blue clothes and broidered work and in chests of rich apparel bound with cords and made of cedar three hundred seventy five As a military power Assyria s name was dreaded Behold Isaiah said addressing King Hezekiah thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly three hundred seventy six The same prophet when foretelling how Israel would suffer exclaimed O Assyrian the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is mine indignation I will send him against an hypocritical nation and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets three hundred seventy seven We expect to find Ashur reflected in these three phases of Assyrian civilization If we recognize him in the first place as a god of fertility his other attributes are at once included A god of fertility is a corn god and a water god The river as a river was a creator p twenty nine and Ashur was therefore closely associated with the watery place with the canals or rivers running round about his plants The rippling water rays or fertilizing tears appear on the solar discs As a corn god he was a god of war Tammuz s first act was to slay the demons of winter and storm as Indra s in India was to slay the demons of drought and Thor s in Scandinavia was to exterminate the frost giants The corn god had to be fed with human sacrifices and the people therefore waged war against foreigners to obtain victims As the god made a contract with his people he was a deity of commerce he provided them with food and they in turn fed him with offerings In Ezekiel s comparison of Assyria to a mighty tree there is no doubt a mythological reference The Hebrew prophets invariably utilized for their poetic imagery the characteristic beliefs of the peoples to whom they made direct reference The owls satyrs and dragons of Babylon mentioned by Isaiah were taken from Babylonian mythology as has been indicated When therefore Assyria is compared to a cedar which is greater than fir or chestnut and it is stated that there are nesting birds in the branches and under them reproducing beasts of the field and that the greatness of the tree is due to the multitude of waters the conclusion is suggested that Assyrian religion which Ashur s symbols reflect included the worship of trees birds beasts and water The symbol of the Assyrian tree probably the world tree of its religion appears to be the rod of mine anger the staff in their hand that is the battle standard which was a symbol of Ashur Tammuz and Osiris were tree gods as well as corn gods Now as Ashur was evidently a complex deity it is futile to attempt to read his symbols without giving consideration to the remnants of Assyrian mythology which are found in the ruins of the ancient cities These either reflect the attributes of Ashur or constitute the material from which he evolved As Layard pointed out many years ago the Assyrians had a sacred tree which became conventionalized It was an elegant device in which curved branches springing from a kind of scroll work terminated in flowers of graceful form As one of the figures last described three hundred seventy eight was turned as if in act of adoration towards this device it was evidently a sacred emblem and I recognized in it the holy tree or tree of life so universally adored at the remotest period in the East and which was preserved in the religious systems of the Persians to the final overthrow of their Empire The flowers were formed by seven petals three hundred seventy nine This tree looks like a pillar and is thrice crossed by conventionalized bull s horns tipped with ring symbols which may be stars the highest pair of horns having a larger ring between them but only partly shown as if it were a crescent The tree with its many sevenfold designs may have been a symbol of the Sevenfold one are ye deity This is evidently the Assyrian tree which was called the rod or staff What mythical animals did this tree shelter Layard found that the four creatures continually introduced on the sculptured walls were a man a lion an ox and an eagle three hundred eighty In Sumeria the gods were given human form but before this stage was reached the bull symbolized Nannar Sin the moon god Ninip Saturn the old sun and Enlil while Nergal was a lion as a tribal sun god The eagle is represented by the Zu bird which symbolized the storm and a phase of the sun and was also a deity of fertility On the silver vase of Lagash the lion and eagle were combined as the lion headed eagle a form of Nin Girsu Tammuz and it was associated with wild goats stags lions and bulls On a mace head dedicated to Nin Girsu a lion slays a bull as the Zu bird slays serpents in the folk tale suggesting the wars of totemic deities according to one school and the battle of the sun with the storm clouds according to another Whatever the explanation may be of one animal deity of fertility slaying another it seems certain that the conflict was associated with the idea of sacrifice to procure the food supply In Assyria the various primitive gods were combined as a winged bull a winged bull with human head the king s a winged lion with human head a winged man a deity with lion s head human body and eagle s legs with claws and also as a deity with eagle s head and feather headdress a human body wings and feather fringed robe carrying in one hand a metal basket on which two winged men adored the holy tree and in the other a fir cone three hundred eighty one Layard suggested that the latter deity with eagle s head was Nisroch the word Nisr signifying in all Semitic languages an eagle three hundred eighty two This deity is referred to in the Bible Sennacherib king of Assyria was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god three hundred eighty three Professor Pinches is certain that Nisroch is Ashur but considers that the ni was attached to Ashur Ashuraku or Ashurachu as it was to Marad Merodach to give the reading Ni Marad Nimrod The names of heathen deities were thus made unrecognizable and in all probability ridiculous as well Pious and orthodox lips could pronounce them without fear of defilement three hundred eighty four At the same time the Nisr theory is probable it may represent another phase of this process The names of heathen gods were not all treated in like manner by the Hebrew teachers Abed nebo for instance became Abed nego Daniel i seven as Professor Pinches shows Seeing that the eagle received prominence in the mythologies of Sumeria and Assyria as a deity of fertility with solar and atmospheric attributes it is highly probable that the Ashur symbol like the Egyptian Horus solar disk is a winged symbol of life fertility and destruction The idea that it represents the sun in eclipse with protruding rays seems rather far fetched because eclipses were disasters and indications of divine wrath three hundred eighty five it certainly does not explain why the rays should only stretch out sideways like wings and downward like a tail why the rays should be double like the double wings of cherubs bulls c and divided into sections suggesting feathers or why the disk is surmounted by conventionalized horns tipped with star like ring symbols identical with those depicted in the holy tree What particular connection the five small rings within the disk were supposed to have with the eclipse of the sun is difficult to discover In one of the other symbols in which appears a feather robed archer it is significant to find that the arrow he is about to discharge has a head shaped like a trident it is evidently a lightning symbol When Ezekiel prophesied to the Israelitish captives at Tel abib by the river of Chebar in Chaldea Kheber near Nippur he appears to have utilized Assyrian symbolism Probably he came into contact in Babylonia with fugitive priests from Assyrian cities This great prophet makes interesting references to four living creatures with four faces the face of a man the face of a lion the face of an ox and the face of an eagle they had the hands of a man under their wings their wings were joined one to another their wings were stretched upward two wings of every one were joined one to another Their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps The living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning three hundred eighty six Elsewhere referring to the sisters Aholah and Aholibah who had been in Egypt and had adopted unmoral ways of life Ezekiel tells that when Aholibah doted upon the Assyrians she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion girded with girdles upon their loins three hundred eighty seven Traces of the red colour on the walls of Assyrian temples and palaces have been observed by excavators The winged gods like burning coals were probably painted in vermilion Ezekiel makes reference to ring and wheel symbols In his vision he saw one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of beryl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel As for their rings they were so high that they were dreadful and their rings were full of eyes round about them four And when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up Whithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was their spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels three hundred eighty eight And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of terrible crystal stretched forth over their heads above And when they went I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters as the voice of the Almighty the voice of speech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down their wings three hundred eighty nine Another description of the cherubs states Their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes stars round about even the wheels that they four had As for the wheels it was cried unto them in my hearing O wheel or according to a marginal rendering they were called in my hearing wheel or Gilgal i e move round And the cherubims were lifted up three hundred ninety It would appear that the wheel or hoop a variant rendering was a symbol of life and that the Assyrian feather robed figure which it enclosed was a god not of war only but also of fertility His trident headed arrow resembles as has been suggested a lightning symbol Ezekiel s references are suggestive in this connection When the cherubs ran and returned they had the appearance of a flash of lightning and the noise of their wings resembled the noise of great waters Their bodies were like burning coals of fire Fertility gods were associated with fire lightning and water Agni of India Sandan of Asia Minor and Melkarth of Phoenicia were highly developed fire gods of fertility The fire cult was also represented in Sumeria pp forty nine fifty one In the Indian epic the Mahabharata the revolving ring or wheel protects the Soma three hundred ninety one ambrosia of the gods on which their existence depends The eagle giant Garuda sets forth to steal it The gods fully armed gather round to protect the life giving drink Garuda approaches darkening the worlds by the dust raised by the hurricane of his wings The celestials overwhelmed by that dust swoon away Garuda afterwards assumes a fiery shape then looks like masses of black clouds and in the end its body becomes golden and bright as the rays of the sun The Soma is protected by fire which the bird quenches after drinking in many rivers with the numerous mouths it has assumed Then Garuda finds that right above the Soma is a wheel of steel keen edged and sharp as a razor revolving incessantly That fierce instrument of the lustre of the blazing sun and of terrible form was devised by the gods for cutting to pieces all robbers of the Soma Garuda passes through the spokes of the wheel and has then to contend against two great snakes of the lustre of blazing fire of tongues bright as the lightning flash of great energy of mouth emitting fire of blazing eyes He slays the snakes The gods afterwards recover the stolen Soma Garuda becomes the vehicle of the god Vishnu who carries the discus another fiery wheel which revolves and returns to the thrower like lightning And he Vishnu made the bird sit on the flagstaff of his car saying Even thus thou shalt stay above me three hundred ninety two The Persian god Ahura Mazda hovers above the king in sculptured representations of that high dignitary enclosed in a winged wheel or disk like Ashur grasping a ring in one hand the other being lifted up as if blessing those who adore him Shamash the Babylonian sun god Ishtar the goddess of heaven and other Babylonian deities carried rings as the Egyptian gods carried the ankh the symbol of life Shamash was also depicted sitting on his throne in a pillar supported pavilion in front of which is a sun wheel The spokes of the wheel are formed by a star symbol and threefold rippling water rays In Hittite inscriptions there are interesting winged emblems the central portion of one seems to be composed of two crescents underneath a disk which is also divided like a crescent Above the emblem there appear the symbol of sanctity the divided oval and the hieroglyph which Professor Sayce interprets as the name of the god Sandes In another instance the centre of the winged emblem may be seen to be a rosette with a curious spreading object below Above two dots follow the name of Sandes and a human arm bent in adoration is by the side Professor Garstang is here dealing with sacred places on rocky points or hilltops bearing out the suggestion of the sculptures near Boghaz Keui three hundred ninety three in which there may be reasonably suspected the surviving traces of mountain cults or cults of mountain deities underlying the newer religious symbolism Who the deity is it is impossible to say but he was identified at some time or other with Sandes three hundred ninety four It would appear too that the god may have been called by a name which was that used also by the priest Perhaps the priest king was believed to be an incarnation of the deity Sandes or Sandan was identical with Sandon of Tarsus the prototype of Attis three hundred ninety five who links with the Babylonian Tammuz Sandon s animal symbol was the lion and he carried the double axe symbol of the god of fertility and thunder As Professor Frazer has shown in The Golden Bough he links with Hercules and Melkarth three hundred ninety six All the younger gods who displaced the elder gods as one year displaces another were deities of fertility battle lightning fire and the sun it is possible therefore that Ashur was like Merodach son of Ea god of the deep a form of Tammuz in origin His spirit was in the solar wheel which revolved at times of seasonal change In Scotland it was believed that on the morning of May Day Beltaine the rising sun revolved three times The younger god was a spring sun god and fire god Great bonfires were lit to strengthen him or as a ceremony of riddance the old year was burned out Indeed the god himself might be burned that is the old god so that he might renew his youth Melkarth was burned at Tyre Hercules burned himself on a mountain top and his soul ascended to heaven as an eagle These fiery rites were evidently not unknown in Babylonia and Assyria When according to Biblical narrative Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold which he set up in the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon he commanded O people nations and languages at the time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of musick fall down and worship the golden image Certain Jews who had been set over the affairs of the province of Babylonia namely Shadrach Meshach and Abed nego refused to adore the idol They were punished by being thrown into a burning fiery furnace which was heated seven times more than it was wont to be heated They came forth uninjured three hundred ninety seven In the Koran it is related that Abraham destroyed the images of Chaldean gods he brake them all in pieces except the biggest of them that they might lay the blame on that three hundred ninety eight According to the commentators the Chaldaeans were at the time abroad in the fields celebrating a great festival To punish the offender Nimrod had a great pyre erected at Cuthah Then they bound Abraham and putting him into an engine shot him into the midst of the fire from which he was preserved by the angel Gabriel who was sent to his assistance Eastern Christians were wont to set apart in the Syrian calendar the twenty fifth of January to commemorate Abraham s escape from Nimrod s pyre three hundred ninety nine It is evident that the Babylonian fire ceremony was observed in the spring season and that human beings were sacrificed to the sun god A mock king may have been burned to perpetuate the ancient sacrifice of real kings who were incarnations of the god Isaiah makes reference to the sacrificial burning of kings in Assyria For through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten down which smote with a rod And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass which the Lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabrets and harps and in battles of shaking will he fight with it For Tophet is ordained of old yea for the king it is prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and much wood the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it four hundred When Nineveh was about to fall and with it the Assyrian Empire the legendary king Sardanapalus who was reputed to have founded Tarsus burned himself with his wives concubines and eunuchs on a pyre in his palace Zimri who reigned over Israel for seven days burnt the king s house over him with fire four hundred one Saul another fallen king was burned after death and his bones were buried under the oak in Jabesh four hundred two In Europe the oak was associated with gods of fertility and lightning including Jupiter and Thor The ceremony of burning Saul is of special interest Asa the orthodox king of Judah was after death laid in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries art and they made a very great burning for him two Chronicles xvi fourteen Jehoram the heretic king of Judah who walked in the way of the kings of Israel died of an incurable disease And his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers two Chronicles xxi eighteen nineteen The conclusion suggested by the comparative study of the beliefs of neighbouring peoples and the evidence afforded by Assyrian sculptures is that Ashur was a highly developed form of the god of fertility who was sustained or aided in his conflicts with demons by the fires and sacrifices of his worshippers It is possible to read too much into his symbols These are not more complicated and vague than are the symbols on the standing stones of Scotland the crescent with the broken arrow the trident with the double rings or wheels connected by two crescents the circle with the dot in its centre the triangle with the dot the large disk with two small rings on either side crossed by double straight lines the so called mirror and so on Highly developed symbolism may not indicate a process of spiritualization so much perhaps as the persistence of magical beliefs and practices There is really no direct evidence to support the theory that the Assyrian winged disk or disk with protruding rays was of more spiritual character than the wheel which encloses the feather robed archer with his trident shaped arrow The various symbols may have represented phases of the god When the spring fires were lit and the god renewed his life like the eagle his symbol was possibly the solar wheel or disk with eagle s wings which became regarded as a symbol of life The god brought life and light to the world he caused the crops to grow he gave increase he sustained his worshippers But he was also the god who slew the demons of darkness and storm The Hittite winged disk was Sandes or Sandon the god of lightning who stood on the back of a bull As the lightning god was a war god it was in keeping with his character to find him represented in Assyria as Ashur the archer with the bow and lightning arrow On the disk of the Assyrian standard the lion and the bull appear with the archer as symbols of the war god Ashur but they were also symbols of Ashur the god of fertility The life or spirit of the god was in the ring or wheel as the life of the Egyptian and Indian gods and of the giants of folk tales was in the egg The dot within the circle a widespread symbol may have represented the seed within the egg of more than one mythology or the thorn within the egg of more than one legendary story It may be that in Assyria as in India the crude beliefs and symbols of the masses were spiritualized by the speculative thinkers in the priesthood but no literary evidence has survived to justify us in placing the Assyrian teachers on the same level as the Brahmans who composed the Upanishads Temples were erected to Ashur but he might be worshipped anywhere like the Queen of Heaven who received offerings in the streets of Jerusalem for he needed no temple as Professor Pinches says Whether this was because he was a highly developed deity or a product of folk religion it is difficult to decide One important fact is that the ruling king of Assyria was more closely connected with the worship of Ashur than the king of Babylonia was with the worship of Merodach This may be because the Assyrian king was regarded as an incarnation of his god like the Egyptian Pharaoh Ashur accompanied the monarch on his campaigns he was their conquering war god Where the king was there was Ashur also No images were made of him but his symbols were carried aloft as were the symbols of Indian gods in the great war of the Mahabharata epic It would appear that Ashur was sometimes worshipped in the temples of other gods In an interesting inscription he is associated with the moon god Nannar Sin of Haran Esarhaddon the Assyrian king is believed to have been crowned in that city The writer says Professor Pinches is apparently addressing Assur bani apli the great and noble Asnapper When the father of my king my lord went to Egypt he was crowned in the ganni of Harran the temple lit Bethel of cedar The god Sin remained over the sacred standard two crowns upon his head and the god Nusku stood beside him The father of the king my lord entered and he the priest of Sin placed the crown upon his head saying thus Thou shalt go and capture the lands in the midst He we nt he captured the land of Egypt The rest of the lands not submitting to Assur Ashur and Sin the king the lord of kings shall capture them four hundred three Ashur and Sin are here linked as equals Associated with them is Nusku the messenger of the gods who was given prominence in Assyria The kings frequently invoked him As the son of Ea he acted as the messenger between Merodach and the god of the deep He was also a son of Bel Enlil and like Anu was guardian or chief of the Igigi the host of heaven Professor Pinches suggests that he may have been either identical with the Sumerian fire god Gibil or a brother of the fire god and an impersonation of the light of fire and sun In Haran he accompanied the moon god and may therefore have symbolized the light of the moon also Professor Pinches adds that in one inscription he is identified with Nirig or En reshtu Nin Girsu Tammuz four hundred four The Babylonians and Assyrians associated fire and light with moisture and fertility The astral phase of the character of Ashur is highly probable As has been indicated the Greek rendering of Anshar as Assoros is suggestive in this connection Jastrow however points out that the use of the characters Anshar for Ashur did not obtain until the eighth century B C Linguistically he says the change of Ashir to Ashur can be accounted for but not the transformation of An shar to Ashur or Ashir so that we must assume the etymology of Ashur proposed by some learned scribe to be the nature of a play upon the name four hundred five On the other hand it is possible that what appears arbitrary to us may have been justified in ancient Assyria on perfectly reasonable or at any rate traditional grounds Professor Pinches points out that as a sun god and at the same time not Shamash Ashur resembled Merodach His identification with Merodach if that was ever accepted may have been due to the likeness of the word to Asari one of the deities names four hundred six As Asari Merodach has been compared to the Egyptian Osiris who as the Nile god was Asar Hapi Osiris resembles Tammuz and was similarly a corn deity and a ruler of the living and the dead associated with sun moon stars water and vegetation We may consistently connect Ashur with Aushar water field Anshar god of the height or most high and with the eponymous King Asshur who went out on the land of Nimrod and builded Nineveh if we regard him as of common origin with Tammuz Osiris and Attis a developed and localized form of the ancient deity of fertility and corn Ashur had a spouse who is referred to as Ashuritu or Beltu the lady Her name however is not given but it is possible that she was identified with the Ishtar of Nineveh In the historical texts Ashur as the royal god stands alone Like the Hittite Great Father he was perhaps regarded as the origin of life Indeed it may have been due to the influence of the northern hillmen in the early Assyrian period that Ashur was developed as a father god a Baal When the Hittite inscriptions are read more light may be thrown on the Ashur problem Another possible source of cultural influence is Persia The supreme god Ahura Mazda Ormuzd was as has been indicated represented like Ashur hovering over the king s head enclosed in a winged disk or wheel and the sacred tree figured in Persian mythology The early Assyrian kings had non Semitic and non Sumerian names It seems reasonable to assume that the religious culture of the ethnic elements they represented must have contributed to the development of the city god of Asshur CHAPTER XV CONFLICTS FOR TRADE AND SUPREMACY Modern Babylonia History repeating itself Babylonian Trade Route in Mesopotamia Egyptian Supremacy in Syria Mitanni and Babylonia Bandits who plundered Caravans Arabian Desert Trade Route opened Assyrian and Elamite Struggles with Babylonia Rapid Extension of Assyrian Empire Hittites control Western Trade Routes Egypt s Nineteenth Dynasty Conquests Campaigns of Rameses II Egyptians and Hittites become Allies Babylonian Fears of Assyria Shalmaneser s Triumphs Assyria Supreme in Mesopotamia Conquest of Babylonia Fall of a Great King Civil War in Assyria Its Empire goes to pieces Babylonian Wars with Elam Revival of Babylonian Power Invasions of Assyrians and Elamites End of the Kassite Dynasty Babylonia contrasted with Assyria It is possible that during the present century Babylonia may once again become one of the great wheat producing countries of the world A scheme of land reclamation has already been inaugurated by the construction of a great dam to control the distribution of the waters of the Euphrates and if it is energetically promoted on a generous scale in the years to come the ancient canals which are used at present as caravan roads may yet be utilized to make the whole country as fertile and prosperous as it was in ancient days When that happy consummation is reached new cities may grow up and flourish beside the ruins of the old centres of Babylonian culture With the revival of agriculture will come the revival of commerce Ancient trade routes will then be reopened and the slow travelling caravans supplanted by speedy trains A beginning has already been made in this direction The first modern commercial highway which is crossing the threshold of Babylonia s new Age is the German railway through Asia Minor North Syria and Mesopotamia to Baghdad four hundred seven It brings the land of Hammurabi into close touch with Europe and will solve problems which engaged the attention of many rival monarchs for long centuries before the world knew aught of the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome These sudden and dramatic changes are causing history to repeat itself Once again the great World Powers are evincing much concern regarding their respective spheres of influence in Western Asia and pressing together around the ancient land of Babylon On the east where the aggressive Elamites and Kassites were followed by the triumphant Persians and Medes Russia and Britain have asserted themselves as protectors of Persian territory and the influence of Britain is supreme in the Persian Gulf Turkey controls the land of the Hittites while Russia looms like a giant across the Armenian highlands Turkey is also the governing power in Syria and Mesopotamia which are being crossed by Germany s Baghdad railway France is constructing railways in Syria and will control the ancient way of the Philistines Britain occupies Cyprus on the Mediterranean coast and presides over the destinies of the ancient land of Egypt which during the brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty extended its sphere of influence to the borders of Asia Minor Once again after the lapse of many centuries international politics is being strongly influenced by the problems connected with the development of trade in Babylonia and its vicinity The history of the ancient rival States which is being pieced together by modern excavators is in view of present day political developments invested with special interest to us We have seen Assyria rising into prominence It began to be a great Power when Egypt was supreme in the Western Land the land of the Amorites as far north as the frontiers of Cappadocia Under the Kassite regime Babylonia s political influence had declined in Mesopotamia but its cultural influence remained for its language and script continued in use among traders and diplomatists At the beginning of the Pharaoh Akhenaton period the supreme power in Mesopotamia was Mitanni As the ally of Egypt it constituted a buffer state on the borders of North Syria which prevented the southern expansion from Asia Minor of the Hittite confederacy and the western expansion of aggressive Assyria while it also held in check the ambitions of Babylonia which still claimed the land of the Amorites So long as Mitanni was maintained as a powerful kingdom the Syrian possessions of Egypt were easily held in control and the Egyptian merchants enjoyed preferential treatment compared with those of Babylonia But when Mitanni was overcome and its territories were divided between the Assyrians and the Hittites the North Syrian Empire of Egypt went to pieces A great struggle then ensued between the nations of western Asia for political supremacy in the land of the Amorites Babylonia had been seriously handicapped by losing control of its western caravan road Prior to the Kassite period its influence was supreme in Mesopotamia and middle Syria from the days of Sargon of Akkad and of Naram Sin until the close of the Hammurabi Age its merchants had naught to fear from bandits or petty kings between the banks of the Euphrates and the Mediterranean coast The city of Babylon had grown rich and powerful as the commercial metropolis of Western Asia Separated from the Delta frontier by the broad and perilous wastes of the Arabian desert Babylonia traded with Egypt by an indirect route Its caravan road ran northward along the west bank of the Euphrates towards Haran and then southward through Palestine This was a long detour but it was the only possible way During the early Kassite Age the caravans from Babylon had to pass through the area controlled by Mitanni which was therefore able to impose heavy duties and fill its coffers with Babylonian gold Nor did the situation improve when the influence of Mitanni suffered decline in southern Mesopotamia Indeed the difficulties under which traders operated were then still further increased for the caravan roads were infested by plundering bands of Suti to whom references are made in the Tell el Amarna letters These bandits defied all the great powers and became so powerful that even the messengers sent from one king to another were liable to be robbed and murdered without discrimination When war broke out between powerful States they harried live stock and sacked towns in those areas which were left unprotected The Suti were Arabians of Aramaean stock What is known as the Third Semitic Migration was in progress during this period The nomads gave trouble to Babylonia and Assyria and penetrating Mesopotamia and Syria sapped the power of Mitanni until it was unable to resist the onslaughts of the Assyrians and the Hittites The Aramaean tribes are referred to at various periods and by various peoples not only as the Suti but also as the Achlame the Arimi and the Khabiri Ultimately they were designated simply as Syrians and under that name became the hereditary enemies of the Hebrews although Jacob was regarded as being of their stock A Syrian ready to perish runs a Biblical reference was my father ancestor and he went down into Egypt and sojourned there with a few and became there a nation great mighty and populous four hundred eight An heroic attempt was made by one of the Kassite kings of Babylonia to afford protection to traders by stamping out brigandage between Arabia and Mesopotamia and opening up a new and direct caravan road to Egypt across the Arabian desert The monarch in question was Kadashman Kharbe the grandson of Ashur uballit of Assyria As we have seen he combined forces with his distinguished and powerful kinsman and laid a heavy hand on the Suti Then he dug wells and erected a chain of fortifications like block houses so that caravans might come and go without interruption and merchants be freed from the imposts of petty kings whose territory they had to penetrate when travelling by the Haran route This bold scheme however was foredoomed to failure It was shown scant favour by the Babylonian Kassites No record survives to indicate the character of the agreement between Kadashman Kharbe and Ashur uballit but there can be little doubt that it involved the abandonment by Babylonia of its historic claim upon Mesopotamia or part of it and the recognition of an Assyrian sphere of influence in that region It was probably on account of his pronounced pro Assyrian tendencies that the Kassites murdered Kadashman Kharbe and set the pretender known as the son of nobody on the throne for a brief period Kadashman Kharbe s immediate successors recognized in Assyria a dangerous and unscrupulous rival and resumed the struggle for the possession of Mesopotamia The trade route across the Arabian desert had to be abandoned Probably it required too great a force to keep it open Then almost every fresh conquest achieved by Assyria involved it in war with Babylonia which appears to have been ever waiting for a suitable opportunity to cripple its northern rival But Assyria was not the only power which Babylonia had to guard itself against On its eastern frontier Elam was also panting for expansion Its chief caravan roads ran from Susa through Assyria towards Asia Minor and through Babylonia towards the Phoenician coast It was probably because its commerce was hampered by the growth of Assyrian power in the north as Servia s commerce in our own day has been hampered by Austria that it cherished dreams of conquering Babylonia In fact as Kassite influence suffered decline one of the great problems of international politics was whether Elam or Assyria would enter into possession of the ancient lands of Sumer and Akkad Ashur uballit s vigorous policy of Assyrian expansion was continued as has been shown by his son Bel nirari His grandson Arik den ilu conducted several successful campaigns and penetrated westward as far as Haran thus crossing the Babylonian caravan road He captured great herds of cattle and flocks of sheep which were transported to Asshur and on one occasion carried away two hundred fifty thousand prisoners Meanwhile Babylonia waged war with Elam It is related that Khur batila King of Elam sent a challenge to Kurigalzu III a descendant of Kadashman Kharbe saying Come hither I will fight with thee The Babylonian monarch accepted the challenge invaded the territory of his rival and won a great victory Deserted by his troops the Elamite king was taken prisoner and did not secure release until he had ceded a portion of his territory and consented to pay annual tribute to Babylonia Flushed with his success the Kassite king invaded Assyria when Adad nirari I died and his son Arik den ilu came to the throne He found however that the Assyrians were more powerful than the Elamites and suffered defeat His son Na zi mar ut tash four hundred nine also made an unsuccessful attempt to curb the growing power of the northern Power These recurring conflicts were intimately associated with the Mesopotamian question Assyria was gradually expanding westward and shattering the dreams of the Babylonian statesmen and traders who hoped to recover control of the caravan routes and restore the prestige of their nation in the west Like his father Adad nirari I of Assyria had attacked the Aramaean Suti who were settling about Haran He also acquired a further portion of the ancient kingdom of Mitanni with the result that he exercised sway over part of northern Mesopotamia After defeating Na zi mar ut tash he fixed the boundaries of the Assyrian and Babylonian spheres of influence much to the advantage of his own country At home Adad nirari conducted a vigorous policy He developed the resources of the city state of Asshur by constructing a great dam and quay wall while he contributed to the prosperity of the priesthood and the growth of Assyrian culture by extending the temple of the god Ashur Ere he died he assumed the proud title of Shar Kishshate king of the world which was also used by his son Shalmaneser I His reign extended over a period of thirty years and terminated about thirteen hundred B C Soon after Shalmaneser came to the throne his country suffered greatly from an earthquake which threw down Ishtar s temple at Nineveh and Ashur s temple at Asshur Fire broke out in the latter building and destroyed it completely These disasters did not dismay the young monarch Indeed they appear to have stimulated him to set out on a career of conquest to secure treasure and slaves so as to carry out the work of reconstructing the temples without delay He became as great a builder and as tireless a campaigner as Thothmes III of Egypt and under his guidance Assyria became the most powerful nation in Western Asia Ere he died his armies were so greatly dreaded that the Egyptians and Assyrians drew their long struggle for supremacy in Syria to a close and formed an alliance for mutual protection against their common enemy It is necessary at this point to review briefly the history of Palestine and north Syria after the period of Hittite expansion under King Subbi luliuma and the decline of Egyptian power under Akhenaton The western part of Mitanni and the most of northern Syria had been colonized by the Hittites four hundred ten Farther south their allies the Amorites formed a buffer State on the borders of Egypt s limited sphere of influence in southern Palestine and of Babylonia s sphere in southern Mesopotamia Mitanni was governed by a subject king who was expected to prevent the acquisition by Assyria of territory in the north west Subbi luliuma was succeeded on the Hittite throne by his son King Mursil who was known to the Egyptians as Meraser or Maurasar The greater part of this monarch s reign appears to have been peaceful and prosperous His allies protected his frontiers and he was able to devote himself to the work of consolidating his empire in Asia Minor and North Syria He erected a great palace at Boghaz Koei and appears to have had dreams of imitating the splendours of the royal Courts of Egypt Assyria and Babylon At this period the Hittite Empire was approaching the zenith of its power It controlled the caravan roads of Babylonia and Egypt and its rulers appear not only to have had intimate diplomatic relations with both these countries but even to have concerned themselves regarding their internal affairs When Rameses I came to the Egyptian throne at the beginning of the Nineteenth Dynasty he sealed an agreement with the Hittites and at a later date the Hittite ambassador at Babylon who represented Hattusil II the second son of King Mursil actually intervened in a dispute regarding the selection of a successor to the throne The closing years of King Mursil s reign were disturbed by the military conquests of Egypt which had renewed its strength under Rameses I Seti I the son of Rameses I and the third Pharaoh of the powerful Nineteenth Dynasty took advantage of the inactivity of the Hittite ruler by invading southern Syria He had first to grapple with the Amorites whom he successfully defeated Then he pressed northward as far as Tunip and won a decisive victory over a Hittite army which secured to Egypt for a period the control of Palestine as far north as Phoenicia When Mursil died he was succeeded on the Hittite throne by his son Mutallu whom the Egyptians referred to as Metella or Mautinel He was a vigorous and aggressive monarch and appears to have lost no time in compelling the Amorites to throw off their allegiance to Egypt and recognize him as their overlord As a result when Rameses II ascended the Egyptian throne he had to undertake the task of winning back the Asiatic possessions of his father The preliminary operations conducted by Rameses on the Palestinian coast were attended with much success Then in his fifth year he marched northward with a great army with purpose it would appear to emulate the achievements of Thothmes III and win fame as a mighty conqueror But he underestimated the strength of his rival and narrowly escaped disaster Advancing impetuously with but two of his four divisions he suddenly found himself surrounded by the army of the wily Hittite King Mutallu in the vicinity of the city of Kadesh on the Orontes His first division remained intact but his second was put to flight by an intervening force of the enemy From this perilous position Rameses extricated himself by leading a daring charge against the Hittite lines on the river bank which proved successful Thrown into confusion his enemies sought refuge in the city but the Pharaoh refrained from attacking them there Although Rameses boasted on his return home of having achieved a great victory there is nothing more certain than that this campaign proved a dismal failure He was unable to win back for Egypt the northern territories which had acknowledged the suzerainty of Egypt during the Eighteenth Dynasty Subsequently he was kept fully engaged in maintaining his prestige in northern Palestine and the vicinity of Phoenicia Then his Asiatic military operations which extended altogether over a period of about twenty years were brought to a close in a dramatic and unexpected manner The Hittite king Mutallu had died in battle or by the hand of an assassin and was succeeded by his brother Hattusil II Khetasar who sealed a treaty of peace with the great Rameses An Egyptian copy of this interesting document can still be read on the walls of a Theban temple but it is lacking in certain details which interest present day historians No reference for instance is made to the boundaries of the Egyptian Empire in Syria so that it is impossible to estimate the degree of success which attended the campaigns of Rameses An interesting light however is thrown on the purport of the treaty by a tablet letter which has been discovered by Professor Hugo Winckler at Boghaz Koei It is a copy of a communication addressed by Hattusil II to the King of Babylonia who had made an enquiry regarding it I will inform my brother wrote the Hittite monarch the King of Egypt and I have made an alliance and made ourselves brothers Brothers we are and will unite against a common foe and with friends in common four hundred eleven The common foe could have been no other than Assyria and the Hittite king s letter appears to convey a hint to Kadashman turgu of Babylon that he should make common cause with Rameses II and Hattusil Shalmaneser I of Assyria was pursuing a determined policy of western and northern expansion He struck boldly at the eastern Hittite States and conquered Malatia where he secured great treasure for the god Ashur He even founded colonies within the Hittite sphere of influence on the borders of Armenia Shalmaneser s second campaign was conducted against the portion of ancient Mitanni which was under Hittite control The vassal king Sattuari apparently a descendant of Tushratta s endeavoured to resist the Assyrians with the aid of Hittites and Aramaeans but his army of allies was put to flight The victorious Shalmaneser was afterwards able to penetrate as far westward as Carchemish on the Euphrates Having thus secured the whole of Mitanni the Assyrian conqueror attacked the Aramaean hordes which were keeping the territory round Haran in a continuous state of unrest and forced them to recognize him as their overlord Shalmaneser thus it would appear gained control of northern Mesopotamia and consequently of the Babylonian caravan route to Haran As a result Hittite prestige must have suffered decline in Babylon For a generation the Hittites had had the Babylonian merchants at their mercy and apparently compelled them to pay heavy duties Winckler has found among the Boghaz Koei tablets several letters from the king of Babylon who made complaints regarding robberies committed by Amoritic bandits and requested that they should be punished and kept in control Such a communication is a clear indication that he was entitled in lieu of payment to have an existing agreement fulfilled Shalmaneser found that Asshur the ancient capital was unsuitable for the administration of his extended empire so he built a great city at Kalkhi Nimrud the Biblical Calah which was strategically situated amidst fertile meadows on the angle of land formed by the Tigris and the Upper Zab Thither to a new palace he transferred his brilliant Court He was succeeded by his son Tukulti Ninip I who was the most powerful of the Assyrian monarchs of the Old Empire He made great conquests in the north and east extended and strengthened Assyrian influence in Mesopotamia and penetrated into Hittite territory bringing into subjection no fewer than forty kings whom he compelled to pay annual tribute It was inevitable that he should be drawn into conflict with the Babylonian king who was plotting with the Hittites against him One of the tablet letters found by Winckler at Boghaz Koei is of special interest in this connection Hattusil advises the young monarch of Babylonia to go and plunder the land of the foe Apparently he sought to be freed from the harassing attention of the Assyrian conqueror by prevailing on his Babylonian royal friend to act as a cat s paw It is uncertain whether or not Kashtiliash II of Babylonia invaded Assyria with purpose to cripple his rival At any rate war broke out between the two countries and Tukulti Ninip proved irresistible in battle He marched into Babylonia and not only defeated Kashtiliash but captured him and carried him off to Asshur where he was presented in chains to the god Ashur The city of Babylon was captured its wall was demolished and many of its inhabitants were put to the sword Tukulti Ninip was evidently waging a war of conquest for he pillaged E sagila the temple of the high head and removed the golden statue of the god Merodach to Assyria where it remained for about sixteen years He subdued the whole of Babylonia as far south as the Persian Gulf and ruled it through viceroys Tukulti Ninip however was not a popular emperor even in his own country He offended national susceptibilities by showing preference for Babylonia and founding a new city which has not been located There he built a great palace and a temple for Ashur and his pantheon He called the city after himself Kar Tukulti Ninip four hundred twelve Seven years after the conquest of Babylonia revolts broke out against the emperor in Assyria and Babylonia and he was murdered in his palace which had been besieged and captured by an army headed by his own son Ashur natsir pal I who succeeded him The Babylonian nobles meantime drove the Assyrian garrisons from their cities and set on the throne the Kassite prince Adad shum utsur Thus in a brief space went to pieces the old Assyrian Empire which at the close of Tukulti Ninip s thirty years reign embraced the whole Tigro Euphrates valley from the borders of Armenia to the Persian Gulf An obscure century followed during which Assyria was raided by its enemies and broken up into petty States The Elamites were not slow to take advantage of the state of anarchy which prevailed in Babylonia during the closing years of Assyrian rule They overran a part of ancient Sumer and captured Nippur where they slew a large number of inhabitants and captured many prisoners On a subsequent occasion they pillaged Isin When however the Babylonian king had cleared his country of the Assyrians he attacked the Elamites and drove them across the frontier Nothing is known regarding the reign of the parricide Ashur natsir pal I of Assyria He was succeeded by Ninip Tukulti Ashur and Adad shum lishir who either reigned concurrently or were father and son After a brief period these were displaced by another two rulers Ashur nirari III and Nabu dan It is not clear why Ninip Tukulti Ashur was deposed Perhaps he was an ally of Adad shum utsur the Babylonian king and was unpopular on that account He journeyed to Babylon on one occasion carrying with him the statue of Merodach but did not return Perhaps he fled from the rebels At any rate Adad shum utsur was asked to send him back by an Assyrian dignitary who was probably Ashur nirari III The king of Babylon refused this request nor would he give official recognition to the new ruler or rulers Soon afterwards another usurper Bel kudur utsur led an Assyrian army against the Babylonians but was slain in battle He was succeeded by Ninip apil esharia who led his forces back to Asshur followed by Adad shum utsur The city was besieged but not captured by the Babylonian army Under Adad shum utsur who reigned for thirty years Babylonia recovered much of its ancient splendour It held Elam in check and laid a heavy hand on Assyria which had been paralysed by civil war Once again it possessed Mesopotamia and controlled its caravan road to Haran and Phoenicia and apparently its relations with the Hittites and Syrians were of a cordial character The next king Meli shipak assumed the Assyrian title Shar Kishshati king of the world and had a prosperous reign of fifteen years He was succeeded by Marduk aplu iddin I who presided over the destinies of Babylonia for about thirteen years Thereafter the glory of the Kassite Dynasty passed away King Zamama shum iddin followed with a twelvemonth s reign during which his kingdom was successfully invaded from the north by the Assyrians under King Ashur dan I and from the east by the Elamites under a king whose name has not been traced Several towns were captured and pillaged and rich booty was carried off to Asshur and Susa Bel shum iddin succeeded Zamama shum iddin but three years afterwards he was deposed by a king of Isin So ended the Kassite Dynasty of Babylonia which had endured for a period of five hundred seventy six years and nine months Babylonia was called Karduniash during the Kassite Dynasty This name was originally applied to the district at the river mouths where the alien rulers appear to have first achieved ascendancy Apparently they were strongly supported by the non Semitic elements in the population and represented a popular revolt against the political supremacy of the city of Babylon and its god Merodach It is significant to find in this connection that the early Kassite kings showed a preference for Nippur as their capital and promoted the worship of Enlil the elder Bel who was probably identified with their own god of fertility and battle Their sun god Sachi appears to have been merged in Shamash In time however the kings followed the example of Hammurabi by exalting Merodach The Kassite language added to the Babel of tongues among the common people but was never used in inscriptions At an early period the alien rulers became thoroughly Babylonianized and as they held sway for nearly six centuries it cannot be assumed that they were unpopular They allowed their mountain homeland or earliest area of settlement in the east to be seized and governed by Assyria and probably maintained as slight a connection with it after settlement in Babylonia as did the Saxons of England with their Continental area of origin Although Babylonia was not so great a world power under the Kassites as it had been during the Hammurabi Dynasty it prospered greatly as an industrial agricultural and trading country The Babylonian language was used throughout western Asia as the language of diplomacy and commerce and the city of Babylon was the most important commercial metropolis of the ancient world Its merchants traded directly and indirectly with far distant countries They imported cobalt which was used for colouring glass a vivid blue from China and may have occasionally met Chinese traders who came westward with their caravans while a brisk trade in marble and limestone was conducted with and through Elam Egypt was the chief source of the gold supply which was obtained from the Nubian mines and in exchange for this precious metal the Babylonians supplied the Nilotic merchants with lapis lazuli from Bactria enamel and their own wonderful coloured glass which was not unlike the later Venetian as well as chariots and horses The Kassites were great horse breeders and the battle steeds from the Babylonian province of Namar were everywhere in great demand They also promoted the cattle trade Cattle rearing was confined chiefly to the marshy districts at the head of the Persian Gulf and the extensive steppes on the borders of the Arabian desert so well known to Abraham and his ancestors which provided excellent grazing Agriculture also flourished as in Egypt it constituted the basis of national and commercial prosperity It is evident that great wealth accumulated in Karduniash during the Kassite period When the images of Merodach and Zerpanitu m were taken back to Babylon from Assyria they were clad as has been recorded in garments embroidered with gold and sparkling with gems while E sagila was redecorated on a lavish scale with priceless works of art Assyria presented a sharp contrast to Babylonia the mother land from which its culture was derived As a separate kingdom it had to develop along different lines In fact it was unable to exist as a world power without the enforced company operation of neighbouring States Babylonia on the other hand could have flourished in comparative isolation like Egypt during the Old Kingdom period because it was able to feed itself and maintain a large population so long as its rich alluvial plain was irrigated during its dry season which extended over about eight months in the year The region north of Baghdad was of different geographical formation to the southern plain and therefore less suitable for the birth and growth of a great independent civilization Assyria embraced a chalk plateau of the later Mesozoic period with tertiary deposits and had an extremely limited area suitable for agricultural pursuits Its original inhabitants were nomadic pastoral and hunting tribes and there appears to be little doubt that agriculture was introduced along the banks of the Tigris by colonists from Babylonia who formed city States which owed allegiance to the kings of Sumer and Akkad After the Hammurabi period Assyria rose into prominence as a predatory power which depended for its stability upon those productive countries which it was able to conquer and hold in sway It never had a numerous peasantry and such as it had ultimately vanished for the kings pursued the short sighted policy of colonizing districts on the borders of their empire with their loyal subjects and settling aliens in the heart of the homeland where they were controlled by the military In this manner they built up an artificial empire which suffered at critical periods in its history because it lacked the great driving and sustaining force of a population welded together by immemorial native traditions and the love of country which is the essence of true patriotism National sentiment was chiefly confined to the military aristocracy and the priests the enslaved and uncultured masses of aliens were concerned mainly with their daily duties and no doubt included communities like the Israelites in captivity who longed to return to their native lands Assyria had to maintain a standing army which grew from an alliance of brigands who first enslaved the native population and ultimately extended their sway over neighbouring States The successes of the army made Assyria powerful Conquering kings accumulated rich booty by pillaging alien cities and grew more and more wealthy as they were able to impose annual tribute on those States which came under their sway They even regarded Babylonia with avaricious eyes It was to achieve the conquest of the fertile and prosperous mother State that the early Assyrian emperors conducted military operations in the north west and laid hands on Mesopotamia There was no surer way of strangling it than by securing control of its trade routes What the command of the sea is to Great Britain at the present day the command of the caravan roads was to ancient Babylonia Babylonia suffered less than Assyria by defeat in battle its natural resources gave it great recuperative powers and the native population was ever so intensely patriotic that centuries of alien sway could not obliterate their national aspirations A conqueror of Babylon had to become a Babylonian The Amorites and Kassites had in turn to adopt the modes of life and modes of thought of the native population Like the Egyptians the Babylonians ever achieved the intellectual conquest of their conquerors The Assyrian Empire on the other hand collapsed like a house of cards when its army of mercenaries suffered a succession of disasters The kings as we have indicated depended on the tribute of subject States to pay their soldiers and maintain the priesthood they were faced with national bankruptcy when their vassals successfully revolted against them The history of Assyria as a world power is divided into three periods one the Old Empire two the Middle Empire three the New or Last Empire We have followed the rise and growth of the Old Empire from the days of Ashur uballit until the reign of Tukulti Ninip when it flourished in great splendour and suddenly went to pieces Thereafter until the second period of the Old Empire Assyria comprised but a few city States which had agricultural resources and were trading centres Of these the most enterprising was Asshur When a ruler of Asshur was able by conserving his revenues to command sufficient capital with purpose to raise a strong army of mercenaries as a business speculation he set forth to build up a new empire on the ruins of the old In its early stages of course this process was slow and difficult It necessitated the adoption of a military career by native Assyrians who officered the troops and these troops had to be trained and disciplined by engaging in brigandage which also brought them rich rewards for their services Babylonia became powerful by developing the arts of peace Assyria became powerful by developing the science of warfare CHAPTER XVI RACE MOVEMENTS THAT SHATTERED EMPIRES The Third Semitic Migration Achaean Conquest of Greece Fall of Crete Tribes of Raiders European Settlers in Asia Minor The Muski overthrow the Hittites Sea Raids on Egypt The Homeric Age Israelites and Philistines in Palestine Culture of Philistines Nebuchadrezzar I of Babylonia Wars against Elamites and Hittites Conquests in Mesopotamia and Syria Assyrians and Babylonians at War Tiglath pileser I

History Philistines as Overlords of Hebrews Kingdom of David and Saul Solomon s Relations with Egypt and Phoenicia Sea Trade with India Aramaean Conquests The Chaldaeans Egyptian King plunders Judah and Israel Historical Importance of Race Movements Great changes were taking place in the ancient world during the period in which Assyria rose into prominence and suddenly suffered decline These were primarily due to widespread migrations of pastoral peoples from the steppe lands of Asia and Europe and the resulting displacement of settled tribes The military operations of the great Powers were also a disturbing factor for they not only propelled fresh movements beyond their spheres of influence but caused the petty States to combine against a common enemy and foster ambitions to achieve conquests on a large scale Towards the close of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt of which Amenhotep III and Akhenaton were the last great kings two well defined migrations were in progress The Aramaean folk waves had already begun to pour in increasing volume into Syria from Arabia and in Europe the pastoral fighting folk from the mountains were establishing themselves along the south eastern coast and crossing the Hellespont to overrun the land of the Hittites These race movements were destined to exercise considerable influence in shaping the history of the ancient world The Aramaean or Third Semitic migration in time swamped various decaying States Despite the successive efforts of the great Powers to hold it in check it ultimately submerged the whole of Syria and part of Mesopotamia Aramaean speech then came into common use among the mingled peoples over a wide area and was not displaced until the time of the Fourth Semitic or Moslem migration from Arabia which began in the seventh century of the Christian era and swept northward through Syria to Asia Minor eastward across Mesopotamia into Persia and India and westward through Egypt along the north African coast to Morocco and then into Spain When Syria was sustaining the first shocks of Aramaean invasion the last wave of Achaeans the tamers of horses and shepherds of the people had achieved the conquest of Greece and contributed to the overthrow of the dynasty of King Minos of Crete Professor Ridgeway identifies this stock which had been filtering southward for several centuries with the tall fair haired and grey eyed Keltoi Celts four hundred thirteen who doctor Haddon believes were representatives of the mixed peoples of northern and Alpine descent four hundred fourteen mister Hawes following Professor Sergi holds on the other hand that the Achaeans were fair in comparison with the native Pelasgian Mediterranean stock but not necessarily blonde four hundred fifteen The earliest Achaeans were rude uncultured barbarians but the last wave came from some unknown centre of civilization and probably used iron as well as bronze weapons The old Cretans were known to the Egyptians as the Keftiu and traded on the Mediterranean and the Black Sea It is significant to find however that no mention is made of them in the inscriptions of the Pharaohs after the reign of Amenhotep III In their place appear the Shardana the Mykenaean people who gave their name to Sardinia the Danauna believed to be identical with the Danaoi of Homer the Akhaivasha perhaps the Achaeans and the Tursha and Shakalsha who may have been of the same stock as the piratical Lycians When Rameses II fought his famous battle at Kadesh the Hittite king included among his allies the Aramaeans from Arabia and other mercenaries like the Dardanui and Masa who represented the Thraco Phrygian peoples who had overrun the Balkans occupied Thrace and Macedonia and crossed into Asia Minor In time the Hittite confederacy was broken up by the migrating Europeans and their dominant tribe the Muski four hundred sixteen the Moschoi of the Greeks and the Meshech of the Old Testament came into conflict with the Assyrians The Muski were forerunners of the Phrygians and were probably of allied stock Pharaoh Meneptah the son of Rameses II did not benefit much by the alliance with the Hittites to whom he had to send a supply of grain during a time of famine He found it necessary indeed to invade Syria where their influence had declined and had to beat back from the Delta region the piratical invaders of the same tribes as were securing a footing in Asia Minor In Syria Meneptah fought with the Israelites who apparently had begun their conquest of Canaan during his reign Before the Kassite Dynasty had come to an end Rameses III of Egypt eleven ninety eight eleven sixty seven B C freed his country from the perils of a great invasion of Europeans by land and sea He scattered a fleet on the Delta coast and then arrested the progress of a strong force which was pressing southward through Phoenicia towards the Egyptian frontier These events occurred at the beginning of the Homeric Age and were followed by the siege of Troy which according to the Greeks began about eleven ninety four B C The land raiders who were thwarted by Rameses III were the Philistines a people from Crete four hundred seventeen When the prestige of Egypt suffered decline they overran the coastline of Canaan and that country was then called Palestine the land of the Philistines while the Egyptian overland trade route to Phoenicia became known as the way of the Philistines Their conflicts with the Hebrews are familiar to readers of the Old Testament The only contributions the Hebrews made to the culture of the country writes Professor Macalister were their simple desert customs and their religious organization On the other hand the Philistines sprung from one of the great homes of art of the ancient world had brought with them the artistic instincts of their race decayed no doubt but still superior to anything they met with in the land itself Tombs to be ascribed to them found in Gezer contained beautiful jewellery and ornaments The Philistines in fact were the only cultured or artistic race who ever occupied the soil of Palestine at least until the time when the influence of classical Greece asserted itself too strongly to be withstood Whatsoever things raised life in the country above the dull animal existence of fellahin were due to this people The peasantry of the modern villages still tell of the great days of old when it Palestine was inhabited by the mighty race of the Fenish four hundred eighteen When the Kassite Dynasty of Babylonia was extinguished about eleven forty B C the Amorites were being displaced in Palestine by the Philistines and the Israelitish tribes the Aramaeans were extending their conquests in Syria and Mesopotamia the Muski were the overlords of the Hittites Assyrian power was being revived at the beginning of the second period of the Old Empire and Egypt was governed by a weakly king Rameses VIII a puppet in the hands of the priesthood who was unable to protect the rich tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty Pharaohs against the bands of professional robbers who were plundering them A new dynasty the Dynasty of Pashe had arisen at the ancient Sumerian city of Isin Its early kings were contemporary with some of the last Kassite monarchs and they engaged in conflicts with the Elamites who were encroaching steadily upon Babylonian territory and were ultimately able to seize the province of Namar famous for its horses which was situated to the east of Akkad The Assyrians under Ashur dan I were not only reconquering lost territory but invading Babylonia and carrying off rich plunder Ashur dan inflicted a crushing defeat upon the second last Kassite ruler There years later Nebuchadrezzar I of the Dynasty of Pashe seized the Babylonian throne He was the most powerful and distinguished monarch of his line an accomplished general and a wise statesman His name signifies May the god Nebo protect my boundary His first duty was to drive the Elamites from the land and win back from them the statue of Merodach which they had carried off from E sagila At first he suffered a reverse but although the season was midsummer and the heat overpowering he persisted in his campaign The Elamites were forced to retreat and following up their main force he inflicted upon them a shattering defeat on the banks of the Ula a tributary of the Tigris He then invaded Elam and returned with rich booty The province of Namar was recovered and its governor Ritti Merodach who was Nebuchadrezzar s battle companion was restored to his family possessions and exempted from taxation A second raid to Elam resulted in the recovery of the statue of Merodach The Kassite and Lullume mountaineers also received attention and were taught to respect the power of the new monarch Having freed his country from the yoke of the Elamites and driven the Assyrians over the frontier Nebuchadrezzar came into conflict with the Hittites who appear to have overrun Mesopotamia Probably the invaders were operating in conjunction with the Muski who were extending their sway over part of northern Assyria They were not content with securing control of the trade route but endeavoured also to establish themselves permanently in Babylon the commercial metropolis which they besieged and captured This happened in the third year of Nebuchadrezzar when he was still reigning at Isin Assembling a strong force he hastened northward and defeated the Hittites and apparently followed up his victory Probably it was at this time that he conquered the West Land the land of the Amorites and penetrated to the Mediterranean coast Egyptian power had been long extinguished in that region The possession of Mesopotamia was a signal triumph for Babylonia As was inevitable however it brought Nebuchadrezzar into conflict some years later with the Assyrian king Ashur resh ishi I grandson of Ashur dan and father of the famous Tiglath pileser I The northern monarch had engaged himself in subduing the Lullume and Akhlami hill tribes in the south east whose territory had been conquered by Nebuchadrezzar Thereafter he crossed the Babylonian frontier Nebuchadrezzar drove him back and then laid siege to the border fortress of Zanki but the Assyrian king conducted a sudden and successful reconnaissance in force which rendered perilous the position of the attacking force By setting fire to his siege train the Babylonian war lord was able however to retreat in good order Some time later Nebuchadrezzar dispatched another army northward but it suffered a serious defeat and its general Karashtu fell into the hands of the enemy Nebuchadrezzar reigned less than twenty years and appears to have secured the allegiance of the nobility by restoring the feudal system which had been abolished by the Kassites He boasted that he was the sun of his country who restored ancient landmarks and boundaries and promoted the worship of Ishtar the ancient goddess of the people By restoring the image of Merodach he secured the support of Babylon to which city he transferred his Court Nebuchadrezzar was succeeded by his son Ellil nadin apil who reigned a few years but little or nothing is known regarding him His grandson Marduk nadin akhe came into conflict with Tiglath pileser I of Assyria and suffered serious reverses from the effects of which his country did not recover for over a century Tiglath pileser I in one of his inscriptions recorded significantly The feet of the enemy I kept from my country When he came to the throne northern Assyria was menaced by the Muski and their allies the Hittites and the Shubari of old Mitanni The Kashiari hill tribes to the north of Nineveh whom Shalmaneser I subdued had half a century before thrown off the yoke of Assyria and their kings were apparently vassals of the Muski Tiglath pileser first invaded Mitanni where he routed a combined force of Shubari hillmen and Hittites Thereafter a great army of the Muski and their allies pressed southward with purpose to deal a shattering blow against the Assyrian power The very existence of Assyria as a separate power was threatened by this movement Tiglath pileser however was equal to the occasion He surprised the invaders among the Kashiari mountains and inflicted a crushing defeat slaying about fourteen thousand and capturing six thousand prisoners who were transported to Asshur In fact he wiped the invading army out of existence and possessed himself of all its baggage Thereafter he captured several cities and extended his empire beyond the Kashiari hills and into the heart of Mitanni His second campaign was also directed towards the Mitanni district which had been invaded during his absence by a force of Hittites about four thousand strong The invaders submitted to him as soon as he drew near and he added them to his standing army Subsequent operations towards the north restored the pre eminence of Assyria in the Nairi country on the shores of Lake Van in Armenia where Tiglath pileser captured no fewer than twenty three petty kings These he liberated after they had taken the oath of allegiance and consented to pay annual tribute In his fourth year the conqueror learned that the Aramaeans were crossing the Euphrates and possessing themselves of Mitanni which he had cleared of the Hittites By a series of forced marches he caught them unawares scattered them in confusion and entered Carchemish which he pillaged Thereafter his army crossed the Euphrates in boats of skin and plundered and destroyed six cities round the base of the mountain of Bishru While operating in this district Tiglath pileser engaged in big game hunting He recorded Ten powerful bull elephants in the land of Haran and on the banks of the Khabour I killed four elephants alive I took Their skins their teeth with the living elephants I brought to my city of Asshur four hundred nineteen He also claimed to have slain nine hundred twenty lions as well as a number of wild oxen apparently including in his record the bags of his officers and men A later king credited him with having penetrated to the Phoenician coast where he put to sea and slew a sea monster called the nakhiru While at Arvad the narrative continues the King of Egypt who is not named sent him a hippopotamus pagutu This story however is of doubtful authenticity About this time the prestige of Egypt was at so low an ebb that its messengers were subjected to indignities by the Phoenician kings The conquests of Tiglath pileser once more raised the Mesopotamian question in Babylonia whose sphere of influence in that region had been invaded Marduk nadin akhe the grandson of Nebuchadrezzar I arrayed his chariots against Tiglath pileser and in the first conflict achieved some success but subsequently he was defeated in the land of Akkad The Assyrian army afterwards captured several cities including Babylon and Sippar Thus once again the Assyrian Empire came into being as the predominant world Power extending from the land of the Hittites into the heart of Babylonia Its cities were enriched by the immense quantities of booty captured by its warrior king while the coffers of state were glutted with the tribute of subject States Fortifications were renewed temples were built and great gifts were lavished on the priesthood Artists and artisans were kept fully employed restoring the faded splendours of the Old Empire and everywhere thousands of slaves laboured to make the neglected land prosperous as of old Canals were repaired and reopened the earthworks and quay wall of Ashur were strengthened and its great wall was entirely rebuilt faced with a rampart of earth and protected once again by a deep moat The royal palace was enlarged and redecorated Meanwhile Babylonia was wasted by civil war and invasions It was entered more than once by the Aramaeans who pillaged several cities in the north and the south Then the throne was seized by Adad aplu iddina the grandson of a nobody who reigned for about ten years He was given recognition however by the Assyrian king Ashur bel kala son of Tiglath pileser I who married his daughter and apparently restored to him Sippar and Babylon after receiving a handsome dowry Ashur bel kala died without issue and was succeeded by his brother Shamshi Adad An obscure period followed In Babylonia there were two weak dynasties in less than half a century and thereafter an Elamite Dynasty which lasted about six years An Eighth Dynasty ensued and lasted between fifty and sixty years The records of its early kings are exceedingly meagre and their order uncertain During the reign of Nabu mukin apli who was perhaps the fourth monarch the Aramaeans constantly raided the land and hovered about Babylon The names of two or three kings who succeeded Nabu mukin apli are unknown A century and a half after Tiglath pileser I conquered the north Syrian possessions of the Hittites the Old Assyrian Empire reached the close of its second and last period It had suffered gradual decline under a series of inert and luxury loving kings until it was unable to withstand the gradual encroachment on every side of the restless hill tribes who were ever ready to revolt when the authority of Ashur was not asserted at the point of the sword After nine hundred fifty B C the Hittites of North Syria having shaken off the last semblance of Assyrian authority revived their power and enjoyed a full century of independence and prosperity In Cappadocia their kinsmen had freed themselves at an earlier period from the yoke of the Muski who had suffered so severely at the hands of Tiglath pileser I The Hittite buildings and rock sculptures of this period testify to the enduring character of the ancient civilization of the Hatti Until the hieroglyphics can be read however we must wait patiently for the detailed story of the pre Phrygian period which was of great historical importance because the tide of cultural influence was then flowing at its greatest volume from the old to the new world where Greece was emerging in virgin splendour out of the ruins of the ancient Mykenaean and Cretan civilizations It is possible that the conquest of a considerable part of Palestine by the Philistines was not unconnected with the revival of Hittite power in the north They may have moved southward as the allies of the Cilician State which was rising into prominence For a period they were the overlords of the Hebrews who had been displacing the older inhabitants of the Promised Land and appear to have been armed with weapons of iron In fact as is indicated by a passage in the Book of Samuel they had made a corner in that metal and restricted its use among their vassals Now the Biblical narrative sets forth there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel for the Philistines said Lest the Hebrews make them swords and spears but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock four hundred twenty We are inclined says Professor Macalister to picture the West as a thing of yesterday new fangled with its inventions and its progressive civilization and the East as an embodiment of hoary and unchanging traditions But when West first met East on the shores of the Holy Land it was the former which represented the magnificent traditions of the past and the latter which looked forward to the future The Philistines were of the remnant of the dying glories of Crete the Hebrews had no past to speak of but were entering on the heritage they regarded as theirs by right of a recently ratified divine covenant four hundred twenty one Saul was the leader of a revolt against the Philistines in northern Palestine and became the ruler of the kingdom of Israel Then David having liberated Judah from the yoke of the Philistines succeeded Saul as ruler of Israel and selected Jerusalem as his capital He also conquered Edom and Moab but was unsuccessful in his attempt to subjugate Ammon The Philistines were then confined to a restricted area on the seacoast where they fused with the Semites and ultimately suffered loss of identity Under the famous Solomon the united kingdom of the Hebrews reached its highest splendour and importance among the nations If the Philistines received the support of the Hittites the Hebrews were strengthened by an alliance with Egypt For a period of two and a half centuries no Egyptian army had crossed the Delta frontier into Syria The ancient land of the Pharaohs had been overshadowed meantime by a cloud of anarchy and piratical and robber bands settled freely on its coast line At length a Libyan general named Sheshonk Shishak seized the throne from the Tanite Dynasty He was the Pharaoh with whom Solomon made affinity four hundred twenty two and from whom he received the city of Gezer which an Egyptian army had captured four hundred twenty three Solomon had previously married a daughter of Sheshonk s Phoenicia was also flourishing Freed from Egyptian Hittite and Assyrian interference Tyre and Sidon attained to a high degree of power as independent city States During the reigns of David and Solomon Tyre was the predominant Phoenician power Its kings Abibaal and his son Hiram had become Kings of the Sidonians and are believed to have extended their sway over part of Cyprus The relations between the Hebrews and the Phoenicians were of a cordial character indeed the two powers became allies And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for Hiram was ever a lover of David And Solomon sent to Hiram saying Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the Lord His God for the wars which were about him on every side until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet But now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent And behold I purpose to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God as the Lord spake unto David my father saying Thy son whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build an house unto my name Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians And it came to pass when Hiram heard the words of Solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said Blessed be the Lord this day which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people And Hiram sent to Solomon saying I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar and concerning timber of fir My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me and will cause them to be discharged there and thou shalt receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom as he promised him and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon and they two made a league together four hundred twenty four Hiram also sent skilled workers to Jerusalem to assist in the work of building the temple and Solomon s palace including his famous namesake a widow s son of the Hebrew tribe of Naphtali who like his father a man of Tyre had understanding and cunning to work all works in brass four hundred twenty five Solomon must have cultivated good relations with the Chaldaeans for he had a fleet of trading ships on the Persian Gulf which was manned by Phoenician sailors Once in three years the narrative runs came the navy of Tharshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks four hundred twenty six Apparently he traded with India the land of peacocks during the Brahmanical period when the Sanskrit name Samudra which formerly signified the collected waters of the broadening Indus was applied to the Indian Ocean four hundred twenty seven The Aramaeans of the Third Semitic migration were not slow to take advantage of the weakness of Assyria and Babylon They overran the whole of Syria and entered into the possession of Mesopotamia thus acquiring full control of the trade routes towards the west From time to time they ravaged Babylonia from the north to the south Large numbers of them acquired permanent settlement in that country like the Amorites of the Second Semitic migration in the pre Hammurabi Age In Syria the Aramaeans established several petty States and were beginning to grow powerful at Damascus an important trading centre which assumed considerable political importance after the collapse of Assyria s Old Empire At this period too the Chaldaeans came into prominence in Babylonia Their kingdom of Chaldaea Kaldu which signifies Sealand embraces a wide stretch of the coast land at the head of the Persian Gulf between Arabia and Elam As we have seen an important dynasty flourished in this region in the time of Hammurabi Although more than one king of Babylon recorded that he had extinguished the Sealand Power it continued to exist all through the Kassite period It is possible that this obscure kingdom embraced diverse ethnic elements and that it was controlled in turn by military aristocracies of Sumerians Elamites Kassites and Arabians After the downfall of the Kassites it had become thoroughly Semitized perhaps as a result of the Aramaean migration which may have found one of its outlets around the head of the Persian Gulf The ancient Sumerian city of Ur which dominated a considerable area of steppe land to the west of the Euphrates was included in the Sealand kingdom and was consequently referred to in after time as Ur of the Chaldees When Solomon reigned over Judah and Israel Babylonia was broken up into a number of petty States as in early Sumerian times The feudal revival of Nebuchadrezzar I had weakened the central power with the result that the nominal high kings were less able to resist the inroads of invaders Military aristocracies of Aramaeans Elamites and Chaldaeans held sway in various parts of the valley and struggled for supremacy When Assyria began to assert itself again it laid claim on Babylonia ostensibly as the protector of its independence and the Chaldaeans for a time made common cause with the Elamites against it The future however lay with the Chaldaeans who like the Kassites became the liberators of the ancient inhabitants When Assyria was finally extinguished as a world power they revived the ancient glory of Babylonia and supplanted the Sumerians as the scholars and teachers of Western Asia The Chaldaeans became famous in Syria and even in Greece as the wise men from the east and were renowned as astrologers The prestige of the Hebrew kingdom suffered sharp and serious decline after Solomon s death Pharaoh Sheshonk fostered the elements of revolt which ultimately separated Israel from Judah and when a favourable opportunity arose invaded Palestine and Syria and reestablished Egypt s suzerainty over part of the area which had been swayed by Rameses II replenishing his exhausted treasury with rich booty and the tribute he imposed Phoenicia was able however to maintain its independence but before the Assyrians moved westward again Sidon had shaken off the yoke of Tyre and become an independent State It will be seen from the events outlined in this chapter how greatly the history of the ancient world was affected by the periodic migrations of pastoral folks from the steppe lands These human tides were irresistible The direction of their flow might be diverted for a time but they ultimately overcame every obstacle by sheer persistency and overpowering volume Great emperors in Assyria and Egypt endeavoured to protect their countries from the Bedouin peril by strengthening their frontiers and extending their spheres of influence but the dammed up floods of humanity only gathered strength in the interval for the struggle which might be postponed but could not be averted These migrations as has been indicated were due to natural causes They were propelled by climatic changes which caused a shortage of the food supply and by the rapid increase of population under peaceful conditions Once a migration began to flow it set in motion many currents and cross currents but all these converged towards the districts which offered the most attractions to mankind Prosperous and well governed States were ever in peril of invasion by barbarous peoples The fruits of civilization tempted them the reward of conquest was quickly obtained in Babylon and Egypt with their flourishing farms and prosperous cities Waste land was reclaimed then as now by colonists from centres of civilization the migrating pastoral folks lacked the initiative and experience necessary to establish new communities in undeveloped districts Highly civilized men sowed the harvest and the barbarians reaped it It must not be concluded however that the migrations were historical disasters or that they retarded the general advancement of the human race In time the barbarians became civilized and fused with the peoples whom they conquered They introduced too into communities which had grown stagnant and weakly a fresh and invigorating atmosphere that acted as a stimulant in every sphere of human activity The Kassite for instance was a unifying and therefore a strengthening influence in Babylonia He shook off the manacles of the past which bound the Sumerian and the Akkadian alike to traditional lines of policy based on unforgotten ancient rivalries His concern was chiefly with the future The nomads with their experience of desert wandering promoted trade and the revival of trade inaugurated new eras of prosperity in ancient centres of culture and brought them into closer touch than ever before with one another The rise of Greece was due to the blending of the Achaeans and other pastoral fighting folks with the indigenous Pelasgians Into the early States which fostered the elements of ancient Mykenaean civilization poured the cultural influences of the East through Asia Minor and Phoenicia and from the Egyptian coast The conquerors from the steppes meanwhile contributed their genius for organization their simple and frugal habits of life and their sterling virtues they left a deep impress on the moral physical and intellectual life of Greece CHAPTER XVII THE HEBREWS IN

VII Babylonia becomes an Assyrian Province In one of the Scottish versions of the Seven Sleepers legend a shepherd enters a cave in which the great heroes of other days lie wrapped in magic slumber and blows two blasts on the horn which hangs suspended from the roof

6531_61334_000000_000002	train-clean-100	Then the shepherd hears a warning voice which comes and goes like the wind saying If the horn is blown once again the world will be upset altogether 
none	none	Terrified by the Voice and the ferocious appearance of the heroes the shepherd retreats hurriedly locking the door behind him he casts the key into the sea The story proceeds If anyone should find the key and open the door and blow but a single blast on the horn Finn and all the Feans would come forth And that would be a great day in Alban four hundred twenty eight After the lapse of an obscure century the national heroes of Assyria were awakened as if from sleep by the repeated blasts from the horn of the triumphant thunder god amidst the northern and western mountains Adad or Rimmon of Syria Teshup of Armenia Tarku of the western Hittites The great kings who came forth to upset the world bore the familiar names Ashur natsir pal Shalmaneser Shamash Adad Ashur dan Adad nirari and Ashur nirari They revived and increased the ancient glory of Assyria during its Middle Empire period The Syro Cappadocian Hittites had grown once again powerful and prosperous but no great leader like Subbiluliuma arose to weld the various States into an Empire so as to ensure the protection of the mingled peoples from the operations of the aggressive and ambitious war lords of Assyria 
6531_61334_000002_000001	train-clean-100	One kingdom had its capital at Hamath and another at Carchemish on the Euphrates

6531_61334_000002_000006	train-clean-100	The northern frontier of Assyria was continually menaced by groups of independent hill States which would have been irresistible had they operated together against a common enemy but were liable to be extinguished when attacked in detail 
none	none	A number of Aramaean kingdoms had come into existence in Mesopotamia and throughout Syria The most influential of these was the State of Damascus the king of which was the overlord of the Hebrew kingdoms of Israel and Judah when Ashur natsir pal III ascended the Assyrian throne about eight hundred eighty five B C Groups of the Aramaeans had acquired a high degree of culture and become traders and artisans Large numbers had filtered as well not only into Babylonia but also Assyria and the north Syrian area of Hittite control 
6531_61334_000003_000004	train-clean-100	Accustomed for generations to desert warfare they were fearless warriors 
6531_61334_000003_000005	train-clean-100	Their armies had great mobility being composed mostly of mounted infantry and were not easily overpowered by the Assyrian forces of footmen and charioteers Indeed it was not until cavalry was included in the standing army of Assyria that operations against the Aramaeans were attended with permanent success

6531_61334_000004_000004	train-clean-100	In the north he had to drive back invading bands of the Muski 
none	none	Although like his father he carried out great works at Asshur he appears to have transferred his Court to Nineveh a sure indication that Assyria was once again becoming powerful in northern Mesopotamia and the regions towards Armenia Ashur natsir pal III son of Tukulti Ninip II inaugurated a veritable reign of terror in Mesopotamia and northern Syria His methods of dealing with revolting tribes were of a most savage character Chiefs were skinned alive and when he sacked their cities not only fighting men but women and children were either slaughtered or burned at the stake It is not surprising to find therefore that on more than one occasion the kings of petty States made submission to him without resistance as soon as he invaded their domains In his first year he overran the mountainous district between Lake Van and the upper sources of the Tigris Bubu the rebel son of the governor of Nishtun who had been taken prisoner was transported to Arbela where he was skinned alive 
6531_61334_000006_000002	train-clean-100	Like his father Ashur natsir pal fought against the Muski whose power was declining 
none	none	Then he turned southward from the borders of Asia Minor and dealt with a rebellion in northern Mesopotamia An Aramaean pretender named Akhiababa had established himself at Suru in the region to the east of the Euphrates enclosed by its tributaries the Khabar and the Balikh 
6531_61334_000007_000001	train-clean-100	He had come from the neighbouring Aramaean State of Bit Adini and was preparing it would appear to form a powerful confederacy against the Assyrians

none	none	He entered the city seized the pretender and many of his followers 
6531_61334_000008_000002	train-clean-100	These he disposed of with characteristic barbarity Some were skinned alive and some impaled on stakes while others were enclosed in a pillar which the king had erected to remind the Aramaeans of his determination to brook no opposition 
6531_61334_000008_000003	train-clean-100	Akhiababa the pretender was sent to Nineveh with a few supporters and when they had been flayed their skins were nailed upon the city walls

6531_61334_000009_000006	train-clean-100	Ashur natsir pal s own account of the operations runs as follows 
none	none	The city of Tello was very strong three walls surrounded it The inhabitants trusted to their strong walls and numerous soldiers they did not come down or embrace my feet With battle and slaughter I assaulted and took the city Three thousand warriors I slew in battle 
6531_61334_000010_000003	train-clean-100	Their booty and possessions cattle sheep I carried away many captives I burned with fire

none	none	On one occasion Ashur natsir pal swept southward through this region and attacked a combined force of Sukhi Aramaeans and Babylonians The Babylonians were commanded by Zabdanu brother of Nabu aplu iddin king of Babylonia who was evidently anxious to regain control of the western trade route 
6531_61334_000013_000003	train-clean-100	The Assyrian war lord however proved to be too powerful a rival

Middle Empire Dynasty One of the most interesting figures in Mesopotamian history came into prominence during the Assyrian Middle Empire period This was the famous Sammu rammat the Babylonian wife of an Assyrian ruler Like Sargon of Akkad Alexander the Great and Dietrich von Bern she made by reason of her achievements and influence a deep impression on the popular imagination and as these monarchs became identified in tradition with gods of war and fertility she had attached to her memory the myths associated with the mother goddess of love and battle who presided over the destinies of mankind In her character as the legendary Semiramis of Greek literature the Assyrian queen was reputed to have been the daughter of Derceto the dove and fish goddess of Askalon and to have departed from earth in bird form It is not quite certain whether Sammu rammat was the wife of Shamshi Adad VII or of his son Adad nirari IV Before the former monarch reduced Babylonia to the status of an Assyrian province he had signed a treaty of peace with its king and it is suggested that it was confirmed by a matrimonial alliance This treaty was repudiated by King Bau akh iddina who was transported with his palace treasures to Assyria As Sammu rammat was evidently a royal princess of Babylonia it seems probable that her marriage was arranged with purpose to legitimatize the succession of the Assyrian overlords to the Babylonian throne The principle of mother right was ever popular in those countries where the worship of the Great Mother was perpetuated if not in official at any rate in domestic religion Not a few Egyptian Pharaohs reigned as husbands or as sons of royal ladies Succession by the female line was also observed among the Hittites When Hattusil II gave his daughter in marriage to Putakhi king of the Amorites he inserted a clause in the treaty of alliance to the effect that the sovereignty over the Amorite should belong to the son and descendants of his daughter for evermore four hundred sixty four As queen or queen mother Sammu rammat occupied as prominent a position in Assyria as did Queen Tiy of Egypt during the lifetime of her husband Amenhotep III and the early part of the reign of her son Amenhotep IV Akhenaton The Tell el Amarna letters testify to Tiy s influence in the Egyptian Foreign Office and we know that at home she was joint ruler with her husband and took part with him in public ceremonials During their reign a temple was erected to the mother goddess Mut and beside it was formed a great lake on which sailed the barque of Aton in connection with mysterious religious ceremonials After Akhenaton s religious revolt was inaugurated the worship of Mut was discontinued and Tiy went into retirement In Akhenaton s time the vulture symbol of the goddess Mut did not appear above the sculptured figures of royalty What connection the god Aton had with Mut during the period of the Tiy regime remains obscure There is no evidence that Aton was first exalted as the son of the Great Mother goddess although this is not improbable Queen Sammu rammat of Assyria like Tiy of Egypt is associated with social and religious innovations She was the first and indeed the only Assyrian royal lady to be referred to on equal terms with her royal husband in official inscriptions In a dedication to the god Nebo that deity is reputed to be the protector of the life of Adad nirari king of the land of Ashur his lord and the life of Sammu rammat she of the palace his lady four hundred sixty five During the reign of Adad nirari IV the Assyrian Court radiated Babylonian culture and traditions The king not only recorded his descent from the first Shalmaneser but also claimed to be a descendant of Bel kap kapu an earlier but to us unknown Babylonian monarch than Sulili i e Sumu la ilu the great great grandfather of Hammurabi Bel kap kapu was reputed to have been an overlord of Assyria Apparently Adad nirari desired to be regarded as the legitimate heir to the thrones of Assyria and Babylonia His claim upon the latter country must have had a substantial basis It is not too much to assume that he was a son of a princess of its ancient royal family Sammurammat may therefore have been his mother She could have been called his wife in the mythological sense the king having become husband of his mother If such was the case the royal pair probably posed as the high priest and high priestess of the ancient goddess cult the incarnations of the Great Mother and the son who displaced his sire The worship of the Great Mother was the popular religion of the indigenous peoples of western Asia including parts of Asia Minor Egypt and southern and western Europe It appears to have been closely associated with agricultural rites practised among representative communities of the Mediterranean race In Babylonia and Assyria the peoples of the goddess cult fused with the peoples of the god cult but the prominence maintained by Ishtar who absorbed many of the old mother deities testifies to the persistence of immemorial habits of thought and antique religious ceremonials among the descendants of the earliest settlers in the Tigro Euphrates valley Merodach s spouse Zerpanitu m was not a shadowy deity but a goddess who exercised as much influence as her divine husband As Aruru she took part with him in the creation of mankind In Asia Minor the mother goddess was overshadowed by the father god during the period of Hatti predominance but her worship was revived after the early people along the coast and in the agricultural valleys were freed from the yoke of the father god worshippers It must be recognized in this connection that an official religion was not always a full reflection of popular beliefs In all the great civilizations of antiquity it was invariably a compromise between the beliefs of the military aristocracy and the masses of mingled peoples over whom they held sway Temple worship had therefore a political aspect it was intended among other things to strengthen the position of the ruling classes But ancient deities could still be worshipped and were worshipped in homes and fields in groves and on mountain tops as the case might be Jeremiah has testified to the persistence of the folk practices in connection with the worship of the mother goddess among the inhabitants of Palestine Sacrificial fires were lit and cakes were baked and offered to the Queen of Heaven in the streets of Jerusalem and other cities In Babylonia and Egypt domestic religious practices were never completely supplanted by temple ceremonies in which rulers took a prominent part It was always possible therefore for usurpers to make popular appeal by reviving ancient and persistent forms of worship As we have seen Jehu of Israel after stamping out Phoenician Baal worship secured a strong following by giving official recognition to the cult of the golden calf It is not possible to set forth in detail or with intimate knowledge the various innovations which Sammu rammat introduced or with which she was credited during the reigns of Adad nirari IV eight hundred ten seven hundred eighty two B C and his father No discovery has been made of documents like the Tell el Amarna letters which would shed light on the social and political life of this interesting period But evidence is not awanting that Assyria was being suffused with Babylonian culture Royal inscriptions record the triumphs of the army but suppress the details of barbarities such as those which sully the annals of Ashur natsir pal who had boys and girls burned on pyres and the heroes of small nations flayed alive An ethical tendency becomes apparent in the exaltation of the Babylonian Shamash as an abstract deity who loved law and order inspired the king with wisdom and ordained the destinies of mankind He is invoked on equal terms with Ashur The prominence given to Nebo the god of Borsippa during the reign of Adad nirari IV is highly significant He appears in his later character as a god of culture and wisdom the patron of scribes and artists and the wise counsellor of the deities He symbolized the intellectual life of the southern kingdom which was more closely associated with religious ethics than that of war loving Assyria A great temple was erected to Nebo at Kalkhi and four statues of him were placed within it two of which are now in the British Museum On one of these was cut the inscription from which we have quoted lauding the exalted and wise deity and invoking him to protect Adad nirari and the lady of the palace Sammu rammat and closing with the exhortation Whoso cometh in after time let him trust in Nebo and trust in no other god The priests of Ashur in the city of Asshur must have been as deeply stirred by this religious revolt at Kalkhi as were the priests of Amon when Akhenaton turned his back on Thebes and the national god to worship Aton in his new capital at Tell el Amarna It would appear that this sudden stream of Babylonian culture had begun to flow into Assyria as early as the reign of Shalmaneser III and it may be that it was on account of that monarch s pro Babylonian tendencies that his nobles and priests revolted against him Shalmaneser established at Kalkhi a royal library which was stocked with the literature of the southern kingdom During the reign of Adad nirari IV this collection was greatly increased and subsequent additions were made to it by his successors and especially Ashur nirari IV the last monarch of the Middle Empire The inscriptions of Shamshi Adad son of Shalmaneser III have literary qualities which distinguish them from those of his predecessors and may be accounted for by the influence exercised by Babylonian scholars who migrated northward To the reign of Adad nirari belongs also that important compilation the Synchronistic History of Assyria and Babylonia which deals with the relations of the two kingdoms and refers to contemporary events and rulers The legends of Semiramis indicate that Sammu rammat was associated like Queen Tiy with the revival of mother worship As we have said she went down to tradition as the daughter of the fish goddess Derceto Pliny identified that deity with Atargatis of Hierapolis four hundred sixty six In Babylonia the fish goddess was Nina a developed form of Damkina spouse of Ea of Eridu In the inscription on the Nebo statue that god is referred to as the son of Nudimmud Ea Nina was the goddess who gave her name to Nineveh and it is possible that Nebo may have been regarded as her son during the Semiramis period The story of Semiramis s birth is evidently of great antiquity It seems to survive throughout Europe in the nursery tale of the Babes in the Wood A striking Indian parallel is afforded by the legend of Shakuntala which may be first referred to for the purpose of comparative study Shakuntala was the daughter of the rishi Viswamitra and Menaka the Apsara celestial fairy Menaka gave birth to her child beside the sacred river Malini And she cast the new born infant on the bank of that river and went away And beholding the newborn infant lying in that forest destitute of human beings but abounding with lions and tigers a number of vultures sat around to protect it from harm A sage discovered the child and adopted her Because he said she was surrounded by Shakuntas birds therefore hath she been named by me Shakuntala bird protected four hundred sixty seven Semiramis was similarly deserted at birth by her Celestial mother She was protected by doves and her Assyrian name Sammu rammat is believed to be derived from Summat dove and to signify the dove goddess loveth her Simmas the chief of royal shepherds found the child and adopted her She was of great beauty like Shakuntala the maiden of perfect symmetry sweet smiles and faultless features with whom King Dushyanta fell in love and married in Gandharva fashion four hundred sixty eight Semiramis became the wife of Onnes governor of Nineveh and one of the generals of its alleged founder King Ninus She accompanied her husband to Bactria on a military campaign and is said to have instructed the king how that city should be taken Ninus fell in love with Semiramis and Onnes who refused to give her up went and hanged himself The fair courtesan then became the wife of the king The story proceeds that Semiramis exercised so great an influence over the impressionable King Ninus that she persuaded him to proclaim her Queen of Assyria for five days She then ascended the throne decked in royal robes On the first day she gave a great banquet and on the second thrust Ninus into prison or had him put to death In this manner she secured the empire for herself She reigned for over forty years Professor Frazer inclines to the view that the legend is a reminiscence of the custom of appointing a mock king and queen to whom the kingdom was yielded up for five days Semiramis played the part of the mother goddess and the priestly king died a violent death in the character of her divine lover The mounds of Semiramis which were pointed out all over Western Asia were said to have been the graves of her lovers whom she buried alive This tradition is one of the surest indications of the identity of the mythical Semiramis with the Babylonian goddess Ishtar or Astarte four hundred sixty nine As we have seen Ishtar and other mother goddesses had many lovers whom they deserted like La Belle Dame sans Merci pp one hundred seventy four one hundred seventy five As Queen of Assyria Semiramis was said to have cut roads through mountainous districts and erected many buildings According to one version of the legend she founded the city of Babylon Herodotus however says in this connection Semiramis held the throne for five generations before the later princess Nitocris She raised certain embankments well worthy of inspection in the plain near Babylon to control the river Euphrates which till then used to overflow and flood the whole country round about four hundred seventy Lucian who associates the famous queen with mighty works in Asia states that she was reputed by some to be the builder of the ancient temple of Aphrodite in the Libanus although others credited it to Cinyras or Deukalion four hundred seventy one Several Median places bear her name and according to ancient Armenian tradition she was the founder of Van which was formerly called Shamiramagerd Strabo tells that unidentified mountains in Western Asia were named after Semiramis four hundred seventy two Indeed many of the great works in the Tigro Euphrates valley not excepting the famous inscription of Darius were credited to the legendary queen of Babylonia and Assyria four hundred seventy three She was the rival in tradition of the famous Sesostris of Egypt as a ruler builder and conqueror All the military expeditions of Semiramis were attended with success except her invasion of India She was supposed to have been defeated in the Punjab After suffering this disaster she died or abdicated the throne in favour of her son Ninyas The most archaic form of the legend appears to be that she was turned into a dove and took flight to heaven in that form After her death she was worshipped as a dove goddess like Our Lady of Trees and Doves in Cyprus whose shrine at old Paphos was founded Herodotus says by Phoenician colonists from Askalon four hundred seventy four Fish and doves were sacred to Derceto Attar four hundred seventy five who had a mermaid form I have beheld says Lucian the image of Derceto in Phoenicia A marvellous spectacle it is One half is a woman but the part which extends from thighs to feet terminates with the tail of a fish four hundred seventy six Derceto was supposed to have been a woman who threw herself in despair into a lake After death she was adored as a goddess and her worshippers abstained from eating fish except sacrificially A golden image of a fish was suspended in her temple Atargatis who was identical with Derceto was reputed in another form of the legend to have been born of an egg which the sacred fishes found in the Euphrates and thrust ashore p twenty eight The Greek Aphrodite was born of the froth of the sea and floated in a sea shell According to Hesiod The wafting waves First bore her to Cythera the divine To wave encircled Cyprus came she then And forth emerged a goddess in the charms Of awful beauty Where her delicate feet Had pressed the sands green herbage flowering sprang Her Aphrodite gods and mortals name The foam born goddess and her name is known As Cytherea with the blooming wreath For that she touched Cythera s flowery coast And Cypris for that on the Cyprian shore She rose amid the multitude of waves Elton s translation The animals sacred to Aphrodite included the sparrow the dove the swan the swallow and the wryneck four hundred seventy seven She presided over the month of April and the myrtle rose poppy and apple were sacred to her Some writers connect Semiramis in her character as a dove goddess with Media and the old Persian mother goddess Anaitis and regard as arbitrary her identification with the fish goddess Derceto or Atargatis The dove was certainly not a popular bird in the religious art of Babylonia and Assyria but in one of the hymns translated by Professor Pinches Ishtar says Like a lonely dove I rest In another the worshipper tries to touch Ishtar s heart by crying Like the dove I moan A Sumerian psalmist makes a goddess Gula who presided over Larak a part of Isin lament over the city after it was captured by the enemy My temple E aste temple of Larak Larak the city which Bel Enlil gave Beneath are turned to strangeness above are turned to strangeness With wailings on the lyre my dwelling place is surrendered to the stranger The dove cots they wickedly seized the doves they entrapped The ravens he Enlil caused to fly four hundred seventy eight Apparently there were temple and household doves in Babylonia The Egyptians had their household dovecots in ancient as in modern times Lane makes reference to the large pigeon houses in many villages They are of archaic pattern with the walls slightly inclining inwards like many of the ancient Egyptian buildings and are constructed upon the roofs of the huts with crude brick pottery and mud Each pair of pigeons occupies a separate earthen pot four hundred seventy nine It may be that the dove bulked more prominently in domestic than in official religion and had a special seasonal significance Ishtar appears to have had a dove form In the Gilgamesh epic she is said to have loved the brilliant Allalu bird the bright coloured wood pigeon according to Sayce and to have afterwards wounded it by breaking its wings four hundred eighty She also loved the lion and the horse and must therefore have assumed the forms of these animals The goddess Bau she whose city is destroyed laments in a Sumerian psalm Like a dove to its dwelling place how long to my dwelling place will they pursue me To my sanctuary the sacred place they pursue me My resting place the brick walls of my city Isin thou art destroyed My sanctuary shrine of my temple Galmah thou art destroyed Langdon s translation Here the goddess appears to be identified with the doves which rest on the walls and make their nests in the shrine The Sumerian poets did not adorn their poems with meaningless picturesque imagery their images were stern facts they had a magical or religious significance like the imagery of magical incantations the worshipper invoked the deity by naming his or her various attributes forms c Of special interest are the references in Sumerian psalms to the ravens as well as the doves of goddesses Throughout Asia and Europe ravens are birds of ill omen In Scotland there still linger curious folk beliefs regarding the appearance of ravens and doves after death Michael Scott the great magician when on his deathbed told his friends to place his body on a hillock Three ravens and three doves would be seen flying towards it If the ravens were first the body was to be burned but if the doves were first it was to receive Christian burial The ravens were foremost but in their hurry flew beyond their mark So the devil who had long been preparing a bed for Michael was disappointed four hundred eighty one In Indian mythology Purusha the chaos giant first divided himself Hence were husband and wife produced This couple then assumed various animal forms and thus created every living pair whatsoever down to the ants four hundred eighty two Goddesses and fairies in the folk tales of many countries sometimes assume bird forms The Fates appear to Damayanti in the Nala story as swans which carry love messages four hundred eighty three According to Aryo Indian belief birds were blessed with fecundity The Babylonian Etana eagle and the Egyptian vulture as has been indicated were deities of fertility Throughout Europe birds which were Fates mated according to popular belief on saint Valentine s Day in February when lots were drawn for wives by rural folks Another form of the old custom is referred to by the poet Gay Last Valentine the day when birds of kind Their paramours with mutual chirpings find I early rose Thee first I spied and the first swain we see In spite of fortune shall our true love be The dove appears to have been a sacred bird in various areas occupied by tribes of the Mediterranean race Models of a shrine found in two royal graves at Mycenae are surmounted by a pair of doves suggesting twin goddesses like Isis and Nepthys of Egypt and Ishtar and Belitsheri of Babylonia Doves and snakes were associated with the mother goddess of Crete typifying according to one view her connection with air and earth Although her character was distinctly beneficent and pacific yet as Lady of the Wild Creatures she had a more fearful aspect one that was often depicted on carved gems where lions are her companions four hundred eighty four Discussing the attributes and symbols of this mother goddess Professor Burrows says As the serpent coming from the crevices of the earth shows the possession of the tree or pillar from the underworld so the dove with which this goddess is also associated shows its possession from the world of the sky four hundred eighty five Professor Robertson Smith has demonstrated that the dove was of great sanctity among the Semites four hundred eighty six It figures in Hittite sculptures and was probably connected with the goddess cult in Asia Minor Although Egypt had no dove goddess the bird was addressed by lovers I hear thy voice O turtle dove The dawn is all aglow Weary am I with love with love Oh whither shall I go four hundred eighty seven Pigeons as indicated are in Egypt still regarded as sacred birds and a few years ago British soldiers created a riot by shooting them Doves were connected with the ancient Greek oracle at Dodona In many countries the dove is closely associated with love and also symbolizes innocence gentleness and holiness The pigeon was anciently it would appear a sacred bird in these islands and Brand has recorded curious folk beliefs connected with it In some districts the idea prevailed that no person could die on a bed which contained pigeon feathers If anybody be sick and lye a dying if they lye upon pigeon feathers they will be languishing and never die but be in pain and torment wrote a correspondent A similar superstition about the feathers of different varieties of wild fowl four hundred eighty eight obtained in other districts Brand traced this interesting traditional belief in Yorkshire Lancashire Derbyshire and some of the Welsh and Irish counties four hundred eighty nine It still lingers in parts of the Scottish Highlands In the old ballad of The Bloody Gardener the white dove appears to a young man as the soul of his lady love who was murdered by his mother He first saw the bird perched on his breast and then sitting on a myrtle tree four hundred ninety The dove was not only a symbol of Semiramis but also of her mother Derceto the Phoenician fish goddess The connection between bird and fish may have been given an astral significance In Poor Robin s Almanack for seventeen fifty seven a saint Valentine rhyme begins This month bright Phoebus enters Pisces The maids will have good store of kisses For always when the sun comes there Valentine s day is drawing near And both the men and maids incline To choose them each a Valentine As we have seen the example was set by the mating birds The Almanack poet no doubt versified an old astrological belief when the spring sun entered the sign of the Fishes the love goddess in bird form returned to earth Advocates of the Totemic theory on the other hand may hold that the association of doves with snake goddesses and fish goddesses of fertility was due to the fusion of tribes who had various animal totems The Pelew Islanders believed says Professor Frazer that the souls of their forefathers lived in certain species of animals which accordingly they held sacred and would not injure For this reason one man would not kill snakes another would not harm pigeons and so on but everyone was quite ready to kill and eat the sacred animals of his neighbours four hundred ninety one That the Egyptians had similar customs is suggested by what Herodotus tells us regarding their sacred animals Those who live near Thebes and the lake Moeris hold the crocodile in religious veneration Those who live in or near Elephantine so far from considering these beasts as sacred make them an article of food The hippopotamus is esteemed sacred in the district of Papremis but in no other part of Egypt They roast and boil birds and fishes excepting those which are preserved for sacred purposes four hundred ninety two Totemic animals controlled the destinies of tribes and families Grose tells us says Brand that besides general notices of death many families have particular warnings or notices some by the appearance of a bird and others by the figure of a tall woman dressed all in white Pennant says that many of the great families in Scotland had their demon or genius who gave them monitions of future events four hundred ninety three Members of tribes which venerated the pigeon therefore invoked it like the Egyptian love poet and drew omens from its notes or saw one appearing as the soul of the dead like the lover in the ballad of The Bloody Gardener They refrained also from killing the pigeon except sacrificially and suffered agonies on a deathbed which contained pigeon feathers the taboo having been broken Some such explanation is necessary to account for the specialization of certain goddesses as fish snake cat or bird deities Aphrodite who like Ishtar absorbed the attributes of several goddesses of fertility and fate had attached to her the various animal symbols which were prominent in districts or among tribes brought into close contact while the poppy rose myrtle c which were used as love charms or for making love potions were also consecrated to her Anthropomorphic deities were decorated with the symbols and flowers of folk religion From the comparative evidence accumulated here it will be seen that the theory of the mythical Semiramis s Median or Persian origin is somewhat narrow It is possible that the dove was venerated in Cyprus as it certainly was in Crete long centuries before Assyrian and Babylonian influence filtered westward through Phoenician and Hittite channels In another connection Sir Arthur Evans shows that the resemblance between Cretan and early Semitic beliefs points rather to some remote common element the nature of which is at present obscure than to any definite borrowing by one side or another four hundred ninety four From the evidence afforded by the Semiramis legends and the inscriptions of the latter half of the Assyrian Middle Empire period it may be inferred that a renascence of mother worship was favoured by the social and political changes which were taking place In the first place the influence of Babylon must have been strongly felt in this connection The fact that Adadnirari found it necessary to win the support of the Babylonians by proclaiming his descent from one of their ancient royal families suggests that he was not only concerned about the attitude assumed by the scholars of the southern kingdom but also that of the masses of old Sumerian and Akkadian stocks who continued to bake cakes to the Queen of Heaven so as to ensure good harvests In the second place it is not improbable that even in Assyria the introduction of Nebo and his spouse made widespread appeal That country had become largely peopled by an alien population many of these aliens came from districts where mother worship prevailed and had no traditional respect for Ashur while they regarded with hostility the military aristocracy who conquered and ruled in the name of that dreaded deity Perhaps too the influence of the Aramaeans who in Babylonia wrecked the temples of the sun god tended to revive the ancient religion of the Mediterranean race Jehu s religious revolt in Israel which established once again the cult of Ashtoreth occurred after he came under the sway of Damascus and may have not been unconnected with the political ascendancy elsewhere of the goddess cult Nebo whom Adad nirari exalted at Kalkhi was more than a local god of Borsippa The most satisfactory view says Jastrow is to regard him as a counterpart of Ea Like Ea he is the embodiment and source of wisdom The study of the heavens formed part of the wisdom which is traced back to Nebo and the temple school at Borsippa became one of the chief centres for the astrological and subsequently for the astronomical lore of Babylonia Like Nebo Ea is also associated with the irrigation of the fields and with their consequent fertility A hymn praises him as the one who fills the canals and the dikes who protects the fields and brings the crops to maturity Nebo links with Merodach Marduk who is sometimes referred to as his father Jastrow assumes that the close partnership between Nebo and Merodach had as a consequence a transfer of some of the father Marduk s attributes as a solar deity to Nebo four hundred ninety five his son just as Ea passed his traits on to his son Marduk four hundred ninety six As the recorder or scribe among the gods Nebo resembles the Egyptian god Thoth who links with Khonsu the lunar and spring sun god of love and fertility and with Osiris In Borsippa he had like Merodach in Babylon pronounced Tammuz traits Nebo in fact appears to be the Tammuz of the new age the son of the ancient goddess who became Husband of his Mother If Nebo had no connection with Great Mother worship it is unlikely that his statue would have borne an inscription referring to King Adad nirari and Queen Sammu rammat on equal terms The Assyrian spouse of Nebo was called Tashmit This goddess of supplication and love had a lunar significance A prayer addressed to her in association with Nannar Sin and Ishtar proceeds In the evil of the eclipse of the moon which has taken place In the evil of the powers of the portents evil and not good which are in my palace and my land I have turned towards thee Before Nabu Nebo thy spouse thy lord the prince the first born of E sagila intercede for me May he hearken to my cry at the word of thy mouth may he remove my sighing may he learn my supplication Damkina is similarly addressed in another prayer O Damkina mighty queen of all the gods O wife of Ea valiant art thou O Ir nina mighty queen of all the gods Thou that dwellest in the Abyss O lady of heaven and earth In the evil of the eclipse of the moon et cetera Bau is also prayed in a similar connection as mighty lady that dwellest in the bright heavens i e Queen of heaven four hundred ninety seven Tashmit whose name signifies Obedience according to Jastrow or Hearing according to Sayce carried the prayers of worshippers to Nebo her spouse As Isis interceded with Osiris she interceded with Nebo on behalf of mankind But this did not signify that she was the least influential of the divine pair A goddess played many parts she was at once mother daughter and wife of the god the servant of one god or the mighty queen of all the gods The Great Mother was as has been indicated regarded as the eternal and undecaying one the gods passed away son succeeding father she alone remained Thus too did Semiramis survive in the popular memory as the queen goddess of widespread legends after kings and gods had been forgotten To her was ascribed all the mighty works of other days in the lands where the indigenous peoples first worshipped the Great Mother as Damkina Nina Bau Ishtar or Tashmit because the goddess was anciently believed to be the First Cause the creatrix the mighty one who invested the ruling god with the powers he possessed the god who held sway because he was her husband as did Nergal as the husband of Eresh ki gal queen of Hades The multiplication of well defined goddesses was partly due to the tendency to symbolize the attributes of the Great Mother and partly due to the development of the great Lady in a particular district where she reflected local phenomena and where the political influence achieved by her worshippers emphasized her greatness Legends regarding a famous goddess were in time attached to other goddesses and in Aphrodite and Derceto we appear to have mother deities who absorbed the traditions of more than one local lady of river and plain forest and mountain Semiramis on the other hand survived as a link between the old world and the new between the country from which emanated the stream of ancient culture and the regions which received it As the high priestess of the cult she became identified with the goddess whose bird name she bore as Gilgamesh and Etana became identified with the primitive culture hero or patriarch of the ancient Sumerians and Sargon became identified with Tammuz No doubt the fame of Semiramis was specially emphasized because of her close association as Queen Sammu rammat with the religious innovations which disturbed the land of the god Ashur during the Middle Empire period Adad nirari IV the son or husband of Sammu rammat was a vigorous and successful campaigner He was the Assyrian king who became the saviour of Israel Although it is not possible to give a detailed account of his various expeditions we find from the list of these which survives in the Eponym Chronicle that he included in the Assyrian Empire a larger extent of territory than any of his predecessors In the north east he overcame the Median and other tribes and acquired a large portion of the Iranian plateau he compelled Edom to pay tribute and established his hold in Babylonia by restricting the power of the Chaldaeans in Sealand In the north he swayed at least so he claimed the wide domains of the Nairi people He also confirmed his supremacy over the Hittites The Aramaean state of Damascus which had withstood the attack of the great Shalmaneser and afterwards oppressed as we have seen the kingdoms of Israel and Judah was completely overpowered by Adad nirari The old king Hazael died when Assyria s power was being strengthened and increased along his frontiers He was succeeded by his son Mari who is believed to be identical with the Biblical Ben Hadad III four hundred ninety eight Shortly after this new monarch came to the throne Adad nirari IV led a great army against him The Syrian ruler appears to have been taken by surprise probably his kingdom was suffering from the three defeats which had been previously administered by the revolting Israelites four hundred ninety nine At any rate Mari was unable to gather together an army of allies to resist the Assyrian advance and took refuge behind the walls of Damascus This strongly fortified city was closely invested and Mari had at length to submit and acknowledge Adad nirari as his overlord The price of peace included twenty three thousand talents of silver twenty of gold three thousand of copper and five thousand of iron as well as ivory ornaments and furniture embroidered materials and other goods to a countless amount Thus the Lord gave Israel a saviour so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime This significant reference to the conquest of Damascus by the Assyrian king is followed by another which throws light on the religious phenomena of the period Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam who made Israel sin but walked therein and there remained the grove also in Samaria five hundred Ashtoreth and her golden calf continued to be venerated and doves were sacrificed to the local Adonis It is not certain whether Adad nirari penetrated farther than Damascus Possibly all the states which owed allegiance to the king of that city became at once the willing vassals of Assyria their protector The tribute received by Adad nirari from Tyre Sidon the land of Omri Israel Edom and Palastu Philistia may have been gifted as a formal acknowledgment of his suzerainty and with purpose to bring them directly under Assyrian control so that Damascus might be prevented from taking vengeance against them Meagre details survive regarding the reign of the next king Shalmaneser IV seven hundred eighty one seven hundred seventy two B C These are however supplemented by the Urartian inscriptions Although Adad nirari boasted that he had subdued the kingdom of Urartu in the north he appears to have done no more than limit its southern expansion for a time The Urarti were like the Mitanni a military aristocracy five hundred one who welded together by conquest the tribes of the eastern and northern Highlands which several Assyrian monarchs included in their Empire They acquired the elements of Assyrian culture and used the Assyrian script for their own language Their god was named Khaldis and they called their nation Khaldia During the reign of Ashur natsir pal their area of control was confined to the banks of the river Araxes but it was gradually extended under a succession of vigorous kings towards the south west until they became supreme round the shores of Lake Van Three of their early kings were Lutipris Sharduris I and Arame During the reign of Shamshi Adad the Assyrians came into conflict with the Urarti who were governed at the time by Ushpina of Nairi Ishpuinis son of Sharduris II The Urartian kingdom had extended rapidly and bordered on Assyrian territory To the west were the tribes known as the Mannai the northern enemies of the Medes a people of Indo European speech When Adad nirari IV waged war against the Urarti their king was Menuas the son of Ishpuinis Menuas was a great war lord and was able to measure his strength against Assyria on equal terms He had nearly doubled by conquest the area controlled by his predecessors Adad nirari endeavoured to drive his rival northward but all along the Assyrian frontier from the Euphrates to the Lower Zab Menuas forced the outposts of Adad nirari to retreat southward The Assyrians in short were unable to hold their own Having extended his kingdom towards the south Menuas invaded Hittite territory subdued Malatia and compelled its king to pay tribute He also conquered the Mannai and other tribes Towards the north and north west he added a considerable area to his kingdom which became as large as Assyria Menuas s capital was the city of Turushpa or Dhuspas Van which was called Khaldinas five hundred two after the national god For a century it was the seat of Urartian administration The buildings erected there by Menuas and his successors became associated in after time with the traditions of Semiramis who as Queen Sammu rammat of Assyria was a contemporary of the great Urartian conqueror Similarly a sculptured representation of the Hittite god was referred to by Herodotus as a memorial of the Egyptian king Sesostris The strongest fortification at Dhuspas was the citadel which was erected on a rocky promontory jutting into Lake Van A small garrison could there resist a prolonged siege The water supply of the city was assured by the construction of subterranean aqueducts Menuas erected a magnificent palace which rivalled that of the Assyrian monarch at Kalkhi and furnished it with the rich booty brought back from victorious campaigns He was a lover of trees and planted many and he laid out gardens which bloomed with brilliant Asian flowers The palace commanded a noble prospect of hill and valley scenery on the south western shore of beautiful Lake Van Menuas was succeeded by his son Argistis who ascended the throne during the lifetime of Adad nirari of Assyria During the early part of his reign he conducted military expeditions to the north beyond the river Araxes He afterwards came into conflict with Assyria and acquired more territory on its northern frontier He also subdued the Mannai who had risen in revolt For three years seven hundred eighty one seven hundred seventy eight B C the general of Shalmaneser IV waged war constantly with Urartu and again in seven hundred seventy six B C and seven hundred seventy four B C attempts were made to prevent the southern expansion of that Power On more than one occasion the Assyrians were defeated and compelled to retreat Assyria suffered serious loss of prestige on account of its inability to hold in check its northern rival Damascus rose in revolt and had to be subdued and northern Syria was greatly disturbed Hadrach was visited in the last year of the king s reign Ashur dan III seven hundred seventy one seven hundred sixty three B C occupied the Assyrian throne during a period of great unrest He was unable to attack Urartu His army had to operate instead on his eastern and southern frontiers A great plague broke out in seven hundred sixty five B C the year in which Hadrach had again to be dealt with On June fifteen seven hundred sixty three B C there was a total eclipse of the sun and that dread event was followed by a revolt at Asshur which was no doubt of priestly origin The king s son Adad nirari was involved in it but it is not certain whether or not he displaced his father for a time In seven hundred fifty eight B C Ashur dan again showed signs of activity by endeavouring to suppress the revolts which during the period of civil war had broken out in Syria Adad nirari V came to the throne in seven hundred sixty three B C He had to deal with revolts in Asshur in other cities Indeed for the greater part of his reign he seems to have been kept fully engaged endeavouring to establish his authority within the Assyrian borders The Syrian provinces regained their independence During the first four years of his successor Ashurnirari IV seven hundred fifty three seven hundred forty six B C the army never left Assyria Namri was visited in seven hundred forty nine seven hundred forty eight B C but it is not certain whether he fought against the Urartians or the Aramaeans who had become active during this period of Assyrian decline In seven hundred forty six B C a revolt broke out in the city of Kalkhi and the king had to leave it Soon afterwards he died perhaps he was assassinated and none of his sons came to the throne A year previously Nabu natsir known to the Greeks as Nabonassar was crowned king of Babylonia Ashur nirari IV appears to have been a monarch of somewhat like character to the famous Akhenaton of Egypt an idealist for whom war had no attractions He kept his army at home while his foreign possessions rose in revolt one after another Apparently he had dreams of guarding Assyria against attack by means of treaties of peace He arranged one with a Mesopotamian king Mati ilu of Agusi who pledged himself not to go to war without the consent of his Assyrian overlord and it is possible that there were other documents of like character which have not survived to us During his leisure hours the king engaged himself in studious pursuits and made additions to the royal library In the end his disappointed soldiers found a worthy leader in one of its generals who seized the throne and assumed the royal name of Tiglath pileser Ashur nirari IV was the last king of the Middle Empire of Assyria He may have been a man of high character and refinement and worthy of our esteem although an unsuitable ruler for a predatory State CHAPTER XIX ASSYRIA S AGE OF SPLENDOUR Tiglath pileser IV the

Lower Egypt Revolt of Assyrian Nobles Ashurbanipal We now enter upon the last and most brilliant phase of Assyrian civilization the period of the Third or New Empire during which flourished Tiglath pileser IV the mighty conqueror the Shalmaneser of the Bible Sargon the Later who transported the lost ten tribes of Israel Sennacherib the destroyer of Babylon and Esarhaddon who made Lower Egypt an Assyrian province We also meet with notable figures of Biblical fame including Ahaz Hezekiah Isaiah and the idolatrous Manasseh Tiglath pileser IV who deposed Ashur nirari IV was known to the Babylonians as Pulu which some think was a term of contempt signifying wild animal In the Bible he is referred to as Pul Tiglath pilneser and Tiglath pileser five hundred three He came to the Assyrian throne towards the end of April in seven hundred forty five B C and reigned until seven hundred twenty seven B C We know nothing regarding his origin but it seems clear that he was not of royal descent He appears to have been a popular leader of the revolt against Ashur nirari who like certain of his predecessors had pronounced pro Babylonian tendencies It is significant to note in this connection that the new king was an unswerving adherent of the cult of Ashur by the adherents of which he was probably strongly supported Tiglath pileser combined in equal measure those qualities of generalship and statesmanship which were necessary for the reorganization of the Assyrian state and the revival of its military prestige At the beginning of his reign there was much social discontent and suffering The national exchequer had been exhausted by the loss of tribute from revolting provinces trade was paralysed and the industries were in a languishing condition Plundering bands of Aramaeans were menacing the western frontiers and had overrun part of northern Babylonia New political confederacies in Syria kept the north west regions in a constant state of unrest and the now powerful Urartian kingdom was threatening the Syro Cappadocian states as if its rulers had dreams of building up a great world empire on the ruins of that of Assyria Tiglath pileser first paid attention to Babylonia and extinguished the resistance of the Aramaeans in Akkad He appears to have been welcomed by Nabonassar who became his vassal and he offered sacrifices in the cities of Babylon Sippar Cuthah and Nippur Sippar had been occupied by Aramaeans as on a previous occasion when they destroyed the temple of the sun god Shamash which was restored by Nabu aplu iddina of Babylon Tiglath pileser did not overrun Chaldaea but he destroyed its capital Sarrabanu and impaled King Nabu ushabshi He proclaimed himself King of Sumer and Akkad and King of the Four Quarters The frontier states of Elam and Media were visited and subdued Having disposed of the Aramaeans and other raiders the Assyrian monarch had next to deal with his most powerful rival Urartu Argistis I had been succeeded by Sharduris III who had formed an alliance with the north Mesopotamian king Mati ilu of Agusi on whom Ashur nirari had reposed his faith Ere long Sharduris pressed southward from Malatia and compelled the north Syrian Hittite states including Carchemish to acknowledge his suzerainty A struggle then ensued between Urartu and Assyria for the possession of the Syro Cappadocian states At this time the reputation of Tiglath pileser hung in the balance If he failed in his attack on Urartu his prestige would vanish at home and abroad and Sharduris might after establishing himself in northern Syria invade Assyria and compel its allegiance Two courses lay before Tiglath pileser He could either cross the mountains and invade Urartu or strike at his rival in north Syria where the influence of Assyria had been completely extinguished The latter appeared to him to be the most feasible and judicious procedure for if he succeeded in expelling the invaders he would at the same time compel the allegiance of the rebellious Hittite states In the spring of seven hundred forty three B C Tiglath pileser led his army across the Euphrates and reached Arpad without meeting with any resistance The city appears to have opened its gates to him although it was in the kingdom of Mati ilu who acknowledged Urartian sway Its foreign garrison was slaughtered Well might Sharduris exclaim in the words of the prophet Where is the king of Arpad where are the gods of Arpad five hundred four Leaving Arpad Tiglath pileser advanced to meet Sharduris who was apparently hastening southward to attack the Assyrians in the rear Tiglath pileser however crossed the Euphrates and moving northward delivered an unexpected attack on the Urartian army in Qummukh A fierce battle ensued and one of its dramatic incidents was a single combat between the rival kings The tide of battle flowed in Assyria s favour and when evening was falling the chariots and cavalry of Urartu were thrown into confusion An attempt was made to capture King Sharduris who leapt from his chariot and made hasty escape on horseback hotly pursued in the gathering darkness by an Assyrian contingent of cavalry Not until the bridge of the Euphrates was reached was the exciting night chase abandoned Tiglath pileser had achieved an overwhelming victory against an army superior to his own in numbers Over seventy thousand of the enemy were slain or taken captive while the Urartian camp with its stores and horses and followers fell into the hands of the triumphant Assyrians Tiglath pileser burned the royal tent and throne as an offering to Ashur and carried Sharduris s bed to the temple of the goddess of Nineveh whither he returned to prepare a new plan of campaign against his northern rival Despite the blow dealt against Urartu Assyria did not immediately regain possession of north Syria The shifty Mati ilu either cherished the hope that Sharduris would recover strength and again invade north Syria or that he might himself establish an empire in that region Tiglath pileser had therefore to march westward again For three years he conducted vigorous campaigns in the western land where he met with vigorous resistance In seven hundred forty B C Arpad was captured and Mati ilu deposed and probably put to death Two years later Kullani and Hamath fell and the districts which they controlled were included in the Assyrian empire and governed by Crown officials Once again the Hebrews came into contact with Assyria The Dynasty of Jehu had come to an end by this time Its fall may not have been unconnected with the trend of events in Assyria during the closing years of the Middle Empire Supported by Assyria the kings of Israel had become powerful and haughty Jehoash the grandson of Jehu had achieved successes in conflict with Damascus In Judah the unstable Amaziah son of Joash was strong enough to lay a heavy hand on Edom and flushed with triumph then resolved to readjust his relations with his overlord the king of Israel Accordingly he sent a communication to Jehoash which contained some proposal regarding their political relations concluding with the offer or challenge Come let us look one another in the face A contemptuous answer was returned Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah saying The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon saying Give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon and trode down the thistle Thou hast indeed smitten Edom and thine heart hath lifted thee up glory of this and tarry at home for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and Judah with thee But Amaziah would not hear Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth shemesh city of Shamash the sun god which belongeth to Judah And Judah was put to the worse before Israel and they fled every man to their tents Jehoash afterwards destroyed a large portion of the wall of Jerusalem and plundered the temple and palace returning home to Samaria with rich booty and hostages five hundred five Judah thus remained a vassal state of Israel s Jeroboam son of Jehoash had a long and prosperous reign About seven hundred seventy three B C he appears to have company operated with Assyria and conquered Damascus and Hamath His son Zachariah the last king of the Jehu Dynasty of Israel came to the throne in seven hundred forty B C towards the close of the reign of Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah Six months afterwards he was assassinated by Shallum This usurper held sway at Samaria for only a month For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah and came to Samaria and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria and slew him and reigned in his stead five hundred six Tiglath pileser was operating successfully in middle Syria when he had dealings with among others Menihimme Menahem of the city of the Samarians who paid tribute No resistance was possible on the part of Menahem the usurper who was probably ready to welcome the Assyrian conqueror so that by arranging an alliance he might secure his own position The Biblical reference is as follows And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand And Menahem exacted the money of Israel even of all the mighty men of wealth of each man fifty shekels of silver to give to the king of Assyria So the king of Assyria turned back and stayed not there in the land five hundred seven Rezin of Damascus Hiram of Tyre and Zabibi queen of the Arabians also sent gifts to Tiglath pileser at this time seven hundred thirty eight B C Aramaean revolts on the borders of Elam were suppressed by Assyrian governors and large numbers of the inhabitants were transported to various places in Syria Tiglath pileser next operated against the Median and other hill tribes in the north east In seven hundred thirty five B C he invaded Urartu the great Armenian state which had threatened the supremacy of Assyria in north Syria and Cappadocia King Sharduris was unable to protect his frontier or hamper the progress of the advancing army which penetrated to his capital Dhuspas was soon captured but Sharduris took refuge in his rocky citadel which he and his predecessors had laboured to render impregnable There he was able to defy the might of Assyria for the fortress could be approached on the western side alone by a narrow path between high walls and towers so that only a small force could find room to operate against the numerous garrison Tiglath pileser had to content himself by devastating the city on the plain and the neighbouring villages He overthrew buildings destroyed orchards and transported to Nineveh those of the inhabitants he had not put to the sword with all the live stock he could lay hands on Thus was Urartu crippled and humiliated it never regained its former prestige among the northern states In the following year Tiglath pileser returned to Syria The circumstances which made this expedition necessary are of special interest on account of its Biblical associations Menahem king of Israel had died and was succeeded by his son Pekahiah But Pekah the son of Remaliah a captain of his conspired against him and smote him in Samaria in the palace of the king s house and he killed him and reigned in his room five hundred eight When Pekah was on the throne Ahaz began to reign over Judah Judah had taken advantage of the disturbed conditions in Israel to assert its independence The walls of Jerusalem were repaired by Jotham father of Ahaz and a tunnel constructed to supply it with water Isaiah refers to this tunnel Go forth and meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller s field Isaiah vii three Pekah had to deal with a powerful party in Israel which favoured the re establishment of David s kingdom in Palestine Their most prominent leader was the prophet Amos whose eloquent exhortations were couched in no uncertain terms He condemned Israel for its idolatries and cried For thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel Seek ye me and ye shall live Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years O house of Israel But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images the star of your god which ye made to yourselves five hundred nine Pekah sought to extinguish the orthodox party s movement by subduing Judah So he plotted with Rezin king of Damascus Amos prophesied Thus saith the Lord I will send a fire into the house of Hazael which will devour the palaces of Ben hadad I will break also the bar of Damascus and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir The remnant of the Philistines shall perish Tyre Edom and Ammon would also be punished five hundred ten Judah was completely isolated by the allies who acknowledged the suzerainty of Damascus Soon after Ahaz came to the throne he found himself hemmed in on every side by adversaries who desired to accomplish his fall At that time Rezin king of Syria and Pekah came up to Jerusalem to war and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him five hundred eleven Judah however was overrun the city of Elath was captured and restored to Edom while the Philistines were liberated from the control of Jerusalem Isaiah visited Ahaz and said Take heed and be quiet fear not neither be faint hearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria and of the son of Remaliah Because Syria Ephraim and the son of Remaliah have taken evil counsel against thee saying Let us go up against Judah and vex it and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the midst of it even the son of Tabeal Thus saith the Lord God It shall not stand neither shall it come to pass five hundred twelve The unstable Ahaz had sought assistance from the Baal and made his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the heathen five hundred thirteen Then he resolved to purchase the sympathy of one of the great Powers There was no hope of assistance from the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt for the Ethiopian Pharaohs had not yet conquered the Delta region so he turned to the bee that is in the land of Assyria five hundred fourteen Assyria was the last resource of the king of Judah So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath pileser king of Assyria saying I am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the hand of Syria and out of the hand of the king of Israel which rise up against me And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord and in the treasures of the king s house and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it and carried the people of it captive to Kir five hundred fifteen and slew Rezin five hundred sixteen Tiglath pileser recorded that Rezin took refuge in his city like a mouse Israel was also dealt with In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath pileser king of Assyria and took Ijon and Abel beth maachah and Janoah and Kedesh and Hazor and Gilead and Galilee all the land of Naphtali and carried them captive to Assyria And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah and smote him and slew him and reigned in his stead five hundred seventeen Tiglath pileser recorded They overthrew Paqaha Pekah their king and placed Ausi a Hoshea over them He swept through Israel like a hurricane The Philistines and the Arabians of the desert were also subdued Tribute was sent to the Assyrian monarch by Phoenicia Moab Ammon and Edom It was a proud day for Ahaz when he paid a visit to Tiglath pileser at Damascus five hundred eighteen An Assyrian governor was appointed to rule over Syria and its subject states Babylon next claimed the attention of Tiglath pileser Nabonassar had died and was succeeded by his son Nabu nadin zeri who after reigning for two years was slain in a rebellion The throne was then seized by Nabu shum ukin but in less than two months this usurper was assassinated and the Chaldaeans had one of their chiefs Ukinzer proclaimed king seven hundred thirty two B C When the Assyrian king returned from Syria in seven hundred thirty one B C he invaded Babylonia He was met with a stubborn resistance Ukinzer took refuge in his capital Shapia which held out successfully although the surrounding country was ravaged and despoiled Two years afterwards Tiglath pileser returned captured Shapia and restored peace throughout Babylonia He was welcomed in Babylon which opened its gates to him and he had himself proclaimed king of Sumer and Akkad The Chaldaeans paid tribute Tiglath pileser had now reached the height of his ambition He had not only extended his empire in the west from Cappadocia to the river of Egypt crippled Urartu and pacified his eastern frontier but brought Assyria into close union with Babylonia the mother land the home of culture and the land of the ancient gods He did not live long however to enjoy his final triumph for he died a little over twelve months after he took the hands of Bel Merodach at Babylon He was succeeded by Shalmaneser V seven hundred twenty seven seven hundred twenty two B C who may have been his son but this is not quite certain Little is known regarding his brief reign In seven hundred twenty five B C he led an expedition to Syria and Phoenicia Several of the vassal peoples had revolted when they heard of the death of Tiglath pileser These included the Phoenicians the Philistines and the Israelites who were intriguing with either Egypt or Mutsri Apparently Hoshea king of Israel pretended when the Assyrians entered his country that he remained friendly Shalmaneser however was well informed and made Hoshea a prisoner Samaria closed its gates against him although their king had been dispatched to Assyria The Biblical account of the campaign is as follows Against him Hoshea came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria and Hoshea became his servant and gave him presents And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt five hundred nineteen and brought no present to the king of Assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to Samaria and besieged it three years five hundred twenty Shalmaneser died before Samaria was captured and may have been assassinated The next Assyrian monarch Sargon II seven hundred twenty two seven hundred five B C was not related to either of his two predecessors He is referred to by Isaiah five hundred twenty one and is the Arkeanos of Ptolemy He was the Assyrian monarch who deported the Lost Ten Tribes In the ninth year of Hoshea and the first of Sargon the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away into Assyria and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan and in the cities of the Medes five hundred twenty two In all according to Sargon s record twenty seven thousand two hundred ninety people dwelling in the midst of it Samaria I carried off They the Israelites left all the commandments of the Lord their God and made them molten images even two calves and made a grove and worshipped all the host of heaven the stars and served Baal And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of Judah only And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon and from Cuthah and from Ava and from Hamath and from Sepharvaim and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel and they possessed Samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof And the men of Babylon made Succoth benoth and the men of Cuth Cuthah made Nergal and the men of Hamath made Ashima and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak and the Sepharites burnt their children in fire to Adram melech and Anam melech the gods of Sepharvaim A number of the new settlers were slain by lions and the king of Assyria ordered that a Samaritan priest should be sent to teach them the manner of the God of the land This man was evidently an orthodox Hebrew for he taught them how they should fear the Lord So they feared the Lord but also served their own gods their graven images five hundred twenty three There is no evidence to suggest that the Ten Lost Tribes regarding whom so many nonsensical theories have been formed were not ultimately absorbed by the peoples among whom they settled between Mesopotamia and the Median Highlands five hundred twenty four The various sections must have soon lost touch with one another They were not united like the Jews the people of Judah who were transported to Babylonia a century and a half later by a common religious bond for although a few remained faithful to Abraham s God the majority of the Israelites worshipped either the Baal or the Queen of Heaven The Assyrian policy of transporting the rebellious inhabitants of one part of their empire to another was intended to break their national spirit and compel them to become good and faithful subjects amongst the aliens who must have disliked them The colonists says Professor Maspero exposed to the same hatred as the original Assyrian conquerors soon forgot to look upon the latter as the oppressors of all and allowing their present grudge to efface the memory of past injuries did not hesitate to make common cause with them In time of peace the Assyrian governor did his best to protect them against molestation on the part of the natives and in return for this they rallied round him whenever the latter threatened to get out of hand and helped him to stifle the revolt or hold it in check until the arrival of reinforcements Thanks to their help the empire was consolidated and maintained without too many violent outbreaks in regions far removed from the capital and beyond the immediate reach of the sovereign five hundred twenty five While Sargon was absent in the west a revolt broke out in Babylonia A Chaldaean king Merodach Baladan III had allied himself with the Elamites and occupied Babylon A battle was fought at Dur ilu and the Elamites retreated Although Sargon swept triumphantly through the land he had to leave his rival the tyrannous Chaldaean in possession of the capital and he reigned there for over eleven years Trouble was brewing in Syria It was apparently fostered by an Egyptian king probably Bocchoris of Sais the sole Pharaoh so far as can be ascertained of the Twenty fourth Dynasty who had allied himself with the local dynasts of Lower Egypt and apparently sought to extend his sway into Asia the Ethiopians being supreme in Upper Egypt An alliance had been formed to cast off the yoke of Assyria The city states involved Arpad Simirra Damascus Samaria and Gaza Hanno of Gaza had fled to Egypt after Tiglath pileser came to the relief of Judah and broke up the league of conspirators by capturing Damascus and punishing Samaria Gaza and other cities His return in Sargon s reign was evidently connected with the new rising in which he took part The throne of Hamath had been seized by an adventurer named Ilu bi di a smith The Philistines of Ashdod and the Arabians being strongly pro Egyptian in tendency were willing sympathizers and helpers against the hated Assyrians Sargon appeared in the west with a strong army before the allies had matured their plans He met the smith king of Hamath in battle at Qarqar and having defeated him had him skinned alive Then he marched southward At Rapiki Raphia he routed an army of allies Shabi So the Tartan commander in chief of Pi ru five hundred twenty six Pharaoh King of Mutsri an Arabian state confused perhaps with Misraim Egypt escaped like to a shepherd whose sheep have been taken Piru and other two southern kings Samsi and Itamara afterwards paid tribute to Sargon Hanno of Gaza was transported to Asshur In seven hundred fifteen B C Sargon according to his records appeared with his army in Arabia and received gifts in token of homage from Piru of Mutsri Samsi of Aribi and Itamara of Saba Four years later a revolt broke out in Ashdod which was it would appear directly due to the influence of Shabaka the Ethiopian Pharaoh who had deposed Bocchoris of Sais Another league was about to be formed against Assyria King Azuri of Ashdod had been deposed because of his Egyptian sympathies by the Assyrian governor and his brother Akhimiti was placed on the throne The citizens however overthrew Akhimiti and an adventurer from Cyprus was proclaimed king seven hundred eleven B C It would appear that advances were made by the anti Assyrians to Ahaz of Judah That monarch was placed in a difficult position He knew that if the allies succeeded in stamping out Assyrian authority in Syria and Palestine they would certainly depose him but if on the other hand he joined them and Assyria triumphed its emperor would show him small mercy As Babylon defied Sargon and received the active support of Elam and there were rumours of risings in the north it must have seemed to the western kings as if the Assyrian empire was likely once again to go to pieces Fortunately for Ahaz he had a wise counsellor at this time in the great statesman and prophet the scholarly Isaiah The Lord spake by Isaiah saying Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins and put off thy shoe from thy foot And he did so walking naked and barefoot And the Lord said Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners And they the allies shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation and of Egypt their glory five hundred twenty seven Isaiah warned Ahaz against joining the league in the year that Tartan five hundred twenty eight came unto Ashdod when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him The Tartan fought against Ashdod and took it five hundred twenty nine According to Sargon s record the Pretender of Ashdod fled to Arabia where he was seized by an Arabian chief and delivered up to Assyria The pro Egyptian party in Palestine went under a cloud for a period thereafter Before Sargon could deal with Merodach Baladan of Babylon he found it necessary to pursue the arduous task of breaking up a powerful league which had been formed against him in the north The Syro Cappadocian Hittite states including Tabal in Asia Minor and Carchemish in north Syria were combining for the last time against Assyria supported by Mita Midas king of the Muski Phrygians and Rusas son of Sharduris III king of Urartu Urartu had recovered somewhat from the disasters which it had suffered at the hands of Tiglath pileser and was winning back portions of its lost territory on the north east frontier of Assyria A buffer state had been formed in that area by Tiglath pileser who had assisted the king of the Mannai to weld together the hill tribesmen between Lake Van and Lake Urmia into an organized nation Iranzu its ruler remained faithful to Assyria and consequently became involved in war with Rusas of Urartu who either captured or won over several cities of the Mannai Iranzu was succeeded by his son Aza and this king was so pronounced a pro Assyrian that his pro Urartian subjects assassinated him and set on the throne Bagdatti of Umildish Soon after Sargon began his operations in the north he captured Bagdatti and had him skinned alive The flag of revolt however was kept flying by his brother Ullusunu but ere long this ambitious man found it prudent to submit to Sargon on condition that he would retain the throne as a faithful Assyrian vassal His sudden change of policy appears to have been due to the steady advance of the Median tribes into the territory of the Mannai Sargon conducted a vigorous and successful campaign against the raiders and extended Ullusunu s area of control The way was now clear to Urartu In seven hundred fourteen B C Sargon attacked the revolting king of Zikirtu who was supported by an army led by Rusas his overlord A fierce battle was fought in which the Assyrians achieved a great victory King Rusas fled and when he found that the Assyrians pressed home their triumph by laying waste the country before them he committed suicide according to the Assyrian records although those of Urartu indicate that he subsequently took part in the struggle against Sargon The Armenian peoples were compelled to acknowledge the suzerainty of Assyria and the conqueror received gifts from various tribes between Lake Van and the Caspian Sea and along the frontiers from Lake Van towards the south east as far as the borders of Elam Rusas of Urartu was succeeded by Argistes II who reigned over a shrunken kingdom He intrigued with neighbouring states against Assyria but was closely watched Ere long he found himself caught between two fires During his reign the notorious Cimmerians and Scythians displayed much activity in the north and raided his territory The pressure of fresh infusions of Thraco Phrygian tribes into western Asia Minor had stirred Midas of the Muski to company operate with the Urartian power in an attempt to stamp out Assyrian influence in Cilicia Cappadocia and north Syria A revolt in Tabal in seven hundred eighteen B C was extinguished by Sargon but in the following year evidences were forthcoming of a more serious and widespread rising Pisiris king of Carchemish threw off the Assyrian yoke Before however his allies could hasten to his assistance he was overcome by the vigilant Sargon who deported a large proportion of the city s inhabitants and incorporated it in an Assyrian province Tabal revolted in seven hundred thirteen B C and was similarly dealt with In seven hundred twelve B C Milid had to be overcome The inhabitants were transported and Suti Aramaean peoples settled in their homes The king of Commagene having remained faithful received large extensions of territory Finally in seven hundred nine B C Midas of the Muski Phrygians was compelled to acknowledge the suzerainty of Assyria The northern confederacy was thus completely worsted and broken up Tribute was paid by many peoples including the rulers of Cyprus Sargon was now able to deal with Babylonia which for about twelve years had been ruled by Merodach Baladan who oppressed the people and set at defiance ancient laws by seizing private estates and transferring them to his Chaldaean kinsmen He still received the active support of Elam Sargon s first move was to interpose his army between those of the Babylonians and Elamites Pushing southward he subdued the Aramaeans on the eastern banks of the Tigris and drove the Elamites into the mountains Then he invaded middle Babylonia from the east Merodach Baladan hastily evacuated Babylon and moving southward succeeded in evading Sargon s army Finding Elam was unable to help him he took refuge in the Chaldaean capital Bit Jakin in southern Babylonia Sargon was visited by the priests of Babylon and Borsippa and hailed as the saviour of the ancient kingdom He was afterwards proclaimed king at E sagila where he took the hands of Bel Then having expelled the Aramaeans from Sippar he hastened southward attacked Bit Jakin and captured it Merodach Baladan escaped into Elam The whole of Chaldaea was subdued Thus Sargon the Later entered at length into full possession of the empire of Sargon of Akkad In Babylonia he posed as an incarnation of his ancient namesake and had similarly Messianic pretensions which were no doubt inspired by the Babylonian priesthood Under him Assyria attained its highest degree of splendour He recorded proudly not only his great conquests but also his works of public utility he restored ancient cities irrigated vast tracts of country fostered trade and promoted the industries Like the pious Pharaohs of Egypt he boasted that he fed the hungry and protected the weak against the strong Sargon found time during his strenuous career as a conqueror to lay out and build a new city called Dur Sharrukin the burgh of Sargon to the north of Nineveh It was completed before he undertook the Babylonian campaign The new palace was occupied in seven hundred eight B C Previous to that period he had resided principally at Kalkhi in the restored palace of Ashur natsir pal III He was a worshipper of many gods Although he claimed to have restored the supremacy of Asshur which had come to an end he not only adored Ashur but also revived the ancient triad of Anu Bel and Ea and fostered the growth of the immemorial mother cult of Ishtar Before he died he appointed one of his sons Sennacherib viceroy of the northern portion of the empire He was either assassinated at a military review or in some frontier war As much is suggested by the following entry in an eponym list Eponymy of Upahhir belu prefect of the city of Amedu According to the oracle of the Kulummite s A soldier entered the camp of the king of Assyria and killed him month Ab day twelfth Sennacherib sat on the throne five hundred thirty The fact that Sennacherib lamented his father s sins suggests that the old king had in some manner offended the priesthood Perhaps like some of the Middle Empire monarchs he succumbed to the influence of Babylon during the closing years of his life It is stated that he was not buried in his house which suggests that the customary religious rites were denied him and that his lost soul was supposed to be a wanderer which had to eat offal and drink impure water like the ghost of a pauper or a criminal The task which lay before Sennacherib seven hundred five six hundred eighty B C was to maintain the unity of the great empire of his distinguished father He waged minor wars against the Kassite and Illipi tribes on the Elamite border and the Muski and Hittite tribes in Cappadocia and Cilicia The Kassites however were no longer of any importance and the Hittite power had been extinguished for ere the states could recover from the blows dealt by the Assyrians the Cimmerian hordes ravaged their territory Urartu was also overrun by the fierce barbarians from the north It was one of these last visits of the Assyrians to Tabal of the Hittites and the land of the Muski Meshech which the Hebrew prophet referred to in after time when he exclaimed Asshur is there and all her company his graves are about him all of them slain fallen by the sword There is Meshech Tubal and all her multitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword though they caused their terror in the land of the living Ezekiel xxxii Sennacherib found that Ionians had settled in Cilicia and he deported large numbers of them to Nineveh The metal and ivory work at Nineveh show traces of Greek influence after this period A great conspiracy was fomented in several states against Sennacherib when the intelligence of Sargon s death was bruited abroad Egypt was concerned in it Taharka the Biblical Tirhakah five hundred thirty one the last Pharaoh of the Ethiopian Dynasty had dreams of re establishing Egyptian supremacy in Palestine and Syria and leagued himself with Luli king of Tyre Hezekiah king of Judah and others Merodach Baladan the Chaldaean king whom Sargon had deposed supported by Elamites and Aramaeans was also a party to the conspiracy At that time Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan king of Babylon sent letters and a present to Hezekiah And Hezekiah was glad of them five hundred thirty two Merodach Baladan again seized the throne of Babylon Sargon s son who had been appointed governor was murdered and a pretender sat on the throne for a brief period but Merodach Baladan thrust him aside and reigned for nine months during which period he busied himself by encouraging the kings of Judah and Tyre to revolt Sennacherib invaded Babylonia with a strong army deposed Merodach Baladan routed the Chaldaeans and Aramaeans and appointed as vassal king Bel ibni a native prince who remained faithful to Assyria for about three years In seven hundred seven B C Sennacherib appeared in the west When he approached Tyre Luli the king fled to Cyprus The city was not captured but much of its territory was ceded to the king of Sidon Askalon was afterwards reduced At Eltekeh Sennacherib came into conflict with an army of allies including Ethiopian Egyptian and Arabian Mutsri forces which he routed Then he captured a number of cities in Judah and transported two hundred thousand one hundred fifty people He was unable however to enter Jerusalem in which Hezekiah was compelled to remain like a bird in a cage It appears that Hezekiah bought off the Assyrians on this occasion with gifts of gold and silver and jewels costly furniture musicians and female slaves In six hundred eighty nine B C Sennacherib found it necessary to penetrate Arabia Apparently another conspiracy was brewing for Hezekiah again revolted On his return from the south according to Berosus he had been in Egypt the Assyrian king marched against the king of Judah And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem he took counsel with the princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and they did help him Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water Sennacherib sent messengers to Jerusalem to attempt to stir up the people against Hezekiah He wrote also letters to rail on the Lord God of Israel and to speak against him saying As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand five hundred thirty three Hezekiah sent his servants to Isaiah who was in Jerusalem at the time and the prophet said to them Thus shall ye say to your master Thus saith the Lord Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me Behold I will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and shall return to his own land and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land five hundred thirty four According to Berosus the Babylonian priestly historian the camp of Sennacherib was visited in the night by swarms of field mice which ate up the quivers and bows and the leather handles of shields Next morning the army fled The Biblical account of the disaster is as follows And it came to pass that night that the angel of the Lord went out and smote the camp of the Assyrians an hundred and four score and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at Nineveh five hundred thirty five A pestilence may have broken out in the camp the infection perhaps having been carried by field mice Byron s imagination was stirred by the vision of the broken army of Assyria The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold And his cohorts were gleaming with purple and gold And the sheen of their spears was like stars of the sea When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee Like the leaves of the forest when summer is green That host with their banners at sunset were seen Like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown That host on the morrow lay withered and strown For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast And breathed on the face of the foe as he passed And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill And their hearts but once heaved and forever grew still And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf And cold as the spray of the rock beating surf And there lay the rider distorted and pale With the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail And the tents were all silent the banners alone Thelances uplifted the trumpet unblown And the widows of Asshur are loud in their wail And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal And the might of the Gentile unsmote by the sword Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord Before this disaster occurred Sennacherib had to invade Babylonia again for the vassal king Bel ibni had allied himself with the Chaldaeans and raised the standard of revolt The city of Babylon was besieged and captured and its unfaithful king deported with a number of nobles to Assyria Old Merodach Baladan was concerned in the plot and took refuge on the Elamite coast where the Chaldaeans had formed a colony He died soon afterwards Sennacherib operated in southern Babylonia and invaded Elam But ere he could return to Assyria he was opposed by a strong army of allies including Babylonians Chaldaeans Aramaeans Elamites and Persians led by Samunu son of Merodach Baladan A desperate battle was fought Although Sennacherib claimed a victory he was unable to follow it up This was in six hundred ninety two B C A Chaldaean named Mushezib Merodach seized the Babylonian throne In six hundred ninety one B C Sennacherib again struck a blow for Babylonia but was unable to depose Mushezib Merodach His opportunity came however in six hundred eighty nine B C Elam had been crippled by raids of the men of Parsua Persia and was unable to company operate with the Chaldaean king of Babylon Sennacherib captured the great commercial metropolis took Mushezib Merodach prisoner and dispatched him to Nineveh Then he wreaked his vengeance on Babylon For several days the Assyrian soldiers looted the houses and temples and slaughtered the inhabitants without mercy E sagila was robbed of its treasures images of deities were either broken in pieces or sent to Nineveh the statue of Bel Merodach was dispatched to Asshur so that he might take his place among the gods who were vassals of Ashur The city and its houses Sennacherib recorded from foundation to roof I destroyed them I demolished them I burned them with fire walls gateways sacred chapels and the towers of earth and tiles I laid them low and cast them into the Arakhtu five hundred thirty six So thorough was Sennacherib s destruction of the city in six hundred eighty nine B C writes mister King that after several years of work doctor Koldewey concluded that all traces of earlier buildings had been destroyed on that occasion More recently some remains of earlier strata have been recognized and contract tablets have been found which date from the period of the First Dynasty Moreover a number of earlier pot burials have been unearthed but a careful examination of the greater part of the ruins has added little to our knowledge of this most famous city before the Neo Babylonian period five hundred thirty seven It is possible that Sennacherib desired to supplant Babylon as a commercial metropolis by Nineveh He extended and fortified that city surrounding it with two walls protected by moats According to Diodorus the walls were a hundred feet high and about fifty feet wide Excavators have found that at the gates they were about a hundred feet in breadth The water supply of the city was ensured by the construction of dams and canals and strong quays were erected to prevent flooding Sennacherib repaired a lofty platform which was isolated by a canal and erected upon it his great palace On another platform he had an arsenal built Sennacherib s palace was the most magnificent building of its kind ever erected by an Assyrian emperor It was lavishly decorated and its bas reliefs display native art at its highest pitch of excellence The literary remains of the time also give indication of the growth of culture the inscriptions are distinguished by their prose style It is evident that men of culture and refinement were numerous in Assyria The royal library of Kalkhi received many additions during the reign of the destroyer of Babylon Like his father Sennacherib died a violent death According to the Babylonian Chronicle he was slain in a revolt by his son on the twentieth day of Tebet six hundred eighty B C The revolt continued from the twentieth of Tebet early in January until the second day of Adar the middle of February On the eighteenth of Adar Esarhaddon son of Sennacherib was proclaimed king Berosus states that Sennacherib was murdered by two of his sons but Esarhaddon was not one of the conspirators The Biblical reference is as follows Sennacherib dwelt at Nineveh And it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch Ashur his god that Adrammelech and Sharezer Ashur shar etir his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of Armenia Urartu And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead Ashur shar etir appears to have been the claimant to the throne Esarhaddon six hundred eighty six hundred sixty eight B C was a man of different type from his father He adopted towards vassal states a policy of conciliation and did much to secure peace within the empire by his magnanimous treatment of rebel kings who had been intimidated by their neighbours and forced to entwine themselves in the meshes of intrigue His wars were directed mainly to secure the protection of outlying provinces against aggressive raiders The monarch was strongly influenced by his mother Naki a a Babylonian princess who appears to have been as distinguished a lady as the famous Sammu rammat Indeed it is possible that traditions regarding her contributed to the Semiramis legends But it was not only due to her that Esarhaddon espoused the cause of the pro Babylonian party He appears to be identical with the Axerdes of Berosus who ruled over the southern kingdom for eight years Apparently he had been appointed governor by Sennacherib after the destruction of Babylon and it may be that during his term of office in Babylonia he was attracted by its ethical ideals and developed those traits of character which distinguished him from his father and grandfather He married a Babylonian princess and one of his sons Shamash shum ukin was born in a Babylonian palace probably at Sippar He was a worshipper of the mother goddess Ishtar of Nineveh and Ishtar of Arbela and of Shamash as well as of the national god Ashur As soon as Esarhaddon came to the throne he undertook the restoration of Babylon to which many of the inhabitants were drifting back In three years the city resumed its pre eminent position as a trading and industrial centre Withal he won the hearts of the natives by expelling Chaldaeans from the private estates which they had seized during the Merodach Baladan regime and restoring them to the rightful heirs A Chaldaean revolt was inevitable Two of Merodach Baladan s sons gave trouble in the south but were routed in battle One fled to Elam where he was assassinated the other sued for peace and was accepted by the diplomatic Esarhaddon as a vassal king Egypt was intriguing in the west Its Ethiopian king Taharka the Biblical Tirhakah had stirred up Hezekiah to revolt during Sennacherib s reign An Assyrian ambassador who had visited Jerusalem heard say concerning Tirhakah He sent messengers to Hezekiah saying Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria Behold thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden which were in Telassar Where is the king of Hamath and the king of Arphad and the king of the city of Sepharvaim Hena and Ivah five hundred thirty eight Sidon was a party to the pro Egyptian league which had been formed in Palestine and Syria Early in his reign Esarhaddon conducted military operations in the west and during his absence the queen mother Naki a held the reins of government The Elamites regarded this innovation as a sign of weakness and invaded Babylon Sippar was plundered and its gods carried away The Assyrian governors however ultimately repulsed the Elamite king who was deposed soon after he returned home His son who succeeded him restored the stolen gods and cultivated good relations with Esarhaddon There was great unrest in Elam at this period it suffered greatly from the inroads of Median and Persian pastoral fighting folk In the north the Cimmerians and Scythians who were constantly warring against Urartu and against each other had spread themselves westward and east Esarhaddon drove Cimmerian invaders out of Cappadocia and they swamped Phrygia The Scythian peril on the north east frontier was however of more pronounced character The fierce mountaineers had allied themselves with Median tribes and overrun the buffer State of the Mannai Both Urartu and Assyria were sufferers from the brigandage of these allies Esarhaddon s generals however were able to deal with the situation and one of the notable results of the pacification of the north eastern area was the conclusion of an alliance with Urartu The most serious situation with which the emperor had to deal was in the west The King of Sidon who had been so greatly favoured by Sennacherib had espoused the Egyptian cause He allied himself with the King of Cilicia who however was unable to help him much Sidon was besieged and captured the royal allies escaped but a few years later were caught and beheaded The famous seaport was destroyed and its vast treasures deported to Assyria about six hundred seventy six B C Esarhaddon replaced it by a new city called Kar Esarhaddon which formed the nucleus of the new Sidon It is believed that Judah and other disaffected States were dealt with about this time Manasseh had succeeded Hezekiah at Jerusalem when but a boy of twelve years He appears to have come under the influence of heathen teachers For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for Baal and made a grove as did Ahab king of Israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord And he made his son pass through the fire and observed times and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house of which the Lord said to David and to Solomon his son In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel will I put my name for ever five hundred thirty nine Isaiah ceased to prophesy after Manasseh came to the throne According to Rabbinic traditions he was seized by his enemies and enclosed in the hollow trunk of a tree which was sawn through Other orthodox teachers appear to have been slain also Manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another five hundred forty It is possible that there is a reference to Isaiah s fate in an early Christian lament regarding the persecutions of the faithful Others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword five hundred forty one There is no Assyrian evidence regarding the captivity of Manasseh Wherefore the Lord brought upon them the people of Judah the captains of the host of the king of Assyria which took Manasseh among the thorns and bound him with fetters and carried him to Babylon And when he was in affliction he besought the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers and prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom five hundred forty two It was however in keeping with the policy of Esarhaddon to deal in this manner with an erring vassal The Assyrian records include Manasseh of Judah Menase of the city of Yaudu with the kings of Edom Moab Ammon Tyre Ashdod Gaza Byblos c and twenty two kings of Khatti as payers of tribute to Esarhaddon their overlord Hazael of Arabia was conciliated by having restored to him his gods which Sennacherib had carried away Egypt continued to intrigue against Assyria and Esarhaddon resolved to deal effectively with Taharka the last Ethiopian Pharaoh In six hundred seventy four B C he invaded Egypt but suffered a reverse and had to retreat Tyre revolted soon afterwards six hundred seventy three B C Esarhaddon however made elaborate preparations for his next campaign In six hundred seventy one B C he went westward with a much more powerful army A detachment advanced to Tyre and invested it The main force meanwhile pushed on crossed the Delta frontier and swept victoriously as far south as Memphis where Taharka suffered a crushing defeat That great Egyptian metropolis was then occupied and plundered by the soldiers of Esarhaddon Lower Egypt became an Assyrian province the various petty kings including Necho of Sais had set over them Assyrian governors Tyre was also captured When he returned home Esarhaddon erected at the Syro Cappadocian city of Singirli five hundred forty three a statue of victory which is now in the Berlin museum On this memorial the Assyrian King of the kings of Egypt is depicted as a giant With one hand he pours out an oblation to a god in the other he grasps his sceptre and two cords attached to rings which pierce the lips of dwarfish figures representing the Pharaoh Taharka of Egypt and the unfaithful King of Tyre In six hundred sixty eight B C Taharka who had fled to Napata in Ethiopia returned to Upper Egypt and began to stir up revolts Esarhaddon planned out another expedition so that he might shatter the last vestige of power possessed by his rival But before he left home he found it necessary to set his kingdom in order During his absence from home the old Assyrian party who disliked the emperor because of Babylonian sympathies had been intriguing regarding the succession to the throne According to the Babylonian Chronicle the king remained in Assyria during six hundred sixty nine B C and he slew with the sword many noble men Ashur bani pal was evidently concerned in the conspiracy and it is significant to find that he pleaded on behalf of certain of the conspirators The crown prince Sinidinabal was dead perhaps he had been assassinated At the feast of the goddess Gula identical with Bau consort of Ninip towards the end of April in six hundred sixty eight B C Esarhaddon divided his empire between two of his sons Ashur bani pal was selected to be King of Assyria and Shamash shum ukin to be King of Babylon and the vassal of Ashur banipal Other sons received important priestly appointments Soon after these arrangements were completed Esarhaddon who was suffering from bad health set out for Egypt He died towards the end of October and the early incidents of his campaign were included in the records of Ashur bani pal s reign Taharka was defeated at Memphis and retreated southward to Thebes So passed away the man who has been eulogized as the noblest and most sympathetic figure among the Assyrian kings There was certainly much which was attractive in his character He inaugurated many social reforms and appears to have held in check his overbearing nobles Trade flourished during his reign He did not undertake the erection of a new city like his father but won the gratitude of the priesthood by his activities as a builder and restorer of temples He founded a new house of Ashur at Nineveh and reconstructed several temples in Babylonia His son Ashur bani pal was the last great Assyrian ruler CHAPTER XX THE LAST

four The doom of Babylon was also foretold Bel boweth down Nebo stoopeth Come down and sit in the dust O virgin daughter of Babylon sit on the ground there is no throne O daughter of the Chaldeans Stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth if so be thou shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevail Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels Let now the astrologers the star gazers the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee Behold they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured even thy merchants from thy youth they shall wander every one to his quarter none shall save thee five hundred forty five Against a gloomy background dark and ominous as a thundercloud we have revealed in the last century of Mesopotamian glory the splendour of Assyria and the beauty of Babylon The ancient civilizations ripened quickly before the end came Kings still revelled in pomp and luxury Cities resounded with the noise of a whip and the noise of the rattling of the wheels and of the prancing horses and of the jumping chariots The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear The valiant men are in scarlet five hundred forty six But the minds of cultured men were more deeply occupied than ever with the mysteries of life and creation In the libraries the temples and observatories philosophers and scientists were shattering the unsubstantial fabric of immemorial superstition they attained to higher conceptions of the duties and responsibilities of mankind they conceived of divine love and divine guidance they discovered like Wordsworth that the soul has An obscure sense Of possible sublimity whereto With growing faculties she doth aspire One of the last kings of Babylon Nebuchadrezzar recorded a prayer which reveals the loftiness of religious thought and feeling attained by men to whom graven images were no longer worthy of adoration and reverence men whose god was not made by human hands O eternal prince Lord of all being As for the king whom thou lovest and Whose name thou hast proclaimed As was pleasing to thee Do thou lead aright his life Guide him in a straight path I am the prince obedient to thee The creature of thy hand Thou hast created me and With dominion over all people Thou hast entrusted me According to thy grace O Lord Which thou dost bestow on All people Cause me to love thy supreme dominion And create in my heart The worship of thy godhead And grant whatever is pleasing to thee Because thou hast fashioned my life five hundred forty seven The star gazers had become scientists and foretold eclipses in every sphere of intellectual activity great men were sifting out truth from the debris of superstition It seemed as if Babylon and Assyria were about to cross the threshold of a new age when their doom was sounded and their power was shattered for ever Nineveh perished with dramatic suddenness Babylon died of senile decay When in six hundred sixty eight B C intelligence reached Nineveh that Esarhaddon had passed away on the march through Egypt the arrangements which he had made for the succession were carried out smoothly and quickly Naki a the queen mother was acting as regent and completed her lifework by issuing a proclamation exhorting all loyal subjects and vassals to obey the new rulers her grandsons Ashur bani pal Emperor of Assyria and Shamash shum ukin King of Babylon Peace prevailed in the capital and there was little or no friction throughout the provinces new rulers were appointed to administer the States of Arvad and Ammon but there were no changes elsewhere Babylon welcomed its new king a Babylonian by birth and the son of a Babylonian princess The ancient kingdom rejoiced that it was no longer to be ruled as a province its ancient dignities and privileges were being partially restored But one great and deep seated grievance remained The god Merodach was still a captive in the temple of Ashur No king could reign aright if Merodach were not restored to E sagila Indeed he could not be regarded as the lord of the land until he had taken the hands of Bel The ceremony of taking the god s hands was an act of homage When it was consummated the king became the steward or vassal of Merodach and every day he appeared before the divine one to receive instructions and worship him The welfare of the whole kingdom depended on the manner in which the king acted towards the god If Merodach was satisfied with the king he sent blessings to the land if he was angry he sent calamities A pious and faithful monarch was therefore the protector of the people This close association of the king with the god gave the priests great influence in Babylon They were the power behind the throne The destinies of the royal house were placed in their hands they could strengthen the position of a royal monarch or cause him to be deposed if he did not satisfy their demands A king who reigned over Babylon without the priestly party on his side occupied an insecure position Nor could he secure the company operation of the priests unless the image of the god was placed in the temple Where king was there Merodach had to be also Shamash shum ukin pleaded with his royal brother and overlord to restore Bel Merodach to Babylon Ashur bani pal hesitated for a time he was unwilling to occupy a less dignified position as the representative of Ashur than his distinguished predecessor in his relation to the southern kingdom At length however he was prevailed upon to consult the oracle of Shamash the solar lawgiver the revealer of destiny The god was accordingly asked if Shamash shum ukin could take the hands of Bel in Ashur s temple and then proceed to Babylon as his representative In response the priests of Shamash informed the emperor that Bel Merodach could not exercise sway as sovereign lord so long as he remained a prisoner in a city which was not his own Ashur bani pal accepted the verdict and then visited Ashur s temple to plead with Bel Merodach to return to Babylon Let thy thoughts he cried dwell in Babylon which in thy wrath thou didst bring to naught Let thy face be turned towards E sagila thy lofty and divine temple Return to the city thou hast deserted for a house unworthy of thee O Merodach lord of the gods issue thou the command to return again to Babylon Thus did Ashur bani pal make pious and dignified submission to the will of the priests A favourable response was of course received from Merodach when addressed by the emperor and the god s image was carried back to E sagila accompanied by a strong force Ashur bani pal and Shamash shum ukin led the procession of priests and soldiers and elaborate ceremonials were observed at each city they passed the local gods being carried forth to do homage to Merodach Babylon welcomed the deity who was thus restored to his temple after the lapse of about a quarter of a century and the priests celebrated with unconcealed satisfaction and pride the ceremony at which Shamash shum ukin took the hands of Bel The public rejoicings were conducted on an elaborate scale Babylon believed that a new era of prosperity had been inaugurated and the priests and nobles looked forward to the day when the kingdom would once again become free and independent and powerful Ashur bani pal six hundred sixty eight six hundred twenty six B C made arrangements to complete his father s designs regarding Egypt His Tartan continued the campaign and Taharka as has been stated was driven from Memphis The beaten Pharaoh returned to Ethiopia and did not again attempt to expel the Assyrians He died in six hundred sixty six B C It was found that some of the petty kings of Lower Egypt had been intriguing with Taharka and their cities were severely dealt with Necho of Sais had to be arrested among others but was pardoned after he appeared before Ashur bani pal and sent back to Egypt as the Assyrian governor Tanutamon a son of Pharaoh Shabaka succeeded Taharka and in six hundred sixty three B C marched northward from Thebes with a strong army He captured Memphis It is believed Necho was slain and Herodotus relates that his son Psamtik took refuge in Syria In six hundred sixty one B C Ashur bani pal s army swept through Lower Egypt and expelled the Ethiopians Tanutamon fled southward but on this occasion the Assyrians followed up their success and besieged and captured Thebes which they sacked Its nobles were slain or taken captive According to the prophet Nahum who refers to Thebes as No Nu Amon city of Amon her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets and they the Assyrians cast lots for her honourable men and all her great men were bound in chains five hundred forty eight Thebes never again recovered its prestige Its treasures were transported to Nineveh The Ethiopian supremacy in Egypt was finally extinguished and Psamtik son of Necho who was appointed the Pharaoh began to reign as the vassal of Assyria When the kings on the seacoasts of Palestine and Asia Minor found that they could no longer look to Egypt for help they resigned themselves to the inevitable and ceased to intrigue against Assyria Gifts were sent to Ashur bani pal by the kings of Arvad Tyre Tarsus and Tabal The Arvad ruler however was displaced and his son set on his throne But the most extraordinary development was the visit to Nineveh of emissaries from Gyges king of Lydia who figures in the legends of Greece This monarch had been harassed by the Cimmerians after they accomplished the fall of Midas of Phrygia in six hundred seventy six B C and he sought the help of Ashur bani pal It is not known whether the Assyrians operated against the Cimmerians in Tabal but as Gyges did not send tribute it would appear that he held his own with the aid of mercenaries from the State of Caria in southwestern Asia Minor The Greeks of Cilicia and the Achaeans and Phoenicians of Cyprus remained faithful to Assyria Elam gave trouble in six hundred sixty five B C by raiding Akkad but the Assyrian army repulsed the invaders at Dur ilu and pushed on to Susa The Elamites received a crushing defeat in a battle on the banks of the River Ula King Teumman was slain and a son of the King of Urtagu was placed on his throne Elam thus came under Assyrian sway The most surprising and sensational conspiracy against Ashur bani pal was fomented by his brother Shamash shum ukin of Babylon after the two had company operated peacefully for fifteen years No doubt the priestly party at E sagila were deeply concerned in the movement and the king may have been strongly influenced by the fact that Babylonia was at the time suffering from severe depression caused by a series of poor harvests Merodach according to the priests was angry it was probably argued that he was punishing the people because they had not thrown off the yoke of Assyria The temple treasures of Babylon were freely drawn upon to purchase the allegiance of allies Ere Ashur bani pal had any knowledge of the conspiracy his brother had won over several governors in Babylonia the Chaldaeans Aramaeans and Elamites and many petty kings in Palestine and Syria even Egypt and Libya were prepared to help him When however the faithful governor of Ur was approached he communicated with his superior at Erech who promptly informed Ashur bani pal of the great conspiracy The intelligence reached Nineveh like a bolt from the blue The emperor s heart was filled with sorrow and anguish In after time he lamented in an inscription that his faithless brother forgot the favours he had shown him Outwardly with his lips he spoke friendly things while inwardly his heart plotted murder In six hundred fifty two B C Shamash shum ukin precipitated the crisis by forbidding Ashur bani pal to make offerings to the gods in the cities of Babylonia He thus declared his independence War broke out simultaneously Ur and Erech were besieged and captured by the Chaldaeans and an Elamite army marched to the aid of the King of Babylon but it was withdrawn before long on account of the unsettled political conditions at home The Assyrian armies swept through Babylonia and the Chaldeans in the south were completely subjugated before Babylon was captured That great commercial metropolis was closely besieged for three years and was starved into submission When the Assyrians were entering the city gates a sensational happening occurred Shamash shum ukin the rebel king shut himself up in his palace and set fire to it and perished there amidst the flames with his wife and children his slaves and all his treasures Ashur bani pal was in six hundred forty seven B C proclaimed King Kandalanu five hundred forty nine of Babylon and reigned over it until his death in six hundred twenty six B C Elam was severely dealt with That unhappy country was terribly devastated by Assyrian troops who besieged and captured Susa which was pillaged and wrecked It was recorded afterwards as a great triumph of this campaign that the statue of Nana of Erech which had been carried off by Elamites sixteen thirty five years previously was recovered and restored to the ancient Sumerian city Elam s power of resistance was finally extinguished and the country fell a ready prey to the Medes and Persians who soon entered into possession of it Thus by destroying a buffer State Ashur bani pal strengthened the hands of the people who were destined twenty years after his death to destroy the Empire of Assyria The western allies of Babylon were also dealt with and it may be that at this time Manasseh of Judah was taken to Babylon two Chronicles xxxiii II where however he was forgiven The Medes and the Mannai in the north west were visited and subdued and a new alliance was formed with the dying State of Urartu Psamtik of Egypt had thrown off the yoke of Assyria and with the assistance of Carian mercenaries received from his ally Gyges king of Lydia extended his sway southward He made peace with Ethiopia by marrying a princess of its royal line Gyges must have weakened his army by thus assisting Psamtik for he was severely defeated and slain by the Cimmerians His son Ardys appealed to Assyria for help Ashur bani pal dispatched an army to Cilicia The joint operations of Assyria and Lydia resulted in the extinction of the kingdom of the Cimmerians about six hundred forty five B C The records of Ashur bani pal cease after six hundred forty B C so that we are unable to follow the events of his reign during its last fourteen years Apparently peace prevailed everywhere The great monarch who was a pronounced adherent of the goddess cults appears to have given himself up to a life of indulgence and inactivity Under the name Sardanapalus he went down to tradition as a sensual Oriental monarch who lived in great pomp and luxury and perished in his burning palace when the Medes revolted against him It is evident however that the memory of more than one monarch contributed to the Sardanapalus legend for Ashur bani pal had lain nearly twenty years in his grave before the siege of Nineveh took place In the Bible he is referred to as the great and noble Asnapper and he appears to have been the emperor who settled the Babylonian Elamite and other colonists in the cities of Samaria five hundred fifty He erected at Nineveh a magnificent palace which was decorated on a lavish scale The sculptures are the finest productions of Assyrian art and embrace a wide variety of subjects battle scenes hunting scenes and elaborate Court and temple ceremonies Realism is combined with a delicacy of touch and a degree of originality which raises the artistic productions of the period to the front rank among the artistic triumphs of antiquity Ashur bani pal boasted of the thorough education which he had received from the tutors of his illustrious father Esarhaddon In his palace he kept a magnificent library It contained thousands of clay tablets on which were inscribed and translated the classics of Babylonia To the scholarly zeal of this cultured monarch is due the preservation of the Babylonian story of creation the Gilgamesh and Etana legends and other literary and religious products of remote antiquity Most of the literary tablets in the British Museum were taken from Ashur bani pal s library There are no Assyrian records of the reigns of Ashur bani pal s two sons Ashur etil ilani who erected a small palace and reconstructed the temple to Nebo at Kalkhi and Sin shar ishkun who is supposed to have perished in Nineveh Apparently Ashur etil ilani reigned for at least six years and was succeeded by his brother A year after Ashur bani pal died Nabopolassar who was probably a Chaldaean was proclaimed king at Babylon According to Babylonian legend he was an Assyrian general who had been sent southward with an army to oppose the advance of invaders from the sea Nabopolassar s sway at first was confined to Babylon and Borsippa but he strengthened himself by forming an offensive and defensive alliance with the Median king whose daughter he had married to his son Nebuchadrezzar He strengthened the fortifications of Babylon rebuilt the temple of Merodach which had been destroyed by Ashur bani pal and waged war successfully against the Assyrians and their allies in Mesopotamia About six hundred six B C Nineveh fell and Sin shar ishkun may have burned himself there in his palace like his uncle Shamash shum ukin of Babylon and the legendary Sardanapalus It is not certain however whether the Scythians or the Medes were the successful besiegers of the great Assyrian capital Woe to the bloody city it is all full of lies and robbery Nahum had cried The gates of the rivers shall be opened and the palace shall be dissolved Take ye the spoil of silver take the spoil of gold Behold I am against thee saith the Lord of hosts five hundred fifty one According to Herodotus an army of Medes under Cyaxares had defeated the Assyrians and were besieging Nineveh when the Scythians overran Media Cyaxares raised the siege and went against them but was defeated Then the Scythians swept across Assyria and Mesopotamia and penetrated to the Delta frontier of Egypt Psamtik ransomed his kingdom with handsome gifts At length however Cyaxares had the Scythian leaders slain at a banquet and then besieged and captured Nineveh Assyria was completely overthrown Those of its nobles and priests who escaped the sword no doubt escaped to Babylonia Some may have found refuge also in Palestine and Egypt Necho the second Pharaoh of the Twenty sixth Egyptian Dynasty did not hesitate to take advantage of Assyria s fall In six hundred nine B C he proceeded to recover the long lost Asiatic possessions of Egypt and operated with an army and fleet Gaza and Askalon were captured Josiah the grandson of Manasseh was King of Judah In his days Pharaoh nechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates and king Josiah went against him and he Necho slew him at Megiddo five hundred fifty two His son Jehoahaz succeeded him but was deposed three months later by Necho who placed another son of Josiah named Eliakim on the throne and turned his name to Jehoiakim five hundred fifty three The people were heavily taxed to pay tribute to the Pharaoh When Necho pushed northward towards the Euphrates he was met by a Babylonian army under command of Prince Nebuchadrezzar five hundred fifty four The Egyptians were routed at Carchemish in six hundred five B C Jeremiah xvi two In six hundred four B C Nabopolassar died and the famous Nebuchadrezzar II ascended the throne of Babylon He lived to be one of its greatest kings and reigned for over forty years It was he who built the city described by Herodotus pp two hundred nineteen et seq and constructed its outer wall which enclosed so large an area that no army could invest it Merodach s temple was decorated with greater magnificence than ever before The great palace and hanging gardens were erected by this mighty monarch who no doubt attracted to the city large numbers of the skilled artisans who had fled from Nineveh He also restored temples at other cities and made generous gifts to the priests Captives were drafted into Babylonia from various lands and employed cleaning out the canals and as farm labourers The trade and industries of Babylon flourished greatly and Nebuchadrezzar s soldiers took speedy vengeance on roving bands which infested the caravan roads The king of Egypt after his crushing defeat at Carchemish came not again any more out of his land for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt five hundred fifty five Jehoiakim of Judah remained faithful to Necho until he was made a prisoner by Nebuchadrezzar who bound him in fetters to carry him to Babylon five hundred fifty six He was afterwards sent back to Jerusalem And Jehoiakim became his Nebuchadrezzar s servant three years then he turned and rebelled against him five hundred fifty seven Bands of Chaldaeans Syrians Moabites and Ammonites were harassing the frontiers of Judah and it seemed to the king as if the Babylonian power had collapsed Nebuchadrezzar hastened westward and scattered the raiders before him Jehoiakim died and his son Jehoiachan a youth of eighteen years succeeded him Nebuchadrezzar laid siege to Jerusalem and the young king submitted to him and was carried off to Babylon with all the princes and all the mighty men of valour even ten thousand captives and all the craftsmen and smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the people of the land five hundred fifty eight Nebuchadrezzar had need of warriors and workmen Zedekiah was placed on the throne of Judah as an Assyrian vassal He remained faithful for a few years but at length began to conspire with Tyre and Sidon Moab Edom and Ammon in favour of Egyptian suzerainty Pharaoh Hophra Apries the fourth king of the Twenty sixth Dynasty took active steps to assist the conspirators and Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon five hundred fifty nine Nebuchadrezzar led a strong army through Mesopotamia and divided it at Riblah on the Orontes River One part of it descended upon Judah and captured Lachish and Azekah Jerusalem was able to hold out for about eighteen months Then the famine was sore in the city so that there was no bread for the people of the land Then the city was broken up and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by way of the gate between the two walls which was by the king s garden Zedekiah attempted to escape but was captured and carried before Nebuchadrezzar who was at Riblah in the land of Hamath And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah and the king of Babylon bound him in chains and carried him to Babylon and put him in prison till the day of his death five hundred sixty The majority of the Jews were deported to Babylonia where they were employed as farm labourers Some rose to occupy important official positions A remnant escaped to Egypt with Jeremiah Jerusalem was plundered and desolated The Assyrians burned the house of the Lord and the king s house and all the houses of Jerusalem and brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about Jeremiah lamented How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people how is she become as a widow she that was great among the nations and princess among the provinces how is she become tributary She weepeth sore in the night and her tears are on her cheeks among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her all her friends have dealt treacherously with her they are become her enemies Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction and because of great servitude she dwelleth among the heathen she findeth no rest all her persecutors overtook her between the straits Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old five hundred sixty one Tyre was besieged but was not captured Its king however arranged terms of peace with Nebuchadrezzar Amel Marduk the Evil Merodach of the Bible the next king of Babylon reigned for a little over two years He released Jehoiachin from prison and allowed him to live in the royal palace five hundred sixty two Berosus relates that Amel Marduk lived a dissipated life and was slain by his brother in law Nergal shar utsur who reigned two years five hundred fifty nine six B C Labashi Marduk son of Nergal shar utsur followed with a reign of nine months He was deposed by the priests Then a Babylonian prince named Nabu na id Nabonidus was set on the throne He was the last independent king of Babylonia His son Belshazzar appears to have acted as regent during the latter part of the reign Nabonidus engaged himself actively during his reign five hundred fifty six five hundred forty B C in restoring temples He entirely reconstructed the house of Shamash the sun god at Sippar and towards the end of his reign the house of Sin the moon god at Haran The latter building had been destroyed by the Medes The religious innovations of Nabonidus made him exceedingly unpopular throughout Babylonia for he carried away the gods of Ur Erech Larsa and Eridu and had them placed in E sagila Merodach and his priests were displeased the prestige of the great god was threatened by the policy adopted by Nabonidus As an inscription composed after the fall of Babylon sets forth Merodach gazed over the surrounding lands looking for a righteous prince one after his own heart who should take his hands He called by name Cyrus Cyrus was a petty king of the shrunken Elamite province of Anshan which had been conquered by the Persians He claimed to be an Achaemenian that is a descendant of the semi mythical Akhamanish the Achaemenes of the Greeks a Persian patriarch who resembled the Aryo Indian Manu and the Germanic Mannus Akhamanish was reputed to have been fed and protected in childhood by an eagle the sacred eagle which cast its shadow on born rulers Probably this eagle was remotely Totemic and the Achaemenians were descendants of an ancient eagle tribe Gilgamesh was protected by an eagle as we have seen as the Aryo Indian Shakuntala was by vultures and Semiramis by doves The legends regarding the birth and boyhood of Cyrus resemble those related regarding Sargon of Akkad and the Indian Karna and Krishna Cyrus acknowledged as his overlord Astyages king of the Medes He revolted against Astyages whom he defeated and took prisoner Thereafter he was proclaimed King of the Medes and Persians who were kindred peoples of Indo European speech The father of Astyages was Cyaxares the ally of Nabopolassar of Babylon When this powerful king captured Nineveh he entered into possession of the northern part of the Assyrian Empire which extended westward into Asia Minor to the frontier of the Lydian kingdom he also possessed himself of Urartu Armenia Lydia had after the collapse of the Cimmerian power absorbed Phrygia and its ambitious king Alyattes waged war against the Medes At length owing to the good offices of Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon and Syennesis of Cilicia the Medes and Lydians made peace in five hundred eighty five B C Astyages then married a daughter of the Lydian ruler When Cyrus overthrew Cyaxares king of the Medes Croesus king of Lydia formed an alliance against him with Amasis king of Egypt and Nabonidus king of Babylon The latter was at first friendly to Cyrus who had attacked Cyaxares when he was advancing on Babylon to dispute Nabonidus s claim to the throne and perhaps to win it for a descendant of Nebuchadrezzar his father s ally It was after the fall of the Median Dynasty that Nabonidus undertook the restoration of the moon god s temple at Haran Cyrus advanced westward against Croesus of Lydia before that monarch could receive assistance from the intriguing but pleasure loving Amasis of Egypt he defeated and overthrew him and seized his kingdom five hundred forty seven five hundred forty six B C Then having established himself as supreme ruler in Asia Minor he began to operate against Babylonia In five hundred thirty nine B C Belshazzar was defeated near Opis Sippar fell soon afterwards Cyrus s general Gobryas then advanced upon Babylon where Belshazzar deemed himself safe One night in the month of Tammuz Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousand Belshazzar whiles he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem that the king and his princes his wives and his concubines might drink therein They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver of brass of iron of wood and of stone In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain five hundred sixty three On the sixteenth of Tammuz the investing army under Gobryas entered Babylon the gates having been opened by friends within the city Some think that the Jews favoured the cause of Cyrus It is quite as possible however that the priests of Merodach had a secret understanding with the great Achaemenian the King of kings A few days afterwards Cyrus arrived at Babylon Belshazzar had been slain but Nabonidus still lived and he was deported to Carmania Perfect order prevailed throughout the city which was firmly policed by the Persian soldiers and there was no looting Cyrus was welcomed as a deliverer by the priesthood He took the hands of Bel Merodach at E sagila and was proclaimed King of the world King of Babylon King of Sumer and Akkad and King of the Four Quarters Cyrus appointed his son Cambyses as governor of Babylon Although a worshipper of Ahura Mazda and Mithra Cambyses appears to have conciliated the priesthood When he became king and swept through Egypt he was remembered as the madman who in a fit of passion slew a sacred Apis bull It is possible however that he performed what he considered to be a pious act he may have sacrificed the bull to Mithra The Jews also welcomed Cyrus They yearned for their native land By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered Zion We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying Sing us one of the songs of Zion How shall we sing the Lord s song in a strange land If I forget thee O Jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning If I do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy five hundred sixty four Cyrus heard with compassion the cry of the captives Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia The Lord God of heaven hath given me all kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem which is in Judah Who is there among you of all his people his God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah and build the house of the Lord God of Israel he is the God which is in Jerusalem five hundred sixty five In five hundred thirty eight B C the first party of Jews who were set free saw through tears the hills of home and hastened their steps to reach Mount Zion Fifty years later Ezra led back another party of the faithful The work of restoring Jerusalem was undertaken by Nehemiah in four hundred forty five B C The trade of Babylon flourished under the Persians and the influence of its culture spread far and wide Persian religion was infused with new doctrines and their deities were given stellar attributes Ahura Mazda became identified with Bel Merodach as perhaps he had previously been with Ashur and the goddess Anahita absorbed the attributes of Nina Ishtar Zerpanitu m and other Babylonian mother deities Another Semiramis came into prominence This was the wife and sister of Cambyses After Cambyses died she married Darius I who like Cyrus claimed to be an Achaemenian He had to overthrow a pretender but submitted to the demands of the orthodox Persian party to purify the Ahura Mazda religion of its Babylonian innovations Frequent revolts in Babylon had afterwards to be suppressed The Merodach priesthood apparently suffered loss of prestige at Court According to Herodotus Darius plotted to carry away from E sagila a great statue of Bel twelve cubits high and entirely of solid gold He however was afraid to lay his hands upon it Xerxes son of Darius four hundred eighty five four hundred sixty five B C punished Babylon for revolting when intelligence reached them of his disasters in Greece by pillaging and partly destroying the temple He killed the priest who forbade him to move the statue and took it away five hundred sixty six The city lost its vassal king and was put under the control of a governor It however regained some of its ancient glory after the burning of Susa palace for the later Persian monarchs resided in it Darius II died at Babylon and Artaxerxes II promoted in the city the worship of Anaitis When Darius III the last Persian emperor was overthrown by Alexander the Great in three hundred thirty one B C Babylon welcomed the Macedonian conqueror as it had welcomed Cyrus Alexander was impressed by the wisdom and accomplishments of the astrologers and priests who had become known as Chaldaeans and added Bel Merodach to his extraordinary pantheon which already included Amon of Egypt Melkarth and Jehovah Impressed by the antiquity and magnificence of Babylon he resolved to make it the capital of his world wide empire and there he received ambassadors from countries as far east as India and as far west as Gaul The canals of Babylonia were surveyed and building operations on a vast scale planned out No fewer than ten thousand men were engaged working for two months reconstructing and decorating the temple of Merodach which towered to a height of six hundred seven feet It looked as if Babylon were about to rise to a position of splendour unequalled in its history when Alexander fell sick after attending a banquet and died on an evening of golden splendour sometime in June of three hundred twenty three B C One can imagine the feelings of the Babylonian priests and astrologers as they spent the last few nights of the emperor s life reading the omens of the air taking note of wind and shadow moon and stars and planets seeking for a sign but unable to discover one favourable Their hopes of Babylonian glory were suspended in the balance and they perished completely when the young emperor passed away in the thirty third year of his life For four days and four nights the citizens mourned in silence for Alexander and for Babylon The ancient city fell into decay under the empire of the Seleucidae Seleucus I had been governor of Babylon and after the break up of Alexander s empire he returned to the ancient metropolis as a conqueror None of the persons who succeeded Alexander Strabo wrote attended to the undertaking at Babylon the reconstruction of Merodach s temple Other works were neglected and the city was dilapidated partly by the Persians and partly by time and through the indifference of the Greeks particularly after Seleucus Nicator fortified Seleukeia on the Tigris five hundred sixty seven Seleucus drafted to the city which bore his name the great bulk of the inhabitants of Babylon The remnant which was left behind continued to worship Merodach and other gods after the walls had crumbled and the great temple began to tumble down Babylon died slowly but at length the words of the Hebrew prophet were fulfilled The cormorant and the bittern shall possess it the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom but none shall be there and all her princes shall be nothing And thorns shall come up in her palaces nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof and it shall be an habitation of dragons and a court for owls The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island and the satyr shall cry to his fellow the screech owl also shall rest there and find for herself a place of rest five hundred sixty eight FOOTNOTES one Life of Apollonius of Tyana i twoO two Egyptian Tales Second Series W M
