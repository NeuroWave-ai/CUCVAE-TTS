ASCII START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK I WILL REPAY Produced by Walter Debeuf Project Gutenberg volunteer I Will Repay By Baroness Orczy PROLOGUE I Paris seventeen eighty three Coward Coward Coward The words rang out clear strident passionate in a crescendo of agonised humiliation The boy quivering with rage had sprung to his feet and losing his balance he fell forward clutching at the table whilst with a convulsive movement of the lids he tried in vain to suppress the tears of shame which were blinding him Coward He tried to shout the insult so that all might hear but his parched throat refused him service his trembling hand sought the scattered cards upon the table he collected them together quickly nervously fingering them with feverish energy then he hurled them at the man opposite whilst with a final effort he still contrived to mutter Coward The older men tried to interpose but the young ones only laughed quite prepared for the adventure which must inevitably ensue the only possible ending to a quarrel such as this Conciliation or arbitration was out of the question Deroulede should have known better than to speak disrespectfully of Adele de Montcheri when the little Vicomte de Marny s infatuation for the notorious beauty had been the talk of Paris and Versailles these many months past Adele was very lovely and a veritable tower of greed and egotism The Marnys were rich and the little Vicomte very young and just now the brightly plumaged hawk was busy plucking the latest pigeon newly arrived from its ancestral cote The boy was still in the initial stage of his infatuation To him Adele was a paragon of all the virtues and he would have done battle on her behalf against the entire aristocracy of France in a vain endeavour to justify his own exalted opinion of one of the most dissolute women of the epoch He was a first rate swordsman too and his friends had already learned that it was best to avoid all allusions to Adele s beauty and weaknesses But Deroulede was a noted blunderer He was little versed in the manners and tones of that high society in which somehow he still seemed an intruder But for his great wealth no doubt he never would have been admitted within the intimate circle of aristocratic France His ancestry was somewhat doubtful and his coat of arms unadorned with quarterings But little was known of his family or the origin of its wealth it was only known that his father had suddenly become the late King s dearest friend and commonly surmised that Deroulede gold had on more than one occasion filled the emptied coffers of the First Gentleman of France Deroulede had not sought the present quarrel He had merely blundered in that clumsy way of his which was no doubt a part of the inheritance bequeathed to him by his bourgeois ancestry He knew nothing of the little Vicomte s private affairs still less of his relationship with Adele but he knew enough of the world and enough of Paris to be acquainted with the lady s reputation He hated at all times to speak of women He was not what in those days would be termed a ladies man and was even somewhat unpopular with the sex But in this instance the conversation had drifted in that direction and when Adele s name was mentioned every one became silent save the little Vicomte who waxed enthusiastic A shrug of the shoulders on Deroulede s part had aroused the boy s ire then a few casual words and without further warning the insult had been hurled and the cards thrown in the older man s face Deroulede did not move from his seat He sat erect and placid one knee crossed over the other his serious rather swarthy face perhaps a shade paler than usual otherwise it seemed as if the insult had never reached his ears or the cards struck his cheek He had perceived his blunder just twenty seconds too late Now he was sorry for the boy and angered with himself but it was too late to draw back To avoid a conflict he would at this moment have sacrificed half his fortune but not one particle of his dignity He knew and respected the old Duc de Marny a feeble old man now almost a dotard whose hitherto spotless blason the young Vicomte his son was doing his best to besmirch When the boy fell forward blind and drunk with rage Deroulede leant towards him automatically quite kindly and helped him to his feet He would have asked the lad s pardon for his own thoughtlessness had that been possible but the stilted code of so called honour forbade so logical a proceeding It would have done no good and could but imperil his own reputation without averting the traditional sequel The panelled walls of the celebrated gaming saloon had often witnessed scenes such as this All those present acted by routine The etiquette of duelling prescribed certain formalities and these were strictly but rapidly adhered to The young Vicomte was quickly surrounded by a close circle of friends His great name his wealth his father s influence had opened for him every door in Versailles and Paris At this moment he might have had an army of seconds to support him in the coming conflict Deroulede for a while was left alone near the card table where the unsnuffed candles began smouldering in their sockets He had risen to his feet somewhat bewildered at the rapid turn of events His dark restless eyes wandered for a moment round the room as if in quick search for a friend But where the Vicomte was at home by right Deroulede had only been admitted by reason of his wealth His acquaintances and sycophants were many but his friends very few For the first time this fact was brought home to him Every one in the room must have known and realised that he had not wilfully sought this quarrel that throughout he had borne himself as any gentleman would yet now when the issue was so close at hand no one came forward to stand by him For form s sake monsieur will you choose your seconds It was the young Marquis de Villefranche who spoke a little haughtily with a certain ironical condescension towards the rich parvenu who was about to have the honour of crossing swords with one of the noblest gentlemen in France I pray you Monsieur le Marquis rejoined Deroulede coldly to make the choice for me You see I have few friends in Paris The Marquis bowed and gracefully flourished his lace handkerchief He was accustomed to being appealed to in all matters pertaining to etiquette to the toilet to the latest cut in coats and the procedure in duels Good natured foppish and idle he felt quite happy and in his element thus to be made chief organiser of the tragic farce about to be enacted on the parquet floor of the gaming saloon He looked about the room for a while scrutinising the faces of those around him The gilded youth was crowding round De Marny a few older men stood in a group at the farther end of the room to these the Marquis turned and addressing one of them an elderly man with a military bearing and a shabby brown coat Mon Colonel he said with another flourishing bow I am deputed by M Deroulede to provide him with seconds for this affair of honour may I call upon you to Certainly certainly replied the Colonel I am not intimately acquainted with M Deroulede but since you stand sponsor M le Marquis Oh rejoined the Marquis lightly a mere matter of form you know M Deroulede belongs to the entourage of Her Majesty He is a man of honour But I am not his sponsor Marny is my friend and if you prefer not to Indeed I am entirely at M Deroulede s service said the Colonel who had thrown a quick scrutinising glance at the isolated figure near the card table if he will accept my services He will be very glad to accept my dear Colonel whispered the Marquis with an ironical twist of his aristocratic lips He has no friends in our set and if you and De Quettare will honour him I think he should be grateful M de Quettare adjutant to M le Colonel was ready to follow in the footsteps of his chief and the two men after the prescribed salutations to M le Marquis de Villefranche went across to speak to Deroulede If you will accept our services monsieur began the Colonel abruptly mine and my adjutant s M de Quettare we place ourselves entirely at your disposal I thank you messieurs rejoined Deroulede The whole thing is a farce and that young man is a fool but I have been in the wrong and You would wish to apologise queried the Colonel icily The worthy soldier had heard something of Deroulede s reputed bourgeois ancestry This suggestion of an apology was no doubt in accordance with the customs of the middle classes but the Colonel literally gasped at the unworthiness of the proceeding An apology Bah Disgusting cowardly beneath the dignity of any gentleman however wrong he might be How could two soldiers of His Majesty s army identify themselves with such doings But Deroulede seemed unconscious of the enormity of his suggestion If I could avoid a conflict he said I would tell the Vicomte that I had no knowledge of his admiration for the lady we were discussing and Are you so very much afraid of getting a sword scratch monsieur interrupted the Colonel impatiently whilst M de Quettare elevated a pair of aristocratic eyebrows in bewilderment at such an extraordinary display of bourgeois cowardice You mean Monsieur le Colonel queried Deroulede That you must either fight the Vicomte de Marny to night or clear out of Paris to morrow Your position in our set would become untenable retorted the Colonel not unkindly for in spite of Deroulede s extraordinary attitude there was nothing in his bearing or his appearance that suggested cowardice or fear I bow to your superior knowledge of your friends M le Colonel responded Deroulede as he silently drew his sword from its sheath The centre of the saloon was quickly cleared The seconds measured the length of the swords and then stood behind the antagonists slightly in advance of the groups of spectators who stood massed all round the room They represented the flower of what France had of the best and noblest in name in lineage in chivalry in that year of grace seventeen eighty three The storm cloud which a few years hence was destined to break over their heads sweeping them from their palaces to the prison and the guillotine was only gathering very slowly in the dim horizon of squalid starving Paris for the next half dozen years they would still dance and gamble fight and flirt surround a tottering throne and hoodwink a weak monarch The Fates avenging sword still rested in its sheath the relentless ceaseless wheel still bore them up in their whirl of pleasure the downward movement had only just begun the cry of the oppressed children of France had not yet been heard above the din of dance music and lovers serenades The young Duc de Chateaudun was there he who nine years later went to the guillotine on that cold September morning his hair dressed in the latest fashion the finest Mechlin lace around his wrists playing a final game of piquet with his younger brother as the tumbril bore them along through the hooting yelling crowd of the half naked starvelings of Paris There was the Vicomte de Mirepoix who a few years later standing on the platform of the guillotine laid a bet with M de Miranges that his own blood would flow bluer than that of any other head cut off that day in France Citizen Samson heard the bet made and when De Mirepoix s head fell into the basket the headsman lifted it up for M de Miranges to see The latter laughed Mirepoix was always a braggart he said lightly as he laid his head upon the block Who ll take my bet that my blood turns out to be bluer than his But of all these comedies these tragico farces of later years none who were present on that night when the Vicomte de Marny fought Paul Deroulede had as yet any presentiment They watched the two men fighting with the same casual interest at first which they would have bestowed on the dancing of a new movement in the minuet De Marny came of a race that had wielded the sword of many centuries but he was hot excited not a little addled with wine and rage Deroulede was lucky he would come out of the affair with a slight scratch A good swordsman too that wealthy parvenu It was interesting to watch his sword play very quiet at first no feint or parry scarcely a riposte only en garde always en garde very carefully steadily ready for his antagonist at every turn and in every circumstance Gradually the circle round the combatants narrowed A few discreet exclamations of admiration greeted Deroulede s most successful parry De Marny was getting more and more excited the older man more and more sober and reserved A thoughtless lunge placed the little Vicomte at his opponent s mercy The next instant he was disarmed and the seconds were pressing forward to end the conflict Honour was satisfied the parvenu and the scion of the ancient race had crossed swords over the reputation of one of the most dissolute women in France Deroulede s moderation was a lesson to all the hot headed young bloods who toyed with their lives their honour their reputation as lightly as they did with their lace edged handkerchiefs and gold snuff boxes Already Deroulede had drawn back With the gentle tact peculiar to kindly people he avoided looking at his disarmed antagonist But something in the older man s attitude seemed to further nettle the over stimulated sensibility of the young Vicomte This is no child s play monsieur he said excitedly I demand full satisfaction And are you not satisfied queried Deroulede You have borne yourself bravely you have fought in honour of your liege lady I on the other hand You shouted the boy hoarsely you shall publicly apologise to a noble and virtuous woman whom you have outraged now at once on your knees You are mad Vicomte rejoined Deroulede coldly I am willing to ask your forgiveness for my blunder An apology in public on your knees The boy had become more and more excited He had suffered humiliation after humiliation He was a mere lad spoilt adulated pampered from his boyhood the wine had got into his head the intoxication of rage and hatred blinded his saner judgment Coward he shouted again and again His seconds tried to interpose but he waved them feverishly aside He would listen to no one He saw no one save the man who had insulted Adele and who was heaping further insults upon her by refusing this public acknowledgment of her virtues De Marny hated Deroulede at this moment with the most deadly hatred the heart of man can conceive The older man s calm his chivalry his consideration only enhanced the boy s anger and shame The hubbub had become general Everyone seemed carried away with this strange fever of enmity which was seething in the Vicomte s veins Most of the young men crowded round De Marny doing their best to pacify him The Marquis de Villefranche declared that the matter was getting quite outside the rules No one took much notice of Deroulede In the remote corners of the saloon a few elderly dandies were laying bets as to the ultimate issue of the quarrel Deroulede however was beginning to lose his temper He had no friends in that room and therefore there was no sympathetic observer there to note the gradual darkening of his eyes like the gathering of a cloud heavy with the coming storm I pray you messieurs let us cease the argument he said at last in a loud impatient voice M le Vicomte de Marny desires a further lesson and by God he shall have it En garde M le Vicomte The crowd quickly drew back The seconds once more assumed the bearing and imperturbable expression which their important function demanded The hubbub ceased as the swords began to clash Everyone felt that farce was turning to tragedy And yet it was obvious from the first that Deroulede merely meant once more to disarm his antagonist to give him one more lesson a little more severe perhaps than the last He was such a brillant swordsman and De Marny was so excited that the advantage was with him from the very first How it all happened nobody afterwards could say There is no doubt that the little Vicomte s sword play had become more and more wild that he uncovered himself in the most reckless way whilst lunging wildly at his opponent s breast until at last in one of these mad unguarded moments he seemed literally to throw himself upon Deroulede s weapon The latter tried with lightning swift motion of the wrist to avoid the fatal issue but it was too late and without a sigh or groan scarce a tremor the Vicomte de Marny fell The sword dropped out of his hand and it was Deroulede himself who caught the boy in his arms It had all occurred so quickly and suddenly that no one had realised it all until it was over and the lad was lying prone on the ground his elegant blue satin coat stained with red and his antagonist bending over him There was nothing more to be done Etiquette demanded that Deroulede should withdraw He was not allowed to do anything for the boy whom he had so unwillingly sent to his death As before no one took much notice of him Silence the awesome silence caused by the presence of the great Master fell upon all those around Only in the far corner a shrill voice was heard to say I hold you at five hundred louis Marquis The parvenu is a good swordsman The groups parted as Deroulede walked out of the room followed by the Colonel and M de Quettare who stood by him to the last Both were old and proved soldiers both had chivalry and courage in them with which to do tribute to the brave man whom they had seconded At the door of the establishment they met the leech who had been summoned some little time ago to hold himself in readiness for any eventuality The great eventuality had occurred it was beyond the leech s learning In the brilliantly lighted saloon above the only son of the Duc de Marny was breathing his last whilst Deroulede wrapping his mantle closely round him strode out into the dark street all alone II The head of the house of Marny was at this time barely seventy years of age But he had lived every hour every minute of his life from the day when the Grand Monarque gave him his first appointment as gentleman page in waiting when he was a mere lad barely twelve years of age to the moment some ten years ago now when Nature s relentless hand struck him down in the midst of his pleasures withered him in a flash as she does a sturdy old oak and nailed him a cripple almost a dotard to the invalid chair which he would only quit for his last resting place

none	none	was then a mere slip of a girl an old man s child the spoilt darling of his last happy years She had retained some of the melancholy which had characterised her mother the gentle lady who had endured so much so patiently and who had bequeathed this final tender burden her baby girl to the brillant handsome husband whom she had so deeply loved and so often forgiven When the Duc de Marny entered the final awesome stage of his gilded career that deathlike life which he dragged on for ten years wearily to the grave Juliette became his only joy his one gleam of happiness in the midst of torturing memories In her deep tender eyes he would see mirrored the present the future for her and would forget his past with all its gaieties its mad merry years that meant nothing now but bitter regrets and endless rosary of the might have beens And then there was the boy The little Vicomte the future Duc de Marny who would in his life and with his youth recreate the glory of the family and make France once more ring with the echo of brave deeds and gallant adventures which had made the name of Marny so glorious in camp and court The Vicomte was not his father s love but he was his father s pride and from the depths of his huge cushioned arm chair the old man would listen with delight to stories from Versailles and Paris the young Queen and the fascinating Lamballe the latest play and the newest star in the theatrical firmament His feeble tottering mind would then take him back along the paths of memory to his own youth and his own triumphs and in the joy and pride in his son he would forget himself for the sake of the boy When they brought the Vicomte home that night Juliette was the first to wake She heard the noise outside the great gates the coach slowly drawing up the ring for the doorkeeper and the sound of Matthieu s mutterings who never liked to be called up in the middle of the night to let anyone through the gates Somehow a presentiment of evil at once struck the young girl the footsteps sounded so heavy and muffled along the flagged courtyard and up the great oak staircase It seemed as if they were carrying something heavy something inert or dead She jumped out of bed and hastily wrapped a cloak round her thin girlish shoulders and slipped her feet into a pair of heelless shoes then she opened her bedroom door and looked out upon the landing Two men whom she did not know were walking upstairs abreast two more were carrying a heavy burden and Matthieu was behind moaning and crying bitterly Juliette did not move She stood in the doorway rigid as a statue The little cortege went past her No one saw her for the landings in the Hotel de Marny are very wide and Matthieu s lantern only threw a dim flickering light upon the floor The men stopped outside the Vicomte s room Matthieu opened it and then the five men disappeared within with their heavy burden A moment later old Petronelle who had been Juliette s nurse and was now her devoted slave came to her all bathed in tears She had just heard the news and she could scarcely speak but she folded the young girl her dear pet lamb in her arms and rocking herself to and fro she sobbed and eased her aching motherly heart But Juliette did not cry It was all so sudden so awful She at fourteen years of age had never dreamed of death and now there was her brother her Philippe in whom she had so much joy so much pride he was dead and her father must be told The awfulness of this task seemed to Juliette like unto the last Judgment Day a thing so terrible so appalling so impossible that it would take a host of angels to proclaim its inevitableness The old cripple with one foot in the grave whose whole feeble mind whose pride whose final flicker of hope was concentrated in his boy must be told that the lad had been brought home dead Will you

to holy communion yesterday replied the child It was the Fete Dieu you know Then you are in a state of grace my child I was yesterday morning father replied the young girl naively but I have committed some little sins since then Then make your confession to God in your heart now You must be in a state of grace when you speak the oath The child closed her eyes and as the old man watched her he could see the lips framing the words of her spiritual confession Juliette made the sign of the cross then opened her eyes and looked at her father I am ready father she said I hope God has forgiven me the little sins of yesterday Will you swear my child What father That you will avenge your brother s death on his murderer But father Swear it my child How can I fulfil that oath father I don t understand God will guide you my child When you are older you will understand For a moment Juliette still hesitated She was just on that borderland between childhood and womanhood when all the sensibilities the nervous system the emotions are strung to their highest pitch Throughout her short life she had worshipped her father with a whole hearted passionate devotion which had completely blinded her to his weakening faculties and the feebleness of his mind She was also in that initial stage of enthusiastic piety which overwhelms every girl of temperament if she be brought up in the Roman Catholic religion when she is first initiated into the mysteries of the Sacraments Juliette had been to confession and communion She had been confirmed by Monseigneur the Archbishop Her ardent nature had responded to the full to the sensuous and ecstatic expressions of the ancient faith And somehow her father s wish her brother s death all seemed mingled in her brain with that religion for which in her juvenile enthusiasm she would willingly have laid down her life She thought of all the saints whose lives she had been reading Her young heart quivered at the thought of their sacrifices their martyrdoms their sense of duty An exaltation morbid perhaps superstitious and overwhelming took possession of her mind also perhaps far back in the innermost recesses of her heart a pride in her own importance her mission in life her individuality for she was a girl after all a mere child about to become a woman But the old Duc was waxing impatient Surely you do not hesitate Juliette with your dead brother s body clamouring mutely for revenge You the only Marny left now for from this day I too shall be as dead No father said the young girl in an awed whisper I do not hesitate I will swear just as you bid me Repeat the words after me my child Yes father Before the face of Almighty God who sees and hears me Before the face of Almighty God who sees and hears me repeated Juliette firmly I swear that I will seek out Paul Deroulede I swear that I will seek out Paul Deroulede And in any manner which God may dictate to me encompass his death his ruin or dishonour in revenge for my brother s death And in any manner which God may dictate to me encompass his death his ruin or dishonour in revenge for my brother s death said Juliette solemnly May my brother s soul remain in torment until the final Judgment Day if I should break my oath but may it rest in eternal peace the day on which his death is fitly avenged May my brother s soul remain in torment until the final Judgment Day if I should break my oath but may it rest in eternal peace the day on which his death is fitly avenged The child fell upon her knees The oath was spoken the old man was satisfied He called for his valet and allowed himself quietly to be put to bed One brief hour had transformed a child into a woman A dangerous transformation when the brain is overburdened with emotions when the nerves are overstrung and the heart full to breaking For the moment however the childlike nature reasserted itself for the last time for Juliette sobbing had fled out of the room to the privacy of her own apartment and thrown herself passionately into the arms of kind old Petronelle CHAPTER I Paris seventeen ninety three The outrage It would have been very difficult to say why Citizen Deroulede was quite so popular as he was Still more difficult would it have been to state the reason why he remained immune from the prosecutions which were being conducted at the rate of several scores a day now against the moderate Gironde anon against the fanatic Mountain until the whole of France was transformed into one gigantic prison that daily fed the guillotine But Deroulede remained unscathed Even Merlin s law of the suspect had so far failed to touch him And when last July the murder of Marat brought an entire holocaust of victims to the guillotine from Adam Lux who would have put up a statue in honour of Charlotte Corday with the inscription

none	none	Revolution The forty four thousand sections of the Committee of Public Safety sent their quota each in their turn to the guillotine At one time these tumbrils contained royal ladies and gentlemen ci devant dukes and princesses aristocrats from every county in France but now this stock was becoming exhausted The wretched Queen Marie Antoinette still lingered in the Temple with her son and daughter Madame Elisabeth was still allowed to say her prayers in peace but ci devant dukes and counts were getting scarce those who had not perished at the hand of Citizen Samson were plying some trade in Germany or England There were aristocratic joiners innkeepers and hairdressers The proudest names in France were hidden beneath trade signs in London and Hamburg A good number owed their lives to that mysterious Scarlet Pimpernel that unknown Englishman who had snatched scores of victims from the clutches of Tinville the Prosecutor and sent M Chauvelin baffled back to France Aristocrats were getting scarce so it was now the turn of deputies of the National Convention of men of letters men of science or of art men who had sent others to the guillotine a twelvemonth ago and men who had been loudest in defence of anarchy and its Reign of Terror They had revolutionised the Calendar the Citizen Deputies and every good citizen of France called this nineteenth day of August seventeen ninety three the second Fructidor of the year I of the New Era At six o clock on that afternoon a young girl suddenly turned the angle of the Rue Ecole de Medecine and after looking quickly to the right and left she began deliberately walking along the narrow street It was crowded just then Groups of excited women stood jabbering before every doorway It was the home coming hour after the usual spectacle on the Place de la Revolution The men had paused at the various drinking booths crowding the women out It would be the turn of these Amazons next at the brandy bars for the moment they were left to gossip and to jeer at the passer by At first the young girl did not seem to heed them She walked quickly along looking defiantly before her carrying her head erect and stepping carefully from cobblestone to cobblestone avoiding the mud which could have dirtied her dainty shoes The harridans passed the time of day to her and the time of day meant some obscene remark unfit for women s ears The young girl wore a simple grey dress with fine lawn kerchief neatly folded across her bosom a large hat with flowing ribbons sat above the fairest face that ever gladdened men s eyes to see Fairer still it would have been but for the look of determination which made it seem hard and old for the girl s years She wore the tricolour scarf round her waist else she had been more seriously molested ere now But the Republican colours were her safeguard whilst she walked quietly along no one could harm her Then suddenly a curious impulse seemed to seize her It was just outside the large stone house belonging to

none	none	Deroulede She had so far taken no notice of the groups of women which she had come across When they obstructed the footway she had calmly stepped out into the middle of the road It was wise and prudent for she could close her ears to obscene language and need pay no heed to insult Suddenly she threw up her head defiantly Will you please let me pass she said loudly as a dishevelled Amazon stood before her with arms akimbo glancing sarcastically at the lace petticoat which just peeped beneath the young girl s simple grey frock Let her pass Let her pass Ho ho ho laughed the old woman turning to the nearest group of idlers and apostrophising them with a loud oath Did you know citizeness that this street had been specially made for aristos to pass along I am in a hurry will you let me pass at once commanded the young girl tapping her foot impatiently on the ground There was the whole width of the street on her right plenty of room for her to walk along It seemed positive madness to provoke a quarrel singlehanded against this noisy group of excited females just home from the ghastly spectacle around the guillotine And yet she seemed to do it wilfully as if coming to the end of her patience all her proud aristocratic blood in revolt against this evil smelling crowd which surrounded her Half tipsy men and noisome naked urchins seemed to have sprung from everywhere Oho quelle aristo they shouted with ironical astonishment gazing at the young girl s face fingering her gown thrusting begrimed hate distorted faces close to her own Instinctively she recoiled and backed towards the house immediately on her left It was adorned with a porch made of stout oak beams with a tiled roof an iron lantern descended from this and there was a stone parapet below and a few steps at right angles from the pavement led up to the massive door On these steps the young girl had taken refuge Proud defiant she confronted the howling mob which she had so wilfully provoked Of a truth Citizeness Margot that grey dress would become you well suggested a young man whose red cap hung in tatters over an evil and dissolute looking face And all that fine lace would make a splendid jabot round the aristo s neck when Citizen Samson holds up her head for us to see added another as with mock elegance he stooped and with two very grimy fingers slightly raised the young girl s grey frock displaying the lace edged petticoat beneath A volley of oaths and loud ironical laughter greeted this sally Tis mighty fine lace to be thus hidden away commented an elderly harridan Now would you believe it my fine madam but my legs are bare underneath my kirtle And dirty too I ll lay a wager laughed another Soap is dear in Paris just now The lace on the aristo s kerchief would pay the baker s bill of a whole family for a month shouted an excited voice Heat and brandy further addled the brains of this group of French citizens hatred gleamed out of every eye Outrage was imminent The young girl seemed to know it but she remained defiant and self possessed gradually stepping back and back up the steps closely followed by her assailants To the Jew with the gewgaw then shouted a thin haggard female viciously as she suddenly clutched at the young girl s kerchief and with a mocking triumphant laugh tore it from her bosom This outrage seemed to be the signal for the breaking down of the final barriers which ordinary decency should have raised The language and vituperation became such as no chronicler could record The girl s dainty white neck her clear skin the refined contour of shoulders and bust seemed to have aroused the deadliest lust of hate in these wretched creatures rendered bestial by famine and squalor It seemed almost as if one would vie with the other in seeking for words which would most offend these small aristocratic ears The young girl was now crouching against the doorway her hands held up to her ears to shut out the awful sounds She did not seem frightened only appalled at the terrible volcano which she had provoked Suddenly a miserable harridan struck her straight in the face with hard grimy fist and a long shout of exultation greeted this monstrous deed Then only did the girl seem to lose her self control A moi she shouted loudly whilst hammering with both hands against the massive doorway A moi Murder Murder Citoyen Deroulede a moi But her terror was greeted with renewed glee by her assailants They were now roused to the highest point of frenzy the crowd of brutes would in the next moment have torn the helpless girl from her place of refuge and dragged her into the mire an outraged prey for the satisfaction of an ungovernable hate But just as half a dozen pairs of talon like hands clutched frantically at her skirts the door behind her was quickly opened She felt her arm seized firmly and herself dragged swiftly within the shelter of the threshold Her senses overwrought by the terrible adventure which she had just gone through were threatening to reel she heard the massive door close shutting out the yells of baffled rage the ironical laughter the obscene words which sounded in her ears like the shrieks of Dante s damned She could not see her rescuer for the hall into which he had hastily dragged her was only dimly lighted But a peremptory voice said quickly Up the stairs the room straight in front of you my mother is there Go quickly She had fallen on her knees cowering against the heavy oak beam which supported the ceiling and was straining her eyes to catch sight of the man to whom at this moment she perhaps owed more than her life but he was standing against the doorway with his hand on the latch What are you going to do she murmured Prevent their breaking into my house in order to drag you out of it he replied quietly so I pray you do as I bid you Mechanically she obeyed him drew herself to her feet and turning towards the stairs began slowly to mount the shallow steps Her knees were shaking under her her whole body was trembling with horror at the awesome crisis she had just traversed She dared not look back at her rescuer Her head was bent and her lips were murmuring half audible words as she went Outside the hooting and yelling was becoming louder and louder Enraged fists were hammering violently against the stout oak door At the top of the stairs moved by an irresistible impulse she turned and looked into the hall She saw his figure dimly outlined in the gloom one hand on the latch his head thrown back to watch her movements A door stood ajar immediately in front of her She pushed it open and went within At that moment he too opened the door below The shrieks of the howling mob once more resounded close to her ears It seemed as if they had surrounded him She wondered what was happening and marvelled how he dared to face that awful crowd alone The room into which she had entered was gay and cheerful looking with its dainty chintz hangings and graceful elegant pieces of furniture The young girl looked up as a kindly voice said to her from out the depths of a capacious armchair Come in come in my dear and close the door behind you Did those wretches attack you Never mind Paul will speak to them Come here my dear and sit down there s no cause now for fear Without a word the young girl came forward She seemed now to be walking in a dream the chintz hangings to be swaying ghostlike around her the yells and shrieks below to come from the very bowels of the earth The old lady continued to prattle on She had taken the girl s hand in hers and was gently forcing her down on to a low stool beside her armchair She was talking about Paul and said something about Anne Mie and then about the National Convention and those beasts and savages but mostly about Paul The noise outside had subsided The girl felt strangely sick and tired Her head seemed to be whirling round the furniture to be dancing round her the old lady s face looked at her through a swaying veil and then and then Tired Nature was having her way at last she folded the quivering young body in her motherly arms and wrapped the aching senses beneath her merciful mantle of unconsciousness CHAPTER II Citizen Deputy When presently the young girl awoke with a delicious feeling of rest and well being she had plenty of leisure to think So then this was his house She was actually a guest a rescued protege beneath the roof of Citoyen Deroulede He had dragged her from the clutches of the howling mob which she had provoked his mother had made her welcome a sweet faced young girl scarce out of her teens sad eyed and slightly deformed had waited upon her and made her happy and comfortable Juliette de Marny was in the house of the man whom she had sworn before her God and before her father to pursue with hatred and revenge Ten years had gone by since then Lying upon the sweet scented bed which the hospitality of the Derouledes had provided for her she seemed to see passing before her the spectres of these past ten years the first four after her brother s death until the old Duc de Marny s body slowly followed his soul to its grave 
3551_7884_000009_000000	train-clean-360	After that last glimmer of life beside the deathbed of his son the old Duc had practically ceased to be 
none	none	A mute shrunken figure he merely existed his mind vanished his memory gone a wreck whom Nature fortunately remembered at last and finally took away from the invalid chair which had been his world Then came those few years at the Convent of the Ursulines Juliette had hoped that she had a vocation her whole soul yearned for a secluded a religious life for great barriers of solemn vows and days spent in prayer and contemplation to interpose between herself and the memory of that awful night when obedient to her father s will she had made the solemn oath to avenge her brother s death She was only eighteen when she first entered the convent directly after her father s death when she felt very lonely both morally and mentally lonely and followed by the obsession of that oath She never spoke of it to anyone except to her confessor and he a simple minded man of great learning and a total lack of knowledge of the world was completely at a loss how to advise 
3551_7884_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The Archbishop was consulted 
none	none	He could grant a dispensation and release her of that most solemn vow When first this idea was suggested to her Juliette was exultant Her entire nature which in itself was wholesome light hearted the very reverse of morbid rebelled against this unnatural task placed upon her young shoulders It was only religion the strange warped religion of that extraordinary age which kept her to it which forbade her breaking lightly that most unnatural oath The Archbishop was a man of many duties many engagements He agreed to give this strange cas de conscience his most earnest attention 
3551_7884_000015_000002	train-clean-360	He would make no promises 
none	none	But Mademoiselle de Marny was rich a munificent donation to the poor of Paris or to some cause dear to the Holy Father himself might perhaps be more acceptable to God than the fulfilment of a compulsory vow Juliette within the convent walls was waiting patiently for the Archbishop s decision at the very moment when the greatest upheaval the world has ever known was beginning to shake the very foundations of France The Archbishop had other things now to think about than isolated cases of conscience He forgot all about Juliette probably 
3551_7884_000017_000002	train-clean-360	He was busy consoling a monarch for the loss of his throne and preparing himself and his royal patron for the scaffold

3551_7884_000020_000002	train-clean-360	When he died she looked upon her spiritual guide s death as a direct warning from God that nothing could relieve her of her oath

3551_7884_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Two years later she had heard the cries of an entire people exulting over a regicide

3551_7884_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Juliette followed the trial of Charlotte Corday with all the passionate ardour of her exalted temperament 
none	none	Just think what an effect it must have had upon the mind of this young girl who for nine years the best of her life had also lived with the idea of a sublime mission pervading her very soul She watched Charlotte Corday at her trial Conquering her natural repulsion for such scenes and the crowds which usually watched them she had forced her way into the foremost rank of the narrow gallery which overlooked the Hall of the Revolutionary Tribunal She heard the indictment heard Tinville s speech and the calling of the witnesses All this is unnecessary
3551_7884_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I killed Marat

3551_7884_000041_000000	train-clean-360	But there was no further comment 
none	none	A huge magnificently equipped hospital for sick children had been thrown open in Paris that very morning a gift to the nation from Citoyen Deroulede Surely he was privileged to talk a little if it pleased him 
3551_7884_000041_000003	train-clean-360	His hospital would cover quite a good many defalcations

3551_7884_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Juliette heard it all 
3551_7884_000043_000001	train-clean-360	The knitters round her were talking loudly 
none	none	Even Charlotte was almost forgotten whilst Deroulede talked He had a fine voice of strong calibre which echoed powerfully through the hall He was rather short but broad shouldered and well knit with an expressive hand which looked slender and delicate below the fine lace ruffle 
3551_7884_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Charlotte Corday was condemned

3551_7884_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Juliette left the court in a state of mad exultation 
none	none	She was very young the scenes she had witnessed in the past two years could not help but excite the imagination of a young girl left entirely to her own intellectual and moral resources

3551_7884_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Juliette felt impelled by duty and duty at best is not so prompt a counsellor as love or hate 
3551_7884_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Her adventure outside Deroulede s house had not been premeditated Impulse and coincidence had worked their will with her 
none	none	She had been in the habit daily for the past month of wandering down the Rue Ecole de Medecine ostensibly to gaze at Marat s dwelling as crowds of idlers were wont to do but really in order to look at Deroulede s house 
3551_7884_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Once or twice she saw him coming or going from home Once she caught sight of the inner hall and of a young girl in a dark kirtle and snow white kerchief bidding him good bye at his door 
3551_7884_000051_000002	train-clean-360	Another time she caught sight of him at the corner of the street helping that same young girl over the muddy pavement

3551_7884_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Chivalrous eh and innately so evidently for the girl was slightly deformed hardly a hunchback but weak and unattractive looking with melancholy eyes and a pale pinched face 
none	none	It was the thought of that little act of simple chivalry witnessed the day before which caused Juliette to provoke the scene which but for Deroulede s timely interference might have ended so fatally But she reckoned on that interference the whole thing had occurred to her suddenly and she had carried it through Had not her father said to her that when the time came God would show her a means to the end And now she was inside the house of the man who had murdered her brother and sent her sorrowing father a poor senseless maniac tottering to the grave Would God s finger point again and show her what to to next how best to accomplish what she had sworn to do CHAPTER III Hospitality Is there anything more I can do for you now mademoiselle The gentle timid voice roused Juliette from the contemplation of the past She smiled at Anne Mie and held her hand out towards her You have all been so kind she said I want to get up now and thank you all Don t move unless you feel quite well I am quite well now Those horrid people frightened me so that is why I fainted They would have half killed you if Will you tell me where I am asked Juliette In the house of M Paul Deroulede I should have said of Citizen Deputy Deroulede He rescued you from the mob and pacified them He has such a beautiful voice that he can make anyone listen to him and And you are fond of him mademoiselle added Juliette suddenly feeling a mist of tears rising to her eyes Of course I am fond of him rejoined the other girl simply whilst a look of the most tender hearted devotion seemed to beautify her pale face He and Madame Deroulede have brought me up I never knew my parents They have cared for me and he has taught me all I know What do they call you mademoiselle My name is Anne Mie And mine Juliette Juliette Marny she added after a slight hesitation I have no parents either My old nurse Petronelle has brought me up and But tell me more about M Deroulede I owe him so much I d like to know him better Will you not let me arrange your hair said Anne Mie as if purposely evading a direct reply M Deroulede is in the salon with madame You can see him then Juliette asked no more questions but allowed Anne Mie to tidy her hair for her to lend her a fresh kerchief and generally to efface all traces of her terrible adventure She felt puzzled and tearful Anne Mie s gentleness seemed somehow to jar on her spirits She could not understand the girl s position in the Deroulede household Was she a relative or a superior servant In these troublous times she might easily have been both In any case she was a childhood s companion of the Citizen Deputy whether on an equal or a humbler footing Juliette would have given much to ascertain With the marvellous instinct peculiar to women of temperament she had already divined Anne Mie s love for Deroulede The poor young cripple s very soul seemed to quiver magnetically at the bare mention of his name her whole face became transfigured Juliette even thought her beautiful then She looked at herself critically in the glass and adjusted a curl which looked its best when it was rebellious She scrutinised her own face carefully why she could not tell another of those subtle feminine instincts perhaps The becoming simplicity of the prevailing mode suited her to perfection The waist line rather high but clearly defined a precursor of the later more accentuated fashion gave grace to her long slender limbs and emphasised the lissomeness of her figure The kerchief edged with fine lace and neatly folded across her bosom softened the contour of her girlish bust and shoulders And her hair was a veritable glory round her dainty piquant face Soft fair and curly it emerged in a golden halo from beneath the prettiest little lace cap imaginable She turned and faced Anne Mie ready to follow her out of the room and the young crippled girl sighed as she smoothed down the folds of her own apron and gave a final touch to the completion of Juliette s attire The time before the evening meal slipped by like a dream hour for Juliette She had lived so much alone had led such an introspective life that she had hardly realised and understood all that was going on around her At the time when the inner vitality of France first asserted itself and then swept away all that hindered its mad progress she was tied to the invalid chair of her half demented father then after that the sheltering walls of the Ursuline Convent had hidden from her mental vision the true meaning of the great conflict between the Old Era and the New Deroulede was neither a pedant nor yet a revolutionary his theories were Utopian and he had an extraordinary overpowering sympathy for his fellow men After the first casual greetings with Juliette he had continued a discussion with his mother which the young girl s entrance had interrupted He seemed to take but little notice of her although at times his dark keen eyes would seek hers as if challenging her for a reply He was talking of the mob of Paris whom he evidently understood so well Incidents such as the one which Juliette had provoked had led to rape and theft often to murder before now but outside Citizen Deputy Deroulede s house everything was quiet half an hour after Juliette s escape from that howling brutish crowd He had merely spoken to them for about twenty minutes and they had gone away quite quietly without even touching one hair of his head He seemed to love them to know how to separate the little good that was in them from that hard crust of evil which misery had put around their hearts Once he addressed Juliette somewhat abruptly Pardon me mademoiselle but for your own sake we must guard you a prisoner here awhile No one would harm you under this roof but it would not be safe for you to cross the neighbouring streets to night But I must go monsieur Indeed indeed I must she said earnestly I am deeply grateful to you but I could not leave Petronelle Who is Petronelle My dear old nurse monsieur She has never left me Think how anxious and miserable she must be at my prolonged absence Where does she live At No fifteen Rue Taitbout but Will you allow me to take her a message telling her that you are safe and under my roof where it is obviously more prudent that you should remain at present If you think it best monsieur she replied Inwardly she was trembling with excitement God had not only brought her to this house but willed that she should stay in it In whose name shall I take the message mademoiselle he asked My name is Juliette Marny She watched him keenly as she said it but there was not the slightest sign in his expressive face to show that he had recognised the name Ten years is a long time and every one had lived through so much during those years A wave of intense wrath swept through Juliette s soul as she realised that he had forgotten The name meant nothing to him It did not recall to him the fact that his hand was stained with blood During ten years she had suffered she had fought with herself fought for him as it were against the Fate which she was destined to mete out to him whilst he had forgotten or at least had ceased to think He bowed to her and went out of the room The wave of wrath subsided and she was left alone with Madame Deroulede presently Anne Mie came in The three women chatted together waiting for the return of the master of the house Juliette felt well and in spite of herself almost happy She had lived so long in the miserable little attic alone with Petronelle that she enjoyed the well being of this refined home It was not so grand or gorgeous of course as her father s princely palace opposite the Louvre a wreck now since it was annexed by the Committee of National Defence for the housing of soldiery But the Derouledes home was essentially a refined one The delicate china on the tall chimney piece the few bits of Buhl and Vernis Martin about the room the vision through the open doorway of the supper table spread with a fine white cloth and sparkling with silver all spoke of fastidious tastes of habits of luxury and elegance which the spirit of Equality and Anarchy had not succeeded in eradicating When Deroulede came back he brought an atmosphere of breezy cheerfulness with him The street was quiet now and when walking past the hospital his own gift to the Nation he had been loudly cheered One or two ironical voices had asked him what he had done with the aristo and her lace furbelows but it remained at that and Mademoiselle Marny need have no fear He had brought Petronelle along with him his careless lavish hospitality would have suggested the housing of Juliette s entire domestic establishment had she possessed one As it was the worthy old soul s deluge of happy tears had melted his kindly heart He offered her and her young mistress shelter until the small cloud should have rolled by After that he suggested a journey to England Emigration now was the only real safety and Mademoiselle Marny had unpleasantly drawn on herself the attention of the Paris rabble No doubt within the next few days her name would figure among the suspect She would be safest out of the country and could not do better than place herself under the guidance of that English enthusiast who had helped so many persecuted Frenchmen to escape from the terrors of the Revolution the man who was such a thorn in the flesh of the Committee of Public Safety and who went by the nickname of

none	none	CHAPTER IV The faithful house dog After supper they talked of Charlotte Corday Juliette clung to the vision of that heroine and liked to talk of her She appeared as a justification of her own actions which somehow seemed to require justification She loved to hear Paul Deroulede talk liked to provoke his enthusiasm and to see his stern dark face light up with the inward fire of the enthusiast She had openly avowed herself as the daughter of the Duc de Marny When she actually named her father and her brother killed in duel she saw Deroulede looking long and searchingly at her Evidently he wondered if she knew everything but she returned his gaze fearlessly and frankly and he apparently was satisfied Madame Deroulede seemed to know nothing of the circumstances of that duel Deroulede tried to draw Juliette out to make her speak of her brother She replied to his questions quite openly but there was nothing in what she said suggestive of the fact that she knew who killed her brother She wanted him to know who she was If he feared an enemy in her there was yet time enough for him to close his doors against her But less than a minute later he had renewed his warmest offers of hospitality Until we can arrange for your journey to England he added with a short sigh as if reluctant to part from her To Juliette his attitude seemed one of complete indifference for the wrong he had done to her and to her father feeling that she was an avenging spirit with flaming sword in hand pursuing her brother s murderer like a relentless Nemesis she would have preferred to see him cowed before her even afraid of her though she was only a young and delicate girl She did not understand that in the simplicity of his heart he only wished to make amends The quarrel with the young Vicomte de Marny had been forced upon him the fight had been honourable and fair and on his side fought with every desire to spare the young man He had merely been the instrument of Fate but he felt happy that Fate once more used him as her tool this time to save the sister Whilst Deroulede and Juliette talked together Anne Mie cleared the supper table then came and sat on a low stool at madame s feet She took no part in the conversation but every now and then Juliette felt the girl s melancholy eyes fixed almost reproachfully upon her When Juliette had retired with Petronelle Deroulede took Anne Mie s hand in his You will be kind to my guest Anne Mie won t you She seems very lonely and has gone through a great deal Not more than I have murmured the young girl involuntarily You are not happy Anne Mie I thought Is a wretched deformed creature ever happy she said with sudden vehemence as tears of mortification rushed to her eyes in spite of herself I did not think that you were wretched he replied with some sadness and neither in my eyes nor in my mother s are you in any way deformed Her mood changed at once She clung to him pressing his hand between her own Forgive me I I don t know what s the matter with me to night she said with a nervous little laugh Let me see you asked me to be kind to Mademoiselle Marny did you not He nodded with a smile Of course I ll be kind to her Isn t every one kind to one who is young and beautiful and has great appealing eyes and soft curly hair Ah me how easy is the path in life for some people What do you want me to do Paul Wait on her Be her little maid Soothe her nerves or what I ll do it all though in her eyes I shall remain both wretched and deformed a creature to pity the harmless necessary house dog She paused a moment said Good night to him and turned to go candle in hand looking pathetic and fragile with that ugly contour of shoulder which Deroulede assured her he could not see The candle flickered in the draught illumining the thin pinched face the large melancholy eyes of the faithful house dog Who can watch and bite she said half audibly as she slipped out of the room For I do not trust you my fine madam and there was something about that comedy this afternoon which somehow I don t quite understand CHAPTER V A day in the woods But whilst men and women set to work to make the towns of France hideous with their shrieks and their hootings their mock trials and bloody guillotines they could not quite prevent Nature from working her sweet will with the country June July and August had received new names they were now called Messidor Thermidor and Fructidor but under these new names they continued to pour forth upon the earth the same old fruits the same flowers the same grass in the meadows and leaves upon the trees Messidor brought its quota of wild roses in the hedgerows just as archaic June had done Thermidor covered the barren cornfields with its flaming mantle of scarlet poppies and Fructidor though now called August still tipped the wild sorrel with dots of crimson and laid the first wash of tender colour on the pale cheeks of the ripening peaches And Juliette young girlish feminine and inconsequent had sighed for country and sunshine had longed for a ramble in the woods the music of the birds the sight of the meadows sugared with marguerites She had left the house early accompanied by Petronelle she had been rowed along the river as far as Suresnes They had brought some bread and fresh butter a little wine and fruit in a basket and from here she meant to wander homewards through the woods It was all so peaceful so remote even the noise of shrieking howling Paris did not reach the leafy thickets of Suresnes It almost seemed as if this little old world village had been forgotten by the destroyers of France It had never been a royal residence the woods had never been preserved for royal sport there was no vengeance to be wreaked upon its peaceful glades and sleepy fragrant meadows Juliette spent a happy day she loved the flowers the trees the birds and Petronelle was silent and sympathetic As the afternoon wore on and it was time to go home Juliette turned townwards with a sigh You all know that road through the woods which lies to the north west of Paris so leafy so secluded No large hundred year old trees no fine oaks or antique elms but numberless delicate stems of hazel nut and young ash covered with honeysuckle at this time of year sweet smelling and so peaceful after that awful turmoil of the town Obedient to Madame Deroulede s suggestion Juliette had tied a tricolour scarf round her waist and a Phrygian cap of crimson cloth with the inevitable rosette on one side adorned her curly head She had gathered a huge bouquet of poppies marguerites and blue lupin Nature s tribute to the national colours and as she wandered through the sylvan glades she looked like some quaint dweller of the woods a sprite mayhap with old mother Petronelle trotting behind her like an attendant witch Suddenly she paused for in the near distance she had perceived the sound of footsteps upon the leafy turf and the next moment Paul Deroulede emerged from out the thicket and came rapidly towards her We were so anxious about you at home he said almost by way of an apology My mother became so restless That to quiet her fears you came in search of me she retorted with a gay little laugh the laugh of a young girl scarce a woman as yet who feels that she is good to look at good to talk to who feels her wings for the first time the wings with which to soar into that mad merry elusive and called Romance Ay her wings but her power also that sweet subtle power of the woman the yoke which men love rail at and love again the yoke that enslaves them and gives them the joy of kings How happy the day had been Yet it had been incomplete Petronelle was somewhat dull and Juliette was too young to enjoy long companionship with her own thoughts Now suddenly the day seemed to have become perfect There was someone there to appreciate the charm of the woods the beauty of that blue sky peeping though the tangled foliage of the honeysuckle covered trees There was some one to talk to someone to admire the fresh white frock Juliette had put on that morning But how did you know where to find me she asked with a quaint touch of immature coquetry I didn t know he replied quietly They told me you had gone to Suresness and meant to wander homewards through the woods It frightened me for you will have to go through the north west barrier and Well He smiled and looked earnestly for a moment at the dainty apparition before him Well you know he said gaily that tricolour scarf and the red cap are not quite sufficient as a disguise you look anything but a staunch friend of the people I guessed that your muslin frock would be clean and that there would still be some tell tale lace upon it She laughed again and with delicate fingers lifted her pretty muslin frock displaying a white frou frou of flounces beneath the hem How careless and childish he said almost roughly Would you have me coarse and grimy to be a fitting match for your partisans she retorted His tone of mentor nettled her his attitude seemed to her priggish and dictatorial and as the sun disappearing behind a sudden cloud so her childish merriment quickly gave place to a feeling of unexplainable disappointment I humbly beg your pardon he said quietly And must crave your kind indulgence for my mood but I have been so anxious Why should you be anxious about me She had meant to say this indifferently as if caring little what the reply might be but in her effort to seem indifferent her voice became haughty a reminiscence of the days when she still was the daughter of the Duc de Marny the richest and most high born heiress in France Was that presumptuous he asked with a slight touch of irony in response to her own hauteur It was merely unnecessary she replied I have already laid too many burdens on your shoulders without wishing to add that of anxiety You have laid no burden on me he said quietly save one of gratitude Gratitude What have I done You committed a foolish thoughtless act outside my door and gave me the chance of easing my conscience of a heavy load In what way I had never hoped that the Fates would be so kind as to allow me to render a member of your family a slight service I understand that you saved my life the other day Monsieur Deroulede I know that I am still in peril and that I owe my safety to you Do you also know that your brother owed his death to me She closed her lips firmly unable to reply wrathful with him for having suddenly and without any warning placed a clumsy hand upon that hidden sore I always meant to tell you he continued somewhat hurriedly for it almost seemed to me that I have been cheating you these last few days I don t suppose that you can quite realise what it means to me to tell you this just now but I owe it to you I think In later years you might find out and then regret the days you spent under my roof I called you childish a moment ago you must forgive me I know that you are a woman and hope therefore that you will understand me I killed your brother in fair fight He provoked me as no man was ever provoked before Is it necessary M Deroulede that you should tell me all this she interrupted him with some impatience I thought you ought to know You must know on the other hand that I have no means of hearing the history of the quarrel from my brother s point of view now The moment the words were out of her lips she had realised how cruelly she had spoken He did not reply he was too chivalrous too gentle to reproach her Perhaps he understood for the first time how bitterly she had felt her brother s death and how deeply she must be suffering now that she knew herself to be face to face with his murderer She stole a quick glance at him through her tears She was deeply penitent for what she had said It almost seemed to her as if a dual nature was at war within her The mention of her brother s name the recollection of that awful night beside his dead body of those four years whilst she watched her father s moribund reason slowly wandering towards the grave seemed to rouse in her a spirit of rebellion and of evil which she felt was not entirely of herself The woods had become quite silent It was late afternoon and they had gradually wandered farther and farther away from pretty sylvan Suresness towards great anarchic deathdealing Paris In this part of the woods the birds had left their homes the trees shorn of their lower branches looked like gaunt spectres raising melancholy heads towards the relentless silent sky In the distance from behind the barriers a couple of miles away the boom of a gun was heard They are closing the barriers he said quietly after a long pause I am glad I was fortunate enough to meet you It was kind of you to seek for me she said meekly I didn t mean what I said just now I pray you say no more about it I can so well understand I only wish It would be best I should leave your house she said gently I have so ill repaid your hospitality Petronelle and I can easily go back to our lodgings You would break my mother s heart if you left her now he said almost roughly She has become very fond of you and knows just as well as I do the dangers that would beset you outside my house My coarse and grimy partisans he added with a bitter touch of sarcasm have that advantage that they are loyal to me and would not harm you while under my roof But you she murmured She felt somehow that she had wounded him very deeply and was half angry with herself for her seeming ingratitude and yet childishly glad to have suppressed in him that attitude of mentorship which he was beginning to assume over her You need not fear that my presence will offend you much longer mademoiselle he said coldly I can quite understand how hateful it must be to you though I would have wished that you could believe at least in my sincerity Are you going away then Not out of Paris altogether I have accepted the post of Governor of the Conciergerie Ah where the poor Queen She checked herself suddenly Those words would have been called treasonable to the people of France Instinctively and furtively as everyone did in these days she cast a rapid glance behind her You need not be afraid he said there is no one here but Petronelle And you Oh I echo your words Poor Marie Antoinette You pity her How can I help it But your are that horrible National Convention who will try her condemn her execute her as they did the King I am of the National Convention But I will not condemn her nor be a party to another crime I go as Governor of the Conciergerie to help her if I can But your popularity your life if you befriend her As you say mademoiselle my life if I befriend her he said simply She looked at him with renewed curiosity in her gaze How strange were men in these days Paul Deroulede the republican the recognised idol of the lawless people of France was about to risk his life for the woman he had helped to dethrone Pity with him did not end with the rabble of Paris it had reached Charlotte Corday though it failed to save her and now it extended to the poor dispossessed Queen Somehow in his face this time she saw either success or death When do you leave she asked To morrow night She said nothing more Strangely enough a tinge of melancholy had settled over her spirits No doubt the proximity of the town was the cause of this She could already hear the familiar noise of muffled drums the loud excited shrieking of the mob who stood round the gates of Paris at this time of the evening waiting to witness some important capture perhaps that of a hated aristocrat striving to escape from the people s revenge They had reached the edge of the wood and gradually as she walked the flowers she had gathered fell unheeded out of her listless hands one by one First the blue lupins their bud laden heads were heavy and they dropped to the ground followed by the white marguerites that lay thick behind her now on the grass like a shroud The red poppies were the lightest their thin gummy stalks clung to her hands longer than the rest At last she let them fall too singly like great drops of blood that glistened as her long white gown swept them aside Deroulede was absorbed in his thoughts and seemed not to heed her At the barrier however he roused himself and took out the passes which alone enabled Juliette and Petronelle to re enter the town unchallenged He himself as Citizen Deputy could come and go as he wished Juliette shuddered as the great gates closed behind her with a heavy clank It seemed to shut out even the memory of this happy day which for a brief space had been quite perfect She did not know Paris very well and wondered where lay that gloomy Conciergerie where a dethroned queen was living her last days in an agonised memory of the past But as they crossed the bridge she recognised all round her the massive towers of the great city Notre Dame the grateful spire of La Sainte Chapelle the sombre outline of saint Gervais and behind her the Louvre with its great history and irreclaimable grandeur How small her own tragedy seemed in the midst of this great sanguinary drama the last act of which had not yet even begun Her own revenge her oath her tribulations what were they in comparison with that great flaming Nemesis which had swept away a throne that vow of retaliation carried out by thousands against other thousands that long story of degradation of regicide of fratricide the awesome chapters of which were still being unfolded one by one She felt small and petty ashamed of the pleasure she had felt in the woods ashamed of her high spirits and light heartedness ashamed of that feeling of sudden pity and admiration for the man who had done her and her family so deep an injury which she was too feeble too vacillating to avenge The majestic outline of the Louvre seemed to frown sarcastically on her weakness the silent river to mock her and her wavering purpose The man beside her had wronged her and hers far more deeply than the Bourbons had wronged their people The people of France were taking their revenge and God had at the close of this last happy day of her life pointed once more to the means for her great end

none	none	 The Scarlet Pimpernel 
3551_7887_000003_000000	train-clean-360	It was some few hours later 
none	none	The ladies sat in the drawing room silent and anxious Soon after supper a visitor had called and had been closeted with Paul Deroulede in the latter s study for the past two hours 
3551_7887_000005_000000	train-clean-360	A tall somewhat lazy looking figure he was sitting at a table face to face with the Citizen Deputy 
3551_7887_000005_000001	train-clean-360	On a chair beside him lay a heavy caped coat covered with the dust and the splashings of a long journey but he himself was attired in clothes that suggested the most fastidious taste and the most perfect of tailors he wore with apparent ease the eccentric fashion of the time the short waisted coat of many lapels the double waistcoat and billows of delicate lace 
none	none	Unlike Deroulede he was of great height with fair hair and a somewhat lazy expression in his good natured blue eyes and as he spoke there was just a soupcon of foreign accent in the pronunciation of the French vowels a certain drawl of o s and a s that would have betrayed the Britisher to an observant ear The two men had been talking earnestly for some time the tall Englishman was watching his friend keenly whilst an amused pleasant smile lingered round the corners of his firm mouth and jaw Deroulede restless and enthusiastic was pacing to and fro But I don t understand now how you managed to reach Paris my dear Blakeney said Deroulede at last placing an anxious hand on his friend s shoulder The government has not forgotten The Scarlet Pimpernel La 
3551_7887_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I took care of that responded Blakeney with his short pleasant laugh 
3551_7887_000008_000002	train-clean-360	 I sent Tinville my autograph this morning 
none	none	You are mad Blakeney
3551_7887_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Not altogether my friend 
3551_7887_000010_000001	train-clean-360	My faith 
none	none	twas on only foolhardiness caused me to grant that devilish prosecutor another sight of my scarlet device I knew what you maniacs would be after so I came across in the Daydream just to see if I couldn t get my share of the fun
3551_7887_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Fun you call it queried the other bitterly 
none	none	Nay what would you have me call it A mad insane senseless tragedy with but one issue the guillotine for you all
3551_7887_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Then why did you come 
3551_7887_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 To What shall I say my friend rejoined Sir Percy Blakeney with that inimitable drawl of his 
none	none	To give your demmed government something else to think about whilst you are all busy running your heads into a noose What makes you think we are doing that Three things my friend may I offer you a pinch of snuff No Ah well And with the graceful gesture of an accomplished dandy Sir Percy flicked off a grain of dust from his immaculate Mechlin ruffles
3551_7887_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Three things he continued quietly an imprisoned Queen about to be tried for her life the temperament of a Frenchman some of them and the idiocy of mankind generally 
none	none	These three things make me think that a certain section of hot headed Republicans with yourself my dear Deroulede en tete are about to attempt the most stupid senseless purposeless thing that was ever concocted by the excitable brain of a demmed Frenchman Deroulede smiled Does it not seem amusing to you Blakeney that you should sit there and condemn anyone for planning mad insane senseless things La I ll not sit I ll stand rejoined Blakeney with a laugh as he drew himself up to his full height and stretched his long lazy limbs And now let me tell you friend that my League of The Scarlet Pimpernel never attempted the impossible and to try and drag the Queen out of the clutches of these murderous rascals now is attempting the unattainable And yet we mean to try
3551_7887_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I know it 
3551_7887_000022_000001	train-clean-360	I guessed it that is why I came that is also why I sent a pleasant little note to the Committee of Public Safety signed with the device they know so well The Scarlet Pimpernel 
none	none	Well
3551_7887_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Well the result is obvious 
none	none	Robespierre Danton Tinville Merlin and the whole of the demmed murderous crowd will be busy looking after me a needle in a haystack They ll put the abortive attempt down to me and you may ma foi I only suggest that you may escape safely out of France in the Daydream and with the help of your humble servant
3551_7887_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 But in the meanwhile they ll discover you and they ll not let you escape a second time 
none	none	My friend if a terrier were to lose his temper he never would run a rat to earth Now your Revolutionary Government has lost its temper with me ever since I slipped through Chauvelin s fingers they are blind with their own fury whilst I am perfectly happy and cool as a cucumber My life has become valuable to me my friend 
3551_7887_000026_000002	train-clean-360	There is someone over the water now who weeps when I don t return No no never fear they ll not get The Scarlet Pimpernel this journey 
none	none	He laughed a gay pleasant laugh and his strong firm face seemed to soften at thought of the beautiful wife over in England who was waiting anxiously for his safe return And yet you ll not help us to rescue the Queen rejoined Deroulede with some bitterness
3551_7887_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 By every means in my power replied Blakeney save the insane 
3551_7887_000029_000001	train-clean-360	But I will help to get you all out of the demmed hole when you have failed 
none	none	We ll not fail asserted the other hotly Sir Percy Blakeney went close up to his friend and placed his long slender hand with a touch of almost womanly tenderness upon the latter s shoulder
3551_7887_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you tell me your plans 
none	none	In a moment Deroulede was all fire and enthusiasm There are not many of us in it he began although half France will be in sympathy with us We have plenty of money of course and also the necessary disguise for the royal lady Yes I in the meanwhile have asked for and obtained the post of Governor of the Conciergerie I go into my new quarters to morrow In the meanwhile I am making arrangements for my mother and and those dependent upon me to quit France immediately Blakeney had perceived the slight hesitation when Deroulede mentioned those dependent upon him He looked scrutinisingly at his friend who continued quickly I am still very popular among the people My family can go about unmolested 
3551_7887_000038_000002	train-clean-360	I must get them out of France however in case in case 
3551_7887_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course rejoined the other simply 
none	none	As soon as I am assured that they are safe my friends and I can prosecute our plans 
3551_7887_000040_000001	train-clean-360	You see the trial of the Queen has not yet been decided on but I know that it is in the air 
none	none	We hope to get her away disguised in one of the uniforms of the National Guard As you know it will be my duty to make the final round every evening in the prison and to see that everything is safe for the night Two fellows watch all night in the room next to that occupied by the Queen 
3551_7887_000040_000005	train-clean-360	Usually they drink and play cards all night long 
none	none	I want an opportunity to drug their brandy and thus to render them more loutish and idiotic than usual then for a blow on the head that will make them senseless 
3551_7887_000040_000007	train-clean-360	It should be easy for I have a strong fist and after that 
none	none	Well After that friend rejoined Sir Percy earnestly after that Shall I fill in the details of the picture the guard twenty five strong outside the Conciergerie how will you pass them I as the Governor followed by one of my guards To go whither I have the right to come and go as I please I faith so you have but one of your guards eh Wrapped to the eyes in a long mantle to hide the female figure beneath I have been in Paris but a few hours and yet already I have realised that there is not one demmed citizen within its walls who does not at this moment suspect some other demmed citizen of conniving at the Queen s escape Even the sparrows on the house tops are objects of suspicion 
3551_7887_000045_000004	train-clean-360	No figure wrapped in a mantle will from this day forth leave Paris unchallenged 
none	none	But you yourself friend suggested Deroulede You think you can quit Paris unrecognised then why not the Queen Because she is a woman and has been a queen She has nerves poor soul and weaknesses of body and of mind now 
3551_7887_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Alas for her 
none	none	Alas for France who wreaks such idle vengeance on so poor an enemy 
3551_7887_000047_000004	train-clean-360	Can you take hold of Marie Antoinette by the shoulders shove her into the bottom of a cart and pile sacks of potatoes on the top of her 
none	none	I did that to the Comtesse de Tournai and her daughter as stiff necked a pair of French aristocrats as ever deserved the guillotine for their insane prejudices But can you do it to Marie Antoinette 
3551_7887_000047_000006	train-clean-360	She d rebuke you publicly and betray herself and you in a flash sooner than submit to a loss of dignity 
none	none	But would you leave her to her fate
3551_7887_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah there s the trouble friend 
none	none	Do you think you need appeal to the sense of chivalry of my league 
3551_7887_000049_000002	train-clean-360	We are still twenty strong and heart and soul in sympathy with your mad schemes 
3551_7887_000049_000003	train-clean-360	The poor poor Queen 
3551_7887_000049_000004	train-clean-360	But you are bound to fail and then who will help you all if we too are put out of the way 
none	none	We should succeed if you helped us At one time you used proudly to say The League of The Scarlet Pimpernel has never failed Because it attempted nothing which it could not accomplish But la since you put me on my mettle Demm it all I ll have to think about it And he laughed that funny somewhat inane laugh of his which had deceived the clever men of two countries as to his real personality Deroulede went up to the heavy oak desk which occupied a conspicuous place in the centre of one of the walls 
3551_7887_000053_000001	train-clean-360	He unlocked it and drew forth a bundle of papers 
3551_7887_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you look through these he asked handing them to Sir Percy Blakeney 
3551_7887_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 What are they 
none	none	Different schemes I have drawn up in case my original plan should not succeed
3551_7887_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Burn them my friend said Blakeney laconically 
none	none	Have you not yet learned the lesson of never putting your hand to paper
3551_7887_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t burn these 
none	none	You see I shall not be able to have long conversations with Marie Antoinette I must give her my suggestions in writing that she may study them and not fail me through lack of knowledge of her part
3551_7887_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Better that than papers in these times my friend these papers if found would send you untried to the guillotine 
3551_7887_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 I am careful and at present quite beyond suspicion 
none	none	Moreover among the papers is a complete collection of passports suitable for any character the Queen and her attendant may be forced to assume It has taken me some months to collect them so as not to arouse suspicion I gradually got them together on one pretence or another now I am ready for any eventuality 
3551_7887_000061_000000	train-clean-360	He suddenly paused 
none	none	A look in his friend s face had given him a swift warning 
3551_7887_000062_000000	train-clean-360	He turned and there in the doorway holding back the heavy portiere stood Juliette graceful smiling a little pale this no doubt owing to the flickering light of the unsnuffed candles 
none	none	So young and girlish did she look in her soft white muslin frock that at sight of her the tension in Deroulede s face seemed to relax Instinctively he had thrown the papers back into the desk but his look had softened from the fire of obstinate energy to that of inexpressible tenderness Blakeney was quietly watching the young girl as she stood in the doorway a little bashful and undecided Madame Deroulede sent me she said hesitatingly she says the hour is getting late and she is very anxious M Deroulede would you come and reassure her
3551_7887_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 In a moment mademoiselle he replied lightly my friend and I have just finished our talk 
none	none	May I have the honour to present him Sir Percy Blakeney a traveller from England Blakeney this is Mademoiselle Juliette de Marny my mother s guest CHAPTER VII A warning Sir Percy bowed very low with all the graceful flourish and elaborate gesture the eccentric customs of the time demanded He had not said a word since the first exclamation of warning with which he had drawn his friend s attention to the young girl in the doorway Noiselessly as she had come Juliette glided out of the room again leaving behind her an atmosphere of wild flowers of the bouquet she had gathered then scattered in the woods There was silence in the room for awhile Deroulede was locking up his desk and slipping the keys into his pocket Shall we join my mother for a moment Blakeney he said moving towards the door I shall be proud to pay my respects replied Sir Percy but before we close the subject I think I ll change my mind about those papers If I am to be of service to you I think I had best look through them and give you my opinion of your schemes Deroulede looked at him keenly for a moment Certainly he said at last going up to his desk I ll stay with you whilst you read them through La not to night my friend said Sir Percy lightly the hour is late and madame is waiting for us They ll be quite safe with me and you ll entrust them to my care Deroulede seemed to hesitate Blakeney had spoken in his usual airy manner and was even now busy readjusting the set of his perfectly tailored coat Perhaps you cannot quite trust me laughed Sir Percy gaily I seemed too lukewarm just now No it s not that Blakeney said Deroulede quietly at last There is no mistrust in me all the mistrust is on your side Faith began Sir Percy Nay do not explain I understand and appreciate your friendship but I should like to convince you how unjust is your mistrust of one of God s purest angels that ever walked the earth Oho that s it is it friend Deroulede Methought you had foresworn the sex altogether and now you are in love Madly blindly stupidly in love my friend said Deroulede with a sigh Hopelessly I fear me Why hopelessly She is the daughter of the late Duc de Marny one of the oldest names in France a Royalist to the backbone Hence your overwhelming sympathy for the Queen Nay you wrong me there friend I d have tried to save the Queen even if I had never learned to love Juliette But you see now how unjust were your suspicions Had I any Don t deny it You were loud in urging me to burn those papers a moment ago You called them useless and dangerous and now I still think them useless and dangerous and by reading them would wish to confirm my opinion and give weight to my arguments If I were to part from them now I would seem to be mistrusting her You are a mad idealist my dear Deroulede How can I help it I have lived under the same roof with her for three weeks now I have begun to understand what a saint is like And twill be when you understand that your idol has feet of clay that you ll learn the real lesson of love said Blakeney earnestly Is it love to worship a saint in heaven whom you dare not touch who hovers above you like a cloud which floats away from you even as you gaze To love is to feel one being in the world at one with us our equal in sin as well as in virtue To love for us men is to clasp one woman with our arms feeling that she lives and breathes just as we do suffers as we do thinks with us loves with us and above all sins with us Your mock saint who stands in a niche is not a woman if she have not suffered still less a woman if she have not sinned Fall at the feet of your idol an you wish but drag her down to your level after that the only level she should ever reach that of your heart Who shall render faithfully a true account of the magnetism which poured forth from this remarkable man as he spoke this well dressed foppish apostle of the greatest love that man has ever known And as he spoke the whole story of his own great true love for the woman who once had so deeply wronged him seemed to stand clearly written in the strong lazy good humoured kindly face glowing with tenderness for her Deroulede felt this magnetism and therefore did not resent the implied suggestion anent the saint whom he was still content to worship A dreamer and an idealist his mind held spellbound by the great social problems which were causing the upheaval of a whole country he had not yet had the time to learn the sweet lesson which Nature teaches to her elect the lesson of a great a true human and passionate love To him at present Juliette represented the perfect embodiment of his most idealistic dreams She stood in his mind so far above him that if she proved unattainable he would scarce have suffered It was such a foregone conclusion Blakeney s words were the first to stir in his heart a desire for something beyond that quasi mediaeval worship something weaker and yet infinitely stronger something more earthy and yet almost divine And now shall we join the ladies said Blakeney after a long pause during which the mental workings of his alert brain were almost visible in the earnest look which he cast at his friend You shall keep the papers in your desk give them into the keeping of your saint trust her all in all rather than not at all and if the time should come that your heaven enthroned ideal fall somewhat heavily to earth then give me the privilege of being a witness to your happiness You are still mistrustful Blakeney said Deroulede lightly If you say much more I ll give these papers into Mademoiselle Marny s keeping until to morrow CHAPTER VIII Anne Mie That night when Blakeney wrapped in his cloak was walking down the Rue Ecole de Medecine towards his own lodgings he suddenly felt a timid hand upon his sleeve Anne Mie stood beside him her pale melancholy face peeping up at the tall Englishman through the folds of a dark hood closely tied under her chin Monsieur she said timidly do not think me very presumptuous I I would wish to have five minutes talk with you may I He looked down with great kindness at the quaint wizened little figure and the strong face softened at the sight of the poor deformed shoulder the hard pinched look of the young mouth the general look of pathetic helplessness which appeals so strongly to the chivalrous Indeed mademoiselle he said gently you make me very proud and I can serve you in any way I pray you command me But he added seeing Anne Mie s somewhat scared look this street is scarce fit for private conversation Shall we try and find a better spot Paris had not yet gone to bed In these times it was really safest to be out in the open streets There everybody was more busy more on the move on the lookout for suspected houses leaving the wanderer alone Blakeney led Anne Mie towards the Luxembourg Gardens the great devastated pleasure ground of the ci devant tyrants of the people The beautiful Anne of Austria and the Medici before her Louis XIII and his gallant musketeers all have given place to the great cannon forging industry of this besieged Republic France attacked on every side is forcing her sons to defend her persecuted martyrised done to death by her she is still their Mother La Patrie who needs their arms against the foreign foe England is threatening the north Prussia and Austria the east Admiral Hood s flag is flying on Toulon Arsenal The siege of the Republic And the Republic is fighting for dear life The Tuileries and Luxembourg Gardens are transformed into a township of gigantic smithies and Anne Mie with scared eyes and clinging to Blakeney s arm cast furtive terrified glances at the huge furnaces and the begrimed darkly scowling faces of the workers within The people of France in arms against tyranny Great placards bearing these inspiriting words are affixed to gallows shaped posts and flutter in the evening breeze rendered scorching by the heat of the furnaces all around Farther on a group of older men squatting on the ground are busy making tents and some women the same Megaeras who daily shriek round the guillotine are plying their needles and scissors for the purpose of making clothes for the soldiers The soldiers are the entire able bodied male population of France The people of France in arms against tyranny That is their sign their trade mark one of these placards fitfully illumined by a torch of resin towers above a group of children busy tearing up scraps of old linen their mothers their sisters linen in order to make lint for the wounded Loud curses and suppressed mutterings fill the smoke laden air The people of France in arms against tyranny is bending its broad back before the most cruel the most absolute and brutish slave driving ever exercised over mankind Not even mediaeval Christianity has ever dared such wholesale enforcements of its doctrines as this constitution of Liberty and Fraternity Merlin s Law of the Suspect has just been formulated From now onward each and every citizen of France must watch his words his looks his gestures lest they be suspect Of what of treason to the Republic to the people Nay worse lest they be suspect of being suspect to the great era of Liberty Therefore in the smithies and among the groups of tent makers a moment s negligence a careless attention to the work might lead to a brief trial on the morrow and the inevitable guillotine Negligence is treason to the higher interests of the Republic Blakeney dragged Anne Mie away from the sight These roaring furnaces frightened her he took her down the Place saint Michel towards the river It was quieter here What dreadful people they have become she said shuddering even I can remember how different they used to be The houses on the banks of the river were mostly converted into hospitals preparatory for the great siege Some hundred metres lower down the new children s hospital endowed by Citizen Deputy Deroulede loomed white clean and comfortable looking amidst its more squalid fellows I think it would be best not to sit down suggested Blakeney and wiser for you to throw your hood away from your face He seemed to have no fears for himself many had said that he bore a charmed life and yet ever since Admiral Hood had planted his flag on Toulon Arsenal the English were more feared than ever and The Scarlet Pimpernel more hated than most You wished to speak to me about Paul Deroulede he said kindly seeing that the young girl was making desperate efforts to say what lay on her mind He is my friend you know Yes that is why I wished to ask you a question she replied What is it Who is Juliette de Marny and why did she seek an entrance into Paul s house Did she seek it then Yes I saw the scene from the balcony At the time it did not strike me as a farce I merely thought that she had been stupid and foolhardy But since then I have reflected She provoked the mob of the street wilfully just at the very moment when she reached M Deroulede s door She meant to appeal to his chivalry and called for help well knowing that he would respond She spoke rapidly and excitedly now throwing off all shyness and reserve Blakeney was forced to check her vehemence which might have been thought suspicious by some idle citizen unpleasantly inclined Well And now he asked for the young girl had paused as if ashamed of her excitement And now she stays in the house on and on day after day continued Anne Mie speaking more quietly though with no less intensity Why does she not go She is not safe in France She belongs to the most hated of all the classes the idle rich aristocrats of the old regime Paul has several times suggested plans for her emigration to England Madame Deroulede who is an angel loves her and would not like to part from her but it would be obviously wiser for her to go and yet she stays Why Presumably because Because she is in love with Paul interrupted Anne Mie vehemently No no she does not love him at least Oh sometimes I don t know Her eyes light up when he comes and she is listless when he goes She always spends a longer time over her toilet when we expect him home to dinner she added with a touch of naive femininity But if it be love then that love is strange and unwomanly it is a love that will not be for his good Why should you think that I don t know said the girl simply Isn t it an instinct Not a very unerring one in this case I fear Why Because your own love for Paul Deroulede has blinded you Ah you must pardon me mademoiselle you sought this conversation and not I and I fear me I have wounded you Yet I would wish you to know how deep is my sympathy with you and how great my desire to render you a service if I could I was about to ask a service of you monsieur Then command me I beg of you You are Paul s friend persuade him that that woman in his house is a standing danger to his life and liberty He would not listen to me Oh a man always listens to another Except on one subject the woman he loves He had said the last words very gently but very firmly He was deeply tenderly sorry for the poor deformed fragile girl doomed to be a witness of that most heartrending of human tragedies the passing away of her own scarce hoped for happiness But he felt that at this moment the kindest act would be one of complete truth He knew that Paul Deroulede s heart was completely given to Juliette de Marny he too like Anne Mie instinctively mistrusted the beautiful girl and her strange silent ways but unlike the poor hunchback he knew that no sin which Juliette might commit would henceforth tear her from out the heart of his friend that if indeed she turned out to be false or even treacherous she would nevertheless still hold a place in Deroulede s very soul which no one else would ever fill You think he loves her asked Anne Mie at last I am sure of it And she Ah I do not know I would trust your instinct a woman s sooner than my own She is false I tell you and is hatching treason against Paul Then all we can do is to wait Wait And watch carefully earnestly all the time There shall I pledge you my word that Deroulede shall come to no harm Pledge me your word that you ll part him from that woman Nay that is beyond my power A man like Paul Deroulede only loves once in life but when he does it is for always Once more she was silent pressing her lips closely together as if afraid of what she might say He saw that she was bitterly disappointed and sought for a means of tempering the cruelty of the blow It will be your task to watch over Paul he said with your friendship to guard and protect him we need have no fear for his safety I think I will watch she replied quietly Gradually he had led her steps back towards the Rue Ecole de Medecine A great melancholy had fallen over his bold adventurous spirit How full of tragedies was this great city in the last throes of its insane and cruel struggle for an unattainable goal And yet despite its guillotine and mock trials its tyrannical laws and overfilled prisons its very sorrows paled before the dead dull misery of this deformed girl s heart A wild exaltation a fever of enthusiasm lent glamour to the scenes which were daily enacted on the Place de la Revolution turning the final acts of the tragedies into glaring lurid melodrama almost unreal in its poignant appeal to the sensibilities But here there was only this dead dull misery an aching heart a poor fragile creature in the throes of an agonised struggle for a fast disappearing happiness Anne Mie hardly knew now what she had hoped when she sought this interview with Sir Percy Blakeney Drowning in a sea of hopelessness she had clutched at what might prove a chance of safety Her reason told her that Paul s friend was right Deroulede was a man who would love but once in his life He had never loved for he had too much pitied poor pathetic little Anne Mie Nay why should we say that love and pity are akin Love the great the strong the conquering god Love that subdues a world and rides roughshod over principle virtue tradition over home kindred and religion what cares he for the easy conquest of the pathetic being who appeals to his sympathy Love means equality the same height of heroism or of sin When Love stoops to pity he has ceased to soar in the boundless space that rarefied atmosphere wherein man feels himself made at last truly in the image of God CHAPTER IX Jealousy At the door of her home Blakeney parted from Anne Mie with all the courtesy with which he would have bade adieu to the greatest lady in his own land Anne Mie let herself into the house with her own latch key She closed the heavy door noiselessly then glided upstairs like a quaint little ghost But on the landing above she met Paul Deroulede He had just come out of his room and was still fully dressed Anne Mie he said with such an obvious cry of pleasure that the young girl with beating heart paused a moment on the top of the stairs as if hoping to hear that cry again feeling that indeed he was glad to see her had been uneasy because of her long absence Have I made you anxious she asked at last Anxious he exclaimed Little one I have hardly lived this last hour since I realised that you had gone out so late as this and all alone How did you know Mademoiselle de Marny knocked at my door an hour ago She had gone to your room to see you and not finding you there she searched the house for you and finally in her anxiety came to me We did not dare to tell my mother I won t ask you where you have been Anne Mie but another time remember little one that the streets of Paris are not safe and that those who love you suffer deeply when they know you to be in peril Those who love me murmured the girl under her breath Could you not have asked me to come with you No I wanted to be alone The streets were quite safe and I wanted to speak with Sir Percy Blakeney With Blakeney he exclaimed in boundless astonishment Why what in the world did you want to say him The girl so unaccustomed to lying had blurted out the truth almost against her will I thought he could help me as I was much perturbed and restless You went to him sooner than to me said Deroulede in a tone of gentle reproach and still puzzled at this extraordinary action on the part of the girl usually so shy and reserved My anxiety was about you and you would have mocked me for it Indeed I should never mock you Anne Mie But why should you be anxious about me Because I see you wandering blindly on the brink of a great danger and because I see you confiding in those whom you had best mistrust He frowned a little and bit his lip to check the rough word that was on the tip of his tongue Is Sir Percy Blakeney one of those whom I had best mistrust he said lightly No she answered curtly Then dear there is no cause for unrest He is the only one of my friends whom you have not known intimately All those who are round me now you know that you can trust and that you can love he added earnestly and significantly He took her hand it was trembling with obvious suppressed agitation She knew that he had guessed what was passing in her mind and now was deeply ashamed of what she had done She had been tortured with jealousy for the past three weeks but at least she had suffered quite alone on one had been allowed to touch that wound which more often than not excites derision rather than pity Now by her own actions two men knew her secret Both were kind and sympathetic but Deroulede resented her imputations and Blakeney had been unable to help her A wave of morbid introspection swept over her soul She realised in a moment how petty and base had been her thoughts and how purposeless her actions She would have given her life at this moment to eradicate from Deroulede s mind the knowledge of her own jealousy she hoped that at least he had not guessed her love She tried to read his thoughts but in the dark passage only dimly lighted by the candles in Deroulede s room beyond she could not see the expression of his face but the hand which held hers was warm and tender She felt herself pitied and blushed at the thought With a hasty good night she fled down the passage and locked herself in her room alone with her own thoughts at last CHAPTER X Denunciation But what of Juliette What of this wild passionate romantic creature tortured by a Titanic conflict She but a girl scarcely yet a woman torn by the greatest antagonistic powers that ever fought for a human soul On the one side duty tradition her dead brother her father above all her religion and the oath she had sworn before God on the other justice and honour a case of right and wrong honesty and pity How she fought with these powers now She fought with them struggled with them on her knees She tried to crush memory tried to forget that awful midnight scene ten years ago her brother s dead body her father s avenging hand holding her own as he begged her to do that which he was too feeble too old to accomplish His words rang in her ears from across that long vista of the past Before the face of Almighthy God who sees and hears me I swear And she had repeated those words loudly and of her own free will with her hand resting on her brother s breast and God Himself looking down upon her for she had called upon Him to listen I swear that I will seek out Paul Deroulede and in any manner which God may dictate to me encompass his death his ruin or dishonour in revenge for my brother s death May my brother s soul remain in torment until the final Judgment Day if I should break my oath but may it rest in eternal peace the day on which his death is fitly avenged Almost it seemed to her as if father and brother were standing by her side as she knelt and prayed Oh how she prayed In many ways she was only a child All her years had been passed in confinement either beside her dying father or later between the four walls of the Ursuline Convent And during those years her soul had been fed on a contemplative ecstatic religion a kind of sanctified superstition which she would have deemed sacrilege to combat Her first step into womanhood was taken with that oath upon her lips since then with a stoical sense of duty she had lashed herself into a daily hourly remembrance of the great mission imposed upon her To have neglected it would have been to her equal to denying God She had but vague ideas of the doctrinal side of religion Purgatory was to her merely a word but a word representing a real spiritual state one of expectancy of restlessness of sorrow And vaguely yet determinedly she believed that her brother s soul suffered because she had been too weak to fulfil her oath The Church had not come to her rescue The ministers of her religion were scattered to the four corners of besieged agonising France She had no one to help her no one to comfort her That very peaceful contemplative life she had led in the convent only served to enhance her feeling of the solemnity of her mission It was true it was inevitable because it was so hard To the few who throughout those troublous times had kept a feeling of veneration for their religion this religion had become one of abnegation and martyrdom A spirit of uncompromising Jansenism seemed to call forth sacrifices and renunciation whereas the happy go lucky Catholicism of the past century had only suggested an easy flowered path to a comfortable well upholstered heaven The harder the task seemed with was set before her the more real it became to Juliette God she firmly believed had at last after ten years shown her the way to wreak vengeance upon her brother s murderer He had brought her to this house caused her to see and hear part of the conversation between Blakeney and Deroulede and this at the moment of all others when even the semblance of a conspiracy against the Republic would bring the one inevitable result in its train disgrace first the hasty mock trial the hall of justice and the guillotine She tried not to hate Deroulede She wished to judge him coldly and impartially or rather to indict him before the throne of God and to punish him for the crime he had commited ten years ago Her personal feelings must remain out of the question Had Charlotte Corday considered her own sensibilities when with her own hand she put an end to Marat Juliette remained on her knees for hours She heard Anne Mie come home and Deroulede s voice of welcome on the landing This was perhaps the most bitter moment of this awful soul conflict for it brought to her mind the remembrance of those others who would suffer too and who were innocent Madame Deroulede and poor crippled Anne Mie They had done no wrong and yet how heavily would they be punished And then the saner judgment the human material code of ethics gained for a while the upper hand Juliette would rise from her knees dry her eyes prepare quietly to go to bed and to forget all about the awful relentless Fate which dragged her to the fulfilment of its will and then sink back broken hearted murmuring impassioned prayers for forgiveness to her father her brother her God The soul was young and ardent and it fought for abnegation martyrdom and stern duty the body was childlike and it fought for peace contentment and quiet reason The rational body was conquered by the passionate powerful soul Blame not the child for in herself she was innocent She was but another of the many victims of this cruel mad hysterical time that spirit of relentless tyranny forcing its doctrines upon the weak With the first break of dawn Juliette at last finally rose from her knees bathed her burning eyes and head tidied her hair and dress then she sat down at the table and began to write She was a transformed being now no longer a child essentially a woman a Joan of Arc with a mission a Charlotte Corday going to martyrdom a human suffering erring soul committing a great crime for the sake of an idea She wrote out carefully and with a steady hand the denunciation of Citizen Deputy Deroulede which has become an historical document and is preserved in the chronicles of France You have all seen it at the Musee Carnavalet in its glass case its yellow paper and faded ink revealing nothing of the soul conflict of which it was the culminating victory The cramped somewhat schoolgirlish writing is the mute pathetic witness of one of the saddest tragedies that era of sorrow and crime has ever known To the Representatives of the People now sitting in Assembly at the National Convention You trust and believe in the Representative of the people Citizen Deputy Paul Deroulede He is false and a traitor to the Republic He is planning and hopes to effect the release of ci devant Marie Antoinette widow of the traitor Louis Capet Haste ye representatives of the people proofs of his assertion papers and plans are still in the house of the Citizen Deputy Deroulede This statement is made by one who knows I The twenty third Fructidor When her letter was written she read it through carefully made the one or two little corrections which are still visible in the document then folded her missive hid it within the folds of her kerchief and wrapping a dark cloak and hood round her she slipped noiselessly out of her room The house was all quiet and still She shuddered a little as the cool morning air fanned her hot cheeks it seemed like the breath of ghosts She ran quickly down the stairs and as rapidly as she could pushed back the heavy bolts of the front door and slipped out into the street Already the city was beginning to stir There was no time for sleep when so much had to be done for the safety of the threatened Republic As Juliette turned her steps towards the river she met the crowd of workmen whom France was employing for her defence Behind her in the Luxembourg Gardens and all along the opposite bank of the river the furnaces were already ablaze and the smiths at work forging the guns At every step now Juliette came across the great placards pinned to the tall gallows shaped posts which proclaim to every passing citizen that the people of France are up and in arms Right across the Place de l Institut a procession of market carts laden with vegetables and a little fruit wends its way slowly towards the centre of the town They each carry tiny tricolour flags with a Pike and Cap of Liberty surmounting the flagstaff They are good patriots the market gardeners who come in daily to feed the starving mob of Paris with the few handfuls of watery potatoes and miserable vermin eaten cabbages which that fraternal Revolution still allows them to grow without hindrance Everyone seems busy with their work this early in the morning the business of killing does not begin until later in the day For the moment Juliette can get along quite unmolested the women and children mostly hurrying on towards the vast encampments in the Tuileries where lint and bandages and coats for the soldiers are manufactured all the day The walls of all the houses bear the great patriotic device Liberte Egalite Fraternite sinon La Mort others are more political in their proclamation La Republique une et indivisible But on the walls of the Louvre of the great palace of whilom kings where the Roi Soleil held his Court and flirted with the prettiest women in France there the new and great Republic has affixed its final mandate A great poster glued to the wall bears the words La Loi concernan les Suspects Below the poster is a huge wooden box with a slit at the top This is the latest invention for securing the safety of this one and indivisible Republic Henceforth everyone becomes a traitor at one word of denunciation from an idler or an enemy and as in the most tyrannical days of the Spanish Inquisition one half of the nation was set to spy upon the other that wooden box with its slit is put there ready to receive denunciations from one hand against another Had Juliette paused but for the fraction of a second had she stopped to read the placard setting forth this odious law had she only reflected then she would even now have turned back and fled from that gruesome box of infamies as she would from a dangerous and noisome reptile or from the pestilence But her long vigil her prayers her ecstatic visions of heroic martyrs had now completely numbed her faculties Her vitality her sensibilities were gone she had become an automaton gliding to her doom without a thought or a tremor She drew the letter from her bosom and with a steady hand dropped it into the box The irreclaimable had now occurred Nothing she could henceforth say or do no prayers or agonised vigils no miracles even could undo her action or save Paul Deroulede from trial and guillotine One or two groups of people hurrying to their work had seen her drop the letter into the box A couple of small children paused finger in mouth gazing at her with inane curiosity one woman uttered a coarse jest all of them shrugged their shoulders and passed on on their way Those who habitually crossed this spot were used to such sights That wooden box with its mouthlike slit was like an insatiable monster that was constantly fed yet was still gaping for more Having done the deed Juliette turned and as rapidly as she had come so she went back to her temporary home A home no more now she must leave it at once to day if possible This much she knew that she no longer could touch the bread of the man she had betrayed She would not appear at breakfast she could plead a headache and in the afternoon Petronelle should pack her things She turned into a little shop close by and asked for a glass of milk and a bit of bread The woman who served her eyed her with some curiosity for Juliette just now looked almost out of her mind She had not yet begun to think and she had ceased to suffer Both would come presently and with them the memory of this last irretrievable hour and a just estimate of what she had done CHAPTER XI Vengeance is mine The pretence of a headache enabled Juliette to keep in her room the greater part of the day She would have liked to shut herself out from the entire world during those hours which she spent face to face with her own thoughts and her own sufferings The sight of Anne Mie s pathetic little face as she brought her food and delicacies and various little comforts was positive torture to the poor harrowed soul At every sound in the great silent house she started up quivering with apprehension and horror Had the sword of Damocles which she herself had suspended already fallen over the heads of those who had shown her nothing but kindness She could not think of Madame Deroulede or of Anne Mie without the most agonising the most torturing shame And what of him the man she had so remorselessly so ruthlessly betrayed to a tribunal which would know no mercy Juliette dared not think of him She had never tried to analyse her feelings with regard to him At the time of Charlotte Corday s trial when his sonorous voice rang out in its pathetic appeal for the misguided woman Juliette had given him ungrudging admiration She remembered now how strongly his magnetic personality had roused in her a feeling of enthusiasm for the poor girl who had come from the depths of her quiet provincial home in order to accomplish the horrible deed which would immortalise her name through all the ages to come and cause her countrymen to proclaim her greater than Brutus Deroulede was pleading for the life of that woman and it was his very appeal which had aroused Juliette s dormant energy for the cause which her dead father had enjoined her not to forget It was Deroulede again whom she had seen but a few weeks ago standing alone before the mob who would have torn her to pieces haranguing them on her behalf speaking to them with that quiet strong voice of his ruling them with the rule of love and pity and turning their wrath to gentleness Did she hate him then Surely surely she hated him for having thrust himself into her life for having caused her brother s death and covered her father s declining years with sorrow And above all she hated him indeed indeed it was hate for being the cause of this most hideous action of her life an action to which she had been driven against her will one of basest ingratitude and treachery foreign to every sentiment within her heart cowardly abject the unconscious outcome of this strange magnetism which emanated from him and had cast a spell over her transforming her individuality and will power and making of her an unconscious and automatic instrument of Fate She would not speak of God s finger again it was Fate pagan devilish Fate the weird shrivelled women who sit and spin their interminable thread They had decreed and Juliette unable to fight blind and broken by the conflict had succumbed to the Megaeras and their relentless wheel At length silence and loneliness became unendurable She called Petronelle and ordered her to pack her boxes We leave for England to day she said curtly For England gasped the worthy old soul who was feeling very happy and comfortable in this hospitable house and was loth to leave it So soon Why yes we had talked of it for some time We cannot remain here always My cousins De Crecy are there and my aunt De Coudremont We shall be among friends Petronelle if we ever get there If we ever get there sighed poor Petronelle we have but very little money ma cherie and no passports Have you thought of asking M Deroulede for them No no rejoined Juliette hastily I ll see to the passports somehow Petronelle Sir Percy Blakeney is English he ll tell me what to do Do you know where he lives my jewel Yes I heard him tell Madame Deroulede last night that he was lodging with a provincial named Brogard at the Sign of the Cruche Cassee I ll go seek him Petronelle I am sure he will help me The English are so resourceful and practical He ll get us our passports I know and advise us as to the best way to proceed Do you stay here and get all our things ready I ll not be long She took up a cloak and hood and throwing them over her arm she slipped out of the room Deroulede had left the house earlier in the day She hoped that he had not yet returned and ran down the stairs quickly so that she might go out unperceived The house was quite peaceful and still It seemed strange to Juliette that there did not hang over it some sort of pall like presentiment of coming evil From the kitchen at some little distance from the hall Anne Mie s voice was heard singing an old ditty four De ta tige detachee Pauvre feuille dessechee Ou vas tu Juliette paused a moment An awful ache had seized her heart her eyes unconsciously filled with tears as they roamed round the walls of this house which had sheltered her so hospitably these three weeks past And now whither was she going Like the poor dead leaf of the song she was wastrel torn from the parent bough homeless friendless having turned against the one hand which in this great time of peril had been extended to her in kindness and in love Conscience was beginning to rise up against her and that hydra headed tyrant Remorse She closed her eyes to shut out the hideous vision of her crime she tried to forget this home which her treachery had desecrated four Je vais ou va toute chose Ou va la feuille de rose Et la feuille de laurier sang Anne Mie plaintively A great sob broke from Juliette s aching heart The misery of it all was more than she could bear Ah pity her if you can She had fought and striven and been conquered A girl s soul is so young so impressionable and she had grown up with that one awful all pervading idea of duty to accomplish a most solemn oath to fulfil one sworn to her dying father and on the dead body of her brother She had begged for guidance prayed for release and the voice from above had remained silent Weak miserable cringing the human soul when torn with earthly passion must look at its own strength for the fight And now the end had come That swift scarce tangible dream of peace which had flitted through her mind during the past few weeks had vanished with the dawn and she was left desolate alone with her great sin and its lifelong expiation Scarce knowing what she did she fell on her knees there on that threshold which she was about to leave for ever Fate had placed on her young shoulders a burden too heavy for her to bear Juliette At first she did not move It was his voice coming from the study behind her Its magic thrilled her as it had done that day in the Hall of Justice Strong passionate tender it seemed now to raise every echo of response in her heart She thought it was a dream and remained there on her knees lest it should be dispelled Then she heard his footsteps on the flagstones of the hall Anne Mie s plaintive singing had died away in the distance She started and jumped to her feet hastily drying her eyes The momentary dream was dispelled and she was ashamed of her weakness He the cause of all her sorrows of her sin and of her degradation had no right to see her suffer She would have fled out of the house now but it was too late He had come out of his study and seeing her there on her knees weeping he came quickly forward trying with all the innate chivalry of his upright nature not to let her see that he had been a witness to her tears You are going out mademoiselle he said courteously as wrapping her cloak around her she was turning towards the door Yes yes she replied hastily a small errand I Is it anything I can do for you No If he added with visible embarrassment if your errand would brook a delay might I crave the honour of your presence in my study for a few moments My errand brooks of no delay Citizen Deroulede she said as composedly as she could and perhaps on my return I might I am leaving almost directly mademoiselle and I would wish to bid you good bye He stood aside to allow her to pass either out through the street door or across the hall to his study There had been no reproach in his voice towards the guest who was thus leaving him without a word of farewell Perhaps if there had been any Juliette would have rebelled As it was an unconquerable magnetism seemed to draw her towards him and making an almost imperceptible sign of acquiescence she glided past him into his room The study was dark and cool for the room faced the west and the shutters had been closed in order to keep out the hot August sun At first Juliette could see nothing but she felt his presence near her as he followed her into the room leaving the door slightly ajar It is kind of you mademoiselle he said gently to accede to my request which was perhaps presumptuous But you see I am leaving this house to day and I had a selfish longing to hear your voice bidding me farewell Juliette s large burning eyes were gradually piercing the semi gloom around her She could see him distinctly now standing close beside her in an attitude of the deepest almost reverential respect The study was as usual neat and tidy denoting the orderly habits of a man of action and energy On the ground there was a valise ready strapped as if for a journey and on the top of it a bulky letter case of stout pigskin secured with a small steel lock Juliette s eyes fastened upon this case with a look of fascination and of horror Obviously it contained Deroulede s papers the plans for Marie Antoinette s escape the passports of which he had spoken the day before to his friend Sir Percy Blakeney the proofs in fact which she had offered to the representatives of the people in support of her denunciation of the Citizen Deputy After his request he had said nothing more He was waiting for her to speak but her voice felt parched it seemed to her as if hands of steel were gripping her throat smothering the words she would have longed to speak Will you not wish me godspeed mademoiselle he repeated gently Godspeed Oh the awful irony of it all Should God speed him to a mock trial and to the guillotine He was going thither though he did not know it and was even now trying to take the hand which had deliberately sent him there At last she made an effort to speak and in a toneless even voice she contrived to murmur You are not going for long Citizen Deputy In these times mademoiselle he replied any farewell might be for ever But I am actually going for a month to the Conciergerie to take charge of the unfortunate prisoner there For a month she repeated mechanically Oh yes he said with a smile You see our present Government is afraid that poor Marie Antoinette will exercise her fascinations over any lieutenant governor of her prison if he remain near her long enough so a new one is appointed every month I shall be in charge during this coming Vendemiaire I shall hope to return before the equinox but who can tell In any case then Citoyen Deroulede the farewell I bid you to night will be a very long one A month will seem a century to me he said earnestly since I must spend it without seeing you but He looked long and searchingly at her He did not understand her in her present mood so scared and wild did she seem so unlike that girlish light hearted self which had made the dull old house so bright these past few weeks But I should not dare to hope he murmured that a similar reason would cause you to call that month a long one She turned perhaps a trifle paler than she had been hitherto and her eyes roamed round the room like those of a trapped hare seeking to escape You misunderstand me Citoyen Deroulede she said at last hurriedly You have all been kind very kind but Petronelle and I can no longer trespass on your hospitality We have friends in England and many enemies here I know he interrupted quietly it would be the most arrant selfishness on my part to suggest that you should stay here an hour longer than necessary I fear that after to day my roof may no longer prove a sheltering one for you But will you allow me to arrange for your safety as I am arranging for that of my mother and Anne Mie My English friend Sir Percy Blakeney has a yacht in readiness off the Normandy coast I have already seen to your passports and to all the arrangements of your journey as far as there and Sir Percy or one of his friends will see you safely on board the English yacht He has given me his promise that he will do this and I trust him as I would myself For the journey through France my name is a sufficient guarantee that you will be unmolested and if you will allow it my mother and Anne Mie will travel in your company Then I pray you stop Citizen Deroulede she suddenly interrupted excitedly You must forgive me but I cannot allow thus to make any arrangements for me Petronelle and I must do as best we can All your time and trouble should be spent for the benefit of those who have a claim upon you whilst I You speak unkindly mademoiselle there is no question of claim And you have no right to think she continued with a growing nervous excitement drawing her hand hurriedly away for he had tried to seize it Ah pardon me he interrupted earnestly there you are wrong I have the right to think of you and for you the inalienable right conferred upon me by my great love for you Citizen Deputy Nay Juliette I know my folly and I know my presumption I know the pride of your caste and of your party and how much you despise the partisan of the squalid mob of France Have I said that I aspired to gain your love I wonder if I have ever dreamed it I only know Juliette that you are to me something akin to the angels something white and ethereal intangible and perhaps ununderstandable Yet knowing my folly I glory in it my dear and I would not let you go out of my life without telling you of that which has made every hour of the past few weeks a paradise for me my love for you Juliette He spoke in that low impressive voice of his and with those soft appealing tones with which she had once heard him pleading for poor Charlotte Corday Yet now he was not pleading for himself not for his selfish wish or for his own happiness only pleading for his love that she should know of it and knowing it have pity in her heart for him and let him serve her to the end He did not say anything more for a while he had taken her hand which she no longer withdrew from him for there was sweet pleasure in feeling his strong fingers close tremblingly over hers He pressed his lips upon her hand upon the soft palm and delicate wrist his burning kisses bearing witness to the tumultuous passion which his reverence for her was holding in check She tried to tear herself away from him but he would not let her go Do not go away just yet Juliette he pleaded Think I may never see you again but when you are far from me in England perhaps amongst your own kith and kin will you try sometimes to think kindly of one who so wildly so madly worships you She would have stilled an she could the beating of her heart which went out to him at last with all the passionate intensity of her great pent up love Every word he spoke had its echo within her very soul and she tried not to hear his tender appeal not to see his dark head bending in worship before her She tried to forget his presence not to know that he was there he the man whom she had betrayed to serve her own miserable vengeance whom in her mad exalted rage she had thought that she hated but whom she now knew that she loved better than her life better than her soul her traditions or her oath Now at this moment she made every effort to conjure up the vision of her brother brought home dead upon a stretcher of her father s declining years rendered hideous by the mind unhinged through the great sorrow She tried to think of the avenging finger of God pointing the way to the fulfilment of her oath and called to Him to stand by her in this terrible agony of her soul And God spoke to her at last through the eternal vistas of boundless universe from that heaven which had known no pity His voice came to her now clear awesome and implacable Vengeance is mine I will repay CHAPTER XII The sword of Damocles In the name of the Republic Absorbed in his thoughts his dreams his present happiness Deroulede had heard nothing of what was going on in the house during the past few seconds At first to Anne Mie who was still singing her melancholy ditty over her work in the kitchen there had seemed nothing unusual in the peremptory ring at the front door bell She pulled down her sleeves over her thin arms smoothed down her cooking apron then only did she run to see who the visitor might be As soon as she had opened the door however she understood Five men were standing before her four of whom wore the uniform of the National Guard and the fifth the tricolour scarf fringed with gold which denoted service under the Convention This man seemed to be in command of the others and he immediately stepped into the hall followed by his four companions who at a sign from him effectively cut off Anne Mie from what had been her imminent purpose namely to run to the study and warn Deroulede of his danger That it was danger of the most certain the most deadly kind she never doubted for one moment Even had her instinct not warned her she would have guessed One glance at the five men had sufficed to tell her their attitude their curt word of command their air of authority as they crossed the hall everything revealed the purpose of their visit a domiciliary search in the house of Citizen Deputy Deroulede Merlin s Law of the Suspect was in full operation Someone had denounced the Citizen Deputy to the Committee of Public Safety and in this year of grace seventeen ninety three and I of the Revolution men and women were daily sent to the guillotine on suspicion Anne Mie would have screamed had she dared but instinct such as hers was far too keen to betray her into so injudicious an act She felt that were Paul Deroulede s eyes upon her at this moment he would wish her to remain calm and outwardly serene The foremost man he with the tricolour scarf had already crossed the hall and was standing outside the study door It was his word of command which first roused Deroulede from his dream In the name of the Republic Deroulede did not immediately drop the small hand which a moment ago he had been covering with kisses He held it to his lips once more very gently lingering over this last fond caress as if over an eternal farewell then he straightened out his broad well knit figure and turned to the door He was very pale but there was neither fear nor even surprise expressed in his earnest deep set eyes They still seemed to be looking afar gazing upon a heaven born vision which the touch of her hand and the avowal of his love had conjured up before him In the name of the Republic Once more for the third time according to custom the words rang out clear distinct peremptory In that one fraction of a second whilst those six words were spoken Deroulede s eyes wandered swiftly towards the heavy letter case which now held his condemnation and a wild mad thought the mere animal desire to escape from danger surged up in his brain The plans for the escape of Marie Antoinette the various passports worded in accordance with the possible disguises the unfortunate Queen might assume all these papers were more than sufficient proof of what would be termed his treason against the Republic He could already hear the indictment against him could see the filthy mob of Paris dancing a wild saraband round the tumbril which bore him towards the guillotine he could hear their yells of execration could feel the insults hurled against him by those who had most admired most envied him And from all this he would have escaped if he could if it had not been too late It was but a second or less whilst the words were spoken outside his door and whilst all other thoughts in him were absorbed in this one mad desire for escape He even made a movement as if to snatch up the letter case and to hide it about his person But it was heavy and bulky it would be sure to attract attention and might bring upon him the additional indignity of being forced to submit to a personal search He caught Juliette s eyes fixed upon him with an intensity of gaze which in that same one mad moment revealed to him the depths of her love Then the second s weakness was gone he was once more quiet firm the man of action accustomed to meet danger boldly to rule and to subdue the most turgid mob With a quiet shrug of the shoulders he dismissed all thought of the compromising lettercase and went to the door Already as no reply had come to the third word of command it had been thrown open from outside and Deroulede found himself face to face with the five men Citizen Merlin he said quietly as he recognised the foremost among them Himself Citizen Deputy rejoined the latter with a sneer at your service Anne Mie in a remote corner of the hall had heard the name and felt her very soul sicken at its sound Merlin Author of that infamous Law of the Suspect which had set man against man a father against his son brother against brother and friend against friend had made of every human creature a bloodhound on the track of his fellowmen dogging in order not to be dogged denouncing spying hounding in order not to be denounced And he Merlin gloried in this the most fiendishly evil law ever perpetrated for the degradation of the human race There is that sketch of him in the Musee Carnavalet drawn just before he in his turn went to expiate his crimes on that very guillotine which he had sharpened and wielded so powerfully against his fellows The artist has well caught the slouchy slovenly look of his loosely knit figure his long limbs and narrow head with the snakelike eyes and slightly receding chin Like Marat his model and prototype Merlin affected dirty ragged clothes The real Sanscullottism the downward levelling of his fellowmen to the lowest rung of the social ladder pervaded every action of this noted product of the great Revolution Even Deroulede whose entire soul was filled with a great all understanding pity for the weaknesses of mankind recoiled at sight of this incarnation of the spirit of squalor and degradation of all that was left of the noble Utopian theories of the makers of the Revolution Merlin grinned when he saw Deroulede standing there calm impassive well dressed as if prepared to receive an honoured guest rather than a summons to submit to the greatest indignity a proud man has ever been called upon to suffer Merlin had always hated the popular Citizen Deputy Friend and boon companion of Marat and his gang he had for over two years now exerted all the influence he possessed in order to bring Deroulede under a cloud of suspicion But Deroulede had the ear of the populace No one understood as he did the tone of a Paris mob and the National Convention ever terrified of the volcano it had kindled felt that a popular member of its assembly was more useful alive than dead But now at last Merlin was having his way An anonymous denunciation against Deroulede had reached the Public Prosecutor that day Tinville and Merlin were the fastest of friends so the latter easily obtained the privilege of being the first to proclaim to his hated enemy the news of his downfall He stood facing Deroulede for a moment enjoying the present situation to its full The light from the vast hall struck full upon the powerful figure of the Citizen Deputy and upon his firm dark face and magnetic restless eyes Behind him the study with its closely drawn shutters appeared wrapped in gloom Merlin turned to his men and still delighted with his position of a cat playing with a mouse he pointed to Deroulede with a smile and a shrug of the shoulders Voyez moi donc ca he said with a coarse jest and expectorating contemptuously upon the floor the aristocrat seems not to understand that we are here in the name of the Republic There is a very good proverb Citizen Deputy he added once more addressing Deroulede which you seem to have forgotten and that is that the pitcher which goes too often to the well breaks at last You have conspired against the liberties of the people for the past ten years Retribution has come to you at last the people of France have come to their senses The National Convention wants to know what treason you are hatching between these four walls and it has deputed me to find out all there is to know At your service Citizen Deputy said Deroulede quietly stepping aside in order to make way for Merlin and his men Resistance was useless and like all strong determined natures he knew when it was best to give in During this while Juliette had neither moved nor uttered a sound Little more than a minute had elapsed since the moment when the first peremptory order to open in the name of the Republic had sounded like the tocsin through the stillness of the house Deroulede s kisses were still hot upon her hand his words of love were still ringing in her ears And now this awful deadly peril which she with her own hand had brought on the man she loved If in one moment s anguish the soul be allowed to expiate a lifelong sin then indeed did Juliette atone during this one terrible second Her conscience her heart her entire being rose in revolt against her crime Her oath her life her final denunciation appeared before her in all their hideousness And now it was too late Deroulede stood facing Merlin his most implacable enemy The latter was giving orders to his men preparatory to searching the house and there just on the top of the valise lay the letter case obviously containing those papers to which the day before she had overheard Deroulede making allusion whilst he spoke to his friend Sir Percy Blakeney An unexplainable instinct seemed to tell her that the papers were in that case Her eyes were riveted on it as if fascinated An awful terror held her enthralled for one second more whilst her thoughts her longings her desires were all centred on the safety of that one thing The next instant she had seized it and thrown it upon the sofa Then seating herself beside it with the gesture of a queen and the grace of a Parisienne she had spread the ample folds of her skirts over the compromising case hiding it entirely from view Merlin in the hall was ordering two men to stand one on each side of Deroulede and two more to follow him into the room Now he entered it himself his narrow eyes trying to pierce the semi obscurity which was rendered more palpable by the brillant light in the hall He had not seen Juliette s gesture but he had heard the frou frou of her skirts as she seated herself upon the sofa You are not alone Citizen Deputy I see he said with a sneer as his snakelike eyes lighted upon the young girl My guest Citizen Merlin replied Deroulede as calmly as he could Citizen Juliette Marny I know that it is useless under these circumstances to ask for consideration for a woman but I pray you to remember as far as is possible that although we are all Republicans we are also Frenchmen and all still equal in our sentiment of chivalry towards our mothers our sisters or our guests Merlin chuckled and gazed for a moment ironically at Juliette He had held between his talon like fingers that very morning a thin scrap of paper on which a schoolgirlish hand had scrawled the denunciation against Citizen Deputy Deroulede Coarse in nature and still coarser in thoughts this representative of the people had very quickly arrived at a conclusion in his mind with regard to this so called guest in the Deroulede household A discarded mistress he muttered to himself Just had another scene I suppose He s got tired of her and she s given him away out of spite Satisfied with this explanation of the situation he was quite inclined to be amiable to Juliette Moreover he had caught sight of the valise and almost thought that the young girl s eyes had directed his attention towards it Open those shutters he commanded this place is like a vault One of the men obeyed immediately and as the brillant August sun came streaming into the room Merlin once more turned to Deroulede Information has been laid against you Citizen Deputy he said by an anonymous writer who states that you have just now in your possession correspondence or other papers intended for the Widow Capet and the Committee of Public Safety has entrusted me and these citizens to seize such correspondence and make you answerable for its presence in your house Deroulede hesitated for one brief fraction of a second As soon as the shutters had been opened and the room flooded in daylight he had at once perceived that his letter case had disappeared and guessed from Juliette s attitude upon the sofa that she had concealed it about her person It was this which caused him to hesitate His heart was filled with boundless gratitude to her for her noble effort to save him but he would have given his life at this moment to undo what she had done The Terrorists were no respecters of persons or of sex A domicillary search order in those days conferred full powers on those in authority and Juliette might at any moment now be peremptorily ordered to rise Through her action she had made herself one with the Citizen Deputy if the case were found under the folds of her skirts she would be accused of connivance or at any rate of the equally grave charge of shielding a traitor The manly pride in him rebelled at the thought of owing his immediate safety to a woman yet he could not now discard her help without compromising her irretrievably He dared not even to look again towards her for he felt that at this moment her life as well as his own lay in the quiver of an eyelid and Merlin s keen narrow eyes were fixed upon him in eager search for a tremor a flash which might betray fear or prove an admission of guilt Juliette sat there calm impassive disdainful and she seemed to Deroulede more angelic more unattainable even than before He could have worshipped her for her heroism her resourcefulness her quiet aloofness from all these coarse creatures who filled the room with the odour of their dirty clothes with their rough jests and their noisome suggestions Well Citizen Deputy sneered Merlin after a while you do not reply I notice The insinuation is unworthy of a reply citizen replied Deroulede quietly my services to the Republic are well known I should have thought that the Committee of Public Safety would disdain an anonymous denunciation against a faithful servant of the people of France The Committee of Public Safety knows its own business best Citizen Deputy rejoined Merlin roughly If the accusation prove a calumny so much the better for you I presume he added with a sneer that you do not propose to offer any resistance whilst these citizens and I search your house Without another word Deroulede handed a bunch of keys to the man by his side Every kind of opposition argument even would be worse than useless Merlin had ordered the valise and desk to be searched and two men were busy turning out the contents of both on to the floor But the desk now only contained a few private household accounts and notes for the various speeches which Deroulede had at various times delivered in the assemblies of the National Convention Among these a few pencil jottings for his great defence of Charlotte Corday were eagerly seized upon by Merlin and his grimy clawlike hands fastened upon this scrap of paper as upon a welcome prey But there was nothing else of any importance Deroulede was a man of thought and of action with all the enthusiasm of real conviction but none of the carelessness of a fanatic The papers which were contained in the letter case and which he was taking with him to the Conciergerie he considered were necessary to the success of his plans otherwise he never would have kept them and they were the only proofs that could be brought up against him The valise itself was only packed with the few necessaries for a month s sojourn at the Conciergerie and the men under Merlin s guidance were vainly trying to find something anything that might be construed into treasonable correspondence with the unfortunate prisoner there Merlin whilst his men were busy with the search was sprawling in one of the big leather covered chairs on the arms of which his dirty finger nails were beating an impatient devil s tattoo He was at no pains to conceal the intense disappointment which he would experience were his errand to prove fruitless His narrow eyes every now and then wandered towards Juliette as if asking for her help and guidance She understanding his frame of mind responded to the look Shutting her mentality off from the coarse suggestion of his attitude towards her she played her part with cunning and without flinching With a glance here and there she directed the men in their search Deroulede himself could scarcely refrain from looking at her he was puzzled and vaguely marvelled at the perfection with which she carried through her role to the end Merlin found himself baffled He knew quite well that Citizen Deputy Deroulede was not a man to be lightly dealt with No mere suspicion or anonymous denunciation would be sufficient in his case to bring him before the tribunal of the Revolution Unless there were proofs positive irrefutable damnable proofs of Paul Deroulede s treachery the Public Prosecutor would never dare to frame an indictment against him The mob of Paris would rise to defend its idol the hideous hags who plied their knitting at the foot of the scaffold would tear the guillotine down before they would allow Deroulede to mount it This was Deroulede s stronghold the people of Paris whom he had loved through all their infamies and whom he had succoured and helped in their private need and above all the women of Paris whose children he had caused to be tended in the hospitals which he had built for them this they had not yet forgotten and Merlin knew it One day they would forget soon perhaps then they would turn on their former idol and howling send him to his death amidst cries of rancour and execration When that day came there would be no need to worry about treason or about proofs When the populace had forgotten all that he had done then Deroulede would fall But that time was not yet The men had finished ransacking the room every scrap of paper every portable article had been eagerly seized upon Merlin half blind with fury had jumped to his feet Search him he ordered peremptorily Deroulede set his teeth and made no protest calling up every fibre of moral strength within him to aid him in submitting to this indignity At a coarse jest from Merlin he buried his nails into the palms of his hand not to strike the foulmouthed creature in the face But he submitted and stood impassive by whilst the pockets of his coat were turned inside out by the rough hands of the soldiers All the while Juliette had remained silent watching Merlin as any hawk would its prey But the Terrorist through the very coarseness of his nature was in this case completely fooled He knew that it was Juliette who had denounced Deroulede and had satisfied himself as to her motive Because he was low and brutish and degraded he never once suspected the truth never saw in that beautiful young woman anything of the double nature within her of that curious self torturing at times morbid sense of religion and of duty at war with her own upright innately heathy disposition The low born self degraded Terrorist had put his own construction on Juliette s action and with this he was satisfied since it answered to his own estimate of the human race the race which he was doing his best to bring down to the level of the beast Therefore Merlin did not interfere with Juliette but contented himself with insinuating by jest and action what her share in this day s work had been To these hints Deroulede of course paid no heed For him Juliette was as far above political intrigue as the angels He would as soon have suspected one of the saints enshrined in Notre Dame as this beautiful almost ethereal creature who had been sent by Heaven to gladden his heart and to elevate his very thought But Juliette understood Merlin s attitude and guessed that her written denunciation had come into his hands Her every thought every living sensation within her was centred in this one thing to save the man she loved from the consequences of her own crime against him And for this even the shadow of suspicion must be removed from him Merlin s iniquitous law should not touch him again When Deroulede at last had been released after the outrage to which he had been personally subjected Merlin was literally and figuratively too looking about him for an issue to his present dubious position Judging others by his own standard of conduct he feared now that the popular Citizen Deputy would incite the mob against him in revenge for the indignities which he had had to suffer And with it all the Terrorist was convinced that Deroulede was guilty that proofs of his treason did exist if only he knew where to lay hands on them He turned to Juliette with an unexpressed query in his adder like eyes 
3551_7894_000018_000000	train-clean-360	She shrugged her shoulders 
none	none	and made a gesture as if pointing towards the door There are other rooms in the house besides this her gesture seemed to say try them The proofs are there tis for you to find them Merlin had been standing between her and Deroulede so that the latter saw neither query nor reply You are cunning Citizen Deputy said Merlin now turning towards him and no doubt you have been at pains to put your treasonable correspondence out of the way You must understand that the Committee of Public Safety will not be satisfied with a mere examination of your study he added assuming an air of ironical benevolence and I presume you will have no objection if I and these citizen soldiers pay a visit to other portions of your house As you please responded Deroulede drily You will accompany us Citizen Deputy commanded the other curtly The four men of the National Guard formed themselves into line outside the study door with a peremptory nod Merlin ordered Deroulede to pass between them then he too prepared to follow At the door he turned and once more faced Juliette As for you citizeness he said with a sudden access of viciousness against her if you have brought us here on a fool s errand it will go ill with you remember Do not leave the house until our return I may have some questions to put to you CHAPTER XIII Tangled meshes Juliette waited a moment or two until the footsteps of the six men died away up the massive oak stairs For the first time since the sword of Damocles had fallen she was alone with her thoughts She had but a few moments at her command in which to devise an issue out of these tangled meshes which she had woven round the man she loved Merlin and his men would return anon The comedy could not be kept up through another visit from them and while the compromising letter case remained in Deroulede s private study he was in imminent danger at the hands of his enemy She thought for a moment of concealing the case about her person but a second s reflection showed her the futility of such a move She had not seen the papers themselves any one of them might be an absolute proof of Deroulede s guilt the correspondence might be in his handwriting If Merlin furious baffled vicious were to order her to be searched The horror of the indignity made her shudder but she would have submitted to that if thereby she could have saved Deroulede But of this she could not be sure until after she had looked through the papers and this she had not the time to do Her first and greatest idea was to get out of this room his private study with the compromising papers Not a trace of them must be found here if he were to remain beyond suspicion She rose from the sofa and peeped through the door The hall was now deserted from the left wing of the house on the floor above the heavy footsteps of the soldiers and Merlin s occasional brutish laugh could be distinctly heard Juliette listened for a moment trying to understand what was happening Yes they had all gone to Deroulede s bedroom which was on the extreme left at the end of the first floor landing There might be just time to accomplish what she had now resolved to do As best she could she hid the bulky leather case in the folds of her skirt It was literally neck or nothing now If she were caught on the stairs by one of the men nothing could save her or possibly Deroulede At any rate by remaining where she was by leaving the events to shape themselves discovery was absolutely certain She chose to take the risk She slipped noiselessly out of the room and up the great oak stairs Merlin and his men busy with their search in Deroulede s bedroom took no heed of what was going on behind them Juliette arrived on the landing and turned sharply to her right running noiselessly along the thick Aubusson carpet and thence quickly to her own room All this had taken less than a minute to accomplish The very next moment she heard Merlin s voice ordering one of his men to stand at attention on the landing but by that time she was safe inside her room She closed the door noiselessly Petronelle who had been busy all the afternoon packing up her young mistress things had fallen asleep in an arm chair Unconscious of the terrible events which were rapidly succeeding each other in the house the worthy old soul was snoring peaceably with her hands complacently folded on her ample bosom Juliette for the moment took no notice of her As quickly and as dexterously as she could she was tearing open the heavy leather case with a sharp pair of scissors and very soon its contents were scattered before her on the table One glance at them was sufficient to convince her that most of the papers would undoubtedly if found send Deroulede to the guillotine Most of the correspondence was in the Citizen Deputy s handwriting She had of course no time to examine it more closely but instinct naturally told her that it was of a highly compromising character She gathered the papers up into a heap tearing some of them up into strips then she spread them out upon the ash pan in front of the large earthenware stove which stood in a corner of the room Unfortunately this was a hot day in August Her task would have been far easier if she had wished to destroy a bundle of papers in the depth of winter when there was a good fire burning in the stove But her purpose was firm and her incentive the greatest that has ever spurred mankind to heroism Regardless of any consequences to herself she had but the one object in view to save Deroulede at all costs On the wall facing her bed and immediately above a velvet covered prie dieu there was a small figure of the Virgin and Child one of those quaintly pretty devices for holding holy water which the reverent superstition of the past century rendered a necessary adjunct of every girl s room In front of the figure a small lamp was kept perpetually burning This Juliette now took between her fingers carefully lest the tiny flame should die out First she poured the oil over the fragments of paper in the ash pan then with the wick she set fire to the whole compromising correspondence The oil helped the paper to burn quickly the smell or perhaps the presence of Juliette in the room caused worthy old Petronelle to wake It s nothing Petronelle said Juliette quietly only a few old letters I am burning But I want to be alone for a few moments will you go down to the kitchen until I call you Accustomed to do as her young mistress commanded Petronelle rose without a word I have finished putting away your few things my jewel There there why didn t you tell me to burn your papers for you You have soiled your dear hands and Sh Sh Petronelle said Juliette impatiently and gently pushing the garrulous old woman towards the door Run to the kitchen now quickly and don t come out of it until I call you And Petronelle she added you will see soldiers about the house perhaps Soldiers The good God have mercy Don t be frightened Petronelle But they may ask you questions Questions Yes about me My treasure my jewel exclaimed Petronelle in alarm have those devils No no nothing has happened as yet but you know in these times there is always danger Good God Holy Mary Mother of God Nothing ll happen if you try to keep quite calm and do exactly as I tell you Go to the kitchen and wait there until I call you If the soldiers come in and question you if they try to frighten you remember that we have nothing to fear from men and that our lives are in God s keeping All the while that Juliette spoke she was watching the heap of paper being gradually reduced to ashes She tried to fan the flames as best she could but some of the correspondence was on tough paper and was slow in being consumed Petronelle tearful but obedient prepared to leave the room She was overawed by her mistress air of aloofness the pale face rendered ethereally beautiful by the sufferings she had gone through The eyes glowed large and magnetic as if in presence of spiritual visions beyond mortal ken the golden hair looked like a saintly halo above the white immaculate young brow Petronelle made the sign of the cross as if she were in the presence of a saint As she opened the door there was a sudden draught and the last flickering flame died out in the ash pan Juliette seeing that Petronelle had gone hastily turned over the few half burnt fragments of paper that were left In none of them had the writing remained legible All that was compromising to Deroulede was effectually reduced to dust The small wick in the lamp at the foot of the Virgin and Child had burned itself out for want of oil there was no means for Juliette to strike another light and to destroy what remained The leather case was of course still there with its sides ripped open an indestructible thing There was nothing to be done about that Juliette after a second s hesitation threw it among her dresses in the valise Then she too went out of the room CHAPTER XIV A happy moment The search in the Citizen Deputy s bedroom had proved as fruitless as that in his study Merlin was beginning to have vague doubts as to whether he had been effectively fooled His manner towards Deroulede had undergone a change He had become suave and unctuous a kind of elephantine irony pervading his laborious attempts at conciliation He and the Public Prosecutor would be severely blamed for this day s work if the popular Deputy relying upon the support of the people of Paris chose to take his revenge In France in this glorious year of the Revolution there was but one step between censure and indictment And Merlin knew it Therefore although he had not given up all hope of finding proofs of Deroulede s treason although by the latter s attitude he remained quite convinced that such proof did exist he was already reckoning upon the cat s paw the sop he would offer to that Cerberus the Committee of Public Safety in exchange for his own exculpation in the matter This sop would be Juliette the denunciator instead of Deroulede the denounced But he was still seeking for the proofs Somewhat changing his tactics he had allowed Deroulede to join his mother in the living room and had betaken himself to the kitchen in search of Anne Mie whom he had previously caught sight of in the hall There he also found old Petronelle whom he could scare out of her wits to his heart s content but from whom he was quite unable to extract any useful information Petronelle was too stupid to be dangerous and Anne Mie was too much on the alert But with a vague idea that a cunning man might choose the most unlikely places for the concealment of compromising property he was ransacking the kitchen from floor to ceiling In the living room Deroulede was doing his best to reassure his mother who in her turn was forcing herself to be brave and not to show by her tears how deeply she feared for the safety of her son As soon as Deroulede had been freed from the presence of the soldiers he had hastened back to his study only to find that Juliette had gone and that the letter case had also disappeared Not knowing what to think trembling for the safety of the woman he adored he was just debating whether he would seek for her in her own room when she came towards him across the landing There seemed a halo around her now Deroulede felt that she had never been so beautiful and to him so unattainable Something told him then that at this moment she was as far away from him as if she were an inhabitant of another more ethereal planet When she saw him coming towards her she put a finger to her lips and whispered Sh sh the papers are destroyed burned And I owe my safety to you He had said it with his whole soul an infinity of gratitude filled his heart a joy and pride in that she had cared for his safety But at his words she had grown paler than she was before Her eyes large dilated and dark were fixed upon him with an intensity of gaze which almost startled him He thought that she was about to faint that the emotions of the past half hour had been too much for her overstrung nerves He took her hand and gently dragged her into the living room She sank into a chair as if utterly weary and exhausted and he forgetting his danger forgetting the world and all else besides knelt at her feet and held her hands in his She sat bolt upright her great eyes still fixed upon him At first it seemed as if he could not be satiated with looking at her he felt as if he had never never really seen her She had been a dream of beauty to him ever since that awful afternoon when he had held her half fainting in his arms and had dragged her under the shelter of his roof From that hour he had worshipped her she had cast over him the magic spell of her refinement her beauty that aroma of youth and innocence which makes such a strong appeal to the man of sentiment He had worshipped her and not tried to understand He would have deemed it almost sacrilege to pry into the mysteries of her inner self of that second nature in her which at times made her silent and almost morose and cast a lurid gloom over her young beauty And though his love for her had grown in intensity it had remained as heaven born as he deemed her to be the love of a mortal for a saint the ecstatic adoration of a saint Francis for his Madonna Sir Percy Blakeney had called Deroulede an idealist He was that in the strictest sense and Juliette had embodied all that was best in his idealism It was for the first time to day that he had held her hand just for a moment longer than mere conventionality allowed The first kiss on her finger tips had sent the blood rushing wildly to his heart but he still worshipped her and gazed upon her as upon a divinity She sat bolt upright in the chair abandoning her small cold hands to his burning grasp His very senses ached with the longing to clasp her in his arms to draw her to him and to feel her pulses beat closer against his It was almost torture now to gaze upon her beauty that small oval face almost like a child s the large eyes which at times had seemed to be blue but which now appeared to be a deep unfathomable colour like the tempestuous sea Juliette he murmured at last as his soul went out to her in a passionate appeal for the first kiss A shudder seemed to go through her entire frame her very lips turned white and cold and he not understanding timorous chivalrous and humble thought that she was repelled by his ardour and frightened by a passion to which she was too pure to respond Nothing but that one word had been spoken just her name an appeal from a strong man overmastered at last by his boundless love and she poor stricken soul who had so much loved so deeply wronged him shuddered at the thought of what she might have done had Fate not helped her to save him Half ashamed of his passion he bowed his dark head over her hands and once more forcing himself to be calm now he kissed her finger tips reverently When he looked up again the hard lines in her face had softened and two tears were slowly trickling down her pale cheeks Will you forgive me madonna he said gently I am only a man and you are very beautiful No don t take your little hands away I am quite calm now and know how one should speak to angels Reason justice rectitude everything was urging Juliette to close her ears to the words of love spoken by the man whom she had betrayed But who shall blame her for listening to the sweetest sound the ears of a woman can ever hear the sound of the voice of the loved one in his first declaration of love She sat and listened whilst he whispered to her those soft endearing words of which a strong man alone possesses the enchanting secret She sat and listened whilst all around her was still Madame Deroulede at the farther end of the room was softly muttering a few prayers They were all alone these two in the mad and beautiful world which man has created for himself the world of romance that world more wonderful than any heaven where only those may enter who have learned the sweet lesson of love Deroulede roamed in it at will He had created his own romance wherein he was as a humble worshipper spending his life in the service of his madonna And she too forgot the earth forgot the reality her oath her crime and its punishment and began to think that it was good to live good to love and good to have at her feet the one man in all the world whom she could fondly worship Who shall tell what he whispered Enough that she listened and that she smiled and he seeing her smile felt happy CHAPTER XV Detected The opening and shutting of the door roused them both from their dreams Anne Mie pale trembling with eyes looking wild and terrified had glided into the room Deroulede had sprung to his feet In a moment he had thrust his own happiness into the background at sight of the poor child s obvious suffering He went quickly towards her and would have spoken to her but she ran past him up to Madame Deroulede as if she were beside herself with some unexplainable terror Anne Mie he said firmly what is it Have those devils dared In a moment reality had come rushing back upon him with full force and bitter reproaches surged up in his heart against himself for having in this moment of selfish joy forgotten those who looked up to him for help and protection He knew the temper of the brutes who had been set upon his track knew that low minded Merlin and his noisome ways and blamed himself severely for having left Anne Mie and Petronelle alone with him even for a few moments But Anne Mie quickly reassured him They have not molested us much she said speaking with a visible effort and enforced calmness Petronelle and I were together and they made us open all the cupboards and uncover all the dishes They then asked us many questions Questions Of what kind asked Deroulede About you Paul replied Anne Mie and about maman and also about about the citizeness your guest Deroulede looked at her closely vaguely wondering at the strange attitude of the child She was evidently labouring under some strong excitement and in her thin brown little hand she was clutching a piece of paper Anne Mie Child he said very gently you seem quite upset as if something terrible had happened What is that paper you are holding my dear Anne Mie gazed down upon it She was obviously making frantic efforts to maintain her self possession Juliette at first sight of Anne Mie seemed literally to have been turned to stone She sat upright rigid as a statue her eyes fixed upon the poor crippled girl as if upon an inexorable judge about to pronounce sentence upon her of life or death Instinct that keen sense of coming danger which Nature sometimes gives to her elect had told her that within the next few seconds her doom would be sealed that Fate would descend upon her holding the sword of Nemesis and it was Anne Mie s tiny half shrivelled hand which had placed that sword into the grasp of Fate What is that paper Will you let me see it Anne Mie repeated Deroulede Citizen Merlin gave it to me just now began Anne Mie more quietly he seems very wroth at finding nothing compromising against you Paul They were a long time in the kitchen and now they have gone to search my room and Petronelle s but Merlin oh that awful man he seemed like a beast infuriated with his disappointment Yes yes I don t know what he hoped to get out of me for I told him that you never spoke to your mother or to me about your political business and that I was not in the habit of listening at the keyholes Yes And Then he began to speak of of our guest but of course there again I could tell him nothing He seemed to be puzzled as to who had denounced you He spoke about an anonymous denunciation which reached the Public Prosecutor early this morning It was written on a scrap of paper and thrown into the public box it seems and It is indeed very strange said Deroulede musing over this extraordinary occurrence and still more over Anne Mie s strange excitement in the telling of it I never knew I had a hidden enemy I wonder if I shall ever find out That is just what I said to Citizen Merlin rejoined Anne Mie What That I wondered if you or or any of us who love you will ever find out who your hidden enemy might be It was a mistake to talk so fully with such a brute little one I didn t say much and I thought it wisest to humour him as he seemed to wish to talk on that subject Well And what did he say He laughed and asked me if I would very much like to know I hope you said No Anne Mie Indeed indeed I said Yes she retorted with sudden energy her eyes fixed now upon Juliette who still sat rigid and silent watching every movement of Anne Mie from the moment in which she began to tell her story Would I not wish to know who is your enemy Paul the creature who was base and treacherous enough to attempt to deliver you into the hands of those merciless villains What wrong had you done to anyone Sh Hush Anne Mie you are too excited he said smiling now in spite of himself at the young girl s vehemence over what he thought was but a trifle the discovery of his own enemy I am sorry Paul How can I help being excited rejoined Anne Mie with quaint pathetic gentleness when I speak of such base treachery as that which Merlin has suggested Well And what did he suggest He did more than suggest whispered Anne Mie almost inaudibly he gave me this paper the anonymous denunciation which reached the Public Prosecutor this morning he thought one of us might recognise the handwriting Then she paused some five steps away from Deroulede holding out towards him the crumpled paper which up to now she had clutched determinedly in her hand Deroulede was about to take it from her and just before he had turned to do so his eyes lighted on Juliette She said nothing she had merely risen instinctively and had reached Anne Mie s side in less than the fraction of a second It was all a flash and there was dead silence in the room but in that one hundredth part of a second Deroulede had read guilt in the face of Juliette It was nothing but instinct a sudden awful unexplainable revelation Her soul seemed suddenly to stand before him in all its misery and in all its sin It was if the fire from heaven had descended in one terrific crash burying beneath its devastating flames his ideals his happiness and his divinity She was no longer there His madonna had ceased to be There stood before him a beautiful woman on whom he had lavished all the pent up treasures of his love whom he had succoured sheltered and protected and who had repaid him thus She had forced an entry into his house she had spied upon him dogged him lied to him The moment was too sudden too awful for him to make even a wild guess at her motives His entire life his whole past the present and the future were all blotted out in this awful dispersal of his most cherished dream He had forgotten everything else save her appalling treachery how could he even remember that once long ago in fair fight he had killed her brother She did not even try now to hide her guilt A look of appeal touching in its trustfulness went out to him begging him to spare her further shame Perhaps she felt that love such as his could not be killed in a flash His entire nature was full of pity and to that pity she made a final appeal lest she should be humiliated before Madame Deroulede and Anne Mie And he still under the spell of those magic moments when he had knelt at her feet understood her prayer and closing his eyes just for one brief moment in order to shut out for ever that radiant vision of a pure angel whom he had worshipped turned quietly to Anne Mie Give me that paper Anne Mie he said coldly I may perhaps recognise the handwriting of my most bitter enemy Tis unnecessary now replied Anne Mie slowly still gazing at the face of Juliette in which she too had read what she wished to read The paper dropped out of her hand Deroulede stooped to pick it up He unfolded it smoothed it out and then saw that it was blank There is nothing written on this paper he said mechanically No rejoined Anne Mie no other words save the story of her treachery What you have done is evil and wicked Anne Mie Perhaps so but I had guessed the truth and I wished to know God showed me this way how to do it and how to let you know as well The less you speak of God just now Anne Mie the better I think Will you attend to maman she seems faint and ill Madame Deroulede silent and placid in her arm chair had watched the tragic scene before her almost like a disinterested spectator All her ideas and all her thoughts had been paralysed since the moment when the first summons at the front door had warned her of the imminence of the peril to her son The final discovery of Juliette s treachery had left her impassive Since her son was in danger she cared little as to whence that danger had come Obedient to Deroulede s wish Anne Mie was attending to the old lady s comforts The poor crippled girl was already feeling the terrible reaction of her deed In her childish mind she had planned this way in which to bring the traitor to shame Anne Mie knew nothing cared nothing about the motives which had actuated Juliette all she knew was that a terrible Judas like deed had been perpetrated against the man on whom she herself had lavished her pathetic hopeless love All the pent up jealousy which had tortured her for the past three weeks rose up and goaded her into unmasking her rival Never for a moment did she doubt Juliette s guilt The god of love may be blind tradition has so decreed it but the demon of jealousy has a hundred eyes more keen than those of the lynx Anne Mie pushed aside by Merlin s men when they forced their way into Deroulede s study had nevertheless followed them to the door When the curtains were drawn aside and the room filled with light she had seen Juliette enthroned apparently calm and placid upon the sofa It was instinct the instinct born of her own rejected passion which caused her to read in the beautiful girl s face all that lay hidden behind the pale impassive mask That same second sight made her understand Merlin s hints and allusions She caught every inflection of his voice heard everything saw everything And in the midst of her anxiety and her terrors for the man she loved there was the wild primitive intensely human joy at the thought of bringing that enthroned idol who had stolen his love down to earth at last Anne Mie was not clever she was simple and childish with no complexity of passions or devious ways of intellect It was her elemental jealousy which suggested the cunning plan for the unmasking of Juliette She would make the girl cringe and fear threaten her with discovery and through her very terror shame her before Paul Deroulede And now it was all done it had all occurred as she had planned it Paul knew that his love had been wasted upon a liar and a traitor and Juliette stood pale humiliated a veritable wreck of shamed humanity Anne Mie had triumphed and was profoundly abjectly wretched in her triumph Great sobs seemed to tear at her very heart strings She had pulled down Paul s idol from her pedestal but the one look she had cast at his face had shown her that she had also wrecked his life He seemed almost old now The earnest restless gaze had gone from his eyes he was staring mutely before him twisting between nerveless fingers that blank scrap of paper which had been the means of annihilating his dream All energy of attitude all strength of bearing which were his chief characteristics seemed to have gone There was a look of complete blankness of hopelessness in his listless gesture How he loved her sighed Anne Mie as she tenderly wrapped the shawl round Madame Deroulede s shoulders Juliette had said nothing it seemed as if her very life had gone out of her She was a mere statue now her mind numb her heart dead her very existence a fragile piece of mechanism But she was looking at Deroulede That one sense in her had remained alive her sight She looked and looked and saw every passing sign of mental agony on his face the look of recognition of her guilt the bewilderment at the appalling crash and now that hideous deathlike emptiness of his soul and mind Never once did she detect horror or loathing He had tried to save her from being further humiliated before his mother but there was no hatred or contempt in his eyes when he realised that she had been unmasked by a trick She looked and looked for there was no hope in her not even despair There was nothing in her mind nothing in her soul but a great pall like blank Then gradually as the minutes sped on she saw the strong soul within him make a sudden fight against the darkness of his despair the movement of the fingers became less listless the powerful energetic figure straightened itself out remembrance of other matters other interests than his own began to lift the overwhelming burden of his grief He remembered the letter case containing the compromising papers A vague wonder arose in him as to Juliette s motives in warding off through her concealment of it the inevitable moment of its discovery by Merlin The thought that her entire being had undergone a change and that she now wished to save him never once entered his mind if it had he would have dismissed it as the outcome of maudlin sentimentality the conceit of the fop who believes his personality to be irresistible His own self torturing humility pointed but to the one conclusion that she had fooled him all along fooled him when she sought his protection fooled him when she taught him to love her fooled him above all at the moment when subjugated by the intensity of his passion he had for one brief second ceased to worship in order to love When the bitter remembrance of that moment of sweetest folly rushed back to his aching brain then at last did he look up at her with one final agonised look of reproach so great so tender and yet so final that Anne Mie who saw it felt as if her own heart would break with the pity of it all But Juliette had caught the look too The tension of her nerves seemed suddenly to relax Memory rushed back upon her with tumultuous intensity Very gradually her knees gave beneath her and at last she knelt down on the floor before him her golden head bent under the burden of her guilt and her shame CHAPTER XVI Under arrest Deroulede did not attempt to go to her Only presently when the heavy footsteps of Merlin and his men were once more heard upon the landing she quietly rose to her feet She had accomplished her act of humiliation and repentance there before them all She looked for the last time upon those whom she had so deeply wronged and in her heart spoke an eternal farewell to that great and mighty and holy love which she had called forth and then had so hopelessly crushed Now she was ready for the 
3551_7894_000001_000000	train-clean-360	atonement 
none	none	Merlin had already swaggered into the room The long and arduous search throughout the house had not improved either his temper or his personal appearance He was more covered with grime than he had been before and his narrow forehead had almost disappeared beneath the tangled mass of his ill kempt hair which he had perpetually tugged forward and roughed up in his angry impatience One look at his face had already told Juliette what she wished to know He had searched her room and found the fragments of burnt paper which she had purposely left in the ash pan How he would act now was the one thing of importance left for Juliette to ponder over That she would not escape arrest and condemnation was at once made clear to her Merlin s look of sneering contempt when he glanced towards her had told her that Deroulede himself had been conscious of a feeling of intense relief when the men re entered the room The tension had become unendurable When he saw his dethroned madonna kneel in humiliation at his feet an overwhelming pain had wrenched his very heart strings And yet he could not go to her The passionate human nature within him felt a certain proud exultation at seeing her there She was not above him now she was no longer akin to the angels He had given no further thought to his own immediate danger Vaguely he guessed that Merlin would find the leather case Where it was he could not tell perhaps Juliette herself had handed it to the soldiers She had only hidden it for a few moments out of impulse perhaps fearing lest at the first instant of its discovery Merlin might betray her He remembered now those hints and insinuations which had gone out from the Terrorist to Juliette whilst the search was being conducted in the study At the time he had merely looked upon these as a base attempt at insult and had tortured himself almost beyond bearing in the endeavour to refrain from punishing that evilmouthed creature who dared to bandy words with his madonna But now he understood and felt his very soul writhing with shame at the remembrance of it all Oh yes the return of Merlin and his men the presence of these grimy degraded brutes was welcome now He would have wished to crowd in the entire world the universe and its population between him and his fallen idol Merlin s manner towards him had lost nothing of its ironical benevolence There was even a touch of obsequiousness apparent in the ugly face as the representative of the people approached the popular Citizen Deputy Citizen Deputy began Merlin I have to bring you the welcome news that we have found nothing in your house that in any way can cast suspicion upon your loyalty to the Republic My orders however were to bring you before the Committee of Public Safety whether I had found proofs of your guilt or not I have found none He was watching Deroulede keenly hoping even at this eleventh hour to detect a look or a sign which would furnish him with the proofs for which he was seeking The slightest suggestion of relief on Deroulede s part a sigh of satisfaction would have been sufficient at this moment to convince him and the Committee of Public Safety that the Citizen Deputy was guilty after all But Deroulede never moved He was sufficiently master of himself not to express either surprise or satisfaction Yet he felt both satisfaction not for his own safety but because of his mother and Anne Mie whom he would immediately send out of the country out of all danger and also because of her of Juliette Marny his guest who whatever she may have done against him had still a claim on his protection His feeling of surprise was less keen and quite transient Merlin had not found the letter case Juliette stricken with tardy remorse perhaps had succeeded in concealing it The matter had practically ceased to interest him It was equally galling to owe his betrayal or his ultimate safety to her He kissed his mother tenderly bidding her good bye and pressed Anne Mie s timid little hand warmly between his own He did what he could to reassure them but for their own sakes he dared say nothing before Merlin as to his plans for their safety After that he was ready to follow the soldiers As he passed close to Juliette he bowed and almost inaudibly whispered Adieu She heard the whisper but did not respond Her look alone gave him the reply to his eternal farewell His footsteps and those of his escort were heard echoing down the staircase then the hall door to open and shut Through the open window came the sound of hoarse cheering as the popular Citizen Deputy appeared in the street Merlin with two men beside him remained under the portico he told off the other two to escort Deroulede as far as the Hall of Justice where sat the members of the Committee of Public Safety The Terrorist had a vague fear that the Citizen Deputy would speak to the mob An unruly crowd of women had evidently been awaiting his appearance The news had quickly spread along the streets that Merlin Merlin himself the ardent bloodthirsty Jacobin had made a descent upon Paul Deroulede s house escorted by four soldiers Such an indignity put upon the man they most trusted in the entire assembly of the Convention had greatly incensed the crowd The women jeered at the soldiers as soon as they appeared and Merlin dared not actually forbid Deroulede to speak A la lanterne vieux cretin shouted one of the women thrusting her fist under Merlin s nose Give the word Citizen Deputy rejoined another and we ll break his ugly face Nous lui casserons la gueule A la lanterne A la lanterne One word from Deroulede now would have caused an open riot and in those days self defence against the mob was construed into enmity against the people Merlin s work too was not yet accomplished He had had no intention of escorting Deroulede himself he had still important business to transact inside the house which he had just quitted and had merely wished to get the Citizen Deputy well out of the way before he went upstairs again Moreover he had expected something of a riot in the streets The temper of the people of Paris was at fever heat just now The hatred of the populace against a certain class and against certain individuals was only equalled by their enthusiasm in favour of others They had worshipped Marat for his squalor and his vices they worshipped Danton for his energy and Robespierre for his calm they worshipped Deroulede for his voice his gentleness and his pity for his care of their children and the eloquence of his speech It was that eloquence which Merlin feared now but he little knew the type of man he had to deal with Deroulede s influence over the most unruly the most vicious populace the history of the world has ever known was not obtained through fanning its passions That popularity though brilliant is always ephemeral The passions of a mob will invariably turn against those who have helped to rouse them Marat did not live to see the waning of his star Danton was dragged to the guillotine by those whom he had taught to look upon that instrument of death as the only possible and unanswerable political argument Robespierre succumbed to the orgies of bloodshed he himself had brought about But Deroulede remained master of the people of Paris for as long as he chose to exert that mastery When they listened to him they felt better nobler less hopelessly degraded He kept up in their poor misguided hearts that last flickering sense of manhood which their bloodthirsty tyrants under the guise of Fraternity and Equality were doing their best to smother Even now when he might have turned the temper of the small crowd outside his door to his own advantage he preferred to say nothing he even pacified them with a gesture He well knew that those whom he incited against Merlin now would once their blood was up probably turn against him in less than half an hour Merlin who all along had meant to return to the house took his opportunity now He allowed Deroulede and the two men to go on ahead and beat a hasty retreat back into the house followed by the jeers of the women A la lanterne vieux cretin they shouted as soon as the hall door was once more closed in their faces A few of them began hammering against the door with their fists then they realised that their special favourite Citizen Deputy Deroulede was marching along between two soldiers as if he were a prisoner The word went round that he was under arrest and was being taken to the Hall of Justice a prisoner This was not to be The mob of Paris had been taught that it was the master in the city and it had learned its lesson well For the moment it had chosen to take Paul Deroulede under its special protection and as a guard of honour to him the women in ragged kirtles the men with bare legs and stripped to the waist the children all yelling hooting and shrieking followed him to see that none dared harm him

none	none	 Atonement Merlin waited a while in the hall until he heard the noise of the shrieking crowd gradually die away in the distance then with a grunt of satisfaction he one more mounted the stairs All these events outside had occurred during a very few minutes and Madame Deroulede and Anne Mie had been too anxious as to what was happening in the streets to take any notice of Juliette They had not dared to step out on to the balcony to see what was going on and therefore did not understand what the reopening and shutting of the front door had meant The next instant however Merlin s heavy slouching footsteps on the stairs had caused Anne Mie to look round in alarm
3551_7894_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 It is only the soldiers come back for me said Juliette quietly 
none	none	For you
3551_7894_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes they are coming to take me away 
none	none	I suppose they did not wish to do it in the presence of mister Deroulede for fear She had no time to say more Anne Mie was still looking at her in awed and mute surprise when Merlin entered the room 
3551_7894_000010_000000	train-clean-360	In his hand he held a leather case all torn and split at one end and a few tiny scraps of half charred paper 
none	none	He walked straight up to Juliette and roughly thrust the case and papers into her face
3551_7894_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 These are yours he said roughly 
none	none	Yes I suppose you know where they were found 
3551_7894_000014_000000	train-clean-360	She nodded quietly in reply 
3551_7894_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 What were these papers which you burnt 
3551_7894_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Love letters 
3551_7894_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 You lie 
none	none	She shrugged her shoulders
3551_7894_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 As you please she said curtly 
3551_7894_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 What were these papers he repeated with a loud obscene oath which however had not the power to disturb the young girl s serenity 
3551_7894_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I have told you she said love letters which I wished to burn 
3551_7894_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Who was your lover he asked 
none	none	Then as she did not reply he indicated the street where cries of Deroulede Vive Deroulede still echoed from afar Were the letters from him No You had more than one lover then He laughed and a hideous leer seemed further to distort his ugly countenance 
3551_7894_000028_000000	train-clean-360	He thrust his face quite close to hers and she closed her eyes sick with the horror of this contact with the degraded wretch 
none	none	Even Anne Mie had uttered a cry of sympathy at sight of this evil smelling squalid creature torturing with his close proximity the beautiful refined girl before him With a rough gesture he put his clawlike hand under her delicate chin forcing her to turn round and to look at him 
3551_7894_000029_000001	train-clean-360	She shuddered at the loathsome touch but her quietude never forsook her for a moment 
none	none	It was into the power of wretches such as this man that she had wilfully delivered the man she loved This brutish creature s familiarity put the finishing touch to her own degradation but it gave her the courage to carry through her purpose to the end You had more than one lover then said Merlin with a laugh which would have pleased the devil himself And you wished to send one of them to the guillotine in order to make way for the other 
3551_7894_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Was that it 
none	none	Was that it he repeated suddenly seizing one of her wrists and giving it as savage twist so that she almost screamed with the pain
3551_7894_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes she replied firmly 
none	none	Do you know that you brought me here on a fool s errand he asked viciously that the Citizen Deputy Deroulede cannot be sent to the guillotine on mere suspicion eh Did you know that when you wrote out that denunciation No I did not know You thought we could arrest him on mere suspicion Yes You knew he was Innocent
3551_7894_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I knew it 
none	none	Why did you burn your love letters I was afraid that they would be found and would be brought under the notice of the Citizen Deputy A splendid combination ma foi said Merlin with an oath as he turned to the two other women who sat pale and shrinking in a corner of the room not understanding what was going on not knowing what to think or what to believe They had known nothing of Deroulede s plans for the escape of Marie Antoinette they didn t know what the letter case had contained and yet they both vaguely felt that the beautiful girl who stood up so calmly before the loathsome Terrorist was not a wanton as she tried to make out but only misguided mad perhaps perhaps a martyr Did you know anything of this queried Merlin roughly from trembling Anne Mie
3551_7894_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing she replied 
none	none	No one knew anything of my private affairs or of my private correspondence said Juliette coldly as you say it was a splendid combination I had hoped that it would succeed But I understand now that Citizen Deputy Deroulede is a personage of too much importance to be brought to trial on mere suspicion and my denunciation of him was not based on facts And do you know my fine aristocrat sneered Merlin viciously that it is not wise either to fool the Committee of Public Safety or to denounce without cause one of the representatives of the people I know she rejoined quietly that you Citizen Merlin are determined that someone shall pay for this day s blunder You dare not now attack the Citizen Deputy and so you must be content with me Enough of this talk now I have no time to bandy words with aristos he said roughly Come now follow the men quietly 
3551_7894_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Resistance would only aggravate your case 
none	none	I am quite prepared to follow you May I speak two words to my friends before I go No I may never be able to speak to them again I have said No and I mean No Now then forward 
3551_7894_000053_000002	train-clean-360	March 
none	none	I have wasted too much time already 
3551_7894_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Juliette was too proud to insist any further 
none	none	She had hoped by one word to soften Madame Deroulede s and Anne Mie s heart towards her She did not know whether they believed that miserable lie which she had been telling to Merlin she only guessed that for the moment they still thought her the betrayer of Paul Deroulede 
3551_7894_000055_000000	train-clean-360	But that one word was not to be spoken 
none	none	She would have to go forth to her certain trial to her probable death under the awful cloud which she herself had brought over her own life She turned quietly and walked towards the door where the two men already stood at attention Then it was that some heaven born instinct seemed suddenly to guide Anne Mie 
3551_7894_000057_000001	train-clean-360	The crippled girl was face to face with a psychological problem which in itself was far beyond her comprehension but vaguely she felt that it was a problem 
none	none	Something in Juliette s face had already caused her to bitterly repent her action towards her and now as this beautiful refined woman was about to pass from under the shelter of this roof to the cruel publicity and terrible torture of that awful revolutionary tribunal Anne Mie s whole heart went out to her in boundless sympathy Before Merlin or the men could prevent her she had run up to Juliette taken her hand which hung listless and cold and kissed it tenderly 
3551_7894_000059_000000	train-clean-360	Juliette seemed to wake as if from a dream 
none	none	She looked down at Anne Mie with a glance of hope almost of joy and whispered It was an oath I swore it to my father and my dead brother Tell him Anne Mie could only nod she could not speak for her tears were choking her But I ll atone with my life 
3551_7894_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Tell him whispered Juliette 
3551_7894_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Now then shouted Merlin out of the way hunchback unless you want to come along too 
none	none	Forgive me said Anne Mie through her tears 
3551_7894_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Then the men pushed her roughly aside 
3551_7894_000065_000001	train-clean-360	But at the door Juliette turned to her once more and said 
none	none	Petronelle take care of her 
3551_7894_000067_000000	train-clean-360	And with a firm step she followed the soldiers out of the room 
none	none	Presently the front door was heard to open then to shut with a loud bang and the house in the Rue Ecole de Medecine was left in silence 
3551_7894_000069_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XVIII
none	none	 In the Luxembourg prison Juliette was alone at last that is to say comparatively alone for there were too many aristocrats too many criminels and traitors in the prisons of Paris now to allow of any seclusion of those who were about to be tried condemned and guillotined The young girl had been marched through the crowded streets of Paris followed by a jeering mob who readily recognised in the gentle high bred girl the obvious prey which the Committee of Public Safety was wont from time to time to throw to the hungry hydra headed dog of the Revolution Lately the squalid spectators of the noisome spectacle on the Place de la Guillotine had had few of these very welcome sights an aristocrat a real elegant refined woman with white hands and proud pale face mounting the steps of the same scaffold on which perished the vilest criminals and most degraded brutes 
3551_7894_000074_000000	train-clean-360	Madame Guillotine was above all catholic in her tastes her gaunt arms painted blood red were open alike to the murderer and the thief the aristocrats of ancient lineage and the proletariat from the gutter 
3551_7894_000075_000000	train-clean-360	But lately the executions had been almost exclusively of a political character 
none	none	The Girondins were fighting their last upon the bloody arena of the Revolution One by one they fell still fighting still preaching moderation still foretelling disaster and appealing to that people whom they had roused from one slavery in order to throw it headlong under a tyrannical yoke more brutish more absolute than before 
3551_7894_000076_000000	train-clean-360	There were twelve prisons in Paris then and forty thousand in France and they were all full 
none	none	An entire army went round the country recruiting prisoners 
3551_7894_000076_000002	train-clean-360	There was no room for separate cells no room for privacy no cause or desire for the most elementary sense of delicacy 
3551_7894_000077_000000	train-clean-360	Women men children all were herded together for one day perhaps two and a night or so and then death would obliterate the petty annoyances the womanly blushes caused by this sordid propinquity 
3551_7894_000078_000000	train-clean-360	Death levelled all erased everything 
3551_7894_000079_000000	train-clean-360	When Marie Antoinette mounted the guillotine she had forgotten that for six weeks she practically lived day and night in the immediate companionship of a set of degraded soldiery 
3551_7894_000080_000000	train-clean-360	Juliette as she marched through the streets between two men of the National Guard and followed by Merlin was hooted and jeered at insulted pelted with mud 
3551_7894_000080_000001	train-clean-360	One woman tried to push past the soldiers and to strike her in the face a woman not thirty and who was dragging a pale squalid little boy by the hand 
none	none	Crache donc sur l aristo voyons the woman said to this poor miserable little scrap of humanity as the soldiers pushed her roughly aside
3551_7894_000081_000001	train-clean-360	 Spit on the aristocrat And the child tortured its own small parched mouth so that in obedience to its mother it might defile and bespatter a beautiful innocent girl 
none	none	The soldiers laughed and improved the occasion with another insulting jest Even Merlin forgot his vexation delighted at the incident 
3551_7894_000083_000000	train-clean-360	But Juliette had seen nothing of it all 
3551_7894_000084_000000	train-clean-360	She was walking as in a dream 
3551_7894_000084_000001	train-clean-360	The mob did not exist for her she heard neither insult nor vituperation 
none	none	She did not see the evil dirty faces pushed now and then quite close to her she did not feel the rough hands of the soldiers jostling her through the crowd she had gone back to her own world of romance where she dwelt alone now with the man she loved Instead of the squalid houses of Paris with their eternal device of Fraternity and Equality there were beautiful trees and shrubs of laurel and of roses around her making the air fragrant with their soft intoxicating perfumes sweet voices from the land of dreams filled the atmosphere with their tender murmur whilst overhead a cloudless sky illumined this earthly paradise 
3551_7894_000085_000000	train-clean-360	She was happy supremely completely happy 
3551_7894_000085_000001	train-clean-360	She had saved him from the consequences of her own iniquitous crime and she was about to give her life for him so that his safety might be more completely assured 
3551_7894_000086_000000	train-clean-360	Her love for him he would never know now he knew only her crime but presently when she would be convicted and condemned confronted with a few scraps of burned paper and a torn letter case then he would know that she had stood her trial self accused and meant to die for him 
none	none	Therfore the past few moments were now wholly hers She had the rights to dwell on those few happy seconds when she listened to the avowal of his love 
3551_7894_000087_000002	train-clean-360	It was ethereal and perhaps not altogether human but it was hers 
3551_7894_000087_000003	train-clean-360	She had been his divinity his madonna he had loved in her that which was her truer her better self 
none	none	What was base in her was not truly her 
3551_7894_000088_000001	train-clean-360	That awful oath sworn so solemnly had been her relentless tyrant and her religion a religion of superstition and of false ideals had blinded her and dragged her into crime 
3551_7894_000089_000000	train-clean-360	She had arrogated to herself that which was God s alone Vengeance which is not for man 
3551_7894_000090_000000	train-clean-360	That through it all she should have known love and learned its tender secrets was more than she deserved 
none	none	That she should have felt his burning kisses on her hand was heavenly compensation for all she would have to suffer And so she allowed them to drag her through the sansculotte mob of Paris who would have torn her to pieces then and there so as not to delay the pleasure of seeing her die They took her to the Luxembourg once the palace of the Medici the home of proud Monsieur in the days of the Great Monarch now a loathsome overfilled prison It was then six o clock in the afternoon drawing towards the close of this memorable day 
3551_7894_000093_000001	train-clean-360	She was handed over to the governor of the prison a short thick set man in black trousers and black shag woollen shirt and wearing a dirty red cap with tricolour rosette on the side of his unkempt head 
none	none	He eyed her up and down as she passed under the narrow doorway then murmured one swift query to Merlin Dangerous
3551_7894_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes replied Merlin laconically 
3551_7894_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 You understand added the governor we are so crowded 
none	none	We ought to know if individual attention is required
3551_7894_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly said Merlin you will be personally responsible for this prisoner to the Committee of Public Safety 
none	none	Any visitors allowed
3551_7894_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly not without the special permission of the Public Prosecutor 
none	none	Juliette heard this brief exchange of words over her future fate No visitor would be allowed to see her 
3551_7894_000102_000001	train-clean-360	Well perhaps that would be best 
3551_7894_000102_000002	train-clean-360	She would have been afraid to meet Deroulede again afraid to read in his eyes that story of his dead love which alone might have destroyed her present happiness 
none	none	And she wished to see no one She had a memory to dwell on a short heavenly memory 
3551_7894_000103_000002	train-clean-360	It consisted of a few words a kiss the last one on her hand and that passionate murmur which had escaped from his lips when he knelt at her feet 
none	none	Juliette CHAPTER XIX Complexities Citizen Deputy Deroulede had been privately interviewed by the Committee of Public Safety and temporarily allowed to go free The brief proceedings had been quite private the people of Paris were not to know as yet that their favourite was under a cloud When he had answered all the questions put to him and Merlin just returned from his errand at the Luxembourg Prison had given his version of the domiciliary visitation in the Citizen Deputy s house the latter was briefly told that for the moment the Republic had no grievance against him But he knew quite well what that meant He would be henceforth under suspicion watched incessantly as a mouse is by the cat and pounced upon the moment time would be considered propitious for his final downfall The inevitable waning of his popularity would be noted by keen jealous eyes and Deroulede with his sure knowledge of mankind and of character knew well enough that his popularity was bound to wane sooner or later as all such ephemeral things do In the meanwhile during the short respite which his enemies would leave him his one thought and duty would be to get his mother and Anne Mie safely out of the country And also He thought of her and wondered what had happened As he walked swiftly across the narrow footbridge and reached the other side of the river the events of the past few hours rushed upon his memory with terrible overwhelming force A bitter ache filled his heart at the remembrance of her treachery The baseness of it all was so appalling He tried to think if he had ever wronged her wondered if perhaps she loved someone else and wished him out of her way But then he had been so humble so unassuming in his love He had arrogated nothing unto himself asked for nothing demanded nothing in virtue of his protecting powers over her He was torturing himself with this awful wonderment of why she had treated him thus Out of revenge for her brother s death that was the only explanation he could find the only palliation for her crime He knew nothing of her oath to her father and of course had never heard of the sad history of this young sensitive girl placed in one terrible moment between her dead brother and her demented father He only thought of common sordid revenge for a sin he had been practically forced to commit And how he had loved her Yes loved for that was in the past now She had ceased to be a saint or a madonna she had fallen from her pedestal so low that he could not find the way to descend and grope after the fragments of his ideal At his own door he was met by Anne Mie in tears She has gone murmured the young girl I feel as if I had murdered her Gone Who Where queried Deroulede rapidly an icy feeling of terror gripping him by the heart strings Juliette has gone replied Anne Mie those awful brutes took her away When Directly after you left That man Merlin found some ashes and scraps of paper in her room Ashes Yes and a torn letter case Great God She said that they were love letters which she had been burning for fear you should see them She said so Anne Mie Anne Mie are you quite sure It was all so horrible and he did not quite understand it all his brain which was usually so keen and so active refused him service at this terrible juncture Yes I am quite sure continued Anne Mie in the midst of her tears And oh that awful Merlin said some dastardly things But she persisted in her story that she had another lover Oh Paul I am sure it is not true I hated her because because you loved her so and I mistrusted her but I cannot believe that she was quite as base as that No no child he said in a toneless miserable voice she was not so base as that Tell me more of what she said She said very little else But Merlin asked her whether she had denounced you so as to get you out of the way He hinted that that That I was her lover too Yes murmured Anne Mie She hardly liked to look at him the strong face had become hard and set in its misery And she allowed them to say all this he asked at last Yes And she followed them without a murmur as Merlin said she would have to answer before the Committee of Public Safety for having fooled the representatives of the people She ll answer for it with her life murmured Deroulede And with mine he added half audibly Anne Mie did not hear him her pathetic little soul was filled with a great an overwhelming pity of Juliette and for Paul Before they took her away she said placing her thin delicate looking hands on his arm I ran to her and bade her farewell The soldiers pushed me roughly aside but I contrived to kiss her and then she whispered a few words to me Yes What were they It was an oath she said I swore it to my father and to my dead brother Tell him repeated Anne Mie slowly An oath Now he understood and oh how he pitied her How terribly she must have suffered in her poor harassed soul when her noble upright nature fought against this hideous treachery That she was true and brave in herself of that Deroulede had no doubt And now this awful sin upon her conscience which must be causing her endless misery And alas the atonement would never free her from the load of self condemnation She had elected to pay with her life for her treason against him and his family She would be arraigned before a tribunal which would inevitably condemn her Oh the pity of it all One moment s passionate emotion a lifelong superstition and mistaken sense of duty and now this endless misery this terrible atonement of a wrong that could never be undone And she had never loved him That was the true the only sting which he knew now it rankled more than her sin more than her falsehood more than the shattering of his ideal With a passionate desire for his safety she had sacrificed herself in order to atone for the material evil which she had done But there was the wreck of his hopes and of his dreams Never until now when he had irretrievably lost her did Deroulede realise how great had been his hopes how he had watched day after day for a look in her eyes a word from her lips to show him that she too his unattainable saint would one day come to earth and respond to his love And now and then when her beautiful face lighted up at sight of him when she smiled a greeting to him on his return from his work when she looked with pride and admiration on him from the public bench in the assemblies of the Convention then he had begun to hope to think to dream And it was all a sham A mask to hide the terrible conflict that was raging within her soul nothing more She did not love him of that he felt convinced Man like he did not understand to the full that great and wonderful enigma which has puzzled the world since primeval times a woman s heart The eternal contradictions which go to make up the complex nature of an emotional woman were quite incomprehensible to him Juliette had betrayed him to serve her own sense of what was just and right her revenge and her oath Therefore she did not love him It was logic sound common sense and aided by his own diffidence where women were concerned it seemed to him irrefutable To a man like Paul Deroulede a man of thought of purpose and of action the idea of being false to the thing loved of hate and love being interchangeable was absolutely foreign and unbelievable He had never hated the thing he loved or loved the thing he hated A man s feelings in these respects are so much less complex so much less contradictory Would a man betray his friend No never He might betray his enemy the creature he abhorred whose downfall would cause him joy But his friend The very idea was repugnant impossible to an upright nature Juliette s ultimate access of generosity in trying to save him when she was at last brought face to face with the terrible wrong she had committed that he put down to one of those noble impulses of which he knew her soul to be fully capable and even then his own diffidence suggested that she did it more for the sake of his mother or for Anne Mie rather than for him Therefore what mattered life to him now She was lost to him for ever whether he succeeded in snatching her from the guillotine or not He had but little hope to save her but he would not owe his life to her Anne Mie seeing him wrapped in his own thoughts had quietly withdrawn Her own good sense told her already that Paul Deroulede s first step would be to try and get his mother out of danger and out of the country while there was yet time So without waiting for instructions she began that same evening to pack up her belongings and those of Madame Deroulede There was no longer any hatred in her heart against Juliette Where Paul Deroulede had failed to understand there Anne Mie had already made a guess She firmly believed that nothing now could save Juliette from death and a great feeling of tenderness had crept into her heart for the woman whom she had looked upon as an enemy and a rival She too had learnt in those brief days the great lesson that revenge belongs to God alone CHAPTER XX The Cheval Borgne It was close upon midnight The place had become suffocatingly hot the fumes of rank tobacco of rancid butter and of raw spirits hung like a vapour in mid air The principal room in the Auberge du Cheval Borgne had been used for the past five years now as the chief meeting place of the ultra sansculotte party of the Republic The house itself was squalid and dirty up one of those mean streets which by their narrow way and shelving buildings shut out sun air and light from their miserable inhabitants The Cheval Borgne was one of the most wretched looking dwellings in this street of evil repute The plaster was cracked the walls themselves seemed bulging outward preparatory to a final collapse The ceilings were low and supported by beams black with age and dirt At one time it had been celebrated for its vast cellarage which had contained some rare old wines And in the days of the Grand Monarch young bucks were wont to quit the gay salons of the ladies in order to repair to the Cheval Borgne for a night s carouse In those days the vast cellarage was witness of many a dark encounter of many a mysterious death could the slimy walls have told their own tale it would have been one which would have put to shame the wildest chronicles of M Vidoq Now it was no longer so Things were done in broad daylight on the Place de la Revolution there was no need for dark mysterious cellars in which to accomplish deeds of murder and of revenge Rats and vermin of all sorts worked their way now in the underground portion of the building They ate up each other and held their orgies in the cellars whilst men did the same sort of thing in the rooms above It was a club of Equality and Fraternity Any passer by was at liberty to enter and take part in the debates his only qualification for this temporary membership being an inordinate love for Madame la Guillotine It was from the sordid rooms of the Cheval Borgne that most of the denunciations had gone forth which led but to the one inevitable ending death They sat in conclave here some twoscore or so at first the rabid patriots of this poor downtrodden France They talked of Liberty mostly with many oaths and curses against the tyrants and then started a tyranny an autocracy ten thousand times more awful than any wielded by the dissolute Bourbons And this was the temple of Liberty this dark damp evil smelling brothel with is narrow cracked window panes which let in but an infinitesimal fraction of air and that of the foulest most unwholesome kind The floor was of planks roughly put together now they were worm eaten bare save for a thick carpet of greasy dust which deadened the sound of booted feet The place only boasted of a couple of chairs both of which had to be propped against the wall lest they should break and bring the sitter down upon the floor otherwise a number of empty wine barrels did duty for seats and rough deal boards on broken trestles for tables There had once been a paper on the walls now it hung down in strips showing the cracked plaster beneath The whole place had a tone of yellowish grey grime all over it save where in the centre of the room on a rough double post shaped like the guillotine a scarlet cap of Liberty gave a note of lurid colour to the dismal surroundings On the walls here and there the eternal device so sublime in conception so sordid in execution recalled the aims of the so called club Liberte Fraternite Egalite sinon la Mort Below the device in one or two corners of the room the wall was further adorned with rough charcoal sketches mostly of an obscene character the work of one of the members of the club who had chosen this means of degrading his art To night the assembly had been reduced to less than a score Even according to the dictates of these apostles of Fraternity la guillotine va toujours the guillotine goes on always She had become the most potent factor in the machinery of government of this great Revolution and she had been daily almost hourly fed through the activity of this nameless club which held its weird and awesome sittings in the dank coffee room of the Cheval Borgne The number of the active members had been reduced Like the rats in the cellars below they had done away with one another swallowed one another up torn each other to pieces in this wild rage for a Utopian fraternity Marat founder of the organisation had been murdered by a girl s hand but Charon Manuel Osselin had gone the usual way denounced by their colleagues Rabaut Custine Bison who in their turn were sent to the guillotine by those more powerful perhaps more eloquent than themselves It was merely a case of who could shout the loudest at an assembly of the National Convention La guillotine va toujours After the death of Marat Merlin became the most prominent member of the club he and Foucquier Tinville his bosom friend Public Prosecutor and the most bloodthirsty homicide of this homicidal age Bosom friend both yet they worked against one another undermining each other s popularity whispering persistently one against the other He is a traitor It had become just a neck to neck race between them towards the inevitable goal the guillotine Foucquier Tinville is in the ascendant for the moment Merlin had been given a task which he had failed to accomplish For days now weeks even the debates of this noble assembly had been chiefly concerned with the downfall of Citizen Deputy Deroulede His popularity his calm security in the midst of this reign of terror and anarchy had been a terrible thorn in the flesh of these rabid Jacobins And now the climax had been reached An anonymous denunciation had roused the hopes of these sanguinary patriots It all sounded perfectly plausible To try and save that traitor Marie Antoinette the widow of Louis Capet was just the sort of scheme that would originate in the brain of Paul Deroulede He had always been at heart an aristocrat and the feeling of chivalry for a persecuted woman was only the outward signs of his secret adherence to the hated class Merlin had been sent to search the Deputy s house for proofs of the latter s guilt And Merlin had come back empty handed The arrest of a female aristo the probable mistress of Deroulede who obviously had denounced him was but small compensation for the failure of the more important capture As soon as Merlin joined his friends in the low ill lit evil smelling room he realised at once that there was a feeling of hostility against him Tinville enthroned on one of the few chairs of which the Cheval Borgne could boast was surrounded by a group of surly adherents On the rough trestles a number of glasses half filled with raw potato spirit gave the keynote to the temper of the assembly All those present were dressed in the black shag spencer the seedy black breeches and down at heel boots which had become recognised as the distinctive uniform of the sansculotte party The inevitable Phrygian cap with its tricolour cockade appeared on the heads of all those present in various stages of dirt and decay Tinville had chosen to assume a sarcastic tone with regard to his whilom bosom friend Merlin Leaning both elbows on the table he was picking his teeth with a steel fork and in the intervals of his interesting operation gave forth his views on the broad principles of patriotism Those who sat round him felt that his star was in the ascendant and assumed the position of satellites Merlin as he entered had grunted a sullen Good eve and sat himself down in a remote corner of the room His greeting had been responded to with a few jeers and a good many dark threatening looks Tinville himself had bowed to him with mock sarcasm and an unpleasant leer One of the patriots a huge fellow almost a giant with heavy coarse fists and broad shoulders that obviously suggested coal heaving had after a few satirical observations dragged one of the empty wine barrels to Merlin s table and sat down opposite him Take care Citizen Lenoir said Tinville with an evil laugh Citizen Deputy Merlin will arrest you instead of Deputy Deroulede whom he has allowed to slip through his fingers Nay I ve no fear replied Lenoir with an oath Citizen Merlin is too much of an aristo to hurt anyone his hands are too clean he does not care to do the dirty work of the Republic Isn t that so Monsieur Merlin added the giant with a mock bow and emphasising the appellation which had fallen into complete disuse in these days of equality My patriotism is too well known said Merlin roughly to fear any attacks from jealous enemies and as for my search in the Citizen Deputy s house this afternoon I was told to find proofs against him and I found none Lenoir expectorated on the floor crossed his dark hairy arms over the table and said quietly Real patriotism as the true Jacobin understands it makes the proofs it wants and leaves nothing to chance A chorus of hoarse murmurs of Vive la Liberte greeted this harangue of the burly coal heaver Feeling that he had gained the ear and approval of the gallery Lenoir seemed as it were to spread himself out to arrogate to himself the leadership of this band of malcontents who disappointed in their lust of Deroulede s downfall were ready to exult over that of Merlin You were a fool Citizen Merlin said Lenoir with slow significance not to see that the woman was playing her own game Merlin had become livid under the grime on his face With this ill kempt sansculotte giant in front of him he almost felt as if he were already arraigned before that awful merciless tribunal to which he had dragged so many innocent victims Already he felt as he sat ensconced behind a table in the far corner of the room that he was a prisoner at the bar answering for his failure with his life His own laws his own theories now stood in bloody array against him Was it not he who had framed the indictments against General Custine for having failed to subdue the cities of the south against General Westerman and Brunet and Beauharnais for having failed and failed and failed And now it was his turn These bloodthirsty jackals had been cheated of their prey they would tear him to pieces in compensation of their loss How could I tell he murmured roughly the woman had denounced him A chorus of angry derision greeted this feeble attempt at defence By your own law Citizen Deputy Merlin commented Tinville sarcastically it is a crime against the Republic to be suspected of treason It is evident however that it is quite one thing to frame a law and quite another to obey it What could I have done Hark at the innocent rejoined Lenoir with a sneer What could he have done Patriots friends brothers I ask you what could he have done The giant had pushed the wine cask aside it rolled away from under him and in the fulness of his contempt for Merlin and his impotence he stood up before them all strong in his indictment against treasonable incapacity I ask you he repeated with a loud oath what any patriot would do what you or I would have done in the house of a man whom we all know is a traitor to the Republic Brothers friends Citizen Deputy Merlin found a heap of burn paper in a grate he found a letter case which had obviously contained important documents and he asks us what he could do Deroulede is too important a man to be tried without proofs The whole mob of Paris would have turned on us for having arraigned him for having dared lay hands upon his sacred person Without proofs Who said there were no proofs queried Lenoir I found the burnt papers and torn letter case in the woman s room She owned that they were love letters and that she had denounced Deroulede in order to be rid of him Then let me tell you Citizen Deputy Merlin that a true patriot would have found those papers in Deroulede s and not the woman s room that in the hands of a faithful servant of the Republic those documents would not all have been destroyed for he would have found one letter addressed to the Widow Capet which would have proved conclusively that Citizen Deputy Deroulede was a traitor That is what a true patriot would have done what I would have done Pardi since Deroulede is so important a personage since we must all put on kid gloves when we lay hands upon him then let us fight him with other weapons Are we aristocrats that we should hesitate to play the part of jackal to this cunning fox Citizen Deputy Merlin are you the son of some ci devant duke or prince that you dared not forge a document which would bring a traitor to his doom Nay let me tell you friends that the Republic has no use for curs and calls him a traitor who allows one of her enemies to remain inviolate through his cowardice his terror of that intangible and fleeting shadow the wrath of a Paris mob Thunderous applause greeted this peroration which had been delivered with an accompaniment of violent gestures and a wealth of obscene epithets quite beyond the power of the mere chronicler to render Lenoir had a harsh strident voice very high pitched and he spoke with a broad provincial accent somewhat difficult to locate but quite unlike the hoarse guttural tones of the low class Parisian His enthusiasm made him seem impressive He looked in his ragged dust stained clothes the very personification of the squalid herd which had driven culture art refinement to the scaffold in order to make way for sordid vice and satisfied lusts of hate CHAPTER XXI A Jacobin orator Tinville alone had remained silent during Lenoir s impassioned speech It seemed to be his turn now to become surly He sat picking his teeth and staring moodily at the enthusiastic orator who had so obviously diverted popular feeling in his own direction And Tinville brooked popularity only for himself It is easy to talk now Citizen er Lenoir Is that your name Well you are a comparative stranger here Citizen Lenoir and have not yet proved to the Republic that you can do ought else but talk If somebody did not talk Citizen Tinville is that your name rejoined Lenoir with a sneer if somebody didn t talk nothing would get done You all sit here and condemn the Citizen Deputy Merlin for being a fool and I must say I am with you there but Pardi tell us your but citizen said Tinville for the coal heaver had paused as if trying to collect his thoughts He had dragged a wine barrel to collect his thoughts He had dragged a wine barrel close to the trestle table and now sat astride upon it facing Tinville and the group of Jacobins The flickering tallow candle behind him threw into bold silhouette his square massive head crowned with its Phrygian cap and the great breadth of his shoulders with the shabby knitted spencer and low turned down collar He had long thin hands which were covered with successive coats of coal dust and with these he constantly made weird gestures as if in the act of gripping some live thing by the throat We all know that the Deputy Deroulede is a traitor eh he said addressing the company in general We do came with uniform assent from all those present Then let us put it to the vote The Ayes mean death the Noes freedom Ay ay came from every hoarse parched throat and twelve gaunt hand were lifted up demanding death for Citizen Deputy Deroulede The Ayes have it said Lenoir quietly Now all we need do is to decide how best to carry out our purpose Merlin very agreeably surprised to see public attention thus diverted from his own misdeeds had gradually lost his surly attitude He too dragged one of the wine barrels which did duty for chairs close to the trestle table and thus the members of the nameless Jacobin club made a compact group picturesque in its weird horror its uncompromising flaunting ugliness I suppose said Tinville who was loth to give up his position as leader of these extremists I suppose Citizen Lenoir that you are in position to furnish me with proofs of the Citizen Deputy s guilt If I furnish you with such proofs Citizen Tinville retorted the other will you as Public Prosecutor carry the indictment through It is my duty to publicly accuse those who are traitors to the Republic And you Citizen Merlin queried Lenoir will you help the Republic to the best of your ability to be rid of a traitor My services to the cause of our great Revolution are too well known began Merlin But Lenoir interrupted him with impatience Pardi but we ll have no rhetoric now Citizen Merlin We all know that you have blundered and that the Republic cares little for those of her sons who have failed but whilst you are still Minister of Justice the people of France have need of you for bringing other traitors to the guillotine He spoke this last phrase slowly and significantly lingering on the word other as if he wished its whole awesome meaning to penetrate well into Merlin s brain What is your advice then Citizen Lenoir Apparently by unanimous consent the coalheaver from some obscure province of France had been tacitly acknowledged the leader of the band Merlin still in terror for himself looked to him for advice even Tinville was ready to be guided by him All were at one in their desire to rid themselves of Deroulede who by his clean living his aloofness from their own hideous orgies and deadly hates seemed a living reproach to them all and they all felt that in Lenoir there must exist some secret dislike of the popular Citizen Deputy which would give him a clear insight of how best to bring about his downfall What is your advice had been Merlin s query and everyone there listened eagerly for what was to come We are all agreed commenced Lenoir quietly that just at this moment it would be unwise to arraign the Citizen Deputy without material proof The mob of Paris worship him and would turn against those who had tried to dethrone their idol Now Citizen Merlin failed to furnish us with proofs of Deroulede s guilt For the moment he is a free man and I imagine a wise one within two days he will have quitted this country well knowing that if he stayed long enough to see his popularity wane he would also outstay his welcome on earth altogether Ay Ay said some of the men approvingly whilst others laughed hoarsely at the weird jest I propose therefore continued Lenoir after a slight pause that it shall be Citizen Deputy Deroulede himself who shall furnish to the people of France proofs of his own treason against the Republic But how But how rapid loud and excited queries greeted this extraordinary suggestion from the provincial giant By the simplest means imaginable retorted Lenoir with imperturbable calm Isn t there a good proverb which our grandmothers used to quote that if you only give a man a sufficient length of rope he is sure to hang himself We ll give our aristocratic Citizen Deputy plenty of rope I ll warrant if only our present Minister of Justice he added indicating Merlin will help us in the little comedy which I propose that we should play Yes Yes Go on said Merlin excitedly The woman who denounced Deroulede that is our trump card continued Lenoir now waxing enthusiastic with his own scheme and his own eloquence She denounced him Ergo he had been her lover whom she wished to be rid of why Not as Citizen Merlin supposed because he had discarded her No no she had another lover she has admitted that She wished to be rid of Deroulede to make way for the other because he was too persistent ergo because he loved her Well and what does that prove queried Tinville with dry sarcasm It proves that Deroulede being in love with the woman would do much to save her from the guillotine Of course Pardi let him try say I rejoined Lenoir placidly Give him the rope with which to hang himself What does he mean asked one or two of the men whose dull brains had not quite as yet grasped the full meaning of this monstrous scheme You don t understand what I mean citizens you think I am mad or drunk or a traitor like Deroulede Eh bien give me your attention five minutes longer and you shall see Let me suppose that we have reached the moment when the woman what is her name Oh ah yes Juliette Marny stands in the Hall of Justice on her trial before the Committee of Public Safety Citizen Foucquier Tinville one of our greatest patriots reads the indictment against her the papers surreptitiously burnt the torn mysterious letter case found in her room If these are presumed in the indictment to be treasonable correspondence with the enemies of the Republic condemnation follows at once then the guillotine There is no defence no respite The Minister of Justice according to Article IX of the Law framed by himself allows no advocate to those directly accused of treason But continued the giant with slow and calm impressiveness in the case of ordinary civil indictments offences against public morality or matters pertaining to the penal code the Minister of Justice allows the accused to be publicly defended Place Juliette Marny in the dock on a treasonable charge she will be hustled out of the court in a few minutes amongst a batch of other traitors dragged back to her own prison and executed in the early dawn before Deroulede has had time to frame a plan for her safety or defence If then he tries to move heaven and earth to rescue the woman he loves the mob of Paris may who knows take his part warmly They are mad where Deroulede is concerned and we all know that two devoted lovers have ere now found favour with the people of France a curious remnant of sentimentalism I suppose and the popular Citizen Deputy knows better than anyone else on earth how to play upon the sentimental feelings of the populace Now in the case of a penal offence mark where the difference would be The woman Juliette Marny arraigned for wantonness for an offence against public morals the burnt correspondence admitted to be the letters of a lover her hatred for Deroulede suggesting the false denunciation Then the Minister of Justice allows an advocate to defend her She has none in court but think you Deroulede would not step forward and bring all the fervour of his eloquence to bear in favour of his mistress Can you hear his impassioned speech on her behalf I can the rope I tell you citizens with which he ll hang himself Will he admit in open court that the burnt correspondence was another lover s letters No a thousand times no and in the face of his emphatic denial of the existence of another lover for Juliette it will be for our clever Public Prosecutor to bring him down to an admission that the correspondence was his that it was treasonable that she burnt them to save him He paused exhausted at last mopping his forehead then drinking large gulps of brandy to ease his parched throat A veritable chorus of enthusiasm greeted the end of his long peroration The Machiavelian scheme almost devilish in its cunning in its subtle knowledge of human nature and of the heart strings of a noble organisation like Deroulede s commended itself to these patriots who were thirsting for the downfall of a superior enemy Even Tinville lost his attitude of dry sarcasm his thin cheeks were glowing with the lust of the fight Already for the past few months the trials before the Committee of Public Safety had been dull monotonous uninteresting Charlotte Corday had been a happy diversion but otherwise it had been the case of various deputies who had held views that had become too moderate or of the generals who had failed to subdue the towns or provinces of the south But now this trial on the morrow the excitement of it all the trap laid for Deroulede the pleasure of seeing him take the first step towards his own downfall Everyone there was eager and enthusiastic for the fray Lenoir having spoken at such length had now become silent but everyone else talked and drank brandy and hugged his own hate and likely triumph For several hours far into the night the sitting was continued Each one of the score of members had some comment to make on Lenoir s speech some suggestion to offer Lenoir himself was the first to break up this weird gathering of human jackals already exulting over their prey He bad his companions a quiet good night then passed out into the dark street After he had gone there were a few seconds of complete silence in the dark and sordid room where men s ugliest passions were holding absolute sway The giant s heavy footsteps echoed along the ill paved street and gradually died away in the distance Then at last Foucquier Tinville the Public Prosecutor spoke And who is that man he asked addressing the assembly of patriots Most of them did not know A provincial from the north said one of the men at last he has been here several times before now and last year he was a fairly constant attendant I believe he is a butcher by trade and I fancy he comes from Calais He was originally brought here by Citizen Brogard who is good patriot enough One by one the members of this bond of Fraternity began to file out of the Cheval Borgne They nodded curt good nights to each other and then went to their respective abodes which surely could not be dignified with the name of home Tinville remained one of the last he and Merlin seemed suddenly to have buried the hatchet which a few hours ago had threatened to destroy one or the other of these whilom bosom friends Two or three of the most ardent of these ardent extremists had gathered round the Public Prosecutor and Merlin the framer of the Law of the Suspect What say you citizens said Tinville at last quietly That man Lenoir meseems is too eloquent eh Dangerous pronounced Merlin whilst the others nodded approval But his scheme is good suggested one of the men And we ll avail ourselves of it assented Tinville but afterwards He paused and once more everyone nodded approval Yes he is dangerous We ll leave him in peace to morrow but afterwards With a gentle hand Tinville caressed the tall double post which stood in the centre of the room and which was shaped like the guillotine An evil look was on his face the grin of a death dealing monster savage and envious The others laughed in grim content Merlin grunted a surly approval He had no cause to love the provincial coal heaver who had raised a raucous voice to threaten him Then nodding to one another the last of the patriots satisfied with this night s work passed out into the night The watchman was making his rounds carrying his lantern and shouting his customary cry Inhabitants of Paris sleep quietly Everything is in order everything is at peace CHAPTER XXII The close of day Deroulede had spent the whole of this same night in a wild impassioned search for Juliette Earlier in the day soon after Anne Mie s revelations he had sought out his English friend Sir Percy Blakeney and talked over with him the final arrangements for the removal of Madame Deroulede and Anne Mie from Paris Though he was a born idealist and a Utopian Paul Deroulede had never for a moment had any illusions with regard to his own popularity He knew that at any time and for any trivial cause the love which the mob bore him would readily turn to hate He had seen Mirabeau s popularity wane La Fayette s Desmoulin s was it likely that he alone would survive the inevitable death of so ephemeral a thing Therefore whilst he was in power whilst he was loved and trusted he had figuratively and actually put his house in order He had made full preparations for his own inevitable downfall for that probable flight from Paris of those who were dependent upon him He had as far back as a year ago provided himself with the necessary passports and bespoken with his English friend certain measures for the safety of his mother and his crippled little relative Now it was merely a question of putting these measures into execution Within two hours of Juliette Marny s arrest Madame Deroulede and Anne Mie had quitted the house in the Rue Ecole de Medecine They had but little luggage with them and were ostensibly going into the country to visit a sick cousin The mother of the popular Citizen Deputy was free to travel unmolested The necessary passports which the safety of the Republic demanded were all in perfect order and Madame Deroulede and Anne Mie passed through the north gate of Paris an hour before sunset on that twenty fourth day of Fructidor Their large travelling chaise took them some distance on the North Road where they were to meet Lord Hastings and Lord Anthony Dewhurst two of The Scarlet Pimpernel s most trusted lieutenants who were to escort them as far as the coast and thence see them safely aboard the English yacht On that score therefore Deroulede had no anxiety His chief duty was to his mother and to Anne Mie and that was now fully discharged Then there was old Petronelle Ever since the arrest of her young mistress the poor old soul had been in a state of mind bordering on frenzy and no amount of eloquence on Deroulede s part would persuade her to quit Paris without Juliette If my pet lamb is to die she said amidst heart broken sobs then I have no cause to live Let those devils take me along too if they want a useless old woman like me But if my darling is allowed to go free then what would become of her in this awful city without me She and I have never been separated she wouldn t know where to turn for a home And who would cook for her and iron out her kerchiefs I d like to know Reason and common sense were of course powerless in face of this sublime and heroic childishness No one had the heart to tell the old woman that the murderous dog of the Revolution seldom loosened its fangs once they had closed upon a victim All Deroulede could do was to convey Petronelle to the old abode which Juliette had quitted in order to come to him and which had never been formally given up The worthy soul calmed and refreshed deluded herself into the idea that she was waiting for the return of her young mistress and became quite cheerful at sight of the familiar room Deroulede had provided her with money and necessaries He had but few remaining hopes in his heart but among them was the firmly implanted one that Petronelle was too insignificant to draw upon herself the terrible attention of the Committee of Public Safety By the nightfall he had seen the good woman safely installed Then only did he feel free At last he could devote himself to what seemed to him the one the only aim of his life to find Juliette A dozen prisons in this vast Paris Over five thousand prisoners on that night awaiting trial condemnation and death Deroulede at first strong in his own power his personality had thought that the task would be comparatively easy At the Palais de Justice they would tell him nothing the list of new arrests had not yet been handled in by the commandant of Paris Citizen Santerre who classified and docketed the miserable herd of aspirants for the next day s guillotine The lists moreover would not be completed until the next day when the trials of the new prisoners would already be imminent The work of the Committee of Public Safety was done without much delay Then began Deroulede s weary quest through those twelve prisons of Paris From the Temple to the Conciergerie from Palais Conde to the Luxembourg he spent hours in the fruitless search Everywhere the same shrug of the shoulders the same indifferent reply to his eager query Juliette Marny Inconnue Unknown She had not yet been docketed not yet classified she was still one of that immense flock of cattle sent in ever increasing numbers to the slaughter house Presently to morrow after a trial which might last ten minutes after a hasty condemnation and quick return to prison she would be listed as one of the traitors whom this great and beneficent Republic sent daily to the guillotine Vainly did Deroulede try to persuade to entreat to bribe The sullen guardians of these twelve charnel houses knew nothing of individual prisoners But the Citizen Deputy was allowed to look for himself He was conducted to the great vaulted rooms of the Temple to the vast ballrooms of the Palais Conde where herded the condemned and those still awaiting trial he was allowed to witness there the grim farcical tragedies with which the captives beguiled the few hours which separated them from death Mock trials were acted there Tinville was mimicked then the Place de la Revolution Samson the headsman with a couple of inverted chairs to represent the guillotine Daughters of dukes and princes descendants of ancient lineage acted in these weird and ghastly comedies The ladies with hair bound high over their heads would kneel before the inverted chairs and place the snowwhite necks beneath this imaginary guillotine Speeches were delivered to a mock populace whilst a mock Santerre ordered a mock roll of drums to drown the last flow of eloquence of the supposed victim Oh the horror of it all the pity pathos and misery of this ghastly parody in the very face of the sublimity of death Deroulede shuddered when first he beheld the scene shuddered at the very thought of finding Juliette amongst these careless laughing thoughtless mimes His own his beautiful Juliette with her proud face and majestic queen like gestures it was a relief not to see her there Juliette Marny Inconnue was the final word he heard about her No one told him that by Deputy Merlin s strictest orders she had been labelled dangerous and placed in a remote wing of the Luxembourg Palace together with a few who like herself were allowed to see no one communicate with no one Then when the couvre feu had sounded when all public places were closed when the night watchman had begun his rounds Deroulede knew that his quest for that night must remain fruitless But he could not rest In and out the tortuous streets of Paris he roamed during the better part of that night He was now only awaiting the dawn to publicly demand the right to stand beside Juliette A hopeless misery was in his heart a longing for a cessation of life only one thing kept his brain active his mind clear the hope of saving Juliette The dawn was breaking in the far east when wandering along the banks of the river he suddenly felt a touch on his arm Come to my hovel said a pleasant lazy voice close to his ear whilst a kindly hand seemed to drag him away from the contemplation of the dark silent river And a demmed beastly place it is too but at least we can talk quietly there Deroulede roused from his meditation looked up to see his friend Sir Percy Blakeney standing close beside him Tall debonnair well dressed he seemed by his very presence to dissipate the morbid atmosphere which was beginning to weigh upon Deroulede s active mind Deroulede followed him readily enough through the intricate mazes of old Paris and down the Rue des Arts until Sir Percy stopped outside a small hostelry the door of which stood wide open Mine host has nothing to lose from footpads and thieves explained the Englishman as he guided his friend through the narrow doorway then up a flight of rickety stairs to a small room on the floor above He leaves all doors open for anyone to walk in but la the interior of the house looks so uninviting that no one is tempted to enter I wonder you care to stay here remarked Deroulede with a momentary smile as he contrasted in his mind the fastidious appearance of his friend with the dinginess and dirt of these surroundings Sir Percy deposited his large person in the capacious depths of a creaky chair stretched his long limbs out before him and said quietly I am only staying in this demmed hole until the moment when I can drag you out of this murderous city Deroulede shook his head You d best go back to England then he said for I ll never leave Paris now Not without Juliette Marny shall we say rejoined Sir Percy placidly And I fear me that she has placed herself beyond our reach said Deroulede sombrely You know that she is in the Luxembourg Prison queried the Englishman suddenly I guessed it but could find no proof And that she will be tried to morrow They never keep a prisoner pining too long replied Deroulede bitterly I guessed that too What do you mean to do Defend her with the last breath in my body You love her still then asked Blakeney with a smile Still The look the accent the agony of a hopeless passion conveyed in that one word told Sir Percy Blakeney all that he wished to know Yet she betrayed you he said tentatively And to atone for that sin an oath mind you friend sworn to her father she is already to give her life for me And you are prepared to forgive To understand is to forgive rejoined Deroulede simply and I love her Your madonna said Blakeney with a gently ironical smile No the woman I love with all her weaknesses all her sins the woman to gain whom I would give my soul to save whom I will give my life And she She does not love me would she have betrayed me else He sat beside the table and buried his head in his hands Not even his dearest friend should see how much he had suffered how deeply his love had been wounded Sir Percy said nothing a curious pleasant smile lurked round the corners of his mobile mouth Through his mind there flitted the vision of beautiful Marguerite who had so much loved yet so deeply wronged him and looking at his friend he thought that Deroulede too would soon learn all the contradictions which wage a constant war in the innermost recesses of a feminine heart He made a movement as if he would say something more something of grave import then seemed to think better of it and shrugged his broad shoulders as if to say Let time and chance take their course now When Deroulede looked up again Sir Percy was sitting placidly in the arm chair with an absolutely blank expression on his face Now that you know how much I love her my friend said Deroulede as soon as he had mastered his emotions will you look after her when they have condemned me and save her for my sake A curious enigmatic smile suddenly illumined Sir Percy s earnest countenance Save her Do you attribute supernatural powers to me then or to The League of The Scarlet Pimpernel To you I think rejoined Deroulede seriously Once more it seemed as if Sir Percy were about to reveal something of great importance to his friend then once more he checked himself The Scarlet Pimpernel was above all far seeing and practical a man of action and not of impulse The glowing eyes of his friend his nervous febrile movements did not suggest that he was in a fit state to be entrusted with plans the success of which hung on a mere thread Therefore Sir Percy only smiled and said quietly Well I ll do my best CHAPTER XXIII Justice The day had been an unusually busy one Five and thirty prisoners arraigned before the bar of the Committee of Public Safety had been tried in the last eight hours an average of rather more than four to the hour twelve minutes and a half in which to send a human creature full of life and health to solve the great enigma which lies hidden beyond the waters of the Styx And Citizen Deputy Foucquier Tinville the Public Prosecutor had surpassed himself He seemed indefatigable Each of these five and thirty prisoners had been arraigned for treason against the Republic for conspiracy with her enemies and all had to have irrefutable proofs of their guilt brought before the Committee of Public Safety Sometimes a few letters written to friends abroad and seized at the frontier a word of condemnation of the measures of the extremists and expression of horror at the massacres on the Place de la Revolution where the guillotine creaked incessantly these were irrefutable proofs or else perhaps a couple of pistols or an old family sword seized in the house of a peaceful citizen would be brought against a prisoner as an irrefutable proof of his warlike dispositions against the Republic Oh it was not difficult Out of five and thirty indictments Foucquier Tinville had obtained thirty convictions No wonder his friends declared that he had surpassed himself It had indeed been a glorious day and the glow of satisfaction as much as the heat caused the Public Prosecutors to mop his high bony cranium before he had adjourned for the much needed respite for refreshment The day s work was not yet done The politicals had been disposed of and there had been such an accumulation of them recently that it was difficult to keep pace with the arrests And in the meanwhile the criminal record of the great city had not diminished Because men butchered one another in the name of Equality there were none the fewer among the Fraternity of thieves and petty pilferers of ordinary cut throats and public wantons And these too had to be dealt with by law The guillotine was impartial and fell with equal velocity on the neck of the proud duke and the gutter born fille de joie on a descendant of the Bourbons and the wastrel born in a brothel The ministerial decrees favoured the proletariat A crime against the Republic was indefensible but one against the individual was dealt with with all the paraphernalia of an elaborate administration of justice There were citizen judges and citizen advocates and the rabble who crowded in to listen to the trials acted as honorary jury It was all thoroughly well done The citizen criminals were given every chance The afternoon of this hot August day one of the last of glorious Fructidor had begun to wane and the shades of evening to slowly creep into the long bare room where this travesty of justice was being administered The Citizen President sat at the extreme end of the room on a rough wooden bench with a desk in front of him littered with papers Just above him on the bare whitewashed wall the words La Republique une et indivisible and below them the device Liberte Egalite Fraternite To the right and left of the Citizen President four clerks were busy making entries in that ponderous ledger that amazing record of the foulest crimes the world has ever known the Bulletin du Tribunal Revolutionnaire At present no one is speaking and the grating of the clerks quill pens against the paper is the only sound which disturbs the silence of the hall In front of the President on a bench lower than his sits Citizen Foucquier Tinville rested and refreshed ready to take up his occupation for as many hours as his country demands it of him On every desk a tallow candle smoking and spluttering throws a weird light and more weird shadows on the faces of clerks and President on blank walls and ominous devices In the centre of the room a platform surrounded by an iron railing is ready for the accused Just in front of it from the tall raftered ceiling above there hangs a small brass lamp with a green abat jour Each side of the long whitewashed walls there are three rows of benches beautiful old carved oak pews snatched from Notre Dame and from the Churches of saint Eustache and saint Germain l Auxerrois Instead of the pious worshippers of mediaeval times they now accommodate the lookers on of the grim spectacle of unfortunates in their brief halt before the scaffold The front row of these benches is reserved for those citizen deputies who desire to be present at the debates of the Tribunal Revolutionnaire It is their privilege almost their duty as representatives of the people to see that the sittings are properly conducted These benches are already well filled At one end on the left Citizen Merlin Minister of Justice sits next to him Citizen Minister Lebrun also Citizen Robespierre still in the height of his ascendancy and watching the proceedings with those pale watery eyes of his and that curious disdainful smile which have earned for him the nickname of the sea green incorruptible Other well known faces are there also dimly outlined in the fast gathering gloom But everyone notes Citizen Deputy Deroulede the idol of the people as he sits on the extreme end of a bench on the right with arms tightly folded across his chest the light from the hanging lamp falling straight on his dark head and proud straight brows with the large restless eager eyes Anon the Citizen President rings a hand bell and there is a discordant noise of hoarse laughter and loud curses some pushing jolting and swearing as the general public is admitted into the hall Heaven save us What a rabble Has humanity really such a scum Women with a single ragged kirtle and shift through the interstices of which the naked grime covered flesh shows shamelessly with bare legs and feet thrust into heavy sabots hair dishevelled and evil spirit sodden faces women without a semblance of womanhood with shrivelled barren breasts and dry parched lips that have never known how to kiss Women without emotion save that of hate without desire save for the satisfaction of hunger and thirst and lust for revenge against their sisters less wretched less unsexed than themselves They crowd in jostling one another swarming into the front rows of the benches where they can get a better view of the miserable victims about to be pilloried before them And the men without a semblance of manhood Bent under the heavy care of their own degradation dead to pity to love to chivalry dead to all save an inordinate longing for the sight of blood And God help them all for there were the children too Children save the mark with pallid precocious little faces pinched with the ravages of starvation gazing with dim filmy eyes on this world of rapacity and hideousness Children who have seen death Oh the horror of it Not beautiful peaceful death a slumber or a dream a loved parent or fond sister or brother lying all in white amidst a wealth of flowers but death in its most awesome aspect violent lurid horrible And now they stare around them with eager greedy eyes awaiting the amusement of the spectacle gazing at the President with his tall Phrygian cap at the clerks wielding their indefatigable quill pens writing writing writing at the flickering lights throwing clouds of sooty smoke up to the dark ceiling above Then suddenly the eyes of one little mite a poor tiny midget not yet in her teens alight on Paul Deroulede s face on the opposite side of the rooms Tiens Papa Deroulede she says pointing an attenuated little finger across at him and turning eagerly to those around her her eyes dilating in wishful recollection of a happy afternoon spent in Papa Deroulede s house with fine white bread to eat in plenty and great jars of foaming milk He rouses himself from his apathy and his great earnest eyes lose their look of agonised misery as he responds to the greeting of the little one For one moment oh a mere fraction of a second the squalid faces the miserable starved expressions of the crowd soften at sight of him There is a faint murmur among the women which perhaps God s recording angel registered as a blessing Who knows Foucquier Tinville suppresses a sneer and the Citizen President impatiently rings his hand bell again Bring forth the accused he commands in stentorian tones There is a movement of satisfaction among the crowd and the angel of God is forced to hide his face again CHAPTER XXIV The trial of Juliette It is all indelibly placed on record in the Bulletin du Tribunal Revolutionnaire under date twenty fifth Fructidor year I of the Revolution Anyone who cares may read for the Bulletin is in the Archives of the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris One by one the accused had been brought forth escorted by two men of the National Guard in ragged stained uniforms of red white and blue they were then conducted to the small raised platform in the centre of the hall and made to listen to the charge brought against them by Citizen Foucquier Tinville the Public Presecutor They were petty charges mostly pilfering fraud theft occasionally arson or manslaughter One man however was arraigned for murder with highway robbery and a woman for the most ignoble traffic which evil feminine ingenuity could invent These two were condemned to the guillotine the others sent to the galleys at Brest or Toulon the forger along with the petty thief the housebreaker with the absconding clerk There was no room in the prison for ordinary offences against the criminal code they were overfilled already with so called traitors against the Republic Three women were sent to the penitentiary at the Salpetriere and were dragged out of the court shrilly protesting their innocence and followed by obscene jeers from the spectators on the benches Then there was a momentary hush Juliette Marny had been brought in She was quite calm and exquisitely beautiful dressed in a plain grey bodice and kirtle with a black band round her slim waist and a soft white kerchief folded across her bosom Beneath the tiny white cap her golden hair appeared in dainty curly profusion her child like oval face was very white but otherwise quite serene She seemed absolutely unconscious of her surroundings and walked with a firm step up to the platform looking neither to the right nor to the left of her Therefore she did not see Deroulede A great a wonderful radiance seemed to shine in her large eyes the radiance of self sacrifice She was offering not only her life but everything a woman of refinement holds most dear for the safety of the man she loved A feeling that was almost physical pain so intense was it overcame Deroulede when at last he heard her name loudly called by the Public Prosecutor All day he had waited for this awful moment forgetting his own misery his own agonised feeling of an irretrievable loss in the horrible thought of what she would endure what she would think when first she realised the terrible indignity which was to be put upon her Yet for the sake of her of her chances of safety and of ultimate freedom it was undoubtedly best that it should be so Arraigned for conspiracy against the Republic she was liable to secret trial to be brought up condemned and executed before he could even hear of her whereabouts before he could throw himself before her judges and take all guilt upon himself Those suspected of treason against the Republic forfeited according to Merlin s most iniquitous Law their rights of citizenship in publicity of trial and in defence It all might have been finished before Deroulede knew anything of it The other way was of course more terrible Brought forth amongst the scum of criminal Paris on a charge the horror of which he could but dimly hope that she was too innocent to fully understand he dared not even think of what she would suffer But undoubtedly it was better so The mud thrown at her robes of purity could never cling to her and at least her trial would be public he would be there to take all infamy all disgrace all opprobrium on himself The strength of his appeal would turn her judges wrath from her to him and after these few moments of misery she would be free to leave Paris France to be happy and to forget him and the memory of him An overwhelming all compelling love filled his entire soul for the beautiful girl who had so wronged yet so nobly tried to save him A longing for her made his very sinews ache she was no longer madonna and her beauty thrilled him with the passionate almost sensuous desire to give his life for her The indictment against Juliette Marny has become history now On that day the twenty fifth Fructidor at seven o clock in the evening it was read out by the Public Prosecutor and listened to by the accused so the Bulletin tells us with complete calm and apparent indifference She stood up in that same pillory where once stood poor guilty Charlotte Corday where presently would stand proud guiltless Marie Antoinette And Deroulede listened to the scurrilous document with all the outward calm his strength of will could command He would have liked to rise from his seat then and there at once and in mad purely animal fury have with a blow of his fist quashed the words in Foucquier Tinville s lying throat But for her sake he was bound to listen and above all to act quietly deliberately according to form and procedure so as in no way to imperil her cause Therefore he listened whilst the Public Prosecutor spoke Juliette Marny you are hereby accused of having by a false and malicious denunciation slandered the person of a representative of the people you caused the Revolutionary Tribunal through this same mischievous act to bring a charge against this representative of the people to institute a domiciliary search in his house and to waste valuable time which otherwise belonged to the service of the Republic And this you did not from a misguided sense of duty towards your country but in wanton and impure spirit to be rid of the surveillance of one who had your welfare at heart and who tried to prevent your leading the immoral life which had become a public scandal and which has now brought you before this court of justice to answer to a charge of wantonness impurity defamation of character and corruption of public morals In proof of which I now place before the court your own admission that more than one citizen of the Republic has been led by you into immoral relationship with yourself and further your own admission that your accusation against Citizen Deputy Deroulede was false and mischievous and further and finally your immoral and obscene correspondence with some persons unknown which you vainly tried to destroy In consideration of which and in the name of the people of France whose spokesman I am I demand that you be taken hence from this Hall of Justice to the Place de la Revolution in full view of the citizens of Paris an its environs and clad in a soiled white garment emblem of the smirch upon your soul that there you be publicly whipped by the hands of Citizen Samson the public executioner after which that you be taken to the prison of the Salpetriere there to be further detained at the discretion of the Committee of Public Safety And now Juliette Marny you have heard the indictment preferred against you have you anything to say why the sentence which I have demanded shall not be passed upon you Jeers shouts laughter and curses greeted this speech of the Public Prosecutor All that was most vile and most bestial in this miserable misguided people struggling for Utopia and Liberty seemed to come to the surface whilst listening to the reading of this most infamous document The delight of seeing this beautiful ethereal woman almost unearthly in her proud aloofness smirched with the vilest mud to which the vituperation of man can contrive to sink was a veritable treat to the degraded wretches The women yelled hoarse approval the children not understanding laughed in mirthless glee the men with loud curses showed their appreciation of Foucquier Tinville s speech As for Deroulede the mental agony he endured surpassed any torture which the devils they say reserve for the damned His sinews cracked in his frantic efforts to control himself he dug his finger nails into his flesh trying by physical pain to drown the sufferings of his mind He thought that his reason was tottering that he would go mad if he heard another word of this infamy The hooting and yelling of that filthy mob sounded like the cries of lost souls shrieking from hell All his pity for them was gone his love for humanity his devotion to the suffering poor A great an immense hatred for this ghastly Revolution and the people it professed to free filled his whole being together with a mad hideous desire to see them suffer starve die a miserable loathsome death The passion of hate that now overwhelmed his soul was at least as ugly as theirs He was for one brief moment now at one with them in their inordinate lust for revenge Only Juliette throughout all this remained calm silent impassive She had heard the indictment heard the loathsome sentence for her white cheeks had gradually become ashy pale but never for a moment did she depart from her attitude of proud aloofness She never once turned her head towards the mob who insulted her She waited in complete passiveness until the yelling and shouting had subsided motionless save for her finger tips which beat an impatient tattoo upon the railing in front of her The Bulletin says that she took out her handkerchief and wiped her face with it Elle s essuya le front qui fut perle de sueur The heat had become oppressive The atmosphere was overcharged with the dank penetrating odour of steaming dirty clothes The room though vast was close and suffocating the tallow candles flickering in the humid hot air threw the faces of the President and clerks into bold relief with curious caricature effects of light and shade The petrol lamp above the head of the accused had flared up and begun to smoke causing the chimney to crack with a sharp report This diversion effected a momentary silence among the crowd and the Public Prosecutor was able to repeat his query Juliette Marny have you anything to say in reply to the charge brought against you and why the sentence which I have demanded should not be passed against you The sooty smoke from the lamp came down in small black greasy particles Juliette with her slender finger tips flicked one of these quietly off her sleeve the she replied No I have nothing to say Have you instructed an advocate to defend you according to your rights of citizenship which the Law allows added the Public Prosecutor solemnly Juliette would have replied at once her mouth had already framed the No with which she meant to answer But now at last had come Deroulede s hour For this he had been silent had suffered and had held his peace whilst twice twenty four hours had dragged their weary lengths along since the arrest of the woman he loved In a moment he was on his feet before them all accustomed to speak to dominate to command Citiziness Juliette Marny has entrusted me with her defence he said even before the No had escaped Juliette s white lips and I am here to refute the charges brought against her and to demand in the name of the people of France full acquittal and justice for her CHAPTER XXV The defence Intense excitement which found vent in loud applause greeted Deroulede s statement Ca ira ca ira vas y Deroulede came from the crowded benches round and men women and children wearied with the monotony of the past proceedings settled themselves down for a quarter of an hour s keen enjoyment If Deroulede had anything to do with it the trial was sure to end in excitement And the people were always ready to listen to their special favourite The citizen deputies drowsy after the long oppressive day seemed to rouse themselves to renewed interest Lebrun like a big shaggy dog shook himself free from creeping somnolence Robespierre smiled between his thin lips and looked across at Merlin to see how the situation affected him The enmity between the Minister of Justice and Citizen Deroulede was well known and everyone noted with added zest that the former wore a keen look of anticipated triumph High up on one of the topmost benches sat Citizen Lenoir the stage manager of this palpitating drama He looked down with obvious satisfaction at the scene which he himself had suggested last night to the members of the Jacobin Club Merlin s sharp eyes had tried to pierce the gloom which wrapped the crowd of spectators searching vainly to distinguish the broad figure and massive head of the provincial giant The light from the petrol lamp shone full on Deroulede s earnest dark countenance as he looked Juliette s infamous accuser full in the face but the tallow candles flickering weirdly on the President s desk threw Tinville s short spare figure and large unkempt head into curious grotesque silhouette Juliette apparently had lost none of her calm and there was no one there sufficiently interested in her personality to note the tinge of delicate colour which at the first word of Deroulede had slowly mounted to her pale cheeks Tinville waited until the wave of excitement had broken upon the shoals of expectancy Then he resumed Then Citizen Deroulede what have you to say why sentence should not be passed upon the accused I have to say that the accused is innocent of every charge brought against her in your indictment replied Deroulede firmly And how do you substantiate this statement Citizen Deputy queried Tinville speaking with mock unctuousness Very simply Citizen Tinville The correspondence to which you refer did not belong to the accused but to me It consisted of certain communications which I desired to hold with Marie Antoinette now a prisoner in the Conciergerie during my state there as lieutenant governor The Citizeness Juliette Marny by denouncing me was serving the Republic for my communications with Marie Antoinette had reference to my own hopes of seeing her quit this country and take refuge in her own native land Gradually as Deroulede spoke a murmur like the distant roar of a monstrous breaker rose among the crowd on the upper benches As he continued quietly and firmly so it grew in volume and in intensity until his last words were drowned in one mighty thunderous shout of horror and execration Deroulede the friend and idol of the people the privileged darling of this unruly population the father of the children the friend of the women the sympathiser in all troubles Papa Deroulede as the little ones called him he a traitor self accused plotting and planning for an ex tyrant a harlot who had called herself a queen for Marie Antoinette the Austrian who had desired and worked for the overthrow of France He Deroulede a traitor In one moment as he spoke the love which in their crude hearts they bore him that animal primitive love was turned to sudden equally irresponsible hate He had deceived them laughed at them tried to bribe them by feeding their little ones Bah the bread of the traitor It might have choked the children Surprise at first had taken their breath away Already they had marvelled why he should stand up to defend a wanton And now probably feeling that he was on the point of being found out he thought it better to make a clean breast of his own treason trusting in his popularity in his power over the people Bah Not one extenuating circumstance did they find in their hardened hearts for him He had been their idol enshrined in their squalid degraded minds and now he had fallen shattered beyond recall and they hated and loathed him as much as they had loved him before And this his enemies noted and smiled with complete satisfaction Merlin heaved a sigh of relief Tinville nodded his shaggy head in token of intense delight What that provincial coal heaver had foretold had indeed come to pass The populace that most fickle of all fickle things in this world had turned all at once against its favourite This Lenoir had predicted and the transition had been even more rapid than he had anticipated Deroulede had been given a length of rope and figuratively speaking had already hanged himself The reality was a mere matter of a few hours now At dawn to morrow the guillotine and the mob of Paris who yesterday would have torn his detractors limb from limb would on the morrow be dragging him with hoots and yells and howls of execration to the scaffold The most shadowy of all footholds that of the whim of a populace had already given way under him His enemies knew it and were exulting in their triumph He knew it himself and stood up calmly defiant ready for any event if only he succeeded in snatching her beautiful head from the ready embrace of the guillotine Juliette herself had remained as if entranced The colour had again fled from her cheeks leaving them paler more ashen than before It seemed as if in this moment she suffered more than human creature could bear more than any torture she had undergone hitherto He would not owe his life to her That was the one overwhelming thought in her which annihilated all others His love for her was dead and he would not accept the great sacrifice at her hands Thus these two in the supreme moment of their life saw each other yet did not understand A word a touch would have given them both the key to one another s heart and it now seemed as if death would part them for ever whilst that great enigma remained unsolved The Public Prosecutor had been waiting until the noise had somewhat subsided and his voice could be heard above the din then he said with a smile of ill concealed satisfaction And is the court then to understand Citizen Deputy Deroulede that it was you who tried to burn the treasonable correspondence and to destroy the case which contained it The treasonable correspondence was mine and it was I who destroyed it But the accused admitted before Citizen Merlin that she herself was trying to burn certain love letters that would have brought to light her illicit relationship with another man than yourself argued Tinville suavely The rope was perhaps not quite long enough Deroulede must have all that could be given him ere this memorable sitting was adjourned Deroulede however instead of directing his reply straight to his enemy now turned towards the dense crowd of spectators on the benches opposite to him Citizens friends brothers he said warmly the accused is only a girl young innocent knowing nothing of peril or of sin You all have mothers sisters daughters have you not watched those dear to you in the many moods of which a feminine heart is capable have you not seen them affectionate tender and impulsive Would you love them so dearly but for the fickleness of their moods Have you not worshipped them in your hearts for those sublime impulses which put all man s plans and calculations to shame Look on the accused citizens She loves the Republic the people of France and feared that I an unworthy representative of her sons was hatching treason against our great mother That was her first wayward impulse to stop me before I committed the awful crime to punish me or perhaps only to warn me Does a young girl calculate citizens She acts as her heart dictates her reason but awakes from slumber later on when the act is done Then comes repentance sometimes another impulse of tenderness which we all revere Would you extract vinegar from rose leaves Just as readily could you find reason in a young girl s head Is that a crime She wished to thwart me in my treason then seeing me in peril the sincere friendship she had for me gained the upper hand once more She loved my mother who might be losing a son she loved my crippled foster sister for their sakes not for mine a traitor s did she yield to another a heavenly impulse that of saving me from the consequences of my own folly Was that a crime citizens When you are ailing do not your mothers sisters wives tend you when you are seriously ill would they not give their heart s blood to save you and when in the dark hours of your lives some deed which you would not openly avow before the world overweights your soul with its burden of remorse is it not again your womenkind who come to you with tender words and soothing voices trying to ease your aching conscience bringing solace comfort and peace And so it was with the accused citizens She had seen my crime and longed to punish it she saw those who had befriended her in sorrow and she tried to ease their pain by taking my guilt upon her shoulders She has suffered for the noble lie which she had told on my behalf as no woman has ever been made to suffer before She has stood white and innocent as your new born children in the pillory of infamy She was ready to endure death and what was ten thousand times worse than death because of her own warm hearted affection But you citizens of France who above all are noble true and chivalrous you will not allow the sweet impulses of young and tender womanhood to be punished with the ban of felony To you women of France I appeal in the name of your childhood your girlhood your motherhood take her to your hearts she is worthy of it worthier now for having blushed before you worthier than any heroine in the great roll of honour of France His magnetic voice went echoing along the rafters of the great sordid Hall of Justice filling it with a glory it had never known before His enthusiasm thrilled his hearers his appeal to their honour and chivalry roused all the finer feelings within them Still hating him for his treason his magical appeal had turned their hearts towards her They had listened to him without interruption and now at last when he paused it was very evident by muttered exclamations and glances cast at Juliette that popular feeling which up to the present had practically ignored her now went out towards her personality with overwhelming sympathy Obviously at the present moment if Juliette s fate had been put to the plebiscite she would have been unanimously acquitted Merlin as Deroulede spoke had once or twice tried to read his friend Foucquier Tinville s enigmatical expression but the Public Prosecutor with his face in deep shadow had not moved a muscle during the Citizen Deputy s noble peroration He sat at his desk chin resting on hand staring before him with an expression of indifference almost of boredom Now when Deroulede finished speaking and the outburst of human enthusiasm had somewhat subsided he rose slowly to his feet and said quietly So you maintain Citizen Deputy that the accused is a chaste and innocent girl unjustly charged with immorality I do protested Deroulede loudly And will you tell the court why you are so ready to publicly accuse yourself of treason against the Republic knowing full well all the consequences of your action Would any Frenchman care to save his own life at the expense of a woman s honour retorted Deroulede proudly A murmur of approval greeted these words and Tinville remarked unctuously Quite so quite so We esteem your chivalry Citizen Deputy The same spirit no doubt actuates you to maintain that the accused knew nothing of the papers which you say you destroyed She knew nothing of them I destroyed them I did not know that they had been found on my return to my house I discovered that the Citizeness Juliette Marny had falsely accused herself of having destroyed some papers surreptitiously She said they were love letters It is false You declare her to be pure and chaste Before the whole world Yet you were in the habit of frequenting the bedroom of this pure and chaste girl who dwelt under your roof said Tinville with slow and deliberate sarcasm It is false If it be false Citizen Deroulede continued the other with the same unctuous suavity then how comes it that the correspondence which you admit was treasonable and therefore presumably secret how comes it that it was found still smouldering in the chaste young woman s bedroom and the torn letter case concealed among her dresses in a valise It is false The Minister of Justice Citizen Deputy Merlin will answer for the truth of that It is the truth said Juliette quietly Her voice rang out clear almost triumphant in the midst of the breathless pause caused by the previous swift questions and loud answers Deroulede now was silent This one simple fact he did not know Anne Mie in telling him the events in connection with the arrest of Juliette had omitted to give him the one little detail that the burnt letters were found in the young girl s bedroom Up to the moment when the Public Prosecutor confronted him with it he had been under the impression that she had destroyed the papers and the letter case in the study where she had remained alone after Merlin and his men had left the room She could easily have burnt them there as a tiny spirit lamp was always kept alight on a side table for the use of smokers This little fact now altered the entire course of events Tinville had but to frame an indignant ejaculation Citizens of France see how you are being befooled and hoodwinked Then he turned once more to Deroulede Citizen Deroulede he began But in the tumult that ensued he could no longer hear his own voice The pent up rage of the entire mob of Paris seemed to find vent for itself in the howls with which the crowd now tried to drown the rest of the proceedings As their brutish hearts had been suddenly melted on behalf of Juliette in response to Deroulede s passionate appeal so now they swiftly changed their sympathetic attitude to one of horror and execration Two people had fooled and deceived them One of these they had reverenced and trusted as much as their degraded minds were capable of reverencing anything therefore his sin seemed doubly damnable He and that pale face aristocrat had for weeks now months or years perhaps conspired against the Republic against the Revolution which had been made by a people thirsting for liberty During these months and years he had talked to them and they had listened he had poured forth treasures of eloquence cajoled them as he had done just now The noise and hubbub were growing apace If Tinville and Merlin had desired to infuriate the mob they had more than succeeded All that was most bestial most savage in this awful Parisian populace rose to the surface now in one wild mad desire for revenge The crowd rushed down from the benches over one another s heads over children s fallen bodies they rushed down because they wanted to get at him their whilom favourite and at his pale faced mistress and tear them to pieces hit them scratch out their eyes They snarled like so many wild beasts the women shrieked the children cried and the men of the National Guard hurrying forward had much ado to keep back this flood tide of hate Had any of them broken loose from behind the barrier of bayonets hastily raised against them it would have fared ill with Deroulede and Juliette The Pesident wildly rang his bell and his voice quivering with excitement was heard once or twice above the din Clear the court Clear the court But the people refused to be cleared out of court A la lanterne les traitres Mort a Deroulede A la lanterne l aristo And in the thickest of the crowd the broad shoulders and massive head of Citizen Lenoir towered above the others At first it seemed as if he had been urging on the mob in its fury His strident voice with its broad provincial accent was heard distinctly shouting loud vituperations against the accused Then at a given moment when the tumult was at its height when the National Guard felt their bayonets giving way before this onrushing tide of human jackals Lenoir changed his tactics Tiens c est bete he shouted loudly we shall do far better with the traitors when we get them outside What say you citizens Shall we leave the judges here to conclude the farce and arrange for its sequel ourselves outside the Tigre Jaune At first but little heed was paid to his suggestion and he repeated it once or twice adding some interesting details One is freer in the streets where these apes of the National Guard can t get between the people of France and their just revenge Ma foi he added squaring his broad shoulders and pushing his way through the crowd towards the door I for one am going to see where hangs the most suitable lanterne Like a flock of sheep the crowd now followed him The nearest lanterne they shouted In the streets in the streets A la lanterne The traitors And with many a jeer many a loathsome curse and still more loathsome jests some of the crowd began to file out A few only remained to see the conclusion of the farce CHAPTER XXVI Sentence of death The Bulletin du Tribunal Revolutionnaire tells us that both the accused had remained perfectly calm during the turmoil which raged within the bare walls of the Hall of Justice Citizen Deputy Deroulede however so the chroniclers aver though outwardly impassive was evidently deeply moved He had very expressive eyes clear mirrors of the fine upright soul within and in them there was a look of intense emotion as he watched the crowd which he had so often dominated and controlled now turning in hatred against him He seemed actually to be seeing with a spiritual vision his own popularity wane and die But when the thick of the crowd had pushed and jostled itself out of the hall that transient emotion seemed to disappear and he allowed himself quietly to be led from the front bench where he had sat as a privileged member of the National Convention to a place immediately behind the dock and between two men of the National Guard From that moment he was a prisoner accused of treason against the Republic and obviously his mock trial would be hurried through by his triumphant enemies whilst the temper of the people was at boiling point against him Complete silence had succeeded to the raging tumult of the past few moments Nothing now could be heard in the vast room save Foucquier Tinville s hastily whispered instructions to the clerk nearest to him and the scratch of the latter s quill pen against the paper The President was with equal rapididy affixing his signature to various papers handed up to him by the other clerks The few remaining spectators the deputies and those among the crowd who had elected to see the close of the debate were silent and expectant Merlin was mopping his forehead as if in intense fatigue after a hard struggle Robespierre was coolly taking snuff From where Deroulede stood he could see Juliette s graceful figure silhouetted against the light of the petrol lamp His heart was torn between intense misery at having failed to save her and a curious exultant joy at thought of dying beside her He knew the procedure of this revolutionary tribunal well knew that within the next few moments he too would be condemned that they would both be hustled out of the crowd and dragged through the streets of Paris and finally thrown into the same prison to herd with those who like themselves had but a few hours to live And then to morrow at dawn death for them both under the guillotine Death in public with all its attendant horrors the packed tumbril the priest in civil clothes appointed by this godless government muttering conventional prayers and valueless exhortations And in his heart there was nothing but love for her love and an intense pity for the punishment she was suffering was far greater than her crime He hoped that in her heart remorse would not be too bitter and he looked forward with joy to the next few hours which he would pass near her during which he could perhaps still console and soothe her She was but the victim of an ideal of Fate stronger than her own will She stood an innocent martyr to the great mistake of her life But the minutes sped on Foucquier Tinville had evidently completed his new indictments The one against Juliette Marny was read out first She was now accused of conspiring with Paul Deroulede against the safety of the Republic by having cognisance of a treasonable correspondence carried on with the prisoner Marie Antoinette by virtue of which accusation the Public Prosecutor asked her if she had anything to say No she replied loudly and firmly I pray to God for the safety and deliverance of our Queen Marie Antoinette and for the overthrow of this Reign of Terror and Anarchy These words registered in the Bulletin du Tribunal Revolutionnaire were taken as final and irrefutable proofs of her guilt and she was then summarily condemned to death She was then made to step down from the dock and Deroulede to stand in her place He listened quietly to the long indictment which Foucquier Tinville had already framed against him the evening before in readiness for this contingency The words treason against the Republic occurred conspicuously and repeatedly The document itself is at one with the thousands of written charges framed by that odious Foucquier Tinville during these periods of bloodshed and which in themselves are the most scathing indictments against the odious travesty of Justice perpetrated with his help Self accused and avowedly a traitor Deroulede was not even asked if he had anything to say sentence of death was passed on him with the rapididy and callousness peculiar to these proceedings After which Paul Deroulede and Juliette Marny were led forth under strong escort into the street CHAPTER XXVII The Fructidor Riots Many accounts more or less authentic have been published of the events known to history as the Fructidor Riots But this is how it all happened at any rate it is the version related some few days later in England to the Prince of Wales by no less a personage than Sir Percy Blakeney and who indeed should know better than The Scarlet Pimpernel himself Deroulede and Juliette Marny were the last of the batch of prisoners who were tried on that memorable day of Fructidor There had been such a number of these that all the covered carts in use for the conveyance of prisoners to and from the Hall of Justice had already been despatched with their weighty human load thus it was that only a rough wooden cart hoodless and rickety was available and into this Deroulede and Juliette were ordered to mount It was now close on nine o clock in the evening The streets of Paris sparsely illuminated here and there with solitary oil lamps swung across from house to house on wires presented a miserable and squalid appearance A thin misty rain had begun to fall transforming the ill paved roads into morasses of sticky mud The Hall of Justice was surrounded by a howling and shrieking mob who having imbibed all the stores of brandy in the neighbouring drinking bars was now waiting outside in the dripping rain for the express purpose of venting its pent up spirit sodden lust of rage against the man whom it had once worshipped but whom now it hated Men women and even children swarmed round the principal entrances of the Palais de Justice along the bank of the river as far as the Pont au Change and up towards the Luxembourg Palace now transformed into the prison to which the condemned would no doubt be conveyed Along the river bank and immediately facing the Palais de Justice a row of gallows shaped posts at intervals of a hundred yards or more held each a smoky petrol lamp at a height of some eight feet from the ground One of these lamps had been knocked down and from the post itself there now hung ominously a length of rope with a noose at the end Around this improvised gallows a group of women sat or rather squatted in the mud their ragged shifts and kirtles soaked through with the drizzling rain hung dankly on their emaciated forms their hair in some cases grey and in others dark or straw coloured clung matted round their wet faces on which the dirt and the damp had drawn weird and grotesque lines The men were restless and noisy rushing aimlessly hither and thither from the corner of the bridge up the Rue du Palais fearful lest their prey be conjured away ere their vengeance was satisfied Oh how they hated their former idol now Citizen Lenoir with his broad shoulders and powerful grime covered head towered above the throng his strident voice with its raucous provincial accent could be distinctly heard above the din egging on the men shouting to the women stirring up hatred against the prisoners wherever it showed signs of abating in intensity The coal heaver hailing from some distant province seemed to have set himself the grim task of provoking the infuriated populace to some terrible deed of revenge against Deroulede and Juliette The darkness of the street the fast falling mist which obscured the light from the meagre oil lamps seemed to add a certain weirdness to this moving seething multitude No one could see his neighbour In the blackness of the night the muttering or yelling figures moved about like some spectral creatures from hellish regions the Akous of Brittany who call to those about to die whilst the women squatting in the oozing mud beneath that swinging piece of rope looked like a group of ghostly witches waiting for the hour of their Sabbath As Deroulede emerged into the open the light from a swinging lantern in the doorway fell upon his face The foremost of the crowd recognised him a howl of execration went up to the cloud covered sky and a hundred hands were thrust out in deadly menace against him It seemed as if they whished to tear him to pieces A la lanterne A la lanterne le traitre He shivered slightly as if with the sudden blast of cold humid air but he stepped quietly into the cart closely followed by Juliette The strong escort of the National Guard with Commandant Santerre and his two drummers had much ado to keep back the mob It was not the policy of the revolutionary government to allow excesses of summary justice in the streets the public execution of traitors on the Place de la Revolution the processions in the tumbrils were thought to be wholesome examples for other would be traitors to mark and digest Citizen Santerre military commandant of Paris had ordered his men to use their bayonets ruthlessly and to further overawe the populace he ordered a prolonged roll of drums lest Deroulede took it into his head to speak to the crowd But Deroulede had no such intention he seemed chiefly concerned in shielding Juliette from the cold she had been made to sit in the cart beside him and he had taken off his coat and was wrapping it round her against the penetrating rain The eye witnesses of these memorable events have declared that at a given moment he looked up suddenly with a curious eager expression in his eyes and then raised himself in the cart and seemed to be trying to penetrate the gloom round him as if in search of a face or perhaps a voice A la lanterne A la lanterne was the continual hoarse cry of the mob Up to now flanked in their rear by the outer walls of the Palais de Justice the soldiers had found it a fairly easy task to keep the crowd at bay But there came a time when the cart was bound to move out into the open in order to convey the prisoners along by the Rue du Palais up to the Luxembourg Prison This task however had become more and more difficult every moment The people of Paris who for two years had been told by its tyrants that it was supreme lord of the universe was mad with rage at seeing its desires frustrated by a few soldiers The drums had been greeted by terrific yells which effectually drowned their roll the first movement of the cart was hailed by a veritable tumult Only the women who squatted round the gallows had not moved from their position of vantage one of these Maegaeras was quietly readjusting the rope which had got out of place But all the men and some of the women were literally besieging the cart and threatening the soldiers who stood between them and the object of their fury It seemed as if nothing now could save Deroulede and Juliette from an immediate and horrible death A mort A mort A la lanterne les traitres Santerne himself who had shouted himself hoarse was at a loss what to do He had sent one man to the nearest cavalry barracks but reinforcements would still be some little time coming whilst in the meanwhile his men were getting exhausted and the mob more and more excited threatened to break through their line at every moment There was not another second to be lost Santerre was for letting the mob have its way and he would willingly have thrown it the prey for which it clamoured but orders were orders and in the year I of the Revolution it was not good to disobey At this supreme moment of perplexity he suddenly felt a respectful touch on his arm Close behind him a soldier of the National Guard not one of his own men was standing at attention and holding a small folded paper in his hand Sent to you by the Minister of Justice whispered the soldier hurriedly The citizen deputies have watched the tumult from the Hall they say you must not lose an instant Santerre withdrew from the front rank up against the side of the cart where a rough stable lantern had been fixed He took the paper from the soldier s hand and hastily tearing it open he read it by the dim light of the lantern As he read his thick coarse features expressed the keenest satisfaction You have two more men with you he asked quickly Yes citizen replied the man pointing towards his right and the Citizen Minister said you would give me two more You ll take the prisoners quietly across to the Prison of the Temple you understand that Yes citizen Citizen Merlin has given me full instructions You can have the cart drawn back a little more under the shadow of the portico where the prisoners can be made to alight they can then given into my charge You in the meantime are to stay here with your men round the empty cart as long as you can Reinforcements have been sent for and must soon be here When they arrive you are to move along with the cart as if you were making for the Luxembourg Prison This manoeuvre will give us time to deliver the prisoners safely at the Temple The man spoke hurriedly and peremptorily and Santerne was only too ready to obey He felt relieved at thought of reinforcements and glad to be rid of the responsibility of conducting such troublesome prisoners The thick mist which grew more and more dense favoured the new manoeuvre and the constant roll of drums drowned the hastily given orders The cart was drawn back into the deepest shadow of the great portico and whilst the mob were howling their loudest and yelling out frantic demands for the traitors Deroulede and Juliette were summarily ordered to step out of the cart No one saw them for the darkness here was intense Follow quietly whispered a raucous voice in their ears as they did so or my orders are to shoot you where you stand But neither of them had any wish for resistance Juliette cold and numb was clinging to Deroulede who had placed a protecting arm round her Santerne had told off two of his men to join the new escort of the prisoners and presently the small party skirting the walls of the Palais de Justice began to walk rapidly away from the scene of the riot Deroulede noted that some half dozen men seemed to be surrounding him and Juliette but the drizzling rain blurred every outline The blackness of the night too had become absolutely dense and in the distance the cries of the populace grew more and more faint CHAPTER XXVIII The unexpected The small party walked on in silence It seemed to consist of a very few men of the National Guard whom Santerne had placed under the command of the soldier who had transmitted to him the orders of the Citizen Deputies Juliette and Deroulede both vaguely wondered whither they were being led to some other prison mayhap away from the fury of the populace They were conscious of a sense of satisfaction at thought of being freed from that pack of raging wild beasts Beyond that they cared nothing Both felt already the shadow of death hovering over them The supreme moment of their lives had come and had found them side by side What neither fear nor remorse sorrow nor joy could do that the great and mighty Shadow accomplished in a trice Juliette looking death bravely in the face held out her hand and sought that of the man she loved There was not one word spoken between them not even a murmur Deroulede with the unerring instinct of his own unselfish passion understood all that the tiny hand wished to convey to him In a moment everything was forgotten save the joy of this touch Death or the fear of death had ceased to exist Life was beautiful and in the soul of these two human creatures there was perfect peace almost perfect happiness With one grasp of the hand they had sought and found one another s soul What mattered the yelling crowd the noise and tumult of this sordid world They had found one another and hand in hand shoulder to shoulder they had gone off wandering into the land of dreams where dwelt neither doubt nor treachery where there was nothing to forgive He no longer said She does not love me would she have betrayed me else He felt the clinging trustful touch of her hand and knew that with all her faults her great sin and her lasting sorrow her woman s heart Heaven s most priceless treasure was indeed truly his And she knew that he had forgiven nay that he had naught to forgive for Love is sweet and tender and judges not Love is Love whole trustful passionate Love is perfect understanding and perfect peace And so they followed their escort whithersoever it chose to lead them Their eyes wandered aimlessly over the mist laden landscape of this portion of deserted Paris They had turned away from the river now and were following the Rue des Arts Close by on the right was the dismal little hostelry La Cruche Cassee where Sir Percy Blakeney lived Deroulede as they neared the place caught himself vaguely wondering what had become of his English friend But it would take more than the ingenuity of the Scarlet Pimpernel to get two noted prisoners out of Paris to day Even if Halt The word of command rang out clearly and distinctly through the rain soaked atmosphere Deroulede threw up his head and listened Something strange and unaccountable in that same word of command had struck his sensitive ear Yet the party had halted and there was a click as of bayonets or muskets levelled ready to fire All had happened in less than a few seconds The next moment there was a loud cry A moi Deroulede tis the Scarlet Pimpernel A vigorous blow from an unseen hand had knocked down and extinguished the nearest street lantern Deroulede felt that he and Juliette were being hastily dragged under an adjoining doorway even as the cheery voice echoed along the narrow street Half a dozen men were struggling below in the mud and there was a plentiful supply of honest English oaths It looked as if the men of the National Guard had fallen upon one another and had it not been for those same English oaths perhaps Deroulede and Juliette would have been slower to understand Well done Tony Gadzooks Ffoulkes that was a smart bit of work The lazy pleasant voice was unmistakable but God in heaven where did it come from Of one thing there could be no doubt The two men despatched by Santerne were lying disabled on the ground whilst three other soldiers were busy pinioning them with ropes What did it all mean La friend Deroulede you had not thought I trust that I would leave Mademoiselle Juliette in such a demmed uncomfortable hole And there close beside Deroulede and Juliette stood the tall figure of the Jacobin orator the bloodthirsty Citizen Lenoir The two young people gazed and gazed then looked again dumfounded hardly daring to trust their vision for through the grime covered mask of the gigantic coal heaver a pair of merry blue eyes was regarding them with lazy amusement La I do look a miserable object I know said the pseudo coal heaver at last but twas the only way to get those murderous devils to do what I wanted A thousand pardons mademoiselle twas I brought you to such a terrible pass but la you are amongst friends now Will you deign to forgive me Juliette looked up Her great earnest eyes now swimming in tears sought those of the brave man who had so nobly stood by her and the man she loved Blakeney began Deroulede But Sir Percy quickly interrupted him Hush man we have but a few moments Remember you are in Paris still and the Lord only knows how we shall all get out of this murderous city to night I have said that you and mademoiselle are among friends That is all for the moment I had to get you together or I should have failed I could only succeed by subjecting you and mademoiselle to terrible indignities Our League could plan but one rescue and I had to adopt the best means at my command to have you condemned and led away together Faith he added with a pleasant laugh my friend Tinville will not be pleased when he realises that Citizen Lenoir has dragged the Citizen Deputies by the nose Whilst he spoke he had led Deroulede and Juliette into a dark and narrow room on the ground floor of the hostelry and presently he called loudly for Brogard the host of this uninviting abode Brogard shouted Sir Percy Where is that ass Brogard La man he added as Citizen Brogard obsequious and fussy and with pockets stuffed with English gold came shuffling along where do you hide your engaging countenance Here another length of rope for the gallant soldiers Bring them in here then give them that potion down their throats as I have prescribed Demm it I wish we need not have brought them along but that devil Santerre might have been suspicious else They ll come to no harm though and can do us no mischief He prattled along merrily Innately kind and chivalrous he wished to give Deroulede and Juliette time to recover from their dazed surprise The transition from dull despair to buoyant hope had been so sudden it had all happened in less than three minutes The scuffle had been short and sudden outside The two soldiers of Santerne had been taken completely unawares and the three young lieutenants of the Scarlet Pimpernel had fallen on them with such vigour that they had hardly had time to utter a cry of Help Moreover that cry would have been useless The night was dark and wet and those citizens who felt ready for excitement were busy mobbing the Hall of Justice a mile and a half away One or two heads had appeared at the small windows of the squalid houses opposite but it was too dark to see anything and the scuffle had very quickly subsided All was silent now in the Rue des Arts and in the grimy coffee room of the Cruche Cassee two soldiers of the National Guard were lying bound and gagged whilst three others were gaily laughing and wiping their rain soaked hands and faces In the midst of them all stood the tall athletic figure of the bold adventurer who had planned this impudent coup La we ve got so far friends haven t we he said cheerily and now for the immediate future We must all be out of Paris to night or the guillotine for the lot of us to morrow He spoke gaily and with that pleasant drawl of his which was so well known in the fashionable assemblies of London but there was a ring of earnestness in his voice and his lieutenants looked up at him ready to obey him in all things but aware that danger was looming threateningly ahead Lord Anthony Dewhurst Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Hastings dressed as soldiers of the National Guard had played their part to perfection Lord Hastings had presented the order to Santerre and the three young bucks at the word of command from their chief had fallen upon and overpowered the two men whom the commandant of Paris had despatched to look after the prisoners So far all was well But how to get out of Paris Everyone looked to the Scarlet Pimpernel for guidance Sir Percy now turned to Juliette and with the consummate grace which the elaborate etiquette of the times demanded he made her a courtly bow Mademoiselle de Marny he said allow me to conduct you to a room which though unworthy of your presence will nevertheless enable you to rest quietly for a few minutes whilst I give my friend Deroulede further advice and instructions In the room you will find a disguise which I pray you to don with all haste La they are filthy rags I own but your life and and ours depend upon your help Gallantly he kissed the tips of her fingers and opened the door of an adjoining room to enable her to pass through then he stood aside so that her final look as she went might be for Deroulede As soon as the door had closed upon her he once more turned to the men Those uniforms will not do now he said peremptorily there are bundles of abominable clothes here Tony Will you all don them as quickly as you can We must all look as filthy a band of sansculottes to night as ever walked the streets of Paris His lazy drawl had deserted him now He was the man of action and of thought the bold adventurer who held the lives of his friends in the hollow of his hand The four men hastily obeyed Lord Anthony Dewhurst one of the most elegant dandies of London society had brought forth from a dank cupboard a bundle of clothes mere rags filthy but useful Within ten minutes the change was accomplished and four dirty slouchy figures stood confronting their chief That s capital said Sir Percy merrily Now for Mademoiselle de Marny Hardly had he spoken when the door of the adjoining room was pushed open and a horrible apparition stood before the men A woman in filthy bodice and skirt with face covered in grime her yellow hair matted and greasy thrust under a dirty and crumpled cap A shout of rapturous delight greeted this uncanny apparition Juliette like the true woman she was had found all her energy and spirits now that she felt that she had an important part to play She woke from her dream to realise that noble friends had risked their lives for the man she loved and for her Of herself she did not think she only remembered that her presence of mind her physical and mental strength would be needed to carry the rescue to a successful end Therefore with the rags of a Paris tricotteuse she had also donned her personality She played her part valiantly and one look at the perfection of her disguise was sufficient to assure the leader of this band of heroes that his instructions would be carried through to the letter Deroulede too now looked the ragged sansculotte to the life with bare and muddy feet frayed breeches and shabby black shag spencer The four men stood waiting together with Juliette whilst Sir Percy gave them his final instructions We ll mix with the crowd he said and do all that the crowd does It is for us to see that that unruly crowd does what we want Mademoiselle de Marny a thousand congratulations I entreat you to take hold of my friend Deroulede s hand and not to let go of it on any pretext whatever La not a difficult task I ween he added with his genial smile and yours Deroulede is equally easy I enjoin you to take charge of Mademoiselle Juliette and on no account to leave her side until we are out of Paris Out of Paris echoed Deroulede with a troubled sigh Aye rejoined Sir Percy boldly out of Paris with a howling mob at our heels causing the authorities to take double precautions And above all remember friends that our rallying cry is the shrill call of the sea mew thrice repeated Follow it until you are outside the gates of Paris Once there listen for it again it will lead you to freedom and safety at last Aye Outside Paris by the grace of God The hearts of his hearers thrilled as they heard him Who could help but follow this brave and gallant adventurer with the magic voice and the noble bearing And now en route said Blakeney finally that ass Santerre will have dispersed the pack of yelling hyenas with his cavalry by now They ll to the Temple prison to find their prey we ll in their wake A moi friends and remember the sea gull s cry Deroulede drew Juliette s hand in his We are ready he said and God bless the Scarlet Pimpernel Then the five men with Juliette in their midst went out into the street once more CHAPTER XXIX Pere Lachaise It was not difficult to guess which way the crowd had gone yells hoots and hoarse cries could be heard from the farther side of the river Citizen Santerne had been unable to keep the mob back until the arrival of the cavalry reinforcements Within five minutes of the abduction of Deroulede and Juliette the crowd had broken through the line of soldiers and had stormed the cart only to find it empty and the prey dissappeared They are safe in the Temple by now shouted Santerne hoarsely in savage triumph at seeing them all baffled At first it seemed as if the wrath of the infuriated populace fooled in its lust for vengeance would vent itself against the commandant of Paris and his soldiers for a moment even Santerre s ruddy cheeks had paled at the sudden vision of this unlooked for danger Then just as suddenly the cry was raised To the Temple To the Temple To the Temple came in ready response The cry was soon taken up by the entire crowd and in less than two minutes the purlieus of the Hall of Justice were deserted and the Pont saint Michel then the Cite and the Pont au Change swarmed with the rioters Thence along the north bank of the river and up the Rue du Temple the people still yelling muttering singing the Ca ira and shouting A la lanterne A la lanterne Sir Percy Blakeney and his little band of followers had found the Pont Neuf and the adjoining streets practically deserted A few stragglers from the crowd soaked through with the rain their enthusiasm damped and their throats choked with the mist were sulkily returning to their homes The desultory group of six sansculottes attracted little or no attention and Sir Percy boldly challenged every passer by The way to the Rue du Temple citizen he asked once or twice or Have they hung the traitor yet Can you tell me citizeness A grunt or an oath were the usual replies but no one took any further notice of the gigantic coal heaver and his ragged friends At the corner of one of the cross streets between the Rue du Temple and the Rue des Archives Sir Percy Blakeney suddenly turned to his followers We are close to the rabble now he said in a whisper and speaking in English do you all follow the nearest stragglers and get as soon as possible into the thickest of the crowd We ll meet again outside the prison and remember the sea gull s cry He did not wait for an answer and presently disappeared in the mist Already a few stragglers hangers on of the multitude were gradually coming into view and the yells could be distinctly heard The mob had evidently assembled in the great square outside the prison and was loudly demanding the object of its wrath The moment for cool headed action was at hand The Scarlet Pimpernel had planned the whole thing but it was for his followers and for those whom he was endeavouring to rescue from certain death to help him heart and soul Deroulede s grasp tightened on Juliette s little hand Are you frightened my beloved he whispered Not whilst you are near me she murmured in reply A few more minutes walk up the Rue des Archives and they were in the thick of the crowd Sir Andrew Ffoulkes Lord Anthony Dewhurst and Lord Hastings the three Englishmen were in front Deroulede and Juliette immediately behind them The mob itself now carried them along A motley throng they were soaked through with the rain drunk with their own baffled rage and with the brandy which they had imbibed Everyone was shouting the women louder than the rest one of them was dragging the length of rope which might still be useful Ca ira ca ira A la lanterne A la lanterne les traitres And Deroulede holding Juliette by the hand shouted lustily with them Ca ira Sir Andrew Ffoulkes turned and laughed It was rare sport for these young bucks and they all entered into the spirit of the situation They all shouted A la lanterne egging and encouraging those around them Deroulede and Juliette felt the intoxication of the adventure They were drunk with the joy of their reunion and seized with the wild mad passionate desire for freedom and for life Life and love So they pushed and jostled on in the mud followed the crowd sang and yelled louder than any of them Was not that very crowd the great bulwark of their safety As well have sought for the proverbial needle in the haystack as for two escaped prisoners in this mad heaving throng The large open space in front of the Temple Prison looked like one great seething black mass The darkness was almost thick here the ground like a morass with inches of clayey mud which stuck to everything whilst the sparse lanterns hung to the prison walls and beneath the portico threw practically no light into the square As the little band composed of the three Englishmen and of Deroulede holding Juliette by the hand emerged into the open space they heard a strident cry like that of a sea mew thrice repeated and a hoarse voice shouting from out the darkness Ma foi I ll not believe that the prisoners are in the Temple now It is my belief friends citizens that we have been fooled once more The voice with its strange unaccountable accent which seemed to belong to no province of France dominated the almost deafening noise it penetrated through even into the brandy soddened minds of the multitude for the suggestion was received with renewed shouts of the wildest wrath Like one great living seething mass the crowd literally bore down upon the huge and frowning prison Pushing jostling yelling the women screaming the men cursing it seemed as if that awesome day the fourteenth of July was to have its sanguinary counterpart to night as if the Temple were destined to share the fate of the Bastille Obedient to their leader s orders the three young Englishmen remained in the thick of the crowd together with Deroulede they contrived to form a sturdy rampart round Juliette effectually protecting her against rough buffetings On their right towards the direction of Menilmontant the sea mew s cry at intervals gave the strength and courage The foremost rank of the crowd had reached the portico of the building and with howls and snatches of their gutter song were loudly clamouring for the guardian of the grim prison No one appeared the great gates with their massive bars and hinges remained silent and defiant The crowd was becoming dangerous whispers of the victory of the Bastille five years ago engendered thoughts of pillage and of arson Then the strident voice was heard again Pardi the prisoners are not in the Temple The dolts have allowed them to escape and now are afraid of the wrath of the people It was strange how easily the mob assimilated this new idea Perhaps the dark frowning block of massive buildings had overawed them with its peaceful strength perhaps the dripping rain and oozing clay had damped their desire for an immediate storming of the grim citadel perhaps it was merely the human characteristic of a wish for something new something unexpected Be that as it may the cry was certainly taken up with marvellous quick change rapidity The prisoners have escaped The prisoners have escaped Some were for proceeding with the storming of the Temple but they were in the minority All along the crowd had been more inclined for private revenge than for martial deeds of valour the Bastille had been taken by daylight the effort might not have been so successful on a pitch black night such as this when one could not see one s hand before one s eyes and the drizzling rain went through to the marrow They ve got through one of the barriers by now suggested the same voice from out the darkness The barriers the barriers came in sheeplike echo from the crowd The little group of fugitives and their friends tightened their hold on one another They had understood at last It is for us to see that the crowd does what we want the Scarlet Pimpernel had said He wanted it to take him and his friends out of Paris and by God he was like to succeed Juliette s heart within her beat almost to choking her strong little hand gripped Deroulede s fingers with the wild strength of a mad exultation Next to the man to whom she had given her love and her very soul she admired and looked up to the remarkable and noble adventurer the high born and exquisite dandy who with grime covered face and strong limbs encased in filthy clothes was playing the most glorious part ever enacted upon the stage To the barriers to the barriers Like a herd of wild horses driven by the whip of the herdsmen the mob began to scatter in all directions Not knowing what it wanted not knowing what it would find half forgetting the very cause and object of its wrath it made one gigantic rush for the gates of the great city through which the prisoners were supposed to have escaped The three Englishmen and Deroulede with Juliette well protected in their midst had not joined the general onrush as yet The crowd in the open place was still very thick the outward branching streets were very narrow through these the multitude scampering hurrying scurrying like a human torrent let out of a whirlpool rushed down headlong towards the barriers Up the Rue Turbigo to the Belleville gate the Rue des Filles and the Rue du Chemin Vert towards Popincourt they ran knocking each other down jostling the weaker ones on one side trampling others underfoot They were all rough coarse creatures accustomed to these wild bousculades ready to pick themselves up again after any number of falls whilst the mud was slimy and soft to tumble on and those who did the trampling had no shoes on their feet They rushed out from the dark open place these creatures of the night into streets darker still On they ran on on now in thick heaving masses anon in loose straggling groups some north some south some east some west But it was from the east that came the seagull s cry The little band ran boldly towards the east Down the Rue de la Republique they followed their leader s call The crowd was very thick here the Barriere Menilmontant was close by and beyond it there was the cemetery of Pere Lachaise It was the nearest gate to the Temple Prison and the mob wanted to be up and doing not to spend too much time running along the muddy streets and getting wet and cold but to repeat the glorious exploits of the fourteenth of July and capture the barriers of Paris by force of will rather than force of arms In this rushing mob the four men with Juliette in their midst remained quite unchallenged mere units in an unruly crowd In a quarter of an hour Menilmontant was reached The great gates of the city were well guarded by detachments of the National Guard each under command of an officer Twenty strong at most what was that against such a throng Who had ever dreamed of Paris being stormed from within At every gate to the north and east of the city there was now a rabble some four or five thousand strong wanting it knew not what Everyone had forgotten what it was that caused him or her to rush on so blindly so madly towards the nearest barrier But everyone knew that he or she wanted to get through that barrier to attack the soldiery to knock down the captain of the Guard And with a wild cry every city gate was stormed Like one huge wind tossed wave the populace on that memorable night of Fructidor broke against the cordon of soldiery that vainly tried to keep it back Men and women drunk with brandy and exultation shouted Quatorze Juillet and amidst curses and threats demanded the opening of the gates The people of France would have its will Was it not the supreme lord and ruler of the land the arbiter of the Fate of this great beautiful and maddened country The National Guard was powerless the officers in command could offer but feeble resistance The desultory fire which in the darkness and the pouring rain did very little harm had the effect of further infuriating the mob The drizzle had turned to a deluge a veritable heavy summer downpour with occasional distant claps of thunder and incessant sheet lightning which ever and anon illumined with its weird fantastic flash this heaving throng these begrimed faces crowned with red caps of Liberty these witchlike female creatures with wet straggly hair and gaunt menacing arms Within half an hour the people of Paris was outside its own gates Victory was complete The Guard did not resist the officers had surrendered the great and mighty rabble had had its way Exultant it swarmed around the fortifications and along the terrains vauges which it had conquered by its will But the downpour was continuous and with victory came satiety satiety coupled with wet skins muddy feet tired wearied bodies and throats parched with continual shouting At Menilmontant where the crowd had been thickest the tempers highest and the yells most strident there now stretched before this tired excited throng the peaceful vastness of the cemetery of Pere Lachaise The great alleys of sombre monuments the weird cedars with their fantastic branches like arms of a hundred ghosts quelled and awed these hooting masses of degraded humanity The silent majesty of this city of the dead seemed to frown with withering scorn on the passions of the sister city Instinctively the rabble was cowed The cemetery looked dark dismal and deserted The flashed of lightning seemed to reveal ghostlike processions of the departed heroes of France wandering silently amidst the tombs And the populace turned with a shudder away from this vast place of eternal peace From within the cemetery gates there was suddenly heard the sound of a sea mew calling thrice to its mate And five dark figures wrapped in cloaks gradually detached themselves from the throng and one by one slipped into the grounds of Pere Lachaise through that break in the wall which is quite close to the main entrance Once more the sea gull s cry Those in the crowd who heard it shivered beneath their dripping clothes They thought it was a soul in pain risen from one of the graves and some of the women forgetting the last few years of godlessness hastily crossed themselves and muttered an invocation to the Virgin Mary Within the gates all was silent and at peace The sodden earth gave forth no echo of the muffled footsteps which slowly crept towards the massive block of stone which covers the graves of the immortal lovers Abelard and Heloise CHAPTER XXX Conclusion There is but little else to record History has told us how shamefaced tired dripping the great all powerful people of Paris quietly slunk back to their homes even before the first cock crow in the villages beyond the gates acclaimed the pale streak of dawn But long before that even before the church bells of the great city had tolled the midnight hour Sir Percy Blakeney and his little band of followers had reached the little tavern which stands close to the farthest gate of Pere Lachaise Without a word like six silent ghosts they had traversed the vast cemetery and reached the quiet hostelry where the sounds of the seething revolution only came attenuated by their passage through the peaceful city of the dead English gold had easily purchased silence and good will from the half starved keeper of this wayside inn A huge travelling chaise already stood in readiness and four good Flanders horses had been pawing the ground impatiently for the past half hour From the window of the chaise old Petronelle s face wet with anxious tears was peering anxiously A cry of joy and surprise escaped Deroulede and Juliette and both turned with a feeling akin to awe towards the wonderful man who had planned and carried through this bold adventure Nay my friend said Sir Percy speaking more especially to Deroulede if you only knew how simple it all was Gold can do so many things and my only merit seems to be the possession of plenty of that commodity You told me yourself how you had provided for old Petronelle Under the most solemn assurance that she would meet her young mistress here I got her to leave Paris She came out most bravely this morning in one of the market carts She is so obviously a woman of the people that no one suspected her As for the worthy couple who keep this wayside hostel they have been well paid and money soon procures a chaise and horses My English friends and I we have our own passports and one for Mademoiselle Juliette who must travel as an English lady with her old nurse Petronelle There are some decent clothes in readiness for us all in the inn A quarter of an hour in which to don them and we must on our way You can use your own passport of course your arrest has been so very sudden that it has not yet been cancelled and we have an eight hours start of our enemies They ll wake up to morrow morning begad and find that you have slipped through their fingers He spoke with easy carelessness and that slow drawl of his as if he were talking airy nothings in a London drawing room instead of recounting the most daring most colossal piece of effrontery the adventurous brain of man could conceive Deroulede could say nothing His own noble heart was too full of gratitude towards his friend to express it all in a few words And time of course was precious Within the prescribed quarter of an hour the little band of heroes had doffed their grimy ragged clothes and now appeared dressed as respectable bourgeois of Paris en route for the country Sir Percy Blakeney had donned the livery of a coachman of a well to do house whilst Lord Anthony Dewhurst wore that of an English lacquey Five minutes later Deroulede had lifted Juliette into the travelling chaise and in spite of fatigue of anxiety and emotion it was immeasurable happiness to feel her arm encircling his shoulders in perfect joy and trust Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Hastings joined them inside the chaise Lord Anthony sat next to Sir Percy on the box And whilst the crowd of Paris was still wondering why it had stormed the gates of the city the escaped prisoners were borne along the muddy roads of France at breakneck speed northward to the coast Sir Percy Blakeney held the reins himself With his noble heart full of joy the gallant adventurer himself drove his friends to safety They had an eight hours start and The League of The Scarlet Pimpernel had done its work thoroughly well provided with passports and with relays awaiting them at every station of fifty miles or so the journey though wearisome was free from further adventure At Le Havre the little party embarked on board Sir Percy Blakeney s yacht the Daydream where they met Madame Deroulede and Anne Mie The two ladies acting under the instructions of Sir Percy had as originally arranged pursued their journey northwards to the populous seaport town Anne Mie s first meeting with Juliette was intensely pathetic The poor little cripple had spent the last few days in an agony of remorse whilst the heavy travelling chaise bore her farther and farther away from Paris She thought Juliette dead and Paul a prey to despair and her tender soul ached when she remembered that it was she who had given the final deadly stab to the heart of the man she loved Hers was the nature born to abnegation aye and one destined to find bliss therein And when one glance in Paul Deroulede s face told her that she was forgiven her cup of joy at seeing him happy beside his beloved was unalloyed with any bitterness tb It was in the beautiful rosy dawn of one of the last days of that memorable Fructidor when Juliette and Paul Deroulede standing on the deck of the Daydream saw the shores of France gradually receding from their view Deroulede s arm was round his beloved her golden hair fanned by the breeze brushed lightly against his cheek Madonna he murmured She turned her head to him It was the first time that they were quite alone the first time that all thought of danger had become a mere dream What had the future in store for them in that beautiful strange land to which the graceful yacht was swiftly bearing them England the land of freedom would shelter their happiness and their joy and they looked out towards the North where lay still hidden in the arms of the distant horizon the white cliffs of Albion whilst the mist even now was wrapping it its obliterating embrace the shores of the land where they had both suffered where they had both learned to love He took her in his arms My wife he whispered The rosy light touched her golden hair he raised her face to his and soul met soul in one long passionate kiss End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of I Will Repay by Baroness Emmuska Orczy END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK I
