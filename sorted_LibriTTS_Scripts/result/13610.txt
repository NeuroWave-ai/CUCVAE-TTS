HAVELOCK ELLIS nineteen twenty seven GENERAL PREFACE The origin of these Studies dates from many years back As a youth I was faced as others are by the problem of sex Living partly in an Australian city where the ways of life were plainly seen partly in the solitude of the bush I was free both to contemplate and to meditate many things A resolve slowly grew up within me one main part of my life work should be to make clear the problems of sex That was more than twenty years ago Since then I can honestly say that in all that I have done that resolve has never been very far from my thoughts I have always been slowly working up to this central problem and in a book published some three years ago Man and Woman a Study of Human Secondary Sexual Characters I put forward what was in my own eyes an introduction to the study of the primary questions of sexual psychology Now that I have at length reached the time for beginning to publish my results these results scarcely seem to me large As a youth I had hoped to settle problems for those who came after now I am quietly content if I do little more than state them For even that I now think is much it is at least the half of knowledge In this particular field the evil of ignorance is magnified by our efforts to suppress that which never can be suppressed though in the effort of suppression it may become perverted I have at least tried to find out what are the facts among normal people as well as among abnormal people for while it seems to me that the physician s training is necessary in order to ascertain the facts the physician for the most part only obtains the abnormal facts which alone bring little light I have tried to get at the facts and having got at the facts to look them simply and squarely in the face If I cannot perhaps turn the lock myself I bring the key which can alone in the end rightly open the door the key of sincerity That is my one panacea sincerity I know that many of my friends people on whose side I too am to be found retort with another word reticence It is a mistake they say to try to uncover these things leave the sexual instincts alone to grow up and develop in the shy solitude they love and they will be sure to grow up and develop wholesomely But as a matter of fact that is precisely what we can not and will not ever allow them to do There are very few middle aged men and women who can clearly recall the facts of their lives and tell you in all honesty that their sexual instincts have developed easily and wholesomely throughout And it should not be difficult to see why this is so Let my friends try to transfer their feelings and theories from the reproductive region to let us say the nutritive region the only other which can be compared to it for importance Suppose that eating and drinking was never spoken of openly save in veiled or poetic language and that no one ever ate food publicly because it was considered immoral and immodest to reveal the mysteries of this natural function We know what would occur A considerable proportion of the community more especially the more youthful members possessed by an instinctive and legitimate curiosity would concentrate their thoughts on the subject They would have so many problems to puzzle over How often ought I to eat What ought I to eat Is it wrong to eat fruit which I like Ought I to eat grass which I don t like Instinct notwithstanding we may be quite sure that only a small minority would succeed in eating reasonably and wholesomely The sexual secrecy of life is even more disastrous than such a nutritive secrecy would be partly because we expend such a wealth of moral energy in directing or misdirecting it partly because the sexual impulse normally develops at the same time as the intellectual impulse not in the early years of life when wholesome instinctive habits might be formed And there is always some ignorant and foolish friend who is prepared still further to muddle things Eat a meal every other day Eat twelve meals a day Never eat fruit Always eat grass The advice emphatically given in sexual matters is usually not less absurd than this When however the matter is fully open the problems of food are not indeed wholly solved but everyone is enabled by the experience of his fellows to reach some sort of situation suited to his own case And when the rigid secrecy is once swept away a sane and natural reticence becomes for the first time possible This secrecy has not always been maintained When the Catholic Church was at the summit of its power and influence it fully realized the magnitude of sexual problems and took an active and inquiring interest in all the details of normal and abnormal sexuality Even to the present time there are certain phenomena of the sexual life which have scarcely been accurately described except in ancient theological treatises As the type of such treatises I will mention the great tome of Sanchez De Matrimonio Here you will find the whole sexual life of men and women analyzed in its relationships to sin Everything is set forth as clearly and as concisely as it can be without morbid prudery on the one hand or morbid sentimentality on the other in the coldest scientific language the right course of action is pointed out for all the cases that may occur and we are told what is lawful what a venial sin what a mortal sin Now I do not consider that sexual matters concern the theologian alone and I deny altogether that he is competent to deal with them In his hands also undoubtedly they sometimes become prurient as they can scarcely fail to become on the non natural and unwholesome basis of asceticism and as they with difficulty become in the open air light of science But we are bound to recognize the thoroughness with which the Catholic theologians dealt with these matters and from their own point of view indeed the entire reasonableness we are bound to recognize the admirable spirit in which successfully or not they sought to approach them We need to day the same spirit and temper applied from a different standpoint These things concern everyone the study of these things concerns the physiologist the psychologist the moralist We want to get into possession of the actual facts and from the investigation of the facts we want to ascertain what is normal and what is abnormal from the point of view of physiology and of psychology We want to know what is naturally lawful under the various sexual chances that may befall man not as the born child of sin but as a naturally social animal What is a venial sin against nature what a mortal sin against nature The answers are less easy to reach than the theologians answers generally were but we can at least put ourselves in the right attitude we may succeed in asking that question which is sometimes even more than the half of knowledge It is perhaps a mistake to show so plainly at the outset that I approach what may seem only a psychological question not without moral fervour But I do not wish any mistake to be made I regard sex as the central problem of life And now that the problem of religion has practically been settled and that the problem of labor has at least been placed on a practical foundation the question of sex with the racial questions that rest on it stands before the coming generations as the chief problem for solution Sex lies at the root of life and we can never learn to reverence life until we know how to understand sex So at least it seems to me Having said so much I will try to present such results as I have to record in that cold and dry light through which alone the goal of knowledge may truly be seen HAVELOCK ELLIS July eighteen ninety seven PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION The first edition of this volume was published in eighteen ninety nine following Sexual Inversion which now forms Volume II The second edition issued by the present publishers and substantially identical with the first edition appeared in the following year Ten years have elapsed since then and this new edition will be found to reflect the course of that long interval Not only is the volume greatly enlarged but nearly every page has been partly rewritten This is mainly due to three causes Much new literature required to be taken into account my own knowledge of the historical and ethnographic aspects of the sexual impulse has increased many fresh illustrative cases of a valuable and instructive character have accumulated in my hands It is to these three sources of improvement that the book owes its greatly revised and enlarged condition and not to the need for modifying any of its essential conclusions These far from undergoing any change have by the new material been greatly strengthened It may be added that the General Preface to the whole work which was originally published in eighteen ninety eight at the beginning of Sexual Inversion now finds its proper place at the outset of the present volume HAVELOCK ELLIS Carbis Bay Cornwall Eng PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION The present volume contains three studies which seem to me to be necessary prolegomena to that analysis of the sexual instinct which must form the chief part of an investigation into the psychology of sex The first sketches the main outlines of a complex emotional state which is of fundamental importance in sexual psychology the second by bringing together evidence from widely different regions suggests a tentative explanation of facts that are still imperfectly known the third attempts to show that even in fields where we assume our knowledge to be adequate a broader view of the phenomena teaches us to suspend judgment and to adopt a more cautious attitude So far as they go these studies are complete in themselves their special use as an introduction to a more comprehensive analysis of sexual phenomena is that they bring before us under varying aspects a characteristic which though often ignored is of the first importance in obtaining a clear understanding of the facts the tendency of the sexual impulse to appear in a spontaneous and to some extent periodic manner affecting women differently from men This is a tendency which later I hope to make still more apparent for it has practical and social as well as psychological implications Here and more especially in the study of those spontaneous solitary manifestations which I call auto erotic I have attempted to clear the ground and to indicate the main lines along which the progress of our knowledge in these fields may best be attained It may surprise many medical readers that in the third and longest study I have said little save incidentally either of treatment or prevention The omission of such considerations at this stage is intentional It may safely be said that in no other field of human activity is so vast an amount of strenuous didactic morality founded on so slender a basis of facts In most other departments of life we at least make a pretence of learning before we presume to teach in the field of sex we content ourselves with the smallest and vaguest minimum of information often ostentatiously second hand usually unreliable I wish to emphasize the fact that before we can safely talk either of curing or preventing these manifestations we must know a great deal more than we know at present regarding their distribution etiology and symptomatology and we must exercise the same coolness and caution as if our work is to be fruitful we require in any other field of serious study We must approach these facts as physicians it is true but also as psychologists primarily concerned to find out the workings of such manifestations in fairly healthy and normal people If we found a divorce court judge writing a treatise on marriage we should smile But it is equally absurd for the physician so long as his knowledge is confined to disease to write regarding sex at large valuable as the facts he brings forward may be he can never be in a position to generalize concerning them And to me at all events it seems that we have had more than enough pictures of gross sexual perversity whether furnished by the asylum or the brothel They are only really instructive when they are seen in their proper perspective as the rare and ultimate extremes of a chain of phenomena which we may more profitably study nearer home Yet although we are on every hand surrounded by the normal manifestations of sex conscious or unconscious these manifestations are extremely difficult to observe and in those cases in which we are best able to observe them it frequently happens that we are unable to make any use of our knowledge Moreover even when we have obtained our data the difficulties at all events for an English investigator are by no means overcome He may take for granted that any serious and precise study of the sexual instinct will not meet with general approval his work will be misunderstood his motives will be called in question among those for whom he is chiefly working he will find indifference Indeed the pioneer in this field may well count himself happy if he meets with nothing worse than indifference Hence it is that the present volume will not be published in England but that availing myself of the generous sympathy with which my work has been received in America I have sought the wider medical and scientific audience of the United States In matters of faith liberty of prophesying was centuries since eloquently vindicated for Englishmen the liberty of investigating facts is still called in question under one pretence or another and to seek out the most vital facts of life is still in England a perilous task I desire most heartily to thank the numerous friends and correspondents some living in remote parts of the world who have freely assisted me in my work with valuable information and personal histories To mister F H Perry Coste I owe an appendix which is by far the most elaborate attempt yet made to find evidence of periodicity in the spontaneous sexual manifestations of sleep my debts to various medical and other correspondents are duly stated in the text To many women friends and correspondents I may here express my gratitude for the manner in which they have furnished me with intimate personal records and for the cross examination to which they have allowed me to subject them I may already say here what I shall have occasion to say more emphatically in subsequent volumes that without the assistance I have received from women of fine intelligence and high character my work would be impossible I regret that I cannot make my thanks more specific HAVELOCK ELLIS CONTENTS THE EVOLUTION OF MODESTY I The

The Definition of Modesty The Significance of Modesty Difficulties in the Way of Its Analysis The Varying Phenomena of Modesty Among Different Peoples and in Different Ages Modesty which may be provisionally defined as an almost instinctive fear prompting to concealment and usually centering around the sexual processes while common to both sexes is more peculiarly feminine so that it may almost be regarded as the chief secondary sexual character of women on the psychical side The woman who is lacking in this kind of fear is lacking also in sexual attractiveness to the normal and average man The apparent exceptions seem to prove the rule for it will generally be found that the women who are not immodest for immodesty is more closely related to modesty than mere negative absence of the sense of modesty but without that fear which implies the presence of a complex emotional feminine organization to defend only make a strong sexual appeal to men who are themselves lacking in the complementary masculine qualities As a psychical secondary sexual character of the first rank it is necessary before any psychology of sex can be arranged in order to obtain a clear view of modesty The immense importance of feminine modesty in creating masculine passion must be fairly obvious I may however quote the observations of two writers who have shown evidence of insight and knowledge regarding this matter Casanova describes how when at Berne he went to the baths and was according to custom attended by a young girl whom he selected from a group of bath attendants She undressed him proceeded to undress herself and then entered the bath with him and rubbed him thoroughly all over the operation being performed in the most serious manner and without a word being spoken When all was over however he perceived that the girl had expected him to make advances and he proceeds to describe and discuss his own feelings of indifference under such circumstances Though without gazing on the girl s figure I had seen enough to recognize that she had all that a man can desire to find in a woman a beautiful face lively and well formed eyes a beautiful mouth with good teeth a healthy complexion well developed breasts and everything in harmony It is true that I had felt that her hands could have been smoother but I could only attribute this to hard work moreover my Swiss girl was only eighteen and yet I remained entirely cold What was the cause of this That was the question that I asked myself It is clear wrote Stendhal that three parts of modesty are taught This is perhaps the only law born of civilization which produces nothing but happiness It has been observed that birds of prey hide themselves to drink because being obliged to plunge their heads in the water they are at that moment defenceless After having considered what passes at Otaheite I can see no other natural foundation for modesty Love is the miracle of civilization Among savage and very barbarous races we find nothing but physical love of a gross character It is modesty that gives to love the aid of imagination and in so doing imparts life to it Modesty is very early taught to little girls by their mothers and with extreme jealousy one might say by esprit de corps They are watching in advance over the happiness of the future lover To a timid and tender woman there ought to be no greater torture than to allow herself in the presence of a man something which she thinks she ought to blush at I am convinced that a proud woman would prefer a thousand deaths A slight liberty taken on the tender side by the man she loves gives a woman a moment of keen pleasure but if he has the air of blaming her for it or only of not enjoying it with transport an awful doubt must be left in her mind For a woman above the vulgar level there is then everything to gain by very reserved manners The play is not equal She hazards against a slight pleasure or against the advantage of appearing a little amiable the danger of biting remorse and a feeling of shame which must render even the lover less dear An evening passed gaily and thoughtlessly without thinking of what comes after is dearly paid at this price The sight of a lover with whom one fears that one has had this kind of wrong must become odious for several days Can one be surprised at the force of a habit the slightest infractions of which are punished with such atrocious shame As to the utility of modesty it is the mother of love As to the mechanism of the feeling nothing is simpler The mind is absorbed in feeling shame instead of being occupied with desire Desires are forbidden and desires lead to actions It is evident that every tender and proud woman and these two things being cause and effect naturally go together must contract habits of coldness which the people whom she disconcerts call prudery The power of modesty is so great that a tender woman betrays herself with her lover rather by deeds than by words The evil of modesty is that it constantly leads to falsehood Stendhal De l Amour Chapter XXIV It thus happens that as Adler remarks Die Mangelhafte Geschlechtsempfindung des Weibes p one hundred thirty three the sexual impulse in women is fettered by an inhibition which has to be conquered A thin veil of reticence shyness and anxiety is constantly cast anew over a woman s love and her wooer in every act of courtship has the enjoyment of conquering afresh an oft won woman An interesting testimony to the part played by modesty in effecting the union of the sexes is furnished by the fact to which attention has often been called that the special modesty of women usually tends to diminish though not to disappear with the complete gratification of the sexual impulses This may be noted among savage as well as among civilized women The comparatively evanescent character of modesty has led to the argument Venturi Degenerazioni Psico sessuali pp ninety two ninety three that modesty pudore is possessed by women alone men exhibiting instead a sense of decency which remains at about the same level of persistency throughout life Viazzi Pudore nell uomo e nella donna Rivista Mensile di Psichiatria Forense eighteen ninety eight on the contrary following Sergi argues that men are throughout more modest than women but the points he brings forward though often just scarcely justify his conclusion While the young virgin however is more modest and shy than the young man of the same age the experienced married woman is usually less so than her husband and in a woman who is a mother the shy reticences of virginal modesty would be rightly felt to be ridiculous Les petites pudeurs n existent pas pour les meres remarks Goncourt Journal des Goncourt vol iii p five She has put off a sexual livery that has no longer any important part to play in life and would indeed be inconvenient and harmful just as a bird loses its sexual plumage when the pairing season is over Madame Celine Renooz in an elaborate study of the psychological sexual differences between men and women Psychologie Comparee de l Homme et de la Femme eighteen ninety eight pp eighty five eighty seven also believes that modesty is not really a feminine characteristic Modesty she argues is masculine shame attributed to women for two reasons first because man believes that woman is subject to the same laws as himself secondly because the course of human evolution has reversed the psychology of the sexes attributing to women the psychological results of masculine sexuality This is the origin of the conventional lies which by a sort of social suggestion have intimidated women They have in appearance at least accepted the rule of shame imposed on them by men but only custom inspires the modesty for which they are praised it is really an outrage to their sex This reversal of psychological laws has however only been accepted by women with a struggle Primitive woman proud of her womanhood for a long time defended her nakedness which ancient art has always represented And in the actual life of the young girl to day there is a moment when by a secret atavism she feels the pride of her sex the intuition of her moral superiority and cannot understand why she must hide its cause At this moment wavering between the laws of Nature and social conventions she scarcely knows if nakedness should or should not affright her A sort of confused atavistic memory recalls to her a period before clothing was known and reveals to her as a paradisaical ideal the customs of that human epoch In support of this view the authoress proceeds to point out that the decollete constantly reappears in feminine clothing never in male that missionaries experience great difficulty in persuading women to cover themselves that while women accept with facility an examination by male doctors men cannot force themselves to accept examination by a woman doctor et cetera These and similar points had already been independently brought forward by Sergi Archivio di Psichiatria vol xiii eighteen ninety two It cannot be said that Madame Renooz s arguments will all bear examination if only on the ground that nakedness by no means involves absence of modesty but the point of view which she expresses is one which usually fails to gain recognition though it probably contains an important element of truth It is quite true as Stendhal said that modesty is very largely taught from the earliest years a girl child is trained to show a modesty which she quickly begins really to feel This fact cannot fail to strike any one who reads the histories of pseudo hermaphroditic persons really males who have from infancy been brought up in the belief that they are girls and who show and feel all the shrinking reticence and blushing modesty of their supposed sex But when the error is discovered and they are restored to their proper sex this is quickly changed and they exhibit all the boldness of masculinity See e g Neugebauer Beobachtungen aus dem Gebiete des Scheinzwittertumes Jahrbuch fuer Sexuelle Zwischenstufen Jahrgang iv nineteen oh two esp p ninety two At the same time this is only one thread in the tangled skein with which we are here concerned The mass of facts which meets us when we turn to the study of modesty in women cannot be dismissed as a group of artificially imposed customs They gain rather than lose in importance if we have to realize that the organic sexual demands of women calling for coyness in courtship lead to the temporary suppression of another feminine instinct of opposite though doubtless allied nature But these somewhat conflicting though not really contradictory statements serve to bring out the fact that a woman s modesty is often an incalculable element The woman who under some circumstances and at some times is extreme in her reticences under other circumstances or at other times may be extreme in her abandonment Not that her modesty is an artificial garment which she throws off or on at will It is organic but like the snail s shell it sometimes forms an impenetrable covering and sometimes glides off almost altogether A man s modesty is more rigid with little tendency to deviate toward either extreme Thus it is that when uninstructed a man is apt to be impatient with a woman s reticences and yet shocked at her abandonments The significance of our inquiry becomes greater when we reflect that to the reticences of sexual modesty in their progression expansion and complication we largely owe not only the refinement and development of the sexual emotions la pudeur as Guyau remarked a civilise l amour but the subtle and pervading part which the sexual instinct has played in the evolution of all human culture It is certain that very much of what is best in religion art and life remark Stanley Hall and Allin owes its charm to the progressively widening irradiation of sexual feeling Perhaps the reluctance of the female first long circuited the exquisite sensations connected with sexual organs and acts to the antics of animal and human courtship while restraint had the physiological function of developing the colors plumes excessive activity and exuberant life of the pairing season To keep certain parts of the body covered irradiated the sense of beauty to eyes hair face complexion dress form et cetera while many savage dances costumes and postures are irradiations of the sexual act Thus reticence concealment and restraint are among the prime conditions of religion and human culture Stanley Hall and Allin The Psychology of Tickling American Journal of Psychology eighteen ninety seven p thirty one Groos attributes the deepening of the conjugal relation among birds to the circumstance that the male seeks to overcome the reticence of the female by the display of his charms and abilities And in the human world he continues it is the same without the modest reserve of the woman that must in most cases be overcome by lovable qualities the sexual relationship would with difficulty find a singer who would extol in love the highest movements of the human soul Groos Spiele der Menschen p three hundred forty one I have not however been able to find that the subject of modesty has been treated in any comprehensive way by psychologists Though valuable facts and suggestions bearing on the sexual emotions on disgust the origins of tatooing on ornament and clothing have been brought forward by physiologists psychologists and ethnographists few or no attempts appear to have been made to reach a general synthetic statement of these facts and suggestions It is true that a great many unreliable slight or fragmentary efforts have been made to ascertain the constitution or basis of this emotion one Many psychologists have regarded modesty simply as the result of clothing This view is overturned by the well ascertained fact that many races which go absolutely naked possess a highly developed sense of modesty These writers have not realized that physiological modesty is earlier in appearance and more fundamental than anatomical modesty A partial contribution to the analysis of modesty has been made by Professor James who with his usual insight and lucidity has set forth certain of its characteristics especially the element due to the application to ourselves of judgments primarily passed upon our mates Guyau in a very brief discussion of modesty realized its great significance and touched on most of its chief elements two Westermarck again followed by Grosse has very ably and convincingly set forth certain factors in the origin of ornament and clothing a subject which many writers imagine to cover the whole field of modesty More recently Ribot in his work on the emotions has vaguely outlined most of the factors of modesty but has not developed a coherent view of their origins and relationships Since the present Study first appeared Hohenemser who considers that my analysis of modesty is unsatisfactory has made a notable attempt to define the psychological mechanism of shame Versuch einer Analyse der Scham Archiv fuer die Gesamte Psychologie Bd II Heft two three nineteen oh three He regards shame as a general psycho physical phenomenon a definite tension of the whole soul with an emotion superadded The state of shame consists in a certain psychic lameness or inhibition sometimes accompanied by physical phenomena of paralysis such as sinking of the head and inability to meet the eye It is a special case of Lipps s psychic stasis or damming up psychische Stauung always produced when the psychic activities are at the same time drawn in two or more different directions In shame there is always something present in consciousness which conflicts with the rest of the personality and cannot be brought into harmony with it which cannot be brought that is into moral not logical relationship with it A young man in love with a girl is ashamed when told that he is in love because his reverence for one whom he regards as a higher being cannot be brought into relationship with his own lower personality A child in the same way feels shame in approaching a big grown up person who seems a higher sort of being Sometimes likewise we feel shame in approaching a stranger for a new person tends to seem higher and more interesting than ourselves It is not so in approaching a new natural phenomenon because we do not compare it with ourselves Another kind of shame is seen when this mental contest is lower than our personality and on this account in conflict with it as when we are ashamed of sexual thoughts Sexual ideas tend to evoke shame Hohenemser remarks because they so easily tend to pass into sexual feelings when they do not so pass as in scientific discussions they do not evoke shame It will be seen that this discussion of modesty is highly generalized and abstracted it deals simply with the formal mechanism of the process Hohenemser admits that fear is a form of psychic stasis and I have sought to show that modesty is a complexus of fears We may very well accept the conception of psychic stasis at the outset The analysis of modesty has still to be carried very much further The discussion of modesty is complicated by the difficulty and even impossibility of excluding closely allied emotions shame shyness bashfulness timidity et cetera all of which indeed however defined adjoin or overlap modesty three It is not however impossible to isolate the main body of the emotion of modesty on account of its special connection on the whole with the consciousness of sex I here attempt however imperfectly to sketch out a fairly complete analysis of its constitution and to trace its development In entering upon this investigation a few facts with regard to the various manifestations of modesty may be helpful to us I have selected these from scattered original sources and have sought to bring out the variety and complexity of the problems with which we are here concerned The New Georgians of the Solomon Islands so low a race that they are ignorant both of pottery and weaving and wear only a loin cloth have the same ideas of what is decent with regard to certain acts and exposures that we ourselves have so that it is difficult to observe whether they practice circumcision Somerville Journal of the Anthropological Institute eighteen ninety seven p three hundred ninety four In the New Hebrides the closest secrecy is adopted with regard to the penis not at all from a sense of decency but to avoid Narak the sight even of that of another man being considered most dangerous The natives of this savage island accordingly wrap the penis around with many yards of calico and other like materials winding and folding them until a preposterous bundle eighteen inches or two feet long and two inches or more in diameter is formed which is then supported upward by means of a belt in the extremity decorated with flowering grasses et cetera The testicles are left naked There is no other body covering Somerville Journal of the Anthropological Institute eighteen ninety four p three hundred sixty eight In the Pelew Islands says Kubary as quoted by Bastian it is said that when the God Irakaderugel and his wife were creating man and woman he forming man and she forming woman and were at work on the sexual organs the god wished to see his consort s handiwork She however was cross and persisted in concealing what she had made Ever since then women wear an apron of pandanus leaves and men go naked A Bastian Inselgruppen in Oceanien p one hundred twelve In the Pelew Islands Semper tells us that when approaching a large water hole he was surprised to hear an affrighted long drawn cry from his native friends A girl s voice answered out of the bushes and my people held us back for there were women bathing there who would not allow us to pass When I remarked that they were only women of whom they need not be afraid they replied that it was not so that women had an unbounded right to punish men who passed them when bathing without their permission and could inflict fines or even death On this account the women s bathing place is a safe and favorite spot for a secret rendezvous Fortunately a lady s toilet lasts but a short time in this island Carl Semper Die Palau Inseln eighteen seventy three p sixty eight Among the Western Tribes of Torres Strait Haddon states the men were formerly nude and the women wore only a leaf petticoat but I gather that they were a decent people now both sexes are prudish A man would never go nude before me The women would never voluntarily expose their breasts to white men s gaze this applies to quite young girls less so to old women Amongst themselves they are of course much less particular but I believe they are becoming more so Formerly I imagine there was no restraint in speech now there is a great deal of prudery for instance the men were always much ashamed when I asked for the name of the sexual parts of a woman A C Haddon Ethnography of the Western Tribes of Torres Straits Journal of the Anthropological Institute eighteen ninety p three hundred thirty six After a subsequent expedition to the same region the author reiterates his observations as to the ridiculously prudish manner of the men attributable to missionary influence during the past thirty years and notes that even the children are affected by it At Mabuiag some small children were paddling in the water and a boy of about ten years of age reprimanded a little girl of five or six years because she held up her dress too high Reports of the Cambridge Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits vol v p two hundred seventy two Although the women of New Guinea Vahness says are very slightly clothed they are by no means lacking in a well developed sense of decorum If they notice for instance that any one is paying special attention to their nakedness

Except for waist bands forehead bands necklets and armlets and a conventional pubic tassel shell or in the case of the women a small apron the Central Australian native is naked The pubic tassel is a diminutive structure about the size of a five shilling piece made of a few short strands of fur strings flattened out into a fan shape and attached to the pubic hair As the string especially at corrobboree times is covered with white kaolin or gypsum it serves as a decoration rather than a covering Among the Arunta and Luritcha the women usually wear nothing but further north a small apron is made and worn Baldwin Spencer and Gillen Native Tribes of Central Australia p five hundred seventy two Of the Central Australians Stirling says No sense of shame of exposure was exhibited by the men on removal of the diminutive articles worn as conventional coverings they were taken off coram populo and bartered without hesitation On the other hand some little persuasion was necessary to allow inspection of the effect of urethral sub incision assent being given only after dismissal to a distance of the women and young children As to the women it was nearly always observed that when in camp without clothing they especially the younger ones exhibited by their attitude a keen sense of modesty if indeed a consciousness of their nakedness can be thus considered When we desired to take a photograph of a group of young women they were very coy at the proposal to remove their scanty garments and retired behind a wall to do so but once in a state of nudity they made no objection to exposure to the camera Report of the Horn Scientific Expedition eighteen ninety six vol iv p thirty seven In Northern Queensland phallocrypts or penis concealers only used by the males at corrobborees

Queensland Aborigines eighteen ninety seven pp one hundred fourteen one hundred fifteen The principle of chastity said Forster of his experiences in the South Sea Islands in their unspoilt state we found in many families exceedingly well understood I have seen many fine women who with a modesty mixed with politeness refuse the greatest and most tempting offers made them by our forward youths often they excuse themselves with a simple tirra tano I am married and at other times they smiled and declined it with epia no Virtuous women hear a joke without emotion which amongst us might put some men to the blush Neither austerity and anger nor joy and ecstasy is the consequence but sometimes a modest dignified serene smile spreads itself over their face and seems gently to rebuke the uncouth jester J R Forster Observations made During a Voyage Round the World seventeen twenty eight p three hundred ninety two Captain Cook at Tahiti in seventeen sixty nine after performing Divine service on Sunday witnessed Vespers of a very different kind A young man near six feet high performed the rites of Venus with a little girl about eleven or twelve years of age before several of our people and a great number of the natives without the least sense of its being indecent or improper but as it appeared in perfect conformity to the custom of the place Among the spectators were several women of superior rank who may properly be said to have assisted at the ceremony for they gave instructions to the girl how to perform her part which young as she was she did not seem much to stand in need of J Hawkesworth Account of the Voyages et cetera seventeen seventy five vol i p four hundred sixty nine At Tahiti according to Cook it was customary to gratify every appetite and passion before witnesses and it is added in the conversation of these people that which is the principal source of their pleasure is always the principal topic everything is mentioned without any restraint or emotion and in the most direct terms by both sexes Hawkesworth op cit vol ii p forty five I have observed Captain Cook wrote that our friends in the South Seas have not even the idea of indecency with respect to any object or any action but this was by no means the case with the inhabitants of New Zealand in whose carriage and conversation there was as much modest reserve and decorum with respect to actions which yet in their opinion were not criminal as are to be found among the politest people in Europe The women were not impregnable but the terms and manner of compliance were as decent as those in marriage among us and according to their notions the agreement was as innocent When any of our people made an overture to any of their young women he was given to understand that the consent of her friends was necessary and by the influence of a proper present it was generally obtained but when these preliminaries were settled it was also necessary to treat the wife for a night with the same delicacy that is here required by the wife for life and the lover who presumed to take any liberties by which this was violated was sure to be disappointed Hawkesworth op cit vol ii p two hundred fifty four Cook found that the people of New Zealand bring the prepuce over the gland and to prevent it from being drawn back by contraction of the part they tie the string which hangs from the girdle round the end of it The glans indeed seemed to be the only part of their body which they were solicitous to conceal for they frequently threw off all their dress but the belt and string with the most careless indifference but showed manifest signs of confusion when to gratify our curiosity they were requested to untie the string and never consented but with the utmost reluctance and shame The women s lower garment was always bound fast round them except when they went into the water to catch lobsters and then they took great care not to be seen by the men We surprised several of them at this employment and the chaste Diana with her nymphs could not have discovered more confusion and distress at the sight of Actaeon than these women expressed upon our approach Some of them hid themselves among the rocks and the rest crouched down in the sea till they had made themselves a girdle and apron of such weeds as they could find and when they came out even with this veil we could see that their modesty suffered much pain by our presence Hawkesworth op cit vol ii pp two hundred fifty seven two hundred fifty eight In Rotuma in Polynesia where the women enjoy much freedom but where at all events in old days married people were as a rule faithful to each other the language is not chaste according to our ideas and there is a great deal of freedom in speaking of immoral vices In this connection a man and his wife will speak freely to one another before their friends I am informed though by European traders well conversant with the language that there are grades of language and that certain coarse phrases would never be used to any decent woman so that probably in their way they have much modesty only we cannot appreciate it J Stanley Gardiner The Natives of Rotuma Journal of the Anthropological Institute May eighteen ninety eight p four hundred eighty one The men of Rotuma says the same writer are very clean the women also bathing twice a day in the sea but bathing in public without the kukuluga or sulu loin cloth which is the ordinary dress around the waist is absolutely unheard of and would be much looked down upon Journal of the Anthropological Institute eighteen ninety eight p four hundred ten In ancient Samoa the only necessary garment for either man or woman was an apron of leaves but they possessed so delicate a sense of propriety that even while bathing they have a girdle of leaves or some other covering around the waist Turner Samoa a Hundred Years Ago p one hundred twenty one After babyhood the Indians of Guiana are never seen

Everard im Thurn Among the Indians of Guiana eighteen eighty three The Mandurucu women of Brazil according to Tocantins quoted by Mantegazza are completely naked but they are careful to avoid any postures which might be considered indecorous and they do this so skilfully that it is impossible to tell when they have their menstrual periods Mantegazza Fisiologia della Donna cap nine The Indians of Central Brazil have no private parts In men the little girdle or string surrounding the lower part of the abdomen hides nothing it is worn after puberty the penis being often raised and placed beneath it to lengthen the prepuce The women also use a little strip of bast that goes down the groin and passes between the thighs Among some tribes Karibs Tupis Nu Arwaks a little triangular coquettishly made piece of bark bast comes just below the mons veneris it is only a few centimetres in width and is called the uluri In both sexes concealment of the sexual mucous membrane is attained These articles cannot be called clothing The red thread of the Trumai the elegant uluri and the variegated flag of the Bororo attract attention like ornaments instead of drawing attention away Von den

tribes the women are clothed and the men naked among others the women naked and the men clothed Thus among the Guaycurus the men are quite naked while the women wear a short petticoat among the Uaupas the men always wear a loin cloth while the women are quite naked The feeling of modesty is very developed among the Fuegians who are accustomed to live naked They manifest it in their bearing and in the ease with which they show themselves in a state of nudity compared with the awkwardness blushing and shame which both men and women exhibit if one gazes at certain parts of their bodies Among themselves this is never done even between husband and wife There is no Fuegian word for modesty perhaps because the feeling is universal among them The women wear a minute triangular garment of skin suspended between the thighs and never removed being merely raised during conjugal relations Hyades and Deniker Mission Scientifique du Cap Horn vol vii pp two hundred thirty nine three hundred seven and three hundred forty seven Among the Crow Indians of Montana writes doctor Holder who has lived with them for several years a sense of modesty forbids the attendance upon the female in labor of any male white man or Indian physician or layman This antipathy to receiving assistance at the hands of the physician is overcome as the tribes progress toward civilization and it is especially noticeable that half breeds almost constantly seek the physician s aid doctor Holder mentions the case of a young woman who although brought near the verge of death in a very difficult first confinement repeatedly refused to allow him to examine her at last she consented her modest preparation was to take bits of quilt and cover thighs and lips of vulva leaving only the aperture exposed Their modesty would not be so striking were it not that almost to a woman the females of this tribe are prostitutes and for a consideration will admit the connection of any man A B Holder American Journal of

strangers E H Man Journal of the Anthropological Institute eighteen eighty six p four hundred forty two The semi nude natives of the island of Nias in the Indian Ocean are modest by nature paying no attention to their own nudity or that of others and much scandalized by any attempt to go beyond the limits ordained by custom When they pass near places where women are bathing they raise their

tails of leaves suspended from back of girdle to a female friend the delicacy they manifest for the feelings of the bystanders in their mode of removing it amounts to prudishness yet they wear no clothing in the ordinary sense Journal of the Anthropological Institute eighteen eighty three pp ninety four and three hundred thirty one Of the Garo women of Bengal Dalton says Their sole garment is a piece of cloth less than a foot in width that just meets around the loins and in order that it may not restrain the limbs it is only fastened where it meets under the hip at the upper corners The girls are thus greatly restricted in the positions they may modestly assume but decorum is in their opinion sufficiently preserved if they only keep their legs well together when they sit or kneel E T Dalton Ethnology of Bengal eighteen seventy two p sixty six Of the Naga women of Assam it is said Of clothing there was not much to see but in spite of this I doubt whether we could excel them in true decency and modesty Ibn Muhammed Wali had already remarked in his history of the conquest of Assam sixteen sixty two sixty three that the Naga women only cover their breasts They declare that it is absurd to cover those parts of the body which everyone has been able to see from their births but that it is different with the breasts which appeared later and are therefore to be covered Dalton Journal of the Asiatic Society Bengal forty one one eighty four adds that in the presence of strangers Naga women simply cross their arms over their breasts without caring much what other charms they

cloth and pulls out the wet one from underneath much in the same sliding way as servant girls and young women in England This is the common custom in India and the Malay States The breasts are always bare in their own houses but in the public roads are covered whenever a European passes The vulva is never exposed They say that a devil imagined as a white and hairy being might have intercourse with them Private communication In Borneo the sirat called chawal by the Malays is a strip of cloth a yard wide worn round the loins and in between the thighs so as to cover the pudenda and perinaeum it is generally six yards or so in length but the younger men of the present generation use as much as twelve or fourteen yards sometimes even more which they twist and coil with great precision round and round their body until the waist and stomach are fully enveloped in its folds H Ling Roth Low s Natives of Borneo Journal of the Anthropological Institute eighteen ninety two p thirty six In their own houses in the depths of the forest the Dwarfs are said to neglect coverings for decency in the men as in the women but certainly when they emerge from the forest into the villages of the agricultural Negroes they are always observed to be wearing some small piece of bark cloth or skin or a bunch of leaves over the pudenda Elsewhere in all the regions of Africa visited by the writer or described by other observers a neglect of decency in the male has only been recorded among the Efik people of Old Calabar The nudity of women is another question In parts of West Africa between the Niger and the Gaboon especially on the Cameroon River at Old Calabar and in the Niger Delta it is or was customary for young women to go about completely nude before they were married In Swaziland until quite recently unmarried women and very often matrons went stark naked Even amongst the prudish Baganda who made it a punishable offense for a man to expose any part of his leg above the knee the wives of the King would attend at his Court perfectly naked Among the Kavirondo all unmarried girls are completely nude and although women who have become mothers are supposed to wear a tiny covering before and behind they very often completely neglect to do so when in their own villages Yet as a general rule among the Nile Negroes and still more markedly among the Hamites and people of Masai stock the women are particular about concealing the pudenda whereas the men are ostentatiously naked The Baganda hold nudity in the male to be such an abhorrent thing that for centuries they have referred with scorn and disgust to the Nile Negroes as the naked people Male nudity extends northwest to within some two hundred miles of Khartum or in fact wherever the Nile Negroes of the Dinka Acholi stock inhabit the country Sir H H Johnston Uganda Protectorate vol ii pp six hundred sixty nine six hundred seventy two Among the Nilotic Ja luo Johnston states that unmarried men go naked Married men who have children wear a small piece of goat skin which though quite inadequate for purposes of decency is nevertheless a very important thing in etiquette for a married man with a child must on no account call on his mother in law without wearing this piece of goat s skin To call on her in a state of absolute nudity would be regarded as a serious insult only to be atoned for by the payment of goats Even if under the new dispensation he wears European trousers he must have a piece of goat s skin underneath Married women wear a tail of strings behind It is very bad manners for a woman to serve food to her husband without putting on this tail Sir H H Johnston Uganda Protectorate vol ii p seven hundred eighty one missus French Sheldon remarks that the Masai and other East African tribes with regard to menstruation observe the greatest delicacy and are more than modest Journal of the Anthropological Institute eighteen ninety four p three hundred eighty three At the same time the Masai

reaching in many respects a higher stage of civilization in Schweinfurth s opinion than is elsewhere attained in Africa only the women wear aprons The neighboring tribes of the red soil Bongo Mittoo

Dinka negroes brought from the White Nile remark As to their psychology what struck us first was the exaggeration of their modesty not in a single case would the men allow us to examine their genital

these people are highly moral Lombroso and Carrara Archivio di Psichiatria eighteen ninety six vol xvii fasc four The negro is very rarely knowingly indecent or addicted to lubricity says Sir H H

unspoiled savages in the case of that most shameless member of the community the little boy He adds that the native dances are only an apparent exception being serious in character though indecent to our eyes almost constituting a religious ceremony The only really indecent dance indigenous to Central Africa is one which originally represented the act of coition but it is so altered to a stereotyped formula that its exact purport is not obvious until explained somewhat shyly by the natives It may safely be asserted that the negro race in Central Africa is much more truly modest is much more free from real vice than are most European nations Neither boys nor girls wear clothing unless they are the children of chiefs until nearing the age of puberty Among the Wankonda practically no covering is worn by the men except a ring of brass wire around the stomach The Wankonda women are likewise almost entirely naked but generally cover the pudenda with a tiny bead work apron often a piece of very beautiful workmanship and exactly resembling the same article worn by Kaffir women A like degree of nudity prevails among many of the Awemba among the A lungu the Batumbuka and the Angoni Most of the Angoni men however adopt the Zulu fashion of covering the glans penis with a small wooden case or the outer shell of a fruit The Wa Yao have a strong sense of decency in matters of this kind which is the more curious since they are more given to obscenity in their rites ceremonies and dances than any other tribe Not only is it extremely rare to see any Yao uncovered but both men and women have the strongest dislike to exposing their persons even to the inspection of a doctor The Atonga and many of the A nyanga people and all the tribes west of Nyassa with the exception possibly of the A lunda have not the Yao regard for decency and although they can seldom or ever be accused of a deliberate intention to expose themselves the men are relatively indifferent as to whether their nakedness is or is not concealed though the women are modest and careful in this respect H H Johnston British Central Africa eighteen ninety seven pp four hundred eight four hundred

puberty a season of rejoicing when the girl is initiated into all the secrets of marriage amid songs and dances referring to the act of coition The whole matter is looked upon as a matter of course and not as a thing to be ashamed of or to hide and being thus openly treated of and no secrecy made about it you find in this tribe that the women are very virtuous They know from the first all that is to be known and cannot see any reason for secrecy concerning natural laws or the powers and senses that have been given them from birth Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie eighteen ninety eight Heft six p

is abandoned with unconcern I have on several occasions says doctor Freeman seen women at Accra walk from the beach where they have been bathing across the road to their houses where they would proceed to dry themselves and resume their garments and women may not infrequently be seen bathing in pools by the wayside conversing quite unconstrainedly with their male acquaintances who are seated on the bank The mere unclothed body conveys to their minds no idea of indecency Immodesty and indelicacy of manner are practically unknown He adds that the excessive zeal of missionaries in urging their converts to adopt European dress which they are only too ready to do is much to be regretted since the close fitting thin garments are really less modest than the loose clothes they replace besides being much less cleanly R A Freeman Travels and Life in Ashanti and Jaman eighteen ninety eight p three hundred seventy nine At Loango says Pechuel Loesche the well bred negress likes to cover

ancient times they say a bride concealed herself for seven years from her father in law and from the brothers and other masculine relations of her husband The men also tried not to meet her saying The poor child will be ashamed If a meeting could not be avoided the young woman put a mask on her face Nowadays the young wives only avoid showing to their male relatives in law the uncovered body Amongst the rich they avoid going about in the presence of these in the chemise alone In some places they lay especial emphasis on the fact that it is a shame for young wives to show their uncovered hair and feet to the male relatives of their husbands On the other side the male relatives of the husband ought to avoid showing to the young wife the body uncovered above the elbow or the sole of the foot and they ought to avoid indecent expressions and vulgar vituperations in her presence That these observances are not the result of a specially delicate modesty is proved by the fact that even young girls constantly twist thread upon the naked thigh unembarrassed by the presence of men who do not belong to the household nor do they show any embarrassment if a strange man comes upon them when uncovered to the waist The one thing which they do not like and at which they show anger is that such persons look carefully at their uncovered feet The former simplicity with lack of shame in

athletes formerly even when they were contending at Olympia wore girdles about their loins earlier still the Mycenaeans had always worn a loin cloth a practice which lasted until quite lately and still persists among barbarians especially those of Asia where the combatants at boxing and wrestling matches wear girdles Thucydides History Book I Chapter VI The notion of the women exercising naked in the schools with the men at the present day would appear truly ridiculous Not long since it was thought discreditable and ridiculous among the Greeks as it is now among most barbarous nations for men to be seen naked And when the Cretans first and after them the Lacedaemonians began the practice of gymnastic exercises the wits of the time had it in their power to make sport of those novelties As for the man who laughs at the idea of undressed women going through gymnastic exercises as a means of revealing what is most perfect his ridicule is but unripe fruit plucked from the tree of wisdom

sacrifices the young women should dance naked and sing the young men standing around in a circle to see and hear them Aristotle says that in his time Spartan girls only wore a very slight garment As

is good may be done and discussed before all men There are a number of authorities who say that Crates and Hipparchia consummated their marriage in the presence of many spectators Lactantius Inst iii

Tyrrhenians who carry their luxury to an extraordinary pitch Timaeus in his first book relates that the female servants wait on the men in a state of nudity And Theopompus in the forty third book of his History states that it is a law among the Tyrrhenians that all their women should be in common and that the women pay the greatest attention to their persons and often practice gymnastic exercises naked among the men and sometimes with one another for that it is not accounted shameful for them to be seen naked Nor is it reckoned among the Tyrrhenians at all disgraceful either to do or suffer anything in the open air or to be seen while it is going on for it is quite the custom of their country and they are so far from thinking it disgraceful that they even say when the master of the house is indulging his appetite and anyone asks for him that he is doing so and so using the coarsest possible words And they are very beautiful as is natural for people to be who live delicately and who take care of their persons Athenaeus Deipnosophists Yonge s translation vol iii p eight hundred twenty nine Dennis throws doubt on the foregoing statement of Athenaeus regarding the Tyrrhenians or Etruscans and points out that the representations of women in Etruscan tombs shows them as clothed even the breast being rarely uncovered Nudity he remarks was a Greek not an Etruscan characteristic

matter than in Greece the bath became common to both sexes and though each had its basin and hot room apart they could see each other meet speak form intrigues arrange meetings and multiply adulteries At first the baths were so dark that men and women could wash side by side without recognizing each other except by the voice but soon the light of day was allowed to enter from every side In the bath of Scipio said Seneca there were narrow ventholes rather than windows hardly admitting enough light to outrage modesty but nowadays baths are called caves if they do not receive the sun s rays through large windows Hadrian severely prohibited this mingling of men and women and ordained separate lavaera for the sexes Marcus Aurelius and Alexander Severus renewed this edict but in the interval Heliogabalus had authorized the sexes to meet in the baths Dufour Histoire de la Prostitution vol ii Ch XVIII cf Smith s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities Art Balneae In Rome according to ancient custom actors were compelled to wear drawers subligaculum on the stage in order to safeguard the modesty of Roman matrons Respectable women it seems also always wore some sort of subligaculum even sometimes when bathing The name was also applied to a leathern girdle laced behind which they were occasionally made to wear as a girdle of chastity Dufour op cit vol ii p one hundred fifty Greek women also wore a cloth round the loins when taking the bath as did the men who bathed there and a woman is represented bathing and wearing a sort of thin combinations reaching to the middle of the

XVII Lecky History of Morals vol ii p three hundred eighteen brings together instances of women in both Pagan and early Christian times who showed their modesty by drawing their garments around them even at the moment that they were being brutally killed Plutarch in his essay on the Virtues of Women moralizing on the well known story of the young women of Milesia among whom an epidemic of suicide was only brought to an end by the decree that in future women who hanged themselves should be carried naked through the market places observes They who had no dread of the most terrible things in the world death and pain could not abide the imagination of dishonor and exposure to shame even after death In the second century the physician Aretaeus writing at Rome remarks In many cases owing to involuntary restraint from modesty at assemblies and at banquets the bladder becomes distended and from the consequent loss of its contractile power it no longer evacuates the urine On the Causes and Symptoms of Acute Diseases Book II Chapter X Apuleius writing in the second century says Most women in order to exhibit their native gracefulness and allurements divest themselves of all their garments and long to show their naked beauty being conscious that they shall please more by the rosy redness of their skin than by the golden splendor of their robes Thomas Taylor s translation of Metamorphosis p twenty eight Christianity seems to have profoundly affected habits of thought and feeling by uniting together the merely natural emotion of sexual reserve with on the one hand the masculine virtue of modesty modestia and on the other the prescription of sexual abstinence Tertullian admirably illustrates this confusion and his treatises De Pudicitia and De Cultu Feminarum are instructive from the present point of view In the latter he remarks Book II Chapter I Salvation and not of women only but likewise of men consists in the exhibition principally of modesty Since we are all the temple of God modesty is the sacristan and priestess of that temple who is to suffer nothing unclean or profane to enter it for fear that the God who inhabits it should be offended Most women either from simple ignorance or from dissimulation have the hardihood so to walk as if modesty consisted only in the integrity of the flesh and in turning away from fornication and there were no need for anything else in dress and ornament the studied graces of form wearing in their gait the self same appearance as the women of the nations from whom the sense of true modesty is absent The earliest Christian ideal of modesty not long maintained is well shown in an epistle which there is some reason to suppose was written by Clement of Rome And if we see it to be requisite to stand and pray for the sake of the woman and to speak words of exhortation and edification we call the brethren and all the holy sisters and maidens likewise all the other women who are there with all modesty and becoming behavior to come and feast on the truth And those among us who are skilled in speaking speak to them and exhort them in those words which God has given us And then we pray and salute one another the men the men But the women and the maidens will wrap their hands in their garments we also with circumspection and with all purity our eyes looking upward shall wrap our right hand in our garments and then they will come and give us the salutation on our right hand wrapped in our garments Then we go where God permits us Two Epistles Concerning Virginity Second Epistle Chapter III vol xiv Ante Nicene Christian Library p three hundred eighty four Women will scarce strip naked before their own husbands affecting a plausible pretense of modesty writes Clement of Alexandria about the end of the second century but any others who wish may see them at home shut up in their own baths for they are not ashamed to strip before spectators as if exposing their persons for sale The baths are opened promiscuously to men and women and there they strip for licentious indulgence for from looking men get to loving as if their modesty had been washed away in the bath Those who have not become utterly destitute of modesty shut out strangers but bathe with their own servants and strip naked before their slaves and are rubbed by them giving to the crouching menial liberty to lust by permitting fearless handling for those who are introduced before their naked mistresses while in the bath study to strip themselves in order to show audacity in lust casting off fear in consequence of the wicked custom The ancient athletes ashamed to exhibit a man naked preserved their modesty by going through the contest in drawers but these women divesting themselves of their modesty along with their chemise wish to appear beautiful but contrary to their wish are simply proved to be wicked Clement of Alexandria Paedagogus Book III Chapter V For elucidations of this passage see Migne s Patrologiae Cursus Completus vol vii Promiscuous bathing was forbidden by the early Apostolical Constitutions but Cyprian Bishop of Carthage found it necessary in the third century to upbraid even virgins vowed to chastity for continuing the custom What of those he asks who frequent baths who prostitute to eyes that are curious to lust bodies that are dedicated to chastity and modesty They who disgracefully behold naked men and are seen naked by men Do they not themselves afford enticement to vice Do they not solicit and invite the desires of those present to their own corruption and wrong Let every one say you look to the disposition with which he comes thither my care is only that of refreshing and washing my poor body That kind of defence does not clear you nor does it excuse the crime of lasciviousness and wantonness Such a washing defiles it does not purify nor cleanse the limbs but stains them You behold no one immodestly but you yourself are gazed upon immodestly you do not pollute your eyes with disgraceful delight but in delighting others you yourself are polluted you make a show of the bathing place the places where you assemble are fouler than a theatre There all modesty is put off together with the clothing of garments the honor and modesty of the body is laid aside virginity is exposed to be pointed at and to be handled Let your baths be performed with women whose behavior is modest towards you Cyprian De Habitu Virginum cap nineteen twenty one The Church carried the same spirit among the barbarians of northern Europe and several centuries later the promiscuous bathing of men and women was prohibited in some of the Penitentials The custom was however preserved here and there in Northern Europe even to the end of the eighteenth century or later In Rudeck s Geschichte der oeffentlichen Sittlichkeit in Deutschland an interesting chapter with contemporary illustrations is devoted to this custom also Max Bauer Das Geschlechtsleben in der Deutschen Vergangenheit pp two hundred sixteen two hundred sixty five Women says Clement again should not seek to be graceful by avoiding broad drinking vessels that oblige them to stretch their mouths in order to drink from narrow alabastra that cause them indecently to throw back the head revealing to men their necks and breasts The mere thought of what she is ought to inspire a woman with modesty On no account must a woman be permitted to show to a man any portion of her body naked for fear lest both fall the one by gazing eagerly the other by delighting to attract those eager glances Paedagogus Book II Chapter V James Bishop of Nisibis in the fourth century was a man of great holiness We are told by Thedoret that once when James had newly come into Persia it was vouchsafed to him to perform a miracle under the following circumstances He chanced to pass by a fountain where young women were washing their linen and his modesty being profoundly shocked by the exposure involved in this occupation he cursed the fountain which instantly dried up and he changed the hair of the girls from black to a sandy color Jortin Remarks on Ecclesiastical History vol iii p four Procopius writing in the sixth century after Christ and narrating how the Empress Theodora in early life would often appear almost naked before the public in the theatre adds that she would willingly have appeared altogether nude but that no woman is allowed to expose herself altogether unless she wears at least short drawers over the lower part of the abdomen Chrysostom mentions at the end of the fourth century that Arcadius attempted to put down the August festival Majuma during which women appeared naked in the theatres or swimming in large baths In mediaeval days ladies at all events as represented by the poets were not on the whole very prudish Meleranz surprised a lady who was taking a bath under a lime tree the bath was covered with samite and by it was a magnificent ivory bed surrounded by tapestries representing the history of Paris and Helen the destruction of Troy the adventures of AEneas et cetera As Meleranz rides by the lady s waiting maids run away she herself however with quick decision raises the samite which covers the tub and orders him to wait on her in place of the maids He brings her shift and mantle and shoes and then stands aside till she is dressed when she has placed herself on the bed she calls him back and commands him to drive away the flies while she sleeps Strange to say the men are represented as more modest than the women When two maidens prepared a bath for Parzival and proposed to bathe him according to custom the inexperienced young knight was shy and would not enter the bath until they had gone on another occasion he jumped quickly into bed when the maidens entered the room When Wolfdieterich was about to undress he had to ask the ladies who pressed around him to leave him alone for a short time as he was ashamed they should see him naked When Amphons of Spain bewitched by his step mother into a were wolf was at last restored and stood suddenly naked before her he was greatly ashamed The maiden who healed Iwein was tender of his modesty In his love madness the hero wanders for a time naked through the wood three women find him asleep and send a waiting maid to annoint him with salve when he came to himself the maiden hid herself On the whole however the ladies were not so delicate they had no hesitation in bathing with gentlemen and on these occasions would put their finest ornaments on their heads I know no pictures of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries representing such a scene but such baths in common are clearly represented in miniatures of the fifteenth century A Schultz Das Hoefische Leben zur Zeit der Minnesaenger vol i p two hundred twenty five In the years fourteen fifty seventy the use of the cod piece was introduced whereby the attributes of manhood were accentuated in the most shameless manner It was in fact the avowed aim at that period to attract attention to these parts The cod piece was sometimes colored differently from the rest of the garments often stuffed out to enlarge it artificially and decorated with ribbons Rudeck Geschichte der oeffentlichen Sittlichkeit in Deutschland pp forty five forty eight Dufour Histoire de la Prostitution vol vi pp twenty one twenty three Groos refers to the significance of this fashion Spiele der Menschen p three hundred thirty seven The first shirt began to be worn in Germany in the sixteenth century From this fact as well as from the custom of public bathing we reach the remarkable result that for the German people the sight of complete nakedness was the daily rule up to the sixteenth century Everyone undressed completely before going to bed and in the vapor baths no covering was used Again the dances both of the peasants and the townspeople were characterized by very high leaps into the air It was the chief delight of the dancers for the male to raise his partner as high as possible in the air so that her dress flew up That feminine modesty was in this respect very indifferent we know from countless references made in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries It must not be forgotten that throughout the middle ages women wore no underclothes and even in the seventeenth century the wearing of drawers by Italian women was regarded as singular That with the disappearance of the baths and the use of body linen a powerful influence was exerted on the creation of modesty there can be little doubt Rudeck op cit pp fifty seven three hundred ninety nine et cetera In fourteen sixty one when Louis XI entered Paris three very beautiful maidens quite naked represented the Syrens and declaimed

taken off after another even the chemise is hung on the hook Then the door is bolted the light blown out and one goes to bed As we blamed their ways saying that among us a woman would not act so even in the presence of her husband alone they replied that they knew nothing of such shame and that there was no need to be ashamed of limbs which God had created Moreover to sleep without a shift was good because like the other garments it sufficiently served the body during the day Also why take fleas and other insects to bed with one Although our men teased them in various ways they would not change their habits Passek Denkwuerdigkeiten German translation p fourteen Until late in the seventeenth century women in England as well as France suffered much in childbirth from the ignorance and superstition of incompetent midwives owing to the prevailing conceptions of modesty which rendered it impossible as it is still to some extent in some semi civilized lands for male physicians to attend them doctor Willoughby of Derby tells how in sixteen fifty eight he had to creep into the chamber of a lying in woman on his hands and knees in order to examine her unperceived In France Clement was employed secretly to attend the mistresses of Louis XIV in their confinements to the first he was conducted blindfold while the King was concealed among the bed curtains and the face of

the early nineteenth century we still find much insistence on the demands of modesty Thus doctor John Burns of Glasgow in his Principles of Midwifery states that some women from motives of false delicacy are averse from examination until the pains become severe He adds that it is usual for the room to be darkened and the bed curtains drawn close during an examination Many old pictures show

North of Ireland who told me in great earnestness that he coming to the house of Ocane a great lord among them was met at the door with sixteen women all naked excepting their loose mantles whereof eight or ten were very fair and two seemed very nymphs with which strange sight his eyes being dazzled they led him into the house and then sitting down by the fire with crossed legs like tailors and so low as could not but offend chaste eyes desired him to sit down with them Soon after Ocane the lord of the country came in all naked excepting a loose mantle and shoes which he put off as soon as he came in and entertaining the baron after his best manner in the Latin tongue desired him to put off his apparel which he thought to be a burthen to him and to sit naked by the fire with this naked

Coryat Crudities sixteen eleven The fashion of decollete garments it may be remarked only began in the fourteenth century previously the women of Europe generally covered themselves up to the neck In Northern Italy some years ago a fire occurred at night in a house in which two girls were sleeping naked according to the custom One threw herself out and was saved the other returned for a garment and was burnt to death The narrator of the incident a man expressed strong approval of the more modest girl s action Private communication It may be added that the custom of sleeping naked is still preserved also according to Lippert and Stratz in Jutland in Iceland in some parts of Norway and sometimes even in Berlin Lady Mary Wortley Montague writes in seventeen seventeen of the Turkish ladies at the baths at Sophia The first sofas were covered with cushions and rich carpets on which sat the ladies and on the second their slaves behind them but without any distinction of rank in their dress all being in a state of Nature that is in plain English stark naked without any beauty or defect concealed Yet there was not the least wanton smile or immodest gesture among them They walked and moved with the same majestic grace which Milton describes of our general mother I am here convinced of the truth of a reflection I had often made that if it was the fashion to go naked the face would be

ridiculous prudery nevertheless if she had proposed the question to me I should certainly have answered They cannot She further quotes from an educational book It would be needless to caution you against putting your hand by chance under your neck handkerchief for a modest woman never did so Mary Wollstonecraft The Rights of Woman seventeen ninety two pp two hundred seventy seven two hundred eighty nine At the present time a knowledge of the physiology of plants is not usually considered inconsistent with modesty but a knowledge of animal physiology is still so considered by many doctor H R Hopkins of New York wrote in eighteen ninety five regarding the teaching of physiology How can we teach growing girls the functions of the various parts of the human body and still leave them their modesty That is the practical question that has puzzled me for years In England the use of drawers was almost unknown among women half a century ago and was considered immodest and unfeminine Tilt a distinguished gynecologist of that period advocated such garments made of fine calico and not to descend below the knee on hygienic grounds Thus understood he added the adoption of drawers will doubtless become more general in this country as being worn without the knowledge of the general observer they will be robbed of the prejudice usually attached to an appendage deemed masculine Tilt Elements of Health eighteen fifty two p one hundred ninety three Drawers came into general use among women during the third quarter of the nineteenth century Drawers are an Oriental garment and seem to have reached Europe through Venice the great channel of communication with the East Like many other refinements of decency and cleanliness they were at first chiefly cultivated by prostitutes and on this account there was long a prejudice against them Even at the present day it is said that in France a young peasant girl will exclaim if asked whether she wears drawers I wear drawers Madame A respectable girl Drawers however quickly became acclimatized in France and Dufour op cit vol vi p twenty eight even regards them as essentially a French garment They were introduced at the Court towards the end of the fourteenth century and in the sixteenth century were rendered almost necessary by the new fashion of the vertugale or farthingale In sixteen fifteen a lady s calecons are referred to as apparently an ordinary garment It is noteworthy that in London in the middle of the same century young missus Pepys who was the daughter of French parents usually wore drawers which were seemingly of the closed kind Diary of S Pepys ed Wheatley May fifteen sixteen sixty three vol iii They were probably not worn by Englishwomen and even in France with the decay of the farthingale they seem to have dropped out of use during the seventeenth century In a technical and very complete book L Art de la Lingerie published in seventeen seventy one women s drawers are not even mentioned and Mercier Tableau de Paris seventeen eighty three vol vii p fifty four says that except actresses Parisian women do not wear drawers Even by ballet dancers and actresses on the stage they were not invariably worn Camargo the famous dancer who first shortened the skirt in dancing early in the eighteenth century always observed great decorum never showing the leg above the knee when appealed to as to whether she wore drawers she replied that she could not possibly appear without such a precaution But they were not necessarily worn by dancers and in seventeen twenty seven a young ballerina having had her skirt accidentally torn away by a piece of stage machinery the police issued an order that in future no actress or dancer should appear on the stage without drawers this regulation does not appear however to have been long strictly maintained though Schulz Ueber Paris und die Pariser p one hundred forty five refers to it as in force in seventeen ninety one The obscure origin and history of feminine drawers have been discussed from time to time in the Intermediaire des Chercheurs et Curieux especially vols xxv lii and liii Prof Irving Rosse of Washington refers to New England prudishness and the colossal modesty of some New York policemen who in certain cases want to give written rather than oral testimony He adds I have known this sentiment carried to such an extent in a Massachusetts small town that a shop keeper was obliged to drape a small but innocent statuette displayed in his window Irving Rosse Virginia Medical Monthly October eighteen ninety two I am told that popular feeling in South Africa would not permit the exhibition of the nude in the Art Collections of Cape Town Even in Italy nude statues are disfigured by the addition of tin fig leaves and sporadic manifestations of horror at the presence of nude statues even when of most classic type are liable to occur in all parts of Europe including France and Germany Examples of this are recorded from time to time in Sexual reform published as an appendix to Geschlecht und Gesellschaft Some years ago eighteen ninety eight it was stated that the Philadelphia Ladies Home Journal had decided to avoid in future all reference to ladies under linen because the treatment of this subject in print calls for minutiae of detail which is extremely and pardonably offensive to refined and sensitive women A man married twenty years told me that he had never seen his wife entirely nude Such concealment of the external reproductive organs by married people appears to be common Judging from my own inquiry very few women care to look upon male nakedness and many women though not wanting in esthetic feeling find no beauty in man s form Some are positively repelled by the sight of nakedness even that of a husband or lover On the contrary most men delight in gazing upon the uncovered figure of women It seems that only highly cultivated and imaginative women enjoy the spectacle of a finely shaped nude man especially after attending art classes and drawing from the nude as I am told by a lady artist Or else the majority of women dissemble their curiosity or admiration A woman of seventy mother of several children said to a young wife with whom I am acquainted I have never seen a naked man in my life This old lady s sister confessed that she had never looked at her own nakedness in the whole course of her life She said that it frightened her She was the mother of three sons A maiden woman of the same family told her niece that women were disgusting because they have monthly discharges The niece suggested that women have no choice in the matter to which the aunt replied I know that but it doesn t make them less disgusting I have heard of a girl who died from haemorrhage of the womb refusing through shame to make the ailment known to her family The misery suffered by some women at the anticipation of a medical examination appears to be very acute Husbands have told me of brides who sob and tremble with fright on the wedding night the hysteria being sometimes alarming E aged twenty five refused her husband for six weeks after marriage exhibiting the greatest fear of his approach Ignorance of the nature of the sexual connection is often the cause of exaggerated alarm In Jersey I used to hear of a bride who ran to the window and screamed murder on the wedding night Private communication At the present day it is not regarded as incompatible with modesty to exhibit the lower part of the thigh when in swimming costume but it is immodest to exhibit the upper part of the thigh In swimming competitions a minimum of clothing must be combined with the demands of modesty In England the regulations of the Swimming Clubs affiliated to the Amateur Swimming Association require that the male swimmer s costume shall extend not less than eight inches from the bifurcation downward and that the female swimmer s costume shall extend to within not more than three inches from the knee A prolonged discussion we are told arose as to whether the costume should come to one two or three inches from the knee and the proposal of the youngest lady swimmer present that the costume ought to be very scanty met with little approval The modesty of women is thus seen to be greater than that of men by roughly speaking about two inches The same difference may be seen in the sleeves the male sleeve must extend for two inches the female sleeve four inches down the arm Daily Papers September twenty six eighteen ninety eight At bathing in a state of Nature was de rigueur for the elite of the bathers while our Sunday visitors from the slums frequently made a great point of wearing bathing costumes it was frequently noticed that those who were most anxious to avoid exposing their persons were distinguished by the foulness of their language My impression was that their foul mindedness deprived them of the consciousness of safety from coarse jests If I were bathing alone among blackguards I should probably feel uncomfortable myself if without costume Private communication A lady in a little city of the south of Italy told Paola Lombroso that young middle class girls there are not allowed to go out except to Mass and cannot even show themselves at the window except under their mother s eye yet they do not think it necessary to have a cabin when sea bathing and even dispense with a bathing costume without consciousness of immodesty P Lombroso Archivio di Psichiatria nineteen oh one p three hundred six A woman mentioned to me that a man came to her and told her in confidence his distress of mind he feared he had corrupted his wife because she got into a bath in his presence with her baby and enjoyed his looking at her splashing about He was deeply distressed thinking he must have done her harm and destroyed her modesty The woman to whom this was said felt naturally indignant but also it gave her the feeling as if every man may secretly despise a woman for the very things he teaches her and only meets her confiding delight with regret or dislike Private communication Women will occasionally be found to hide diseases and symptoms from a bashfulness and modesty so great and perverse as to be hardly credible writes doctor W Wynn Westcott an experienced coroner I have known several cases of female deaths reported as sudden and of cause unknown when the medical man called in during the latter hours of life has been quite unaware that his lady patient was dying of gangrene of a strangulated femoral hernia or was bleeding to death from the bowel or from ruptured varices of the vulva British Medical Journal Feb twenty nine nineteen oh eight The foregoing selection of facts might of course be indefinitely enlarged since I have not generally quoted from any previous collection of facts bearing on the question of modesty Such collections may be found in Ploss and Max Bartels Das Weib a work that is constantly appearing in new and enlarged editions Herbert Spencer Descriptive Sociology especially under such headings as Clothing Moral Sentiments and AEsthetic Products W G Sumner Folkways Ch XI Mantegazza Amori degli Uomini

Waitz Gerland Peschel Ratzel and others FOOTNOTES one The earliest theory I have met with is that of saint Augustine who states De Civitate Dei Bk XIV Ch XVII that erections of the penis never occurred until after the Fall of Man It was the occurrence of this shameless novelty which made nakedness indecent This theory fails to account for modesty in women two Guyau L Irreligion de l Avenir Ch VII three Timidity as understood by Dugas in his interesting essay on that subject is probably most remote doctor H Campbell s morbid shyness British Medical Journal September twenty six eighteen ninety six is in part identical with timidity in part with modesty The matter is further complicated by the fact that modesty itself has in English like virtue two distinct meanings In its original form it has no special connection with sex or women but may rather be considered as a masculine virtue Cicero regards modestia as the equivalent of the Greek sophrosune This is the modesty which Mary Wollstonecraft eulogized in the last century the outcome of knowledge and reflection soberness of mind the graceful calm virtue of maturity In French it is possible to avoid the confusion and modestie is entirely distinct from pudeur It is of course mainly with pudeur that I am here concerned II Modesty an Agglomeration of Fears Children in Relation to Modesty Modesty in Animals The Attitude of the Medicean Venus The Sexual Factor of Modesty Based on Sexual Periodicity and on the Primitive Phenomena of Courtship The Necessity of Seclusion in Primitive Sexual Intercourse The Meaning of Coquetry The Sexual Charm of Modesty Modesty as an Expression of Feminine Erotic Impulse The Fear of Causing Disgust as a Factor of Modesty The Modesty of Savages in Regard to Eating in the Presence of Others The Sacro Pubic Region as a Focus of Disgust The Idea of Ceremonial Uncleanliness The Custom of Veiling the Face Ornaments and Clothing Modesty Becomes Concentrated in the Garment The Economic Factor in Modesty The Contribution of Civilization to Modesty The Elaboration of Social Ritual That modesty like all the closely allied emotions is based on fear one of the most primitive of the emotions seems to be fairly evident four The association of modesty and fear is even a very ancient observation and is found in the fragments of Epicharmus while according to one of the most recent definitions modesty is the timidity of the body Modesty is indeed an agglomeration of fears especially as I hope to show of two important and distinct fears one of much earlier than human origin and supplied solely by the female the other of more distinctly human character and of social rather than sexual origin A child left to itself though very bashful is wholly devoid of modesty five Everyone is familiar with the shocking inconvenances of children in speech and act with the charming ways in which they innocently disregard the conventions of modesty their elders thrust upon them or even when anxious to carry them out wholly miss the point at issue as when a child thinks that to put a little garment round the neck satisfies the demands of modesty Julius Moses states that modesty in the uncovering of the sexual parts begins about the age of four But in cases when this occurs it is difficult to exclude teaching and example Under civilized conditions the convention of modesty long precedes its real development Bell has found that in love affairs before the age of nine the girl is more aggressive than the boy and that at that age she begins to be modest six It may fairly be said that complete development of modesty only takes place at the advent of puberty seven We may admit with Perez one of the very few writers who touch on the evolution of this emotion that modesty may appear at a very early age if sexual desire appears early eight We should not however be justified in asserting that on this account modesty is a purely sexual phenomenon The social impulses also develop about puberty and to that coincidence the compound nature of the emotion of modesty may well be largely due The sexual factor is however the simplest and most primitive element of modesty and may therefore be mentioned first Anyone who watches a bitch not in heat when approached by a dog with tail wagging gallantly may see the beginnings of modesty When the dog s attentions become a little too marked the bitch squats firmly down on the front legs and hind quarters though when the period of oestrus comes her modesty may be flung to the air and she eagerly turns her hind quarters to her admirer s nose and elevates her tail high in the air Her attitude of refusal is equivalent that is to say to that which in the human race is typified by the classical example of womanly modesty in the Medicean Venus who withdraws the pelvis at the same time holding one hand to guard the pubes the other to guard the breasts nine The essential expression in each case is that of defence of the sexual centers against the undesired advances of the male ten Stratz who criticizes the above statement argues with photographs of nude women in illustration that the normal type of European surprised modesty is shown by an attitude in which the arms are crossed over the breast the most sexually attractive region while the thighs are pressed together one being placed before the other the shoulder raised and the back slightly curved occasionally he adds the hands may be used to cover the face and then the crossed arms conceal the breasts The Medicean Venus he remarks is only a pretty woman coquetting with her body Canova s Venus in the Pitti who has drapery in front of her and presses her arms across her breast being a more accurate rendering of the attitude of modesty But Stratz admits that when a surprised woman is gazed at for some time she turns her head away sinks or closes her eyes and covers her pubes or any other part she thinks is being gazed at with one hand while with the other she hides her breast or face This he terms the secondary expression of modesty Stratz Die Frauenkleidung third ed p twenty three It is certainly true that the Medicean Venus merely represents an artistic convention a generalized tradition not founded on exact and precise observation of the gestures of modesty and it is equally true that all the instinctive movements noted by Stratz are commonly resorted to by a woman whose nakedness is surprised But in the absence of any series of carefully recorded observations one may doubt whether the distinction drawn by Stratz between the primary and the secondary expression of modesty can be upheld as the general rule while it is most certainly not true for every case When a young woman is surprised in a state of nakedness by a person of the opposite or even of the same sex it is her instinct to conceal the primary centers of sexual function and attractiveness in the first place the pubes in the second place the breasts The exact attitude and the particular gestures of the hands in achieving the desired end vary with the individual and with the circumstances The hand may not be used at all as a veil and indeed the instinct of modesty itself may inhibit the use of the hand for the protection of modesty to turn the back towards the beholder is often the chief impulse of blushing modesty even when clothed but the application of the hand to this end is primitive and natural The lowly Fuegian woman depicted by Hyades and Deniker who holds her hand to her pubes while being photographed is one at this point with the Roman Venus described by Ovid Ars Amatoria Book II Ipsa Venus pubem quoties velamnia ponit Protegitur laeva semireducta manus It may be added that young men of the lower social classes at all events in England when bathing at the seaside in complete nudity commonly grasp the sexual organs with one hand for concealment as they walk up from the sea The sexual modesty of the female animal is rooted in the sexual periodicity of the female and is an involuntary expression of the organic fact that the time for love is not now Inasmuch as this fact is true of the greater part of the lives of all female animals below man the expression itself becomes so habitual that it even intrudes at those moments when it has ceased to be in place We may see this again illustrated in the bitch who when in heat herself runs after the male and again turns to flee perhaps only submitting with much persuasion to his embrace Thus modesty becomes something more than a mere refusal of the male it becomes an invitation to the male and is mixed up with his ideas of what is sexually desirable in the female This would alone serve to account for the existence of modesty as a psychical secondary sexual character In this sense and in this sense only we may say with Colin Scott that the feeling of shame is made to be overcome and is thus correlated with its physical representative the hymen in the rupture of which as Groos remarks there is in some degree a disruption also of modesty The sexual modesty of the female is thus an inevitable by product of the naturally aggressive attitude of the male in sexual relationships and the naturally defensive attitude of the female this again being founded on the fact that while in man and the species allied to him the sexual function in the female is periodic and during most of life a function to be guarded from the opposite sex in the male it rarely or never needs to be so guarded eleven Both male and female however need to guard themselves during the exercise of their sexual activities from jealous rivals as well as from enemies who might take advantage of their position to attack them It is highly probable that this is one important sexual factor in the constitution of modesty and it helps to explain how the male not less than the female cultivates modesty and shuns publicity in the exercise of sexual functions Northcote has especially emphasized this element in modesty as originating in the fear of rivals That from this seeking after secrecy from motives of fear should arise an instinctive feeling that the sexual act must always be hidden is a natural enough sequence And since it is not a long step between thinking of an act as needing concealment and thinking of it as wrong it is easily conceivable that sexual intercourse comes to be regarded as a stolen and therefore in some degree a sinful pleasure twelve Animals in a state of nature usually appear to seek seclusion for sexual intercourse although this instinct is lost under domestication Even the lowest savages also if uncorrupted by civilized influences seek the solitude of the forest or the protection of their huts for the same purpose the rare cases in which coitus is public seem usually to involve a ceremonial or social observance rather than mere personal gratification At Loango for instance it would be highly improper to have intercourse in an exposed spot it must only be performed inside the hut with closed doors at night when no one is present thirteen It is on the sexual factor of modesty existing in a well marked form even among animals that coquetry is founded I am glad to find myself on this point in agreement with Professor Groos who in his elaborate study of the play instinct has reached the same conclusion So far from being the mere heartless play by which a woman shows her power over a man Groos points out that coquetry possesses high biological and psychological significance being rooted in the antagonism between the sexual instinct and inborn modesty He refers to the roe who runs away from the stag but in a circle Groos Die Spiele der Menschen eighteen ninety nine p three hundred thirty nine also the same author s Die Spiele der Thiere pp two hundred eighty eight et seq Another example of coquetry is furnished by the female kingfisher Alcedo ispida which will spend all the morning in teasing and flying away from the male but is careful constantly to look back and never to let him out of her sight Many examples are given by Buechner in Liebe und Liebesleben in der Tierwelt Robert Mueller Sexualbiologie p three hundred two emphasizes the importance of coquetry as a lure to the male It is quite true a lady writes to me in a private letter that coquetry is a poor thing and that every milkmaid can assume it but a woman uses it principally in self defence while she is finding out what the man himself is like This is in accordance with the remark of Marro that modesty enables a woman to put lovers to the test in order to select him who is best able to serve the natural ends of love It is doubtless the necessity for this probationary period as a test of masculine qualities which usually leads a woman to repel instinctively a too hasty and impatient suitor for as Arthur Macdonald remarks It seems to be instinctive in young women to reject the impetuous lover without the least consideration of his character ability and fitness This essential element in courtship this fundamental attitude of pursuer and pursued is clearly to be seen even in animals and savages it is equally pronounced in the most civilized men and women manifesting itself in crude and subtle ways alike Shakespeare s Angelo whose virtue had always resisted the temptations of vice discovered at last that modesty may more betray our sense Than woman s lightness What asked the wise Montaigne is the object of that virginal shame that sedate coldness that severe countenance that pretence of not knowing things which they understand better than we who teach them except to increase in us the desire to conquer and curb to trample under our appetite all that ceremony and those obstacles For there is not only matter for pleasure but for pride also in ruffling and debauching that soft sweetness and infantine modesty fourteen The masculine attitude in the face of feminine coyness may easily pass into a kind of sadism but is nevertheless in its origin an innocent and instinctive impulse Restif de la Bretonne describing his own shame and timidity as a pretty boy whom the girls would run after and kiss adds It is surprising that at the same time I would imagine the pleasure I should have in embracing a girl who resisted in inspiring her with timidity in making her flee and in pursuing her that was a part which I burned to play fifteen It is the instinct of the sophisticated and the unsophisticated alike The Arabs have developed an erotic ideal of sensuality but they emphasize the importance of feminine modesty and declare that the best woman is she who sees not men and whom they see not sixteen This deep rooted modesty of women towards men in courtship is intimately interwoven with the marriage customs and magic rites of even the most primitive peoples and has survived in many civilized practices to day seventeen The prostitute must be able to simulate the modesty she may often be far from feeling and the immense erotic advantage of the innocent over the vicious woman lies largely in the fact that in her the exquisite reactions of modesty are fresh and vigorous I cannot imagine anything that is more sexually exciting remarks Hans Menjago than to observe a person of the opposite sex who by some external or internal force is compelled to fight against her physical modesty The more modest she is the more sexually exciting is the picture she presents eighteen It is notable that even in abnormal as well as in normal erotic passion the desire is for innocent and not for vicious women and in association with this the desired favor to be keenly relished must often be gained by sudden surprise and not by mutual agreement A foot fetichist writes to me It is the stolen glimpse of a pretty foot or ankle which produces the greatest effect on me A urolagnic symbolist was chiefly excited by the act of urination when he caught a young woman unawares in the act A fetichistic admirer of the nates only desired to see this region in innocent girls not in prostitutes The exhibitionist almost invariably only exposes himself to apparently respectable girls A Russian correspondent who feels this charm of women in a particularly strong degree is inclined to think that there is an element of perversity in it In the erotic action of the idea of feminine enjoyment he writes I think there are traces of a certain perversity In fact owing to the impressions of early youth woman even if we feel contempt for her in theory is placed above us on a certain pedestal as an almost sacred being and the more so because mysterious Now sensuality and sexual desire are considered as rather vulgar and a little dirty even ridiculous and degrading not to say bestial The woman who enjoys it is therefore rather like a profaned altar or at least like a divinity who has descended on to the earth To give enjoyment to a woman is therefore like perpetrating a sacrilege or at least like taking a liberty with a god The feelings bequeathed to us by a long social civilization maintain themselves in spite of our rational and deliberate opinions Reason tells us that there is nothing evil in sexual enjoyment whether in man or woman but an unconscious feeling directs our emotions and this feeling having a germ that was placed in modern men by Christianity and perhaps by still older religions says that woman ought to be an absolutely pure being with ethereal sensations and that in her sexual enjoyment is out of place improper scandalous To arouse sexual emotions in a woman if not to profane a sacred host is at all events the staining of an immaculate peplos if not sacrilege it is at least irreverence or impertinence For all men the chaster a woman is the more agreeable it is to bring her to the orgasm That is felt as a triumph of the body over the soul of sin over virtue of earth over heaven There is something diabolic in such pleasure especially when it is felt by a man intoxicated with love and full of religious respect for the virgin of his election This feeling is from a rational point of view absurd and in its tendencies immoral but it is delicious in its sacredly voluptuous subtlety Defloration thus has its powerful fascination in the respect consciously or unconsciously felt for woman s chastity In marriage the feeling is yet more complicated in deflowering his bride the Christian that is any man brought up in a Christian civilization has the feeling of committing a sort of sin for the flesh is for him always connected with sin which by a special privilege has for him become legitimate He has received a special permit to corrupt innocence Hence the peculiar prestige for civilized Christians of the wedding night sung by Shelley in ecstatic verses Oh joy Oh fear What will be done In the absence of the sun This feeling has however its normal range and is not per se a perversity though it may doubtless become so when unduly heightened by Christian sentiment and especially if it leads as to some extent it has led in my Russian correspondent to an abnormal feeling of the sexual attraction of girls who have only or scarcely reached the age of puberty The sexual charm of this period of girlhood is well illustrated in many of the poems of Thomas Ashe and it is worthy of note as perhaps supporting the contention that this attraction is based on Christian feeling that Ashe had been a clergyman An attentiveness to the woman s pleasure remains in itself very far from a perversion but increases as Colin Scott has pointed out with civilization while its absence the indifference to the partner s pleasure is a perversion of the most degraded kind There is no such instinctive demand on the woman s part for innocence in the man nineteen In the nature of things that could not be Such emotion is required for properly playing the part of the pursued it is by no means an added attraction on the part of the pursuer There is however an allied and corresponding desire which is very often clearly or latently present in the woman a longing for pleasure that is stolen or forbidden It is a mistake to suppose that this is an indication of viciousness or perversity It appears to be an impulse that occurs quite naturally in altogether innocent women The exciting charm of the risky and dangerous naturally arises on a background of feminine shyness and timidity We may trace its recognition at a very early stage of history in the story of Eve and the forbidden fruit that has so often been the symbol of the masculine organs of sex It is on this ground that many have argued the folly of laying external restrictions on women in matters of love Thus in quoting the great Italian writer who afterwards became Pope Pius II Robert Burton remarked I am of AEneas Sylvius mind Those jealous Italians do very ill to lock up their wives for women are of such a disposition they will mostly covet that which is denied most and offend least when they have free liberty to trespass twenty It is the spontaneous and natural instinct of the lover to desire modesty in his mistress and by no means any calculated opinion on his part that modesty is the sign of sexual emotion It remains true however that modesty is an expression of feminine erotic impulse We have here one of the instances of which there are so many of that curious and instinctive harmony by which Nature has sought the more effectively to bring about the ends of courtship As to the fact itself there can be little doubt It constantly forces itself on the notice of careful observers and has long been decided in the affirmative by those who have discussed the matter Venette one of the earliest writers on the psychology of sex after discussing the question at length decided that the timid woman is a more ardent lover than the bold woman twenty one It is the most pudent girl remarked Restif de la Bretonne whose experience of women was so extensive the girl who blushes most who is most disposed to the pleasures of love he adds that in girls and boys alike shyness is a premature consciousness of sex twenty two This observation has even become embodied in popular proverbs Do as the lasses do say no but take it is a Scotch saying to which corresponds the Welsh saying The more prudish the more unchaste twenty three It is not at first quite clear why an excessively shy and modest woman should be the most apt for intimate relationships with a man and in such a case the woman is often charged with hypocrisy There is however no hypocrisy in the matter The shy and reserved woman holds herself aloof from intimacy in ordinary friendship because she is acutely sensitive to the judgments of others and fears that any seemingly immodest action may make an unfavorable opinion With a lover however in whose eyes she feels assured that her actions can not be viewed unfavorably these barriers of modesty fall down and the resulting intimacy becomes all the more fascinating to the woman because of its contrast with the extreme reserve she is impelled to maintain in other relationships It thus happens that many modest women who in non sexual relationships with their own sex are not able to act with the physical unreserve not uncommon with women among themselves yet feel no such reserve with a man when they are once confident of his good opinion Much the same is true of modest and sensitive men in their relations with women This fundamental animal factor of modesty rooted in the natural facts of the sexual life of the higher mammals and especially man obviously will not explain all the phenomena of modesty We must turn to the other great primary element of modesty the social factor We cannot doubt that one of the most primitive and universal of the social characteristics of man is an aptitude for disgust founded as it is on a yet more primitive and animal aptitude for disgust which has little or no social significance In nearly all races even the most savage we seem to find distinct traces of this aptitude for disgust in the presence of certain actions of others an emotion naturally reflected in the individual s own actions and hence a guide to conduct Notwithstanding our gastric community of disgust with lower animals it is only in man that this disgust seems to become transformed and developed to possess a distinctly social character and to serve as a guide to social conduct twenty four The objects of disgust vary infinitely according to the circumstances and habits of particular races but the reaction of disgust is fundamental throughout The best study of the phenomena of disgust known to me is without doubt Professor Richet s twenty five Richet concludes that it is the dangerous and the useless which evoke disgust The digestive and sexual excretions and secretions being either useless or in accordance with widespread primitive ideas highly dangerous the genito anal region became a concentrated focus of disgust twenty six It is largely for this reason no doubt that savage men exhibit modesty not only toward women but toward their own sex and that so many of the lowest savages take great precautions in obtaining seclusion for the fulfillment of natural functions The statement now so often made that the primary object of clothes is to accentuate rather than to conceal has in it as I shall point out later a large element of truth but it is by no means a complete account of the matter It seems difficult not to admit that alongside the impulse to accentuate sexual differences there is also in both men and women a genuine impulse to concealment among the most primitive peoples and the invincible repugnance often felt by savages to remove the girdle or apron is scarcely accounted for by the theory that it is solely a sexual lure In this connection it seems to me instructive to consider a special form of modesty very strongly marked among savages in some parts of the world I refer to the feeling of immodesty in eating Where this feeling exists modesty is offended when one eats in public the modest man retires to eat Indecency said Cook was utterly unknown among the Tahitians but they would not eat together even brothers and sisters had their separate baskets of provisions and generally sat some yards apart with their backs to each other when they ate twenty seven The Warrua of Central Africa Cameron found when offered a drink put up a cloth before their faces while they swallowed it and would not allow anyone to see them eat or drink so that every man or woman must have his own fire and cook for himself twenty eight Karl von den Steinen remarks in his interesting book on Brazil that though the Bakairi of Central Brazil have no feeling of shame about nakedness they are ashamed to eat in public they retire to eat and hung their heads in shame faced confusion when they saw him innocently eat in public Hrolf Vaughan Stevens found that when he gave an Orang Laut Malay woman anything to eat she not only would not eat it if her husband were present but if any man were present she would go outside before eating or giving her children to eat twenty nine Thus among these peoples the act of eating in public produces the same feelings as among ourselves the indecent exposure of the body in public thirty It is quite easy to understand how this arises Whenever there is any pressure on the means of subsistence as among savages at some time or another there nearly always is it must necessarily arouse a profound and mixed emotion of desire and disgust to see another person putting into his stomach what one might just as well have put into one s own thirty one The special secrecy sometimes observed by women is probably due to the fact that women would be less able to resist the emotions that the act of eating would arouse in onlookers As social feeling develops a man desires not only to eat in safety but also to avoid being an object of disgust and to spare his friends all unpleasant emotions Hence it becomes a requirement of ordinary decency to eat in private A man who eats in public becomes like the man who in our cities exposes his person in public an object of disgust and contempt Long ago when a hospital student on midwifery duty in London slums I had occasion to observe that among the women of the poor and more especially in those who had lost the first bloom of youth modesty consisted chiefly in the fear of being disgusting There was an almost pathetic anxiety in the face of pain and discomfort not to be disgusting in the doctor s eyes This anxiety expressed itself in the ordinary symptoms of modesty But as soon as the woman realized that I found nothing disgusting in whatever was proper and necessary to be done under the circumstances it almost invariably happened that every sign of modesty at once disappeared thirty two In the special and elementary conditions of parturition modesty is reduced to this one fear of causing disgust so that when that is negated the emotion is non existent and the subject becomes without effort as direct and natural as a little child A fellow student on similar duty who also discovered for himself the same character of modesty that if he was careful to guard her modesty the woman was careful also and that if he was not the woman was not remarked on it to me with sadness it seemed to him derogatory to womanhood that what he had been accustomed to consider its supreme grace should be so superficial that he could at will set limits to it thirty three I thought then as I think still that that was rather a perversion of the matter and that nothing becomes degrading because we happen to have learned something about its operations But I am more convinced than ever that the fear of causing disgust a fear quite distinct from that of losing a sexual lure or breaking a rule of social etiquette plays a very large part in the modesty of the more modest sex and in modesty generally Our Venuses as Lucretius long since remarked and Montaigne after him are careful to conceal from their lovers the vita postscenia and that fantastic fate which placed so near together the supreme foci of physical attraction and physical repugnance has immensely contributed to build up all the subtlest coquetries of courtship Whatever stimulates self confidence and lulls the fear of evoking disgust whether it is the presence of a beloved person in whose good opinion complete confidence is felt or whether it is merely the grosser narcotizing influence of a slight degree of intoxication always automatically lulls the emotion of modesty thirty four Together with the animal factor of sexual refusal this social fear of evoking disgust seems to me the most fundamental element in modesty It is of course impossible to argue that the fact of the sacro pubic region of the body being the chief focus of concealment proves the importance of this factor of modesty But it may fairly be argued that it owes this position not merely to being the sexual centre but also as being the excretory centre Even among many lower mammals as well as among birds and insects there is a well marked horror of dirt somewhat disguised by the varying ways in which an animal may be said to define dirt Many animals spend more time and energy in the duties of cleanliness than human beings and they often show well marked anxiety to remove their own excrement or to keep away from it thirty five Thus this element of modesty also may be said to have an animal basis It is on this animal basis that the human and social fear of arousing disgust has developed Its probably wide extension is indicated not only by the strong feeling attached to the constant presence of clothing on this part of the body such constant presence being quite uncalled for if the garment or ornament is merely a sort of sexual war paint but by the repugnance felt by many savages very low down in the scale to the public satisfaction of natural needs and to their more than civilized cleanliness in this connection thirty six it is further of interest to note that in some parts of the world the covering is not in front but behind though of this fact there are probably other explanations Among civilized people also it may be added the final and invincible seat of modesty is sometimes not around the pubes but the anus that is to say that in such cases the fear of arousing disgust is the ultimate and most fundamental element of modesty thirty seven The concentration of modesty around the anus is sometimes very marked Many women feel so high a degree of shame and reserve with regard to this region that they are comparatively indifferent to an anterior examination of the sexual organs A similar feeling is not seldom found in men I would permit of an examination of my genitals by a medical man without any feeling of discomfort a correspondent writes but I think I would rather die than submit to any rectal examination Even physicians have been known to endure painful rectal disorders for years rather than undergo examination Among ordinary English girls a medical correspondent writes I have often noticed that the dislike and shame of allowing a man to have sexual intercourse with them when newly married is simply due to the fact that the sexual aperture is so closely apposed to the anus and bladder If the vulva and vagina were situated between a woman s shoulder blades and a man had a separate instrument for coitus not used for any excretory purpose I do not think women would feel about intercourse as they sometimes do Again in their ignorance of anatomy women often look upon the vagina and womb as part of the bowel and its exit of discharge and sometimes say for instance inflammation of the bowel when they mean womb Again many perhaps most women believe that they pass water through the vagina and are ignorant of the existence of the separate urethral orifice Again women associate the vulva with the anus and so feel ashamed of it even when speaking to their husbands or to a doctor or among themselves they have absolutely no name for the vulva I mean among the upper classes and people of gentle birth but speak of it as down below low down et cetera Even though this feeling is largely based on wrong and ignorant ideas it must still be recognized that it is to some extent natural and inevitable How much is risked exclaims Dugas in the privacies of love The results may be disillusion disgust the consciousness of physical imperfection of brutality or coldness of aesthetic disenchantment of a sentimental shock seen or divined To be without modesty that is to say to have no fear of the ordeals of love one must be sure of one s self of one s grace of one s physical emotions of one s feelings and be sure moreover of the effect of all these on the nerves the imagination and the heart of another person Let us suppose modesty reduced to aesthetic discomfort to a woman s fear of displeasing or of not seeming beautiful enough Even thus defined how can modesty avoid being always awake and restless What woman could repeat without risk the tranquil action of Phryne And even in that action who knows how much may not have been due to mere professional insolence Dugas La Pudeur Revue Philosophique November nineteen oh three Men and Women Schurtz points out Altersklassen und Maennerbuende pp forty one fifty one have certainly the capacity mutually to supplement and enrich each other but when this completion fails or is not sought the difference may easily become a strong antipathy and he proceeds to develop the wide reaching significance of this psychic fact I have emphasized the proximity of the excretory centres to the sexual focus in discussing this important factor of modesty because in analyzing so complex and elusive an emotion as modesty it is desirable to keep as near as possible to the essential and fundamental facts on which it is based It is scarcely necessary to point out that in ordinary civilized society these fundamental facts are not usually present at the surface of consciousness and may even be absent altogether on the foundation of them may arise all sorts of idealized fears of delicate reserves of aesthetic refinements as the emotions of love become more complex and more subtle and the crude simplicity of the basis on which they finally rest becomes inevitably concealed Another factor of modesty which reaches a high development in savagery is the ritual element especially the idea of ceremonial uncleanness based on a dread of the supernatural influences which the sexual organs and functions are supposed to exert It may be to some extent rooted in the elements already referred to and it leads us into a much wider field than that of modesty so that it is only necessary to touch slightly on it here it has been exhaustively studied by Frazer and by Crawley Offences against the ritual rendered necessary by this mysterious dread though more serious than offences against sexual reticence or the fear of causing disgust are so obviously allied that they all reinforce one another and cannot easily be disentangled Nearly everywhere all over the world at a primitive stage of thought and even to some extent in the highest civilization the sight of the sexual organs or of the sexual act the image or even the names of the sexual parts of either man or woman are believed to have a curiously potent influence sometimes beneficent but quite as often maleficent The two kinds of influence may even be combined and Riedel quoted by Ploss and Bartels thirty eight states that the Ambon islanders carve a schematic representation of the vulva on their fruit trees in part to promote the productiveness of the trees and in part to scare any unauthorized person who might be tempted to steal the fruit The precautions prescribed as regards coitus at Loango thirty nine are evidently associated with religious fears In Ceylon again as a medical correspondent there informs me where the penis is worshipped and held sacred a native never allows it to be seen except under compulsion by a doctor and even a wife must neither see it nor touch it nor ask for coitus though she must grant as much as the husband desires All savage and barbarous peoples who have attained any high degree of ceremonialism have included the functions not only of sex but also of excretion more or less stringently within the bounds of that ceremonialism forty It is only necessary to refer to the Jewish ritual books of the Old Testament to Hesiod and to the customs prevalent among Mohammedan peoples Modesty in eating also has its roots by no means only in the fear of causing disgust but very largely in this kind of ritual and Crawley has shown how numerous and frequent among primitive peoples are the religious implications of eating and drinking forty one So profound is this dread of the sacred mystery of sex and so widespread is the ritual based upon it that some have imagined that here alone we may find the complete explanation of modesty and Salomon Reinach declares that at the origin of the emotion of modesty lies a taboo forty two Durkheim La Prohibition de l Inceste L Annee Sociologique eighteen ninety eight p fifty arguing that whatever sense of repugnance women may inspire must necessarily reach the highest point around the womb which is hence subjected to the most stringent taboo incidentally suggests that here is an origin of modesty The sexual organs must be veiled at an early period to prevent the dangerous effluvia which they give off from reaching the environment The veil is often a method of intercepting magic action Once constituted the practice would be maintained and transformed It was doubtless as a secondary and derived significance that the veil became as Reinach Le Voile de l Oblation op cit pp two hundred ninety nine three hundred eleven shows it was alike among the Romans and in the Catholic Church the sign of consecration to the gods At an early stage of culture again menstruation is regarded as a process of purification a dangerous expulsion of vitiated humors Hence the term katharsis applied to it by the Greeks Hence also the mediaeval view of women Mulier speciosa templum aedificatum super cloacam said Boethius The sacro pubic region in women because it includes the source of menstruation thus becomes a specially heightened seat of taboo According to the Mosiac law Leviticus Chapter XX v eighteen if a man uncovered a menstruating woman both were to be cut off It is probable that the Mohammedan custom of veiling the face and head really has its source solely in another aspect of this ritual factor of modesty It must be remembered that this custom is not Mohammedan in its origin since it existed long previously among the Arabians and is described by Tertullian forty three In early Arabia very handsome men also veiled their faces in order to preserve themselves from the evil eye and it has been conjectured with much probability that the origin of the custom of women veiling their faces may be traced to this magico religious precaution forty four Among the Jews of the same period according to Buechler forty five the women had their heads covered and never cut their hair to appear in the streets without such covering would be like a prostitute and was adequate ground for divorce adulterous women were punished by uncovering their heads and cutting their hair It is possible though not certain that saint Paul s obscure injunction to women to cover their heads because of the angels may really be based on the ancient reason that when uncovered they would be exposed to the wanton assaults of spirits one Corinthians Ch XI vv five six forty six exactly as Singhalese women believe that they must keep the vulva covered lest demons should have intercourse with them Even at the present day saint Paul s injunction is still observed by Christendom which is however far from accepting or even perhaps understanding the folk lore ground on which are based such injunctions Crawley thus summarizes some of the evidence concerning the significance of the veil Sexual shyness not only in woman but in man is intensified at marriage and forms a chief feature of the dangerous sexual properties mutually feared When fully ceremonial the idea takes on the meaning that satisfaction of these feelings will lead to their neutralization as in fact it does The bridegroom in ancient Sparta supped on the wedding night at the men s mess and then visited his bride leaving her before daybreak This practice was continued and sometimes children were born before the pair had ever seen each other s faces by day At weddings in the Babar Islands the bridegroom has to hunt for his bride in a darkened room This lasts a good while if she is shy In South Africa the bridegroom may not see his bride till the whole of the marriage ceremonies have been performed In Persia a husband never sees his wife till he has consummated the marriage At marriages in South Arabia the bride and bridegroom have to sit immovable in the same position from noon till midnight fasting in separate rooms The bride is attended by ladies and the groom by men They may not see each other till the night of the fourth day In Egypt the groom cannot see the face of his bride even by a surreptitious glance till she is in his absolute possession Then comes the ceremony which he performs of uncovering her face In Egypt of course this has been accentuated by the seclusion and veiling of women In Morocco at the feast before the marriage the bride and groom sit together on a sort of throne all the time the poor bride s eyes are firmly closed and she sits amidst the revelry as immovable as a statue On the next day is the marriage She is conducted after dark to her future home accompanied by a crowd with lanterns and candles She is led with closed eyes along the street by two relatives each holding one of her hands The bride s head is held in its proper position by a female relative who walks behind her She wears a veil and is not allowed to open her eyes until she is set on the bridal bed with a girl friend beside her Amongst the Zulus the bridal party proceeds to the house of the groom having the bride hidden amongst them They stand facing the groom while the bride sings a song Her companions then suddenly break away and she is discovered standing in the middle with a fringe of beads covering her face Amongst the people of Kumaun the husband sees his wife first after the joining of hands Amongst the Bedui of North East Africa the bride is brought on the evening of the wedding day by her girl friends to the groom s house She is closely muffled up Amongst the Jews of Jerusalem the bride at the marriage ceremony stands under the nuptial canopy her eyes being closed that she may not behold the face of her future husband before she reaches the bridal chamber In Melanesia the bride is carried to her new home on some one s back wrapped in many mats with palm fans held about her face because she is supposed to be modest and shy Among the Damaras the groom cannot see his bride for four days after marriage When a Damara woman is asked in marriage she covers her face for a time with the flap of a headdress made for this purpose At the Thlinkeet marriage ceremony the bride must look down and keep her head bowed all the time during the wedding day she remains hiding in a corner of the house and the groom is forbidden to enter At a Yezedee marriage the bride is covered from head to foot with a thick veil and when arrived at her new home she retires behind a curtain in the corner of a darkened room where she remains for three days before her husband is permitted to see her In Corea the bride has to cover her face with her long sleeves when meeting the bridegroom at the wedding The Manchurian bride uncovers her face for the first time when she descends from the nuptial couch It is dangerous even to see dangerous persons Sight is a method of contagion in primitive science and the idea coincides with the psychological aversion to see dangerous things and with sexual shyness and timidity In the customs noticed we can distinguish the feeling that it is dangerous to the bride for her husband s eyes to be upon her and the feeling of bashfulness in her which induces her neither to see him nor to be seen by him These ideas explain the origin of the bridal veil and similar concealments The bridal veil is used to take a few instances in China Burmah Corea Russia Bulgaria Manchuria and Persia and in all these cases it conceals the face entirely E Crawley The Mystic Rose pp three hundred twenty eight et seq Alexander Walker writing in eighteen forty six remarks Among old fashioned people of whom a good example may be found in old country people of the middle class in England it is indecent to be seen with the head unclothed such a woman is terrified at the chance of being seen In that condition and if intruded on at that time she shrieks with terror and flies to conceal herself A Walker Beauty p fifteen This fear of being seen with the head uncovered exists still M Van Gennep informs me in some regions of France as in Brittany So far it has only been necessary to refer incidentally to the connection of modesty with clothing I have sought to emphasize the unquestionable but often forgotten fact that modesty is in its origin independent of clothing that physiological modesty takes precedence of anatomical modesty and that the primary factors of modesty were certainly developed long before the discovery of either ornament or garments The rise of clothing probably had its first psychical basis on an emotion of modesty already compositely formed of the elements we have traced Both the main elementary factors it must be noted must naturally tend to develop and unite in a more complex though it may well be much less intense emotion The impulse which leads the female animal as it leads some African women when found without their girdles to squat firmly down on the earth becomes a more refined and extended play of gesture and ornament and garment A very notable advance I may remark is made when this primary attitude of defence against the action of the male becomes a defence against his eyes We may thus explain the spread of modesty to various parts of the body even when we exclude the more special influence of the evil eye The breasts very early become a focus of modesty in women this may be observed among many naked or nearly naked negro races the tendency of the nates to become the chief seat of modesty in many parts of Africa may probably be in large part thus explained since the full development of the gluteal regions is often the greatest attraction an African woman can possess forty seven The same cause contributes doubtless to the face becoming in some races the centre of modesty We see the influence of this defence against strange eyes in the special precautions in gesture or clothing taken by the women in various parts of the world against the more offensive eyes of civilized Europeans But in thus becoming directed only against sight and not against action the gestures of modesty are at once free to become merely those of coquetry When there is no real danger of offensive action there is no need for more than playful defence and no serious anxiety should that defence be taken as a disguised invitation Thus the road is at once fully open toward the most civilized manifestations of the comedy of courtship In the same way the social fear of arousing disgust combines easily and perfectly with any new development in the invention of ornament or clothing as sexual lures Even among the most civilized races it has often been noted that the fashion of feminine garments as also sometimes the use of scents has the double object of concealing and attracting It is so with the little apron of the young savage belle The heightening of the attraction is indeed a logical outcome of the fear of evoking disgust It is possible as some ethnographists have observed forty eight that intercrural cords and other primitive garments have a physical ground inasmuch as they protect the most sensitive and unprotected part of the body especially in women We may note in this connection the significant remarks of K von den Steinen who argues that among Brazilian tribes the object of the uluri et cetera is to obtain a maximum of protection for the mucous membrane with a minimum of concealment Among the Eskimo as Nansen noted the corresponding intercrural cord is so thin as to be often practically invisible this may be noted I may add in the excellent photographs of Eskimo women given by Holm But it is evident that in the beginning protection is to little or no extent the motive for attaching foreign substances to the body Thus the tribes of Central Australia wear no clothes although they often suffer from the cold But in addition to armlets neck bands and head bands they have string or hair girdles with for the women a very small apron and for the men a pubic tassel The latter does not conceal the organs being no larger than a coin and often brilliantly coated with white pipeclay especially during the progress of corrobborees when a large number of men and women meet together it serves the purpose of drawing attention to the organs forty nine When Forster visited the unspoilt islanders of the Pacific early in the eighteenth century he tells us that though they wore no clothes they found it necessary to cover themselves with various ornaments especially on the sexual parts But though their males he remarks were to all appearances equally anxious in this respect with their females this part of their dress served only to make that more conspicuous which it intended to hide fifty He adds the significant remark that these ideas of decency and modesty are only observed at the age of sexual maturity just as in Central Australia women may only wear aprons after the initiation of puberty There are certain things said Montaigne which are hidden in order to be shown and there can be no doubt that the contention of Westermarck and others that ornament and clothing were in the first place intended not to conceal or even to protect the body but in large part to render it sexually attractive is fully proved fifty one We cannot in the light of all that has gone before regard ornaments and clothing as the sole cause of modesty but the feelings that are thus gathered around the garment constitute a highly important factor of modesty Among some Australian tribes it is said that the sexual organs are only covered during their erotic dances and it is further said that in some parts of the world only prostitutes are clothed The scanty covering as Westermarck observes was found to act as the most powerful obtainable sexual stimulus It is undoubtedly true that this statement may be made not merely of the savage but of the most civilized world All observers agree that the complete nudity of savages unlike the civilized decollete or detrousse has no suggestion of sexual allurement Westermarck quotes numerous testimonies on this point op cit pp one hundred ninety two et seq doctor R W Felkin remarks concerning Central Africa that he has never met more indecency than in Uganda where the penalty of death is inflicted on an adult found naked in the street Edinburgh Medical Journal April eighteen eighty four A study of pictures or statuary will alone serve to demonstrate that nakedness is always chaster in its effects than partial clothing As a well known artist Du Maurier has remarked in Trilby it is a fact well known to all painters and sculptors who have used the nude model except a few shady pretenders whose purity not being of the right sort has gone rank from too much watching that nothing is so chaste as nudity Venus herself as she drops her garments and steps on to the model throne leaves behind her on the floor every weapon in her armory by which she can pierce to the grosser passions of men Burton in the Anatomy of Melancholy Part III Sect II Subsect three deals at length with the Allurements of Love and concludes that the greatest provocations of lust are from our apparel The artist s model as one informs me is much less exposed to liberties from men when nude than when she is partially clothed and it may be noted that in Paris studios the model who poses naked undresses behind a screen An admirable poetic rendering of this element in the philosophy of clothing has been given by Herrick that master of erotic psychology in A Lily in Crystal where he argues that a lily in crystal and amber in a stream and strawberries in cream gain an added delight from semi concealment and so he concludes we obtain A rule how far to teach Your nakedness must reach In this connection also it is worth noting that Stanley Hall in a report based on returns from nearly a thousand persons mostly teachers The Early Sense of Self American Journal of Psychology eighteen ninety eight p three hundred sixty six finds that of the three functions of clothes protection ornament and Lotzean self feeling the second is by far the most conspicuous in childhood The attitude of children is testimony to the primitive attitude toward clothing It cannot however be said that the use of clothing for the sake of showing the natural forms of the body has everywhere been developed In Japan where nakedness is accepted without shame clothes are worn to cover and conceal and not to reveal the body It is so also in China A distinguished Chinese gentleman who had long resided in Europe once told Baelz that he had gradually learnt to grasp the European point of view but that it would be impossible to persuade his fellow countrymen that a woman who used her clothes to show off her figure could possibly possess the least trace of modesty Baelz Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie nineteen oh one Heft two p one hundred seventy nine The great artistic elaboration often displayed by articles of ornament or clothing even when very small and the fact as shown by Karl von den Steinen regarding the Brazilian uluri that they may serve as common motives in general decoration sufficiently prove that such objects attract rather than avoid attention And while there is an invincible repugnance among some peoples to remove these articles such repugnance being often strongest when the adornment is most minute others have no such repugnance or are quite indifferent whether or not their aprons are accurately adjusted The mere presence or possession of the article gives the required sense of self respect of human dignity of sexual desirability Thus it is that to unclothe a person is to humiliate him this was so even in Homeric times for we may recall the threat of Ulysses to strip Thyestes fifty two When clothing is once established another element this time a social economic element often comes in to emphasize its importance and increase the anatomical modesty of women I mean the growth of the conception of women as property Waitz followed by Schurtz and Letourneau has insisted that the jealousy of husbands is the primary origin of clothing and indirectly of modesty Diderot in the eighteenth century had already given clear expression to the same view It is undoubtedly true that only married women are among some peoples clothed the unmarried women though full grown remaining naked In many parts of the world also as Mantegazza and others have shown where the men are naked and the women covered clothing is regarded as a sort of disgrace and men can only with difficulty be persuaded to adopt it Before marriage a woman was often free and not bound to chastity and at the same time was often naked after marriage she was clothed and no longer free To the husband s mind the garment appears illogically though naturally a moral and physical protection against any attack on his property fifty three Thus a new motive was furnished this time somewhat artificially for making nakedness in women at all events disgraceful As the conception of property also extended to the father s right over his daughters and the appreciation of female chastity developed this motive spread to unmarried as well as married women A woman on the west coast of Africa must always be chaste because she is first the property of her parents and afterwards of her husband fifty four and even in the seventeenth century of Christendom so able a thinker as Bishop Burnet furnished precisely the same reason for feminine chastity fifty five This conception probably constituted the chief and most persistent element furnished to the complex emotion of modesty by the barbarous stages of human civilization This economic factor necessarily involved the introduction of a new moral element into modesty If a woman s chastity is the property of another person it is essential that she shall be modest in order that men may not be tempted to incur the penalties involved by the infringement of property rights Thus modesty is strictly inculcated on women in order that men may be safeguarded from temptation The fact was overlooked that modesty is itself a temptation Immodesty being on this ground disapproved by men a new motive for modesty is furnished to women In the book which the Knight of the Tower Landry wrote in the fourteenth century for the instruction of his daughters this factor of modesty is naively revealed He tells his daughters of the trouble that David got into through the thoughtlessness of Bathsheba and warns them that every woman ought religiously to conceal herself when dressing and washing and neither out of vanity nor yet to attract attention show either her hair or her neck or her breast or any part which ought to be covered Hinton went so far as to regard what he termed body modesty as entirely a custom imposed upon women by men with the object of preserving their own virtue While this motive is far from being the sole source of modesty it must certainly be borne in mind as an inevitable outcome of the economic factor of modesty In Europe it seems probable that the generally accepted conceptions of mediaeval chivalry were not without influence in constituting the forms in which modesty shows itself among us In the early middle ages there seems to have been a much greater degree of physical familiarity between the sexes than is commonly found among barbarians elsewhere There was certainly considerable promiscuity in bathing and indifference to nakedness It seems probable as Durkheim points out fifty six that this state of things was modified in part by the growing force of the dictates of Christian morality which regarded all intimate approaches between the sexes as sinful and in part by the influence of chivalry with its aesthetic and moral ideals of women as the representative of all the delicacies and elegancies of civilization This ideal was regarded as incompatible with the familiarities of the existing social relationships between the sexes and thus a separation which at first existed only in art and literature began by a curious reaction to exert an influence on real life The chief new feature it is scarcely a new element added to modesty when an advanced civilization slowly emerges from barbarism is the elaboration of its social ritual fifty seven Civilization expands the range of modesty and renders it at the same time more changeable The French seventeenth century and the English eighteenth represent early stages of modern European civilization and they both devoted special attention to the elaboration of the minute details of modesty The frequenters of the Hotel Rambouillet the precieuses satirized by Moliere were not only engaged in refining the language they were refining feelings and ideas and enlarging the boundaries of modesty fifty eight In England such famous and popular authors as Swift and Sterne bear witness to a new ardor of modesty in the sudden reticences the dashes and the asterisks which are found throughout their works The altogether new quality of literary prurience of which Sterne is still the classical example could only have arisen on the basis of the new modesty which was then overspreading society and literature Idle people mostly no doubt the women in salons and drawing rooms people more familiar with books than with the realities of life now laid down the rules of modesty and were ever enlarging it ever inventing new subtleties of gesture and speech which it would be immodest to neglect and which are ever being rendered vulgar by use and ever changing It was at this time probably that the custom of inventing an arbitrary private vocabulary of words and phrases for the purpose of disguising references to functions and parts of the body regarded as immodest and indecent first began to become common Such private slang growing up independently in families and especially among women as well as between lovers is now almost universal It is not confined to any European country and has been studied in Italy by Niceforo Il Gergo eighteen ninety seven cap one and two who regards it as a weapon of social defence against an inquisitive or hostile environment since it enables things to be said with a meaning which is unintelligible to all but the initiated person While it is quite true that the custom is supported by the consciousness of its practical advantages it has another source in a desire to avoid what is felt to be the vulgar immodesty of direct speech This is sufficiently shown by the fact that such slang is mostly concerned with the sacro pubic sphere It is one of the chief contributions to the phenomena of modesty furnished by civilization The claims of modesty having effected the clothing of the body the impulse of modesty finds a further sphere of activity half playful yet wholly imperative in the clothing of language Modesty of speech has however a deep and primitive basis although in modern Europe it only became conspicuous at the beginning of the eighteenth century All over the world as Dufour put it to do is good to say is bad Reticences of speech are not adequately accounted for by the statement that modesty tends to irradiate from the action to the words describing the action for there is a tendency for modesty to be more deeply rooted in the words than in the actions Modest women as Kleinpaul truly remarks have a much greater horror of saying immodest things than of doing them they believe that fig leaves were especially made for the mouth Kleinpaul Sprache ohne Worte p three hundred nine It is a tendency which is linked on to the religious and ritual feeling which we have already found to be a factor of modesty and which even when applied to language appears to have an almost or quite instinctive basis for it is found among the most primitive savages who very frequently regard a name as too sacred or dangerous to utter Among the tribes of Central Australia in addition to his ordinary name each individual has his sacred or secret name only known to the older and fully initiated members of his own totemic group among the Warramunga it is not permitted to women to utter even a man s ordinary name though she knows it Spencer and Gillen Northern Tribes of Central Australia p five hundred eighty one In the mysterious region of sex this feeling easily takes root In many parts of the world men use among themselves and women use among themselves words and even languages which they may not use without impropriety in speaking to persons of the opposite sex and it has been shown that exogamy or the fact that the wife belongs to a different tribe will not always account for this phenomenon Crawley The Mystic Rose p forty six A special vocabulary for the generative organs and functions is very widespread Thus in northwest Central Queensland there is both a decent and an indecent vocabulary for the sexual parts in Mitakoodi language for instance me ne may be used for the vulva in the best aboriginal society but koon ja and pukkil which are names for the same parts are the most blackguardly words known to the natives W Roth Ethnological Studies Among the Queensland Aborigines p one hundred eighty four Among the Malays puki is also a name for the vulva which it is very indecent to utter and it is only used in public by people under the influence of an obsessive nervous disorder W Gilman Ellis Latah Journal of Mental Science Jan eighteen ninety seven The Swahili women of Africa have a private metaphorical language of their own referring to sexual matters Zache Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie eighteen ninety nine Heft two three pp seventy et seq and in Samoa again young girls have a euphemistic name for the penis aualuma which is not that in common use Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie eighteen ninety nine Heft one p thirty one exactly the same thing is found in Europe to day and is sometimes more marked among young peasant women than among those of better social class who often avoid under all circumstances the necessity for using any definite name Singular as it may seem the Romans who in their literature impress us by their vigorous and naked grip of the most private facts of life showed in familiar intercourse a dread of obscene language a dread ultimately founded it is evident on religious grounds far exceeding that which prevails among ourselves to day in civilization It is remarkable Dufour observes that the prostitutes of ancient Rome would have blushed to say an indecent word in public The little tender words used between lovers and their mistresses were not less correct and innocent when the mistress was a courtesan and the lover an erotic poet He called her his rose his queen his goddess his dove his light his star and she replied by calling him her jewel her honey her bird her ambrosia the apple of her eye and never with any licentious interjection but only I will love Amabo a frequent exclamation summing up a whole life and vocation When intimate relations began they treated each other as brother and sister These appellations were common among the humblest and the proudest courtesans alike Dufour Histoire de la Prostitution vol ii p seventy eight So excessive was the Roman horror of obscenity that even physicians were compelled to use a euphemism for urina and though the urinal or vas urinarium was openly used at the dining table following a custom introduced by the Sybarites according to Athenaeus Book XII cap seventeen the decorous guest could not ask for it by name but only by a snap of the fingers Dufour op cit vol ii p one hundred seventy four In modern Europe as seems fairly evident from the early realistic dramatic literature of various countries no special horror of speaking plainly regarding the sacro pubic regions and their functions existed among the general population until the seventeenth century There is however one marked exception Such a feeling clearly existed as regards menstruation It is not difficult to see why it should have begun at this function We have here not only a function confined to one sex and therefore easily lending itself to a vocabulary confined to one sex but what is even of more importance the belief which existed among the Romans as elsewhere throughout the world concerning the specially dangerous and mysterious properties of menstruation survived throughout mediaeval times See e g Ploss and Bartels Das Weib Bd I XIV also Havelock Ellis Man and Woman fourth ed Ch XI The very name menses monthlies is a euphemism and most of the old scientific names for this function are similarly vague As regards popular feminine terminology previous to the eighteenth century Schurig gives us fairly ample information Parthenologia seventeen twenty nine pp twenty seven et seq He remarks that both in Latin and Germanic countries menstruation was commonly designated by some term equivalent to flowers because he says it is a blossoming that indicates the possibility of fruit German peasant women he tells us called it the rose wreath Rosenkrantz Among the other current feminine names for menstruation which he gives some are purely fanciful thus the Italian women dignified the function with the title of marchese magnifico German ladies again would use the locution I have had a letter or would say that their cousin or aunt had arrived These are closely similar to the euphemisms still used by women It should be added that euphemisms for menstruation are not confined to Europe and are found among savages According to Hill Tout Journal of the Anthropological Institute nineteen oh four p three hundred twenty and nineteen oh five p one hundred thirty seven one of these euphemisms was putting on the moccasin and in another branch of the same people putting the knees together going outside in allusion to the customary seclusion at this period in a solitary hut and so on It would however be a mistake to suppose that this process is an intensification of modesty It is on the contrary an attenuation of it The observances of modesty become merely a part of a vast body of rules of social etiquette though a somewhat stringent part on account of the vague sense still persisting of a deep lying natural basis It is a significant coincidence that the eighteenth century which was marked by this new extension of the social ritual of modesty also saw the first appearance of a new philosophic impulse not merely to analyze but to dissolve the conception of modesty This took place more especially in France The swift rise to supremacy during the seventeenth century of logical and rational methods of thinking in conjunction with the new development of geometrical and mathematical science led in the eighteenth century to a widespread belief in France that human customs and human society ought to be founded on a strictly logical and rational basis It was a belief which ignored those legitimate claims of the emotional nature which the nineteenth century afterwards investigated and developed but it was of immense service to mankind in clearing away useless prejudices and superstitions and it culminated in the reforms of the great Revolution which most other nations have since been painfully struggling to attain Modesty offered a tempting field for the eighteenth century philosophic spirit to explore The manner in which the most distinguished and adventurous minds of the century approached it can scarcely be better illustrated than by a conversation reported by Madame d Epinay which took place in seventeen fifty at the table of Mlle Quinault the eminent actress A fine virtue Duclos remarked which one fastens on in the morning with pins He proceeded to argue that a moral law must hold good always and everywhere which modesty does not Saint Lambert the poet observed that it must be acknowledged that one can say nothing good about innocence without being a little corrupted and Duclos added or of modesty without being impudent Saint Lambert finally held forth with much poetic enthusiasm concerning the desirability of consummating marriages in public fifty nine This view of modesty combined with the introduction of Greek fashions gained ground to such an extent that towards the end of the century women to the detriment of their health were sometimes content to dress in transparent gauze and even to walk abroad in the Champs Elysees without any clothing that however was too much for the public sixty The final outcome of the eighteenth century spirit in this direction was as we know by no means the dissolution of modesty But it led to a clearer realization of what is permanent in its organic foundations and what is merely temporary in its shifting manifestations That is a realization which is no mean task to achieve and is difficult for many even yet So intelligent a traveler as missus Bishop Miss Bird on her first visit to Japan came to the conclusion that Japanese women had no modesty because they had no objection to being seen naked when bathing Twenty years later she admitted to doctor Baelz that she had made a mistake and that a woman may be naked and yet behave like a lady sixty one In civilized countries the observances of modesty differ in different regions and in different social classes but however various the forms may be the impulse itself remains persistent sixty two Modesty has thus come to have the force of a tradition a vague but massive force bearing with special power on those who cannot reason and yet having its root in the instincts of all people of all classes sixty three It has become mainly transformed into the allied emotion of decency which has been described as modesty fossilized into social customs The emotion yields more readily than in its primitive state to any sufficiently strong motive Even fashion in the more civilized countries can easily inhibit anatomical modesty and rapidly exhibit or accentuate in turn almost any part of the body while the savage Indian woman of America the barbarous woman of some Mohammedan countries can scarcely sacrifice her modesty in the pangs of childbirth Even when among uncivilized races the focus of modesty may be said to be eccentric and arbitrary it still remains very rigid In such savage and barbarous countries modesty possesses the strength of a genuine and irresistible instinct In civilized countries however anyone who places considerations of modesty before the claims of some real human need excites ridicule and contempt FOOTNOTES four

later he remarks that as regards both hands this attitude may be found in a figurine of Cyprus two thousand years before Christ This is no doubt correct and I may add that Babylonian figurines of Ishtar the goddess of fertility represent her as clasping her hands to her breasts or her womb ten When there is no sexual fear the impulse of modesty may be entirely inhibited French ladies under the old Regime as A Franklin points out in his Vie Privee d Autrefois sometimes showed no modesty towards their valets not admitting the possibility of any sexual advance and a lady would for example stand up in her bath while a valet added hot water by pouring it between her separated feet eleven I do not hereby mean to deny a certain degree of normal periodicity even to the human male but such

however special reference to sexual taboo I may remark that English people of lower class especially women are often modest about eating in the presence of people of higher class This feeling is no doubt due in part to the consciousness of defective etiquette but that very consciousness is in part a development of the fear of causing disgust which is a component of modesty thirty Shame in regard to eating it may be added occasionally appears as a neurasthenic obsession in civilization and has been studied as a form of psychasthenia by Janet See e g Raymond and Janet Les Obsessions et la

with one s own desire unsatisfied one sees the satisfaction of another and here we may see the altruistic stage beginning this has two sides the fear of causing desire in others and the fear of causing disgust in each case personal isolation is the psychological result thirty two Hohenemser argues that the fear of causing disgust cannot be a part of shame But he also argues that shame is simply psychic stasis and it is quite easy to see as in the above case that the fear of causing disgust is simply a manifestation of psychic stasis There is a conflict in the woman s mind between the idea of herself which she has already given and the more degraded idea of herself which she fears she is likely to give and this conflict is settled when she is made to feel that the first idea may still be maintained under the new circumstances thirty three We neither of us knew that we had merely made afresh a very ancient discovery Casanova more than a century ago quoted the remark of a friend of his that the easiest way to overcome the modesty of a woman is to suppose it non existent and he adds a saying which he attributes to Clement of Alexandria that modesty which seems so deeply rooted in women only resides in the linen that covers them and vanishes when it vanishes The passage to which Casanova referred occurs in the Paedagogus and has already been quoted The observation seems to have appealed strongly to the Fathers always glad to make a point against women and I have met with it in Cyprian s De Habitu Feminarum It also occurs in Jerome s treatise against Jovinian Jerome with more scholarly instinct rightly presents the remark as a quotation Scribit Herodotus quod mulier cum veste deponat et verecundiam In Herodotus the saying is attributed to Gyges Book I Chapter VIII We may thus trace very far back into antiquity an observation which in English has received its classical expression from Chaucer who in his Wife of Bath s Prologue has He sayde a woman cast hir shame away When she cast of hir smok I need not point out that the analysis of modesty offered above robs this venerable saying of any sting it may have possessed as a slur upon women In such a case modesty is largely a doubt as to the spectator s attitude and necessarily disappears when that doubt is satisfactorily resolved As we have seen the Central Australian maidens were very modest with regard to the removal of their single garment but when that removal was accomplished and accepted they were fearless thirty four The same result occurs more markedly under the deadening influence

Sanction of Modesty The Phenomena of Blushing Influences Which Modify the Aptitude to Blush Darkness Concealment of the Face et cetera It is impossible to contemplate this series of phenomena so radically persistent whatever its changes of form and so constant throughout every stage of civilization without feeling that although modesty cannot properly be called an instinct there must be some physiological basis to support it Undoubtedly such a basis is formed by that vasomotor mechanism of which the most obvious outward sign is in human beings the blush All the allied emotional forms of fear shame bashfulness timidity are to some extent upheld by this mechanism but such is especially the case with the emotion we are now concerned with sixty four The blush is the sanction of modesty The blush is indeed only a part almost perhaps an accidental part of the organic turmoil with which it is associated Partridge who has studied the phenomena of blushing in one hundred and twenty cases Pedagogical Seminary April eighteen ninety seven finds that the following are the general symptoms tremors near the waist weakness in the limbs pressure trembling warmth weight or beating in the chest warm wave from feet upward quivering of heart stoppage and then rapid beating of heart coldness all over followed by heat dizziness tingling of toes and fingers numbness something rising in throat smarting of eyes singing in ears prickling sensations of face and pressure inside head Partridge considers that the disturbance is primarily central a change in the cerebral circulation and that the actual redness of the surface comes late in the nerve storm and is really but a small part of it There has been some discussion as to why and indeed how far blushing is confined to the face Henle Ueber das Erroethen thought that we blush in the face because all nervous phenomena produced by mental states appear first in the face owing to the anatomical arrangement of the nerves of the body Darwin Expression of the Emotions argued that attention to a part tends to produce capillary activity in the part and that the face has been the chief object of attention It has also been argued on the other hand that the blush is the vestigial remains of a general erethism of sex in which shame originated that the blush was thus once more widely diffused and is so still among the women of some lower races its limitation to the face being due to sexual selection and the enhanced beauty thus achieved Fere once had occasion to examine when completely nude a boy of thirteen whose sexual organs were deformed when accused of masturbation he became covered by a blush which spread uniformly over his face neck body and limbs before and behind except only the hands and feet Fere asks whether such a universal blush is more common than we imagine or whether the state of nudity favors its manifestation Comptes Rendus Societe de Biologie April one nineteen oh five It may be added that Partridge mentions one case in which the hands blushed The sexual relationships of blushing are unquestionable It occurs chiefly in women it attains its chief intensity at puberty and during adolescence its most common occasion is some more or less sexual suggestion among one hundred and sixty two occasions of blushing enumerated by Partridge by far the most frequent cause was teasing usually about the other sex An erection it has been said is a blushing of the penis Stanley Hall seems to suggest that the sexual blush is a vicarious genital flushing of blood diverted from the genital sphere by an inhibition of fear just as in girls giggling is also very frequently a vicarious outlet of shame the sexual blush would thus be the outcome of an ancestral sex fear it is as an irradiation of sexual erethism that the blush may contain an element of pleasure sixty five Bloch remarks that the blush is sexual because reddening of the face as well as of the genitals is an accompaniment of sexual emotion Beitraege zur AEtiologie der Psychopathia Sexualis Teil II p thirty nine Do you not think a correspondent writes that the sexual blush at least really represents a vaso relaxor effect quite the same as erection The embarrassment which arises is due to a perception of this fact under circumstances which are felt to be unsuited for such a condition There may arise the fear of awakening disgust by the exhibition of a state which is out of place I have noticed that such a blush is produced when a sufficiently young and susceptible woman is pumped full of compliments This blush seems accompanied by pleasure which does not always change to fear or disgust but is felt to be attractive When discomfort arises most women say that they feel this because it looks as if they had no control over themselves When they feel that there is no need for control they no longer feel fear and the relaxor effect has a wider field of operation producing a general rosiness erection of spinal sexual organs et cetera Such a blush would thus be a partial sexual equivalent and allow of the inhibition of other sexual effects through the warning it gives and the fear aroused as well as being in itself a slight outlet of relaxor energy When the relationships of the persons concerned allow freedom to the special sexual stimuli as in marriage blushing does not occur so often and when it does it has not so often the consequent of fear There can be no doubt that the blush is sexually attractive The blush is the expression of an impulse to concealment and flight which tends automatically to arouse in the beholder the corresponding impulse of pursuit so that the central situation of courtship is at once presented Women are more or less conscious of this as well as men and this recognition is an added source of embarrassment when it cannot become a source of pleasure The ancient use of rouge testifies to the beauty of the blush and Darwin stated that in Turkish slave markets the girls who readily blushed fetched the highest prices To evoke a blush even by producing embarrassment is very commonly a cause of masculine gratification Savages both men and women blush even beneath a dusky skin for the phenomenon of blushing among different races see Waitz Anthropologie der Naturvoelker Bd I pp one hundred forty nine one hundred fifty and it is possible that natural selection as well as sexual selection has been favorable to the development of the blush It is scarcely an accident that as has been often observed criminals or the antisocial element of the community whether by the habits of their lives or by congenital abnormality blush less easily than normal persons Kroner Das koerperliche Gefuehl eighteen eighty seven p one hundred thirty remarks The origin of a specific connection between shame and blushing is the work of a social selection It is certainly an immediate advantage for a man not to blush indirectly however it is a disadvantage because in other ways he will be known as shameless and on that account as a rule he will be shut out from propagation This social selection will be specially exercised on the female sex and on this account women blush to a greater extent and more readily than men The importance of the blush and the emotional confusion behind it as the sanction of modesty is shown by the significant fact that by lulling emotional confusion it is possible to inhibit the sense of modesty In other words we are here in the presence of a fear to a large extent a sex fear impelling to concealment and dreading self attention this fear naturally disappears even though its ostensible cause remains when it becomes apparent that there is no reason for fear That is the reason why nakedness in itself has nothing to do with modesty or immodesty it is the conditions under which the nakedness occurs which determine whether or not modesty will be roused If none of the factors of modesty are violated if no embarrassing self attention is excited if there is a consciousness of perfect propriety alike in the subject and in the spectator nakedness is entirely compatible with the most scrupulous modesty A Duval a pupil of Ingres tells that a female model was once quietly posing completely nude at the Ecole des Beaux Arts Suddenly she screamed and ran to cover herself with her garments She had seen a workman on the roof gazing inquisitively at her through a skylight sixty six And Paola Lombroso describes how a lady a diplomatist s wife who went to a gathering where she found herself the only woman in evening dress felt to her own surprise such sudden shame that she could not keep back her tears It thus comes about that the emotion of modesty necessarily depends on the feelings of the people around The absence of the emotion by no means signifies immodesty provided that the reactions of modesty are at once set in motion under the stress of a spectator s eye that is seen to be lustful inquisitive or reproachful This is proved to be the case among primitive peoples everywhere The Japanese woman naked as in daily life she sometimes is remains unconcerned because she excites no disagreeable attention but the inquisitive and unmannerly European s eye at once causes her to feel confusion Stratz a physician and one moreover who had long lived among the Javanese who frequently go naked found that naked Japanese women felt no embarrassment in his presence It is doubtless as a cloak to the blush that we must explain the curious influence of darkness in restraining the manifestations of modesty as many lovers have discovered and as we may notice in our cities after dark This influence of darkness in inhibiting modesty is a very ancient observation Burton in the Anatomy of Melancholy quotes from Dandinus the saying Nox facit impudentes directly associating this with blushing and Bargagli the Siennese novelist wrote in the sixteenth century that it is commonly said of women that they will do in the dark what they would not do in the light It is true that the immodesty of a large city at night is to some extent explained by the irruption of prostitutes at that time prostitutes being habitually nearer to the threshold of immodesty are more markedly affected by this influence But it is an influence to which the most modest women are at all events in some degree susceptible It has indeed been said that a woman is always more her real self in the dark than in the glare of daylight this is part of what Chamberlain calls her night inspiration Traces of the night inspiration of the influence of the primitive fire group abound in woman Indeed it may be said the life of Southern Europe and of American society of to day illustrates this point abundantly that she is in a sense a night being for the activity physical and moral of modern women revealed e g in the dance and the nocturnal intellectualities of society in this direction is remarkable Perhaps we may style a good deal of her ordinary day labor as rest or the commonplaces and banalities of her existence her evening and night life being the true side of her activities A F Chamberlain Work and Rest Popular Science Monthly March nineteen oh two Giessler who has studied the general influence of darkness on human psychic life reaches conclusions which harmonize with these C M Giessler Der Einfluss der Dunkelheit auf das Seelenleben des Menschen Vierteljahrsschrift fuer wissenschaftliche Philosophie nineteen oh four pp two hundred fifty five two hundred seventy nine I have not been able to see Giessler s paper but according to a summary of it he comes to the result that in the dark the soul s activities are nearer to its motor pole than to its sensitive pole and that there is a tendency for phenomena belonging to the early period of development to be prominent motor memory functioning more than representative memory attention more than apperception imagination more than logical thinking egoistic more than altruistic morals It is curious to note that short sightedness naturally though illogically tends to exert the same influence as darkness in this respect I am assured by short sighted persons of both sexes that they are much more liable to the emotions of shyness and modesty with their glasses than without them such persons with difficulty realize that they are not so dim to others as others are to them To be in the company of a blind person seems also to be a protection against shyness sixty seven It is interesting to learn that congenitally blind children are as sensitive to appearances as normal children and blush as readily sixty eight This would seem to be due to the fact that the habitually blind have permanently adjusted their mental focus to that of normal persons and react in the same manner as normal persons blindness is not for them as it is for the short sighted without their glasses a temporary and relative almost unconscious refuge from clear vision It is of course not as the mere cloak of a possible blush that darkness gives courage it is because it lulls detailed self realization such conscious self realization being always a source of fears and the blush their definite symbol and visible climax It is to the blush that we must attribute a curious complementary relationship between the face and the sacro pubic region as centres of anatomical modesty The women of some African tribes who go naked Emin Bey remarked cover the face with the hand under the influence of modesty Martial long since observed Lib iii LXVIII that when an innocent girl looks at the penis she gazes through her fingers Where as among many Mohammedan peoples the face is the chief focus of modesty the exposure of the rest of the body including sometimes even the sacro pubic region and certainly the legs and thighs often becomes a matter of indifference sixty nine This concealment of the face is more than a convention it has a psychological basis We may observe among ourselves the well marked feminine tendency to hide the face in order to cloak a possible blush and to hide the eyes as a method of lulling self consciousness a method fabulously attributed to the ostrich with the same end of concealment seventy A woman who is shy with her lover will sometimes experience little or no difficulty in showing any part of her person provided she may cover her face When in gynecological practice examination of the sexual organs is necessary women frequently find evident satisfaction in concealing the face with the hands although not the slightest attention is being directed toward the face and when an unsophisticated woman is betrayed into a confession which affects her modesty she is apt to turn her back to her interlocutor When the face of woman is covered it has been said her heart is bared and the Catholic Church has recognized this psychological truth by arranging that in the confessional the penitent s face shall not be visible The gay and innocent freedom of southern women during Carnival is due not entirely to the permitted license of the season or the concealment of identity but to the mask that hides the face In England during Queen Elizabeth s reign and at the Restoration it was possible for respectable women to be present at the theatre even during the performance of the most free spoken plays because they wore masks The fan has often subserved a similar end seventy one All such facts serve to show that though the forms of modesty may change it is yet a very radical constituent of human nature in all stages of civilization and that it is to a large extent maintained by the mechanism of blushing FOOTNOTES sixty four Melinaud Pourquoi Rougit on Revue des Deux Mondes one Octobre eighteen ninety three points out that blushing is always associated with fear and indicates in the various conditions under which it may arise modesty timidity confusion that we have something to conceal which we fear may be discovered All the evidence Partridge states seems to point to the conclusion that the mental state underlying blushing belongs to the fear family The presence of the feeling of dread the palpitation of the heart the impulse to escape to hide the shock all confirms this view sixty five G Stanley Hall A Study of Fears American Journal Psychology eighteen ninety seven sixty six Men are also very sensitive to any such inquisitiveness on the part of the opposite sex To this cause perhaps and possibly also to the fear of causing disgust may be ascribed the objection of men to undress before women artists and women doctors I am told there is often difficulty in getting men to pose nude to women artists Sir Jonathan Hutchinson was compelled some years ago to exclude lady members of the medical profession from the instructive demonstrations at his museum on account of the unwillingness of male patients to undress before them A similar unwillingness is not found among women patients but it must be remembered that while women are accustomed to men as doctors men in England are not yet accustomed to women as doctors sixty seven I am acquainted with the case of a shy man writes doctor Harry Campbell in his interesting study of Morbid Shyness British Medical Journal September twenty six eighteen ninety six who will make himself quite at home in the house of a blind person and help himself to wine with the utmost confidence whereas if a member of the family who can see comes into the room all his old shyness returns and he wishes himself far away sixty eight Stanley Hall Showing Off and Bashfulness Pedagogical Seminary June nineteen oh three quotes doctor Anagnos of the Perkins Institute for the Blind to this effect sixty nine Thus Sonnini in the eighteenth century noted that the country women in Egypt only wore a single garment open from the armpits to the knees on each side so that it revealed the body at every movement but this troubles the women little provided the face is not exposed Voyage dans la Haute et Basse Egypte seventeen seventy nine vol i p two hundred eighty nine When Casanova was at Constantinople the Comte de Bonneval a convert to Islam assured him that he was mistaken in trying to see a woman s face when he might easily obtain greater favors from her The most reserved of Turkish women the Comte assured him only carries her modesty in her face and as soon as her veil is on she is sure that she will never blush at anything Memoires vol i p four hundred twenty nine seventy It is worth noting that this impulse is rooted in the natural instinctive acts and ideas of childhood Stanley Hall dealing with the Early Sense of Self in the report already mentioned refers to the eyes as perhaps even more than the hands feet and mouth the centres of that kind of self consciousness which is always mindful of how the self appears to others and proceeds to mention the very common impression of young children that if the eyes are covered or closed they cannot be seen Some think the entire body thus vanishes from sight of others some that the head also ceases to be visible and a still higher form of this curious psychosis is that when they are closed the soul cannot be seen American Journal of Psychology vol ix No three eighteen ninety eight The instinctive and unreasoned character of this act is further shown by its occurrence in idiots Naecke mentions that he once had occasion to examine the abdomen of an idiot who thereupon attempted to draw down his shirt with the left hand while with the right he covered his eyes seventy one Cf Stanley Hall and T Smith Showing Off and Bashfulness American Journal of Psychology June nineteen oh three IV Summary of the Factors of Modesty The Future of Modesty Modesty an Essential Element of Love We have seen that the factors of modesty are numerous To attempt to explain modesty by dismissing it as merely an example of psychic paralysis of Stauung is to elude the problem by the statement of what is little more than a truism Modesty is a complexus of emotions with their concomitant ideas which we must unravel to comprehend We have found among the factors of modesty one the primitive animal gesture of sexual refusal on the part of the female when she is not at that moment of her generative life at which she desires the male s advances two the fear of arousing disgust a fear primarily due to the close proximity of the sexual centre to the points of exit of those excretions which are useless and unpleasant even in many cases to animals three the fear of the magic influence of sexual phenomena and the ceremonial and ritual practices primarily based on this fear and ultimately passing into simple rules of decorum which are signs and guardians of modesty four the development of ornament and clothing concomitantly fostering alike the modesty which represses male sexual desire and the coquetry which seeks to allure it five the conception of women as property imparting a new and powerful sanction to an emotion already based on more natural and primitive facts It must always be remembered that these factors do not usually occur separately Very often they are all of them implied in a single impulse of modesty We unravel the cord in order to investigate its construction but in real life the strands are more or less indistinguishably twisted together It may still be asked finally whether on the whole modesty really becomes a more prominent emotion as civilization advances I do not think this position can be maintained It is a great mistake as we have seen to suppose that in becoming extended modesty also becomes intensified On the contrary this very extension is a sign of weakness Among savages modesty is far more radical and invincible than among the civilized Of the Araucanian women of Chile Treutler has remarked that they are distinctly more modest than the Christian white population and such observations might be indefinitely extended It is as we have already noted in a new and crude civilization eager to mark its separation from a barbarism it has yet scarcely escaped that we find an extravagant and fantastic anxiety to extend the limits of modesty in life and art and literature In older and more mature civilizations in classical antiquity in old Japan in France modesty while still a very real influence becomes a much less predominant and all pervading influence In life it becomes subservient to human use in art to beauty in literature to expression Among ourselves we may note that modesty is a much more invincible motive among the lower social classes than among the more cultivated classes This is so even when we should expect the influence of occupation to induce familiarity Thus I have been told of a ballet girl who thinks it immodest to bathe in the fashion customary at the seaside and cannot make up her mind to do so but she appears on the stage every night in tights as a matter of course while Fanny Kemble in her Reminiscences tells of an actress accustomed to appear in tights who died a martyr to modesty rather than allow a surgeon to see her inflamed knee Modesty is indeed a part of self respect but in the fully developed human being self respect itself holds in check any excessive modesty seventy two We must remember moreover that there are more definite grounds for the subordination of modesty with the development of civilization We have seen that the factors of modesty are many and that most of them are based on emotions which make little urgent appeal save to races in a savage or barbarous condition Thus disgust as Richet has truly pointed out necessarily decreases as knowledge increases seventy three As we analyze and understand our experiences better so they cause us less disgust A rotten egg is disgusting but the chemist feels no disgust toward sulphuretted hydrogen while a solution of propylamin does not produce the disgusting impression of that human physical uncleanliness of which it is an odorous constituent As disgust becomes analyzed and as self respect tends to increased physical purity so the factor of disgust in modesty is minimized The factor of ceremonial uncleanness again which plays so urgent a part in modesty at certain stages of culture is to day without influence except in so far as it survives in etiquette In the same way the social economic factor of modesty based on the conception of women as property belongs to a stage of human development which is wholly alien to an advanced civilization Even the most fundamental impulse of all the gesture of sexual refusal is normally only imperative among animals and savages Thus civilization tends to subordinate if not to minimize modesty to render it a grace of life rather than a fundamental social law of life But an essential grace of life it still remains and whatever delicate variations it may assume we can scarcely conceive of its disappearance In the art of love however it is more than a grace it must always be fundamental Modesty is not indeed the last word of love but it is the necessary foundation for all love s most exquisite audacities the foundation which alone gives worth and sweetness to what Senancour calls its delicious impudence seventy four Without modesty we could not have nor rightly value at its true worth that bold and pure candor which is at once the final revelation of love and the seal of its sincerity Even Hohenemser who argues that for the perfect man there could be no shame because shame rests on an inner conflict in one s own personality and the perfect man knows no inner conflict believes that since humanity is imperfect modesty possesses a high and indeed symptomatic value for its presence shows that according to the measure of a man s ideal personality his valuations are established Dugas goes further and asserts that the ideals of modesty develop with human development and forever take on new and finer forms There is he declares a very close relationship between naturalness or sincerity and modesty for in love naturalness is the ideal attained and modesty is only the fear of coming short of that ideal Naturalness is the sign and the test of perfect love It is the sign of it for when love can show itself natural and true one may conclude that it is purified of its unavowable imperfections or defects of its alloy of wretched and petty passions its grossness its chimerical notions that it has become strong and healthy and vigorous It is the ordeal of it for to show itself natural to be always true without shrinking it must have all the lovable qualities and have them without seeking as a second nature What we call natural is indeed really acquired it is the gift of a physical and moral evolution which it is precisely the object of modesty to keep Modesty is the feeling of the true that is to say of the healthy in love it long exists as a vision not yet attained vague yet sufficiently clear for all that deviates from it to be repelled as offensive and painful At first a remote and seemingly inaccessible ideal as it comes nearer it grows human and individual and emerges from the region of dream ceasing not to be loved as ideal even when it is possessed as real At first sight it seems paradoxical to define modesty as an aspiration towards truth in love it seems on the contrary to be an altogether factitious feeling But to simplify the problem we have to suppose modesty reduced to its normal functions disengaged from its superstitions its variegated customs and prejudices the true modesty of simple and healthy natures as far removed from prudery as from immodesty And what we term the natural or the true in love is the singular mingling of two forms of imaginations wrongly supposed to be incompatible ideal aspiration and the sense for the realities of life Thus defined modesty not only repudiates that cold and dissolving criticism which deprives love of all poetry and prepares the way for a brutal realism it also excludes that light and detached imagination which floats above love the mere idealism of heroic sentiments which cherishes poetic illusions and passes without seeing it the love that is real and alive True modesty implies a love not addressed to the heroes of vain romances but to living people with their feet on the earth But on the other hand modesty is the respect of love if it is not shocked by its physical necessities if it accepts physiological and psychological conditions it also maintains the ideal of those moral proprieties outside of which for all of us love cannot be enjoyed When love is really felt and not vainly imagined modesty is the requirement of an ideal of dignity conceived as the very condition of that love Separate modesty from love that is from love which is not floating in the air but crystallized around a real person and its psychological reality its poignant and tragic character disappears Dugas La Pudeur Revue Philosophique Nov nineteen oh three So conceived modesty becomes a virtue almost identical with the Roman modestia FOOTNOTES seventy two Freud remarks that one may often hear concerning elderly ladies that in their youth in the country they suffered almost to collapse from haemorrhages from the genital passage because they were too modest to seek medical advice and examination he adds that it is extremely rare to find such an attitude among our young women to day S Freud Zur Neurosenlehre nineteen oh six p one hundred eighty two It would be easy to find evidence of the disappearance of misplaced signs of modesty formerly prevalent although this mark of increasing civilization has not always penetrated to our laws and regulations seventy three Disgust he remarks is a sort of synthesis which attaches to the total form of objects and which must diminish and disappear as scientific analysis separates into parts what as a whole is so repugnant seventy four Senancour De l Amour eighteen thirty four vol i p three hundred sixteen He remarks that a useless and false reserve is due to stupidity rather than to modesty THE PHENOMENA OF SEXUAL PERIODICITY I The Various Physiological and Psychological Rhythms Menstruation The Alleged Influence of the Moon Frequent Suppression of Menstruation among Primitive Races Mittelschmerz Possible Tendency to a Future Intermenstrual Cycle Menstruation among Animals Menstruating Monkeys and Apes What is Menstruation Its Primary Cause Still Obscure The Relation of Menstruation to Ovulation The Occasional Absence of Menstruation in Health The Relation of Menstruation to Heat The Prohibition of Intercourse during Menstruation The Predominance of Sexual Excitement at and around the Menstrual Period Its Absence during the Period Frequently Apparent only Throughout the vegetable and animal worlds the sexual functions are periodic From the usually annual period of flowering in plants with its play of sperm cell and germ cell and consequent seed production through the varying sexual energies of animals up to the monthly effervescence of the generative organism in woman seeking not without the shedding of blood for the gratification of its reproductive function from first to last we find unfailing evidence of the periodicity of sex At first the sun and then as some have thought the moon have marked throughout a rhythmic impress on the phenomena of sex To understand these phenomena we have not only to recognize the bare existence of that periodic fact but to realize its implications Rhythm it is scarcely necessary to remark is far from characterizing sexual activity alone It is the character of all biological activity alike on the physical and the psychic sides All the organs of the body appear to be in a perpetual process of rhythmic contraction and expansion The heart is rhythmic so is the respiration The spleen is rhythmic so also the bladder The uterus constantly undergoes regular rhythmic contractions at brief intervals The vascular system down to the smallest capillaries is acted on by three series of vibrations and every separate fragment of muscular tissue possesses rhythmic contractility Growth itself is rhythmic and as Malling Hansen and subsequent observers have found follows a regular annual course as well as a larger cycle On the psychic sides attention is rhythmic We are always irresistibly compelled to impart a rhythm to every succession of sounds however uniform and monotonous A familiar example of this is the rhythm we can seldom refrain from hearing in the puffing of an engine A series of experiments by Bolton on thirty subjects showed that the clicks of an electric telephone connected in an induction apparatus nearly always fell into rhythmic groups usually of two or four rarely of three or five the rhythmic perception being accompanied by a strong impulse to make corresponding muscular movements seventy five It is however with the influence to some extent real to some extent perhaps only apparent of cosmic rhythm that we are here concerned The general tendency physical and psychic of nervous action to fall into rhythm is merely interesting from the present point of view as showing a biological predisposition to accept any periodicity that is habitually imposed upon the organism seventy six Menstruation has always been associated with the lunar revolutions seventy seven Darwin without specifically mentioning menstruation has suggested that the explanation of the allied cycle of gestation in mammals as well as incubation in birds may be found in the condition under which ascidians live at high and low water in consequence of the phenomena of tidal change seventy eight It must however be remembered that the ascidian origin of the vertebrates has since been contested from many sides and even if we admit that at all events some such allied conditions in the early history of vertebrates and their ancestors tended to impress a lunar cycle on the race it must still be remembered that the monthly periodicity of menstruation only becomes well marked in the human species seventy nine Bearing in mind the influence exerted on both the habits and the emotions even of animals by the brightness of moonlight nights it is perhaps not extravagant to suppose that on organisms already ancestrally predisposed to the influence of rhythm in general and of cosmic rhythm in particular the periodically recurring full moon not merely by its stimulation of the nervous system but possibly by the special opportunities which it gave for the exercise of the sexual functions served to implant a lunar rhythm on menstruation How important such a factor may be we have evidence in the fact that the daily life of even the most civilized peoples is still regulated by a weekly cycle which is apparently a segment of the cosmic lunar cycle Mantegazza has suggested that the sexual period became established with relation to the lunar period because moonlight nights were favorable to courting eighty and Nelson remarks that in his experience young and robust persons are subject to recurrent periods of wakefulness at night which they attribute to the action of the full moon One may perhaps refer also to the tendency of bright moonlight to stir the emotions of the young especially at puberty a tendency which in neurotic persons may become almost morbid eighty one It is interesting to point out that the farther back we are able to trace the beginnings of culture the more important we find the part played by the moon Next to the alteration of day and night the moon s changes are the most conspicuous and startling phenomena of Nature they first suggest a basis for reckoning time they are of the greatest use in primitive agriculture and everywhere the moon is held to have vast influence on the whole of organic life Hahn has suggested that the reason why mythological systems do not usually present the moon in the supreme position which we should expect is that its immense importance is so ancient a fact that it tends with mythological development to become overlaid by other elements eighty two According to Seler Quetzalcouatl and Tezeatlipoca the two most considerable figures in the Mexican pantheon are to be regarded mainly as complementary forms of the moon divinity and the moon was the chief Mexican measurer of time eighty three Even in Babylonia where the sun was most specially revered at the earliest period the moon ranked higher being gradually superseded by the worship of the sun eighty four Although such considerations as these will by no means take us as far back as the earliest appearance of menstruation they may serve to indicate that the phases of the moon probably played a large part in the earliest evolution of man With that statement we must at present rest content It is possible that the monthly character of menstruation while representing a general tendency of the human race always and everywhere prevalent may be modified in the future It is a noteworthy fact that among many primitive races menstruation only occurs at long intervals Thus among Eskimo women menstruation follows the peculiar cosmic conditions to which the people are subjected Cook the ethnologist of the Peary North Greenland expedition found that menstruation only began after the age of nineteen and that it was usually suppressed during the winter months when there is no sun only about one in ten women continuing to menstruate during this period eighty five It was stated by Velpeau that Lapland and Greenland women usually only menstruate every three months or even only two or three times during the year On the Faroe Islands it is said that menstruation is frequently absent Among the Samoyeds Mantegazza mentions that menstruation is so slight that some travelers have denied its existence Azara noted among the Guaranis of Paraguay that menstruation was not only slight in amount but the periods were separated by long intervals Among the Indians in North America again menstruation appears to be scanty Thus Holder speaking of his experience with the Crow Indians of Montana says I am quite sure that full blood Indians in this latitude do not menstruate so freely as white women not usually exceeding three days eighty six Among the naked women of Tierra del Fuego it is said that there is often no physical sign of the menses for six months at a time These observations are noteworthy though they clearly indicate on the whole that primitiveness in race is a very powerless factor without a cold climate On the other hand again there is some reason to suppose that in Europe there is a latent tendency in some women for the menstrual cycle to split up further into two cycles by the appearance of a latent minor climax in the middle of the monthly interval I allude to the phenomenon usually called Mittelschmerz middle period or intermenstrual pain Since the investigations of Goodman Stephenson Van Ott Reinl Jacobi and others it has been generally recognized that menstruation is a continuous process the flow being merely the climax of a menstrual cycle a physiological wave which is in constant flux or reflux This cycle manifests itself in all a woman s activities in metabolism respiration temperature et cetera as well as on the nervous and psychic side The healthier the woman is the less conscious is the cyclic return of her life but the cycle may be traced as Hegar has found even before puberty takes place while Salerni has found that even in amenorrhoea the menstrual cycle still manifests itself in the temperature and respiration Rivista Sperimentale di Freniatria XXX fasc two three For a summary of the phenomena of the menstrual cycle see Havelock Ellis Man and Woman fourth ed revised and enlarged Ch XI The Functional Periodicity of Women Cf Keller Archives Generales de Medecine May eighteen ninety seven Hegar Allgemeine Zeitschrift fuer Psychiatrie nineteen oh one Heft two and three Helen MacMurchy Lancet Oct five nineteen oh one A E Giles Transactions Obstetrical Society London vol xxxix p one hundred fifteen et cetera Mittelschmerz is a condition of pain occurring about the middle of the intermenstrual period either alone or accompanied by a slight sanguineous discharge or more frequently a non sanguineous discharge In a case described by Van Voornveld the manifestation was confined to a regularly occurring rise of temperature The phenomenon varies but seems usually to occur about the fourteenth day and to last two or three days Laycock in eighteen forty Nervous Diseases of Women p forty six gave instances of women with an intermenstrual period Depaul and Gueniot Dictionnaire Encyclopedique des Sciences Medicales Art Menstruation p six hundred ninety four speak of intermenstrual symptoms and even actual flow as occurring in women who are in a perfect state of health and constituting genuine regles surnumeraries The condition is however said to have been first fully described by Valleix then in eighteen thousand seven hundred twenty five by Sir William Priestley and subsequently by Fehling Fasbender Sorel Halliday Croom Findley Addinsell and others See for instance Mittelschmerz by J Halliday Croom Transactions of Edinburgh Obstetrical Society vol xxi eighteen ninety six Also Krieger Menstruation pp sixty eight sixty nine Fliess Die Beziehungen zwischen Nase und weiblichen Geschlechts Organen p one hundred eighteen goes so far as to assert that an intermenstrual period of menstrual symptoms which he terms Nebenmenstruation is a phenomenon well known to most healthy women Observations are at present too few to allow any definite conclusions and in some of the cases so far recorded a pathological condition of the sexual organs has been found to exist Rosner of Cracow however found that only in one case out of twelve was there any disease present La Gynecologie June nineteen oh five and Storer who has met with twenty cases insists on the remarkable and definite regularity of the manifestations wholly unlike those of neuralgia Boston Medical and Surgical Journal April nineteen nineteen hundred There is no agreement as to the cause of Mittelschmerz Addinsell attributed it to disease of the Fallopian tubes This however is denied by such competent authorities as Cullingworth and Bland Sutton Others like Priestley and subsequently Marsh American Journal of Obstetrics July eighteen ninety seven have sought to find the explanation in the occurrence of ovulation This theory is however unsupported by facts and eventually rests on the exploded belief that ovulation is the cause of menstruation Rosner following Richelet vaguely attributes it to the diffused hyperaemia which is generally present Van de Velde also attributes it to an abnormal fall of vascular tone causing passive congestion of the pelvic viscera Others again like Armand Routh and MacLean in the course of an interesting discussion on Mittelschmerz at the Obstetric Society of London on the second day of March eighteen ninety eight believe that we may trace here a double menstruation and would explain the phenomenon by assuming that in certain cases there is an intermenstrual as well as a menstrual cycle The question is not yet ripe for settlement though it is fully evident that looking broadly at the phenomena of rut and menstruation the main basis of their increasing frequency as we rise toward civilized man is increase of nutrition heat and sunlight being factors of nutrition When dealing with civilized man however we are probably concerned not merely with general nutrition but with the nervous direction of that nutrition At this stage it is natural to inquire what the corresponding phenomena are among animals Unfortunately imperfect as is our comprehension of the human phenomena our knowledge of the corresponding phenomena among animals is much more fragmentary and incomplete Among most animals menstruation does not exist being replaced by what is known as heat or oestrus which usually occurs once or twice a year in spring and in autumn sometimes affecting the male as well as the female eighty seven There is however a great deal of progression in the upward march of the phenomena as we approach our own and allied zooelogical series Heat in domesticated cows usually occurs every three weeks The female hippopotamus in the Zooelogical Gardens has been observed to exhibit monthly sexual excitement with swelling and secretion from the vulva Progression is not only toward greater frequency with higher evolution or with increased domestication but there is also a change in the character of the flow As Wiltshire eighty eight in his remarkable lectures on the Comparative Physiology of Menstruation asserted as a law the more highly evolved the animal the more sanguineous the catamenial flow It is not until we reach the monkeys that this character of the flow becomes well marked Monthly sanguineous discharges have been observed among many monkeys In the seventeenth century various observers in many parts of the world Bohnius Peyer Helbigius Van der Wiel and others noted menstruation in monkeys eighty nine Buffon observed it among various monkeys as well as in the orang utan J G saint Hilaire and Cuvier many years ago declared that menstruation exists among a variety of monkeys and lower apes Rengger described a vaginal discharge in a species of cebus in Paraguay while Raciborski observed in the Jardin des Plantes that the menstrual haemorrhage in guenons was so abundant that the floor of the cage was covered by it to a considerable extent the same variety of monkey was observed at Surinam by Hill a surgeon in the Dutch army who noted an abundant sanguineous flow occurring at every new moon and lasting about three days the animal at this time also showing signs of sexual excitement ninety The macaque and the baboon appear to be the non human animals in which menstruation has been most carefully observed In the former besides the flow Bland Sutton remarks that all the naked or pale colored parts of the body such as the face neck and ischial regions assume a lively pink color in some cases it is a vivid red ninety one The flow is slight but the coloring lasts several days and in warm weather the labia are much swollen Heape ninety two has most fully and carefully described menstruation in monkeys He found at Calcutta that the Macacus cynomolgus menstruated regularly on the twentieth of December twentieth of January and about the twentieth of February The Cynocephalus porcaria and the Semnopithecus entellus both menstruated each month for about four days In the Macaci rhesus and cynomolgus at menstruation the nipples and vulva become swollen and deeply congested and the skin of the buttocks swollen tense and of a brilliant red or even purple color The abdominal wall also for a short space upward and the inside of the thighs sometimes as far down as the heel and the under surface of the tail for half its length or more are all colored a vivid red while the skin of the face especially about the eyes is flushed or blotched with red In late gestation the coloring is still more vivid Something similar is to be seen in the males also Distant who kept a female baboon for some time has recorded the dates of menstruation during a year He found that nine periods occurred during the year The average length between the periods was nearly six weeks but they occurred more frequently in the late autumn and the winter than in the summer ninety three It is an interesting fact Heape noted that notwithstanding menstruation the seasonal influence or rut still persisted in the monkeys he investigated In the anthropoid apes Hartmann remarks that several observers have recorded periodic menstruation in the chimpanzee with flushing and enlargement of the external parts and protrusion of the external lips which are not usually visible while there is often excessive enlargement and reddening of these parts and of the posterior callosities during sexual excitement Very little however appears to be definitely known regarding any form of menstruation in the higher apes M Deniker who has made a special study of the anthropoid apes informs me that he has so far been unable to make definite observations regarding the existence of menstruation Moll remarks that he received information regarding such a phenomenon in the orang utan A pair of orang utans was kept in the Berlin Zooelogical Gardens some years ago and the female was stated to have at intervals a menstrual flow resembling that of women and during this period to refrain from sexual congress which was otherwise usually exercised at regular intervals at least every two or three days Moll adds however that while his informant is a reliable man the length of time that has elapsed may have led him to make mistakes in details Keith in a paper read before the Zooelogical Society of London has described menstruation in a chimpanzee it occurred every twenty third or twenty fourth day and lasted for three days the discharge was profuse and first appeared in about the ninth or tenth year ninety four What is menstruation It is easy to describe it by its obvious symptoms as a monthly discharge of blood from the uterus but nearly as much as that was known in the infancy of the world When we seek to probe more intimately into the nature of menstruation we are still baffled not merely as regards its cause but even as regards its precise mechanism The primary cause of menstruation remains unexplained the cause of menstruation remains as obscure as ever so conclude two of the most thorough and cautious investigators into this subject ninety five It is however widely accepted that the main cause of menstruation is a rhythmic contraction of the uterus the result of a disappointed preparation for impregnation a kind of miniature childbirth This seems to be the most reasonable view of menstruation i e as an abortion of a decidua Burdach according to Beard was the first who described menstruation as an abortive parturition The hypothesis Marshall and Jolly conclude that the entire pro oestrous process is of the nature of a preparation for the lodgment of the ovum is in accordance with the facts ninety six Fortunately since we are here primarily concerned with its psychological aspects the precise biological cause and physiological nature of menstruation do not greatly concern us There is however one point which of late years has been definitely determined and which should not be passed without mention the relation of menstruation to ovulation It was once supposed that the maturation of an ovule in the ovaries was the necessary accompaniment and even cause of menstruation We now know that ovulation proceeds throughout the whole of life even before birth and during gestation ninety seven and that removal of the ovaries by no means necessarily involves a cessation of menstruation It has been shown that regular and even excessive menstruation may take place in the congenital absence of a trace of ovaries or Fallopian tubes ninety eight On the other hand a rudimentary state of the uterus and a complete absence of menstruation may exist with well developed ovaries and normal ovulation ninety nine We must regard the uterus as to some extent an independent organ and menstruation as a process which arose no doubt with the object teleologically speaking of cooperating more effectively with ovulation but has become largely independent one hundred It is sometimes stated that menstruation may be entirely absent in perfect health Few cases of this condition have however been recorded with the detail necessary to prove the assertion One such case was investigated by doctor H W Mitchell and described in a paper read to the New York County Medical Society February twenty two eighteen ninety two to be found in Medical Reprints June eighteen ninety two The subject was a young unmarried woman twenty four years of age She was born in Ireland and until her emigration lived quietly at home with her parents Being then twenty years of age she left home and came to New York Up to that time no signs of menstruation had appeared and she had never heard that such a function existed Soon after her arrival in New York she obtained a situation as a waiting maid and it was noticed after a time that she was not unwell at each month Friends filled her ears with wild stories about the dreadful effects likely to follow the absence of menstruation This worried her greatly and as a consequence she became pale and anaemic with loss of flesh appetite and sleep and a long train of imaginary nervous symptoms She presented herself for treatment and insisted upon a uterine examination This revealed no pathological condition of her uterus She was assured that she would not die or become insane nor a chronic invalid In consequence she soon forgot that she differed in any way from other girls A course of chalybeate tonics generous diet and proper care of her general health soon restored her to her normal condition After close observation for several years she submitted to a thorough examination although entirely free from any abnormal symptoms The examination revealed the following physical condition Weight one hundred five pounds her weight before leaving Ireland was one hundred thirty girth of chest twenty nine and a half inches girth of abdomen twenty five inches girth of pelvis thirty four and a half inches girth of thigh upper third twenty inches heart healthy sounds and rhythm perfectly normal pulse seventy six lungs healthy respiratory murmur clear and distinct over every part respiration easy and twenty per minute the mammae are well developed firm and round nipples small no areola her skin is soft smooth and healthy figure erect plump and symmetrical her bowels are regular kidneys healthy She has a good appetite sleeps well and in no particular shows any sign of ill health The uterine examination reveals a short vagina and a small round cervix uteri rather less in size than the average and projecting very slightly into the vaginal canal Depth of uterus from os to fundus two and a quarter inches is very nearly normal No external sign of abnormal ovaries She is a well developed healthy young woman performing all her physiological functions naturally and regularly except the single function of menstruation No vicarious menstruation takes the place of the natural function though she has been watched very closely during the past two years nor the least periodical excitement It is added that though the clitoris is normal the mons veneris is almost destitute of hair and the labia rather undeveloped while as far as is known sexual instincts and desire are entirely absent These latter facts I may add would seem to suggest that in spite of the health of the subject there is yet some concealed lack of development of the sexual system of congenital character In a case recorded by Plant Centralblatt fuer Gynaekologie No nine eighteen ninety six summarized in the British Medical Journal April four eighteen ninety six in which the internal sexual organs were almost wholly undeveloped and menstruation absent the labia were similarly undeveloped and the pubic hair scanty while the axillary hair was wholly absent though that of the head was long and strong We may now regard as purely academic the discussion formerly carried on as to whether menstruation is to be regarded as analogous to heat in female animals For many centuries at least the resemblance has been sufficiently obvious Raciborski and Pouchet who first established the regular periodicity of ovulation in mammals identified heat and menstruation one hundred one During the past century there was notwithstanding an occasional tendency to deny any real connection No satisfactory grounds for this denial have however been brought forward Lawson Tait indeed and more recently Beard have stated that menstruation cannot be the period of heat because women have a disinclination to the approach of the male at that time one hundred two But as we shall see later this statement is unfounded An argument which might indeed be brought forward is the very remarkable fact that while in animals the period of heat is the only period for sexual intercourse among all human races from the very lowest the period of menstruation is the one period during which sexual intercourse is strictly prohibited sometimes under severe penalties even life itself This however is a social not a physiological fact Ploss and Bartels call attention to the curious contrast in this respect between heat and menstruation The same authors also mention that in the Middle Ages however preachers found it necessary to warn their hearers against the sin of intercourse during the menstrual period It may be added that Aquinas and many other early theologians held not only that such intercourse was a deadly sin but that it engendered leprous and monstrous children Some later theologians however like Sanchez argued that the Mosaic enactments such as Leviticus Ch XX v eighteen no longer hold good Modern theologians in part influenced by the tolerant traditions of Liguori and in part like Debreyne Moechialogie pp two hundred seventy five et seq informed by medical science no longer prohibit intercourse during menstruation or regard it as only a venial sin We have here a remarkable but not an isolated example of the tendency of the human mind in its development to rebel against the claims of primitive nature The whole of religion is a similar remolding of nature a repression of natural impulses an effort to turn them into new channels Prohibition of intercourse during menstruation is a fundamental element of savage ritual an element which is universal merely because the conditions which caused it are universal and because as is now beginning to be generally recognized the causes of human psychic evolution are everywhere the same A strictly analogous phenomenon in the sexual sphere itself is the opposed attitude in barbarism and civilization toward the sexual organs Under barbaric conditions and among savages when no magico religious ideas intervene the sexual organs are beautiful and pleasurable objects Under modern conditions this is not so This difference of attitude is reflected in sculpture In savage and barbaric carvings of human beings the sexual organs of both sexes are often enormously exaggerated This is true of the archaic European figures on which Salomon Reinach has thrown so much light but in modern sculpture from the time when it reached its perfection in Greece onward the sexual regions in both men and women are systematically minimized one hundred three With advancing culture as again we shall see later there is a conflict of claims and certain considerations are regarded as higher and more potent than merely natural claims Nakedness is more natural than clothing and on many grounds more desirable under the average circumstances of life yet everywhere under the stress of what are regarded as higher considerations there is a tendency for all races to add more and more to the burden of clothes In the same way it happens that the tendency of the female to sexual intercourse during menstruation one hundred four has everywhere been overlaid by the ideas of a culture which has insisted on regarding menstruation as a supernatural phenomenon which for the protection of everybody must be strictly tabooed one hundred five This tendency is reinforced and in high civilization replaced by the claims of an aesthetic regard for concealment and reserve during this period Such facts are significant for the early history of culture but they must not blind us to the real analogy between heat and menstruation an analogy or even identity which may be said to be accepted now by most careful investigators one hundred six If it is perhaps somewhat excessive to declare with Johnstone that woman is the only animal in which rut is omnipresent we must admit that the two groups of phenomena merge into or replace each other that their object is identical that they involve similar psychic conditions Here also we see a striking example of the way in which women preserve a primitive phenomenon which earlier in the zooelogical series was common to both sexes but which man has now lost Heat and menstruation with whatever difference of detail are practically the same phenomenon We cannot understand menstruation unless we bear this in mind On the psychic side the chief normal and primitive characteristic of the menstrual state is the more predominant presence of the sexual impulse There are other mental and emotional signs of irritability and instability which tend to slightly impair complete mental integrity and to render in some unbalanced individuals explosions of anger or depression in rarer cases crime more common one hundred seven but the heightening of the sexual impulse languor shyness and caprice are the more human manifestations of an emotional state which in some of the lower female animals during heat may produce a state of fury The actual period of the menstrual flow at all events the first two or three days does not among European women usually appear to show any heightening of sexual emotion one hundred eight This heightening occurs usually a few days before and especially during the latter part of the flow and immediately after it ceases one hundred nine I have however convinced myself by inquiry that this absence of sexual feeling during the height of the flow is in large part apparent only No doubt the onset of the flow often producing a general depression of vitality may tend directly to depress the emotions which are heightened by the general emotional state and local congestion of the days immediately preceding but among some women at all events who are normal and in good health I find that the period of menstruation itself is covered by the period of the climax of sexual feeling Thus a married lady writes My feelings are always very strong not only just before and after but during the period very unfortunately as of course they cannot then be gratified while a refined girl of nineteen living a chaste life without either coitus or masturbation which she has never practiced habitually feels very strong sexual excitement about the time of menstruation and more especially during the period this desire torments her life prevents her from sleeping at these times and she looks upon it as a kind of illness one hundred ten I could quote many other similar and equally emphatic statements and the fact that so cardinal a relationship of the sexual life of women should be ignored or denied by most writers on this matter is a curious proof of the prevailing ignorance one hundred eleven This ignorance has been fostered by the fact that women often disguise even to themselves the real state of their feelings One lady remarks that while she would be very ready for coitus during menstruation the thought that it is impossible during that time makes her put the idea of it out of her mind I have reason to think that this statement may be taken to represent the real feelings of very many women The aversion to coitus is real but it is often due not to failure of sexual desire but to the inhibitory action of powerful extraneous causes The absence of active sexual desire in women during the height of the flow may thus be regarded as in part a physiological fact following from the correspondence of the actual menstrual flow to the period of pro oestrum and in part a psychological fact due to the aesthetic repugnance to union when in such a condition and to the unquestioned acceptance of the general belief that at such a period intercourse is out of the question Some of the strongest factors of modesty especially the fear of causing disgust and the sense of the demands of ceremonial ritual would thus help to hold in check the sexual emotions during this period and when under the influence of insanity these motives are in abeyance the coincidence of sexual desire with the menstrual flow often becomes more obvious one hundred twelve It must be added that especially among the lower social classes the primitive belief of the savage that coitus during menstruation is bad for the man still persists Ploss and Bartels mention that among the peasants in some parts of Germany where it is believed that impregnation is impossible during menstruation coitus at that time would be frequent were it not thought dangerous for the man one hundred thirteen It has also been a common belief both in ancient and modern times that coitus during menstruation engenders monsters one hundred fourteen Notwithstanding all the obstacles that are thus placed in the way of coitus during menstruation there is nevertheless good reason to believe that the first coitus very frequently takes place at this point of least psychic resistance When still a student I was struck by the occurrence of cases in which seduction took place during the menstrual flow though at that time they seemed to me inexplicable except as evidencing brutality on the part of the seducer Negrier one hundred fifteen in the lying in wards of the Hotel Dieu at Angers constantly found that the women from the country who came there pregnant as the result of a single coitus had been impregnated at or near the menstrual epoch more especially when the period coincided with a feast day as saint John s Day or Christmas Whatever doubt may exist as to the most frequent state of the sexual emotions during the period of menstruation there can be no doubt whatever that immediately before and immediately after very commonly at both times this varying slightly in different women there is usually a marked heightening of actual desire It is at this period and sometimes during the menstrual flow that masturbation may take place in women who at other times have no strong auto erotic impulse The only women who do not show this heightening of sexual emotion seem to be those in whom sexual feelings have not yet been definitely called into consciousness or the small minority usually suffering from some disorder of sexual or general health in whom there is a high degree of sexual anaesthesia one hundred sixteen The majority of authorities admit a heightening of sexual emotion before or after the menstrual crisis See e g Krafft Ebing who places it at the post menstrual period Psychopathia Sexualis Eng translation of tenth edition p twenty seven Adler states that sexual feeling is increased before during and after menstruation Die Mangelhafte Geschlechtsempfindung des Weibes nineteen oh four p eighty eight Kossmann Senator and Kaminer Health and Disease in Relation to Marriage I two hundred forty nine advises intercourse just after menstruation or even during the latter days of the flow as the period when it is most needed Guyot says that the eight days after menstruation are the period of sexual desire in women Breviaire de l Amour Experimentale p one hundred forty four Harry Campbell investigated the periodicity of sexual desire in healthy women of the working classes in a series of cases by inquiries made of their husbands who were patients at a London hospital People of this class are not always skilful in observation and the method adopted would permit many facts to pass unrecorded it is therefore noteworthy that only in one third of the cases had no connection between menstruation and sexual feeling been observed in the other two thirds sexual feeling was increased either before after or during the flow or at all of these times the proportion of cases in which sexual feeling was increased before the flow to those in which it was increased after was as three to two H Campbell Nervous Organization of Men and Women p two hundred three Even this elementary fact of the sexual life has however been denied and strange to say by two women doctors doctor Mary Putnam Jacobi of New York who furnished valuable contributions to the physiology of menstruation wrote some years ago in a paper on The Theory of Menstruation in reference to the question of the connection between oestrus and menstruation Neither can any such rhythmical alternation of sexual instinct be demonstrated in women as would lead to the inference that the menstrual crisis was an expression of this i e of oestrus doctor Elizabeth Blackwell again in her book on The Human Element in Sex asserts that the menstrual flow itself affords complete relief for the sexual feelings in women like sexual emissions during sleep in men and thus practically denies the prevalence of sexual desire in the immediately post menstrual period when on such a theory sexual feeling should be at its minimum It is fair to add that doctor Blackwell s opinion is merely the survival of a view which was widely held a century ago when various writers Bordeu Roussel Duffieux J Arnould et cetera as Icard has pointed out regarded menstruation as a device of Providence for safeguarding the virginity of women FOOTNOTES seventy five Thaddeus L Bolton Rhythm American Journal of Psychology January eighteen ninety four seventy six It is scarcely necessary to warn the reader that this statement does not prejudge the question of the inheritance of acquired characters although it fits in with Semon s Mnemic theory We can however very well suppose that the organism became adjusted to the rhythms of its environment by a series of congenital variations Or it might be held on the basis of Weismann s doctrine that the germ plasm has been directly modified by the environment seventy seven Thus the Papuans in some districts believe that the first menstruation is due

This is by no means true of European women only Thus we read in an Arabic book The Perfumed Garden that women have an aversion to coitus during menstruation On the other hand the old Hindoo physician Susruta appears to have stated that a tendency to run after men is one of the signs of menstruation one hundred nine The actual period of the menstrual flow corresponds in Heape s terminology to the congestive stage or pro oestrum in female animals the oestrus or period of sexual desire immediately follows the pro oestrum and is the direct result of it See Heape The Sexual Season of Mammals

menstruation Haig remarks that he has found a tendency for high pressure to be accompanied by increased sexual appetite Uric Acid sixth edition p one hundred fifty five one hundred eleven Sir W F Wade however remarked some years ago in his Ingleby Lectures Lancet June five eighteen eighty six It is far from exceptional to find that there is an extreme enhancement of concupiscence in the immediate precatamenial period and adds I am satisfied that evidence is obtainable that in some instances ardor is at its maximum during the actual period and suspect that cases occur in which it is almost if not entirely limited to that time Long ago however the genius of Haller had noted the same fact More recently Icard La Femme Chapter VI and elsewhere e g p one hundred twenty five has brought forward much evidence in confirmation of this view It may be added that there is considerable significance in the fact that the erotic hallucinations which are not infrequently experienced by women under the influence of nitrous oxide gas are more likely to appear at the monthly period than at any other time D W Buxton Anesthetics eighteen ninety two p sixty one one hundred twelve Gehrung considers that in healthy young girls amorous sensations are normal during menstruation and in some women persist during this period throughout life More usually however as menstrual period after menstrual period recurs without the natural interruption of pregnancy the feeling abates and gives place to sensations of discomfort or pain He ascribes this to the vital tissues being sapped of more blood than can be replaced in the intervals The vital powers being thus kept in abeyance the amative sensations are either not developed or destroyed This superadded by the usual moral and religious teachings is amply

5719-41217-0013	train-other-500	it was an ignored or unknown fact Of recent years however many writers especially alienists have stated their conviction that sexual desire in men tends to be heightened at approximately monthly intervals though they have not always been able to give definite evidence in support of their statements

5719-41217-0021	train-other-500	and with so powerful a rhythm already stamped upon its nervous organization to be peculiarly apt to display a menstrual rhythm under the stress of abnormal conditions

5719-41217-0022	train-other-500	I am able to present a case in which such a periodicity seems to be indicated It is that of a gentleman who suffered severely for some years before his death from valvular disease of the heart with a tendency to pulmonary congestion and attacks of cardiac asthma

none	none	 The periodicity of a case of hemicrania has been studied in detail by D Fraser Harris Edinburgh Medical Journal July nineteen oh two But the cycle in these cases is not always or even usually of a menstrual type It is now possible to turn to an investigation which although of very limited extent serves to place the question of a male menstrual cycle for the first time on a sound basis If there is such a cycle analogous to menstruation in women it must be a recurring period of nervous erethism and it must be demonstrably accompanied by greater sexual activity In the American Journal of Psychology for eighteen eighty eight mister Julius Nelson afterward Professor of Biology at the Rutgers College of Agriculture New Brunswick published a study of dreams in which he recorded the results of detailed observations of his dreams and also of seminal emissions during sleep by him termed gonekbole or ecbole during a period of something over two years mister Nelson found that both dreams and ecboles fell into a physiological cycle of twenty eight days The climax of maximum dreaming as determined by the number of words in the dream record and the climax of maximum ecbole fell at the same point of the cycle the ecbolic climax being more distinctly marked than the dream climax The question of cyclic physiological changes is considerably complicated by our uncertainty regarding the precise length of the cycle we may expect to find Nelson finds a twenty eight day cycle satisfactory Perry Coste as we shall see accepts a strictly lunar cycle of two hundred ninety one two days Fliess has argued that in both women and men many physiological facts fall into a cycle of twenty three days which he calls male the twenty eight day cycle being female W Fliess Die Beziehungen zwischen Nase und weiblichen Geschlechts Organen eighteen ninety seven pp one hundred thirteen et seq Although Fliess brings forward a number of minutely observed cases I cannot say that I am yet convinced of the reality of this twenty three day cycle It is somewhat curious however that at the same time as Fliess though in apparent independence and from a different point of view another worker also suggested that there is a twenty three day physiological cycle John Beard The Span of Gestation and the Cause of Birth Jena eighteen ninety seven Beard approaches the question from the embryological standpoint and argues that there is what he terms an ovulation unit of about two hundred thirty one two days in the interval from the end of one menstruation to the beginning of the next Two ovulation units make up one critical unit and the length of pregnancy according to Beard is always a multiple of the critical unit in man the gestation period amounts to six critical units These attempts to prove a new physiological cycle deserve careful study and further investigation The possibility of such a cycle should be borne in mind but at present we are scarcely entitled to accept it So far as I am aware Professor Nelson s very interesting series of observations which for the first time placed the question of a menstrual rhythm in men on a sound and workable basis have not directly led to any further observations I am however in possession of a much more extended series of ecbolic observations completed before Nelson s paper was published although the results have only been calculated at a comparatively recent date I now propose to present a summary of these observations and consider how far they confirm Nelson s conclusions These observations cover no less a period than twelve years between the ages of seventeen and twenty nine the subject W K being a student and afterward schoolmaster leading on the whole a chaste life The records were faithfully made throughout the whole of this long period Here if anywhere should be material for the construction of a menstrual rhythm on an ecbolic basis While the results are in many respects instructive it can scarcely perhaps be said that they absolutely demonstrate a monthly cycle When summated in a somewhat similar manner to that adopted by Nelson in his ecbolic observations it is not difficult to regard the maximum which is reached on the nineteenth to twenty first days of the summated physiological month as a real menstrual ecbolic climax for no other three consecutive days at all approach these in number of ecboles while there is a marked depression occurring four days earlier on the sixteenth day of the month If however we split up the curve by dividing the period of twelve years into two nearly equal periods the earlier of about seven years and the latter of about four years and summate these separately the two curves do not present any parallel as regards the menstrual cycle It scarcely seems to me therefore that these curves present any convincing evidence in this case of a monthly ecbolic cycle and therefore I refrain from reproducing them although they seem to suggest such a cycle Nor is there any reason to suppose that by adopting a different cycle of thirty days or of twenty three days any more conclusive results would be obtained It seems however when we look at these curves more closely that they are not wholly without significance If I am justified in concluding that they scarcely demonstrate a monthly cycle it may certainly be added that they show a rudimentary tendency for the ecboles to fall into a fortnightly rhythm and a very marked and unmistakable tendency to a weekly rhythm The fortnightly rhythm is shown in the curve for the earlier period but is somewhat disguised in the curve for the total period because the first climax is spread over two days the seventh and eighth of the month If we readjust the curve for the total period by presenting the days in pairs the fortnightly tendency is more clearly brought out Chart I A more pronounced tendency still is traceable to a weekly rhythm This is indeed the most unquestionable fact brought out by these curves All the maxima occur on Saturday or Sunday with the minima on Tuesday Wednesday Thursday or Friday This very pronounced weekly rhythm will serve to swamp more or less completely any monthly rhythm on a twenty eight day basis Although here probably seen in an exaggerated form it is almost certainly a characteristic of the ecbolic curve generally one hundred twenty three I have been told by several young men and women especially those who work hard during the week that Saturday and especially Sunday afternoon are periods when the thoughts spontaneously go in an erotic direction and at this time there is a special tendency to masturbation or to spontaneous sexual excitement It is on Friday Saturday Sunday and Monday according to Guerry s tables one hundred twenty four that the fewest suicides are committed Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday with however a partial fall on Wednesday those on which most suicides are committed so that there would appear to be an antagonism between sexual activity and the desire to throw off life It also appears in the reports of the Bavarian factory inspectors that accidents in factories have a tendency to occur chiefly at the beginning of the week and toward the end rather than in the middle one hundred twenty five Even growth as Fleischmann has shown in the case of children tends to fall into weekly cycles It is evident that the nervous system is profoundly affected by the social influences resulting from the weekly cycle The analysis of this series of ecbolic curves may thus be said to recall the suggestion of Laycock that the menstrual cycle is really made up of four weekly cycles the periodic unit according to Laycock being three and one half days I think it would however be more correct to say that the menstrual cycle perhaps originally formed with reference to the influence of the moon on the sexual and social habits of men and other animals tends to break up by a process of segmentation into fortnightly and weekly cycles If we are justified in assuming that there is a male menstrual cycle we must conclude that in such a case as that just analyzed the weekly rhythm has become so marked as almost entirely to obliterate the larger monthly rhythm However constituted there seems little doubt that a physiological weekly cycle really exists This was indeed very clearly indicated many years ago by the observations of Edward Smith who showed that there are weekly rhythms in pulse respiration temperature carbonic acid evolution urea and body weight Sunday being the great day of repair and increase of weight one hundred twenty six In an appendix to this volume I am able to present the results of another long series of observations of nocturnal ecbolic manifestations carried out by mister Perry Coste who has elaborately calculated the results and has convinced himself that on the basis of a strictly lunar month thus abolishing the disturbing influence of the weekly rhythm which in his case also appears a real menstrual rhythm may be traced one hundred twenty seven It does not appear to me however even yet that a final answer to the question whether a menstrual sexual rhythm occurs in men can be decisively given in the affirmative That such a cycle will be proved in many cases seems to me highly probable but before this can be decisively affirmed it is necessary that a much larger number of persons should be induced to carry out on themselves the simple but protracted series of observations that are required Since the first edition of this volume appeared numerous series of ecbolic records have reached me from different parts of the world The most notable of these series comes from a professional man of scientific training who has for the past six years lived in different parts of India where the record was kept Though the record extends over nearly six years there are two breaks in it due to a visit to England and to loss of interest Both involuntary and voluntary discharges are included in the record The involuntary discharges occurred during sleep usually with an erotic dream in which the subject invariably awaked and frequently made an effort to check the emission The voluntary discharges in most cases commenced during sleep or in the half waking state deliberate masturbation when fully awake was comparatively rare The proportion of involuntary to more or less voluntary ecboles was about three to one A third kind of sexual manifestation of frequency intermediate between the other two forms is also included in which a high degree of erethism is induced during the half waking state culminating in an orgasm in which the power of preventing discharge has been artificially acquired The subject E M was thirty two years of age when the record began He belongs to a healthy family and is himself physically sound five feet six inches in height but weight low due to rickets in infancy In early life he stammered badly his temperament is emotional and self conscious while his work is unusually exacting and he lives for most of the year in a very trying climate As a boy he was very religious and has always felt obliged to resist sexual vice to the utmost though there have been occasional lapses As regards lunar periodicity E M has summated his results in a curve after the same manner as mister Perry Coste beginning with the new moon The periods covered include fifty four lunar months and the total number of discharges is one hundred seventy six the average frequency is about three per month of twenty eight days The curve for the most part zigzags between a frequency of four and nine but on the twenty fourth day it falls to one and then rises uninterruptedly to a height of eleven on the twenty seventh day falling to two on the next day Whether a really menstrual rhythm is thus indicated I do not undertake to decide but I am inclined to agree with E M himself that there is no definite evidence of it It looks to me he writes as if the only real rhythm putting aside the annual cycle will be found to be the average period between the ecboles varying in different persons but in my case about nine and one eighth days May not the ecbolic period in men be compared to the menstrual period in women and be an example of the greater katabolic activity of men There is the period of tumescence and the ecbole constituting the detumescence The week end holiday would hasten the detumescence but about every third week end there would tend to be delay to enable the system to get back into its regulation nine or ten days stride This might possibly be the explanation of the curves The recent emissions were nearly all involuntary during sleep Age may have something to do with the change in character E M s curves frequently show the influence of weekly periodicity in the tendency to ecbole on Sunday or sometimes on Saturday or Monday In recent years there has been some tendency for this climax to be thrown towards the middle of the week but on the whole Wednesday is the point of lowest frequency In another case the subject A N who has spent nearly all his life in the State of Indiana has kept a record of sexual manifestations between the ages of thirty and thirty four The data which cover four years have not been sent to me in a form which enables the possibility of a monthly curve to be estimated but A N who has himself arranged the data on a lunar monthly basis considers that a monthly curve is thus revealed My memoranda he writes show that discharges occur most frequently on the first second and third days after new moon There is also another period on the fourteenth and fifteenth which might indicate a semi lunar rhythm The days of minimum discharge are the seventh eighth twenty second and twenty third It may be added that the yearly average of ecbolic manifestations varying between fifty and fifty five comes out as fifty two or exactly one per week A weekly periodicity is very definitely shown by A N s data Sunday once more stands at the head of the week as regards frequency in this case very decisively The figures are as follows Sun Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat forty eight twenty one twenty four thirty five twenty eight twenty six twenty seven In another case which has reached me from the United States the data are slighter but deserve note as the subject is a trained psychologist and I quote the case in his own words Here it will be seen there appears to be a tendency for the ecbolic cycle to cover a period of about six weeks In this case also there is a tendency for the climax to occur about Saturday or Sunday X is thirty eight years old unmarried fair health pretty good heredity university trained and engaged in academic pursuits He thinks he may have completed puberty at about thirteen though he has no proof that he was in the full possession of his sex powers until he was fifteen years three months old when he had his first emission His sex life has been normal He masturbated somewhat when he slept with other boys or men during early manhood but not to excess During the autumn of eighteen eighty nine when twenty eight years of age he observed that at certain times he had an itching feeling about the testicles that he felt slightly irritable that the penis erected with the slightest provocation and that this peculiar feeling usually passed away with a nightly emission Indeed so regular was the matter that he usually wore a loin garment at these times to prevent the semen getting on the bedding This peculiar feeling ordinarily continued for two or three days He recalls at these times that he felt that he would like to wrestle with some one for there seemed to be a muscular tension These states returned with apparent regularity and the intervals seemed to be about six weeks though no effort was made to measure the periods until eighteen ninety three The following notes are taken from the diaries of X Thursday December twenty nine eighteen ninety two The peculiar feeling This is the only entry Thursday February nine eighteen ninety three The peculiar feeling The diary notes that X awoke nights to find erections and that the feeling continued until Sunday night following when there was an emission Friday March twenty seven eighteen ninety three The peculiar feeling The diary notes that there was an emission the next night and that the feeling disappeared Wednesday May three eighteen ninety three The peculiar feeling The diary notes that it continued until Saturday night when X had sexual relations and that it then disappeared Wednesday June fourteen eighteen ninety three The peculiar feeling The diary states that the next night X had an emission and the disappearance of the feeling Thursday July twenty seven eighteen ninety three The peculiar feeling The diary notes that it was apparent at about three o clock that afternoon That night at ten o clock X had sexual intercourse and the feeling was not noted the next day Friday September eight eighteen ninety three The peculiar feeling Continued until Tuesday the eleventh and then disappeared No sexual intercourse and no nightly emission Wednesday October twenty five eighteen ninety three The peculiar feeling Continued until Saturday night when there was a nightly emission Saturday December nine eighteen ninety three The peculiar feeling Continued until Monday night when there was sexual relations It will be noted that the intervals observed were of about six weeks duration excepting one that from September to October when it was nearly seven weeks These observations were not recorded after eighteen ninety three X thinks that in eighteen ninety four the intervals were longer an opinion which is based on the fact that for a period of six months he had no sexual intercourse and no nightly emissions The times during this six months when he had the peculiar feeling the sensation was so slight as to be scarcely noted In eighteen ninety five the feeling seemed more pronounced than ever before and X thinks that it may have recurred as often as once a month In eighteen ninety six eighteen ninety seven and eighteen ninety eight the intervals he thinks lengthened at times he thought wholly disappeared During eighteen ninety nine while they did not recur often when they did come the sensation was pronounced although the emission was less common There was a peculiar heavy feeling about the testicles and a marked tendency towards erection of the penis especially at night time while sleeping X often awoke to find a tense erection Moreover these feelings usually continued a week one In general X is of the opinion that as he grows older these intervals lengthen though this inference is not based on recorded data two He notes that a discharge through sexual intercourse or in sleep invariably brings the peculiar feeling to a close for the time being three He notes that sexual intercourse at the time stops it but when there has been sexual intercourse within a week or ten days of the time based upon the observations of eighteen ninety three that it had no tendency to check the feeling In another case that of F C an Irish farmer born in Waterford the data are still more meagre though the periodicity is stated to be very pronounced He is chaste steady with occasional lapses from strict sobriety healthy and mentally normal living a regular open air life far from the artificial stimuli of towns The observations refer to a period when he was from twenty to twenty seven years of age During this period nocturnal emissions occurred at regular intervals of exactly a month They were ushered in by fits of irritability and depression and usually occurred in dreamless sleep The discharges were abundant and physically weakening but they relieved the psychic symptoms though they occasioned mental distress since F C is scrupulous in a religious sense and also apprehensive of bad constitutional effects the result of reading alarmist quack pamphlets In another case known to me a young man leading a chaste life experienced crises of sexual excitement every ten to fourteen days the crisis lasting for several days Finally an interesting contribution to this subject suggested by this Study has been made and published in the proceedings of the Amsterdam International Congress of Psychology in nineteen oh seven by the well known Amsterdam neurologist and psychologist doctor L S A M Von Roemer under the title Ueber das Verhaeltniss zwischen Mondalter und Sexualitaet Von Roemer s data are made up not of nocturnal involuntary emissions but of the voluntary acts of sexual intercourse of an unmarried man during a period of four years Von Roemer believes that these to a much greater extent than those of a married man would be liable to periodic influence if such exist On making a curve of exact lunar length similarly to Perry Coste he finds that there are every month two maxima and two minima in a way that approximately resemble Perry Coste s curve The main point in Von Roemer s results is however the correspondence that he finds with the actual lunar phases the chief maximum occurs at the time of the full moon and the secondary maximum at the time of the new moon the minima being at the first and fourth quarters He hazards no theory in explanation of this coincidence but insists on the need for further observations It will be seen that A N s results ante p one hundred seventeen seem in the main to correspond to Von Roemer s FOOTNOTES one hundred

changes in the human organism especially connected with the sexual function is a statement that has been made by physiologists and others from time to time and the statement has even reached the poets who have frequently declared that spring is the season of love Thus sixty years ago Laycock an acute pioneer in the investigation of the working of the human organism brought together in a chapter on The Periodic Movements in the Reproductive Organs of Woman in his Nervous Diseases of Women eighteen forty pp sixty one seventy much interesting evidence to show that the system undergoes changes about the vernal and autumnal equinoxes and that these changes are largely sexual Edward Smith also a notable pioneer in this field of human periodicity and indeed the first to make definite observations on a number of points bearing on it sums up in his remarkable book Health and Disease as Influenced by Daily Seasonal and Other Cyclical Changes in the Human System eighteen sixty one to the effect that season is a more powerful influence on the system than temperature or atmospheric pressure in the early and middle parts of spring every function of the body is in its highest degree of efficiency while autumn is essentially a period of change from the minimum toward the maximum of vital conditions He found that in April and May most carbonic acid is evolved there being then a progressive diminution to September and then a progressive increase the respiratory rate also fell from a maximum in April to a minimum maintained at exactly the same level throughout August September October and November spring was found to be the season of maximum autumn of minimum muscular power sensibility to tactile and temperature impressions was also greater in spring Kulischer studying the sexual customs of various human races concluded that in primitive times only at two special seasons at spring and in harvest time did pairing take place and that when pairing ceased to be strictly confined to these periods its symbolical representation was still so confined even among the civilized nations of Europe He further argued that the physiological impulse was only felt at these periods Kulischer Die geschlechtliche Zuchtwahl bei den Menschen in der Urzeit Zeitschrift fuer Ethnologie eighteen seventy six pp one hundred fifty two and one hundred fifty seven Cohnstein Ueber Praedilectionszeiten bei Schwangerschaft Archiv fuer Gynaekologie eighteen seventy nine also suggested that women sometimes only conceive at certain periods of the year Wiltshire who made various interesting observations regarding the physiology of menstruation wrote Many years ago I concluded that every women had a law peculiar to herself which governed the times of her bringing forth and conceiving that she was more prone to bring forth at certain epochs than at others and subsequent researches have established the accuracy of the forecast He further stated his belief in a primordial seasonal aptitude for procreation the impress of which still remains and to some extent governs the breeding times of humanity A Wiltshire Lectures on the Comparative Physiology of Menstruation British Medical Journal March eighteen eighty three pp five hundred two et cetera Westermarck in a chapter of his History of Human Marriage dealing with the question of A Human Pairing Season in Primitive Times brings forward evidence showing that spring or rather early summer is the time for increase of the sexual instinct and argues that this is a survival of an ancient pairing season spring he points out is a season of want rather than abundance for a frugivorous species but when men took to herbs roots and animal food spring became a time of abundance and suitable for the birth of children He thus considers that in man as in lower animals the times of conception are governed by the times most suitable for birth Rosenstadt as we shall see later also believes that men to day have inherited a physiological custom of procreating at a certain epoch and he thus accounts for the seasonal changes in the birthrate Heape who also believes that at one period of its existence the human species had a special breeding season follows Wiltshire in suggesting that there is some reason to believe that the human female is not always in a condition to breed W Heape Menstruation and Ovulation of Macacus rhesus Philosophical Transactions eighteen ninety seven id The Sexual Season of Mammals Quarterly Journal Microscopical Science nineteen hundred Except however in one important respect with which we shall presently have to deal few attempts have been made to demonstrate any annual organic sexual rhythm The supposition of such annual cycle is usually little more than a deduction from the existence of the well marked seasonal sexual rhythm in animals Most of the higher animals breed only once or twice a year and at such a period that the young are born when food is most plentiful At other periods the female is incapable of breeding and without sexual desires while the male is either in the same condition or in a condition of latent sexuality Under the influence of domestication animals tend to lose the strict periodicity of the wild condition and become apt for breeding at more frequent intervals Thus among dogs in the wild state the bitch only experiences heat once a year in the spring Among domesticated dogs there is not only the spring period of heat early in the year but also an autumn period about six months later the primitive period however remains the most important one and the best litters of pups are said to be produced in the spring The mare is in season in spring and summer sheep take the ram in autumn one hundred twenty eight Many of the menstruating monkeys also whether or not sexual desire is present throughout the year only conceive in spring and in autumn Almost any time of the year may be an animal s pairing season this season being apparently in part determined by the economic conditions which will prevail at birth While it is essential that animals should be born during the season of greatest abundance it is equally essential that pairing which involves great expenditure of energy should also take place at a season of maximum physical vigor As an example of the sexual history of an animal through the year I may quote the following description by doctor A W Johnstone of the habits of the American deer Our common American deer in winter time is half starved for lack of vegetation in the woods the low temperature snow and ice make his conditions of life harder for lack of the proper amount of food whereby he becomes an easier prey to carnivorous animals He has difficulty even in preserving life In spring he sheds his winter coat and is provided with a suit of lighter hair and while this is going on the male grows antlers for defence The female about this time is far along in pregnancy and when the antlers are fully grown she drops the fawn When the fawns are dropped vegetation is plentiful and lactation sets in During this time the male is kept fully employed in getting food and guarding his more or less helpless family As the season advances the vegetation increases and the fawn begins to eat grass When the summer heat commences the little streams begin to dry up and the animal once more has difficulty in supporting life because of the enervating heat the effect of drought on the vegetation and the distance which has to be traveled to get water therefore fully ten months in each year the deer has all he can do to live without extra exertion incident to rutting Soon after the autumn rains commence vegetation becomes more luxurious the antlers of the male and new suits of hair for both are fully grown heat of the summer is gone food and drink are plentiful everywhere the fawns are weaned and both sexes are in the very finest condition Then and then only in the whole year comes the rut which to them as to most other animals means an unwonted amount of physical exercise besides the everyday runs for life from their natural enemies and an unusual amount of energy is used up If a doe dislikes the attention of a special buck miles of racing result If jealous males meet furious battles take place The strain on both sexes could not possibly be endured at any other season of the year With approach of cold weather climatic deprivations and winter dangers commence and rut closes In all wild animals rut occurs only when the climatic and other conditions favor the highest physical development This law holds good in all wild birds for it is then only that they can stand the strain incident to love making The common American crow is a very good study In the winter he travels around the ricefields of the South leading a tramp s existence in a country foreign to him and to which he goes only to escape the rigors of the northern climate For several weeks in the spring he goes about the fields gathering up the worms and grubs After his long flight from the South he experiences several weeks of an almost ideal existence his food is plentiful he becomes strong and hearty and then he turns to thoughts of love In the pairing season he does more work than at any other time in the year fantastic dances racing and chasing after the females and savage fights with rivals He endures more than would be possible in his ordinary physical state Then come the care of the young and the long flights for water and food during the drought of the summer After the molt autumn finds him once more in flock and with the first frosts he is off again to the South In the wild state rut is the capstone of perfect physical condition A W Johnstone The Relation of Menstruation to the other Reproductive Functions American Journal of Obstetrics vol xxxii eighteen ninety five Wiltshire Lectures on the Comparative Physiology of Menstruation British Medical Journal March eighteen eighty eight and Westermarck History of Human Marriage Chapter II enumerate the pairing season of a number of different animals With regard to the breeding seasons of monkeys little seems to be positively known Heape made special inquiries with reference to the two species whose sexual life he investigated He was informed that Semnopithecus entellus breeds twice a year in April and in October He accepts Aitcheson s statement that the Macacus rhesus in Simla copulates in October and adds that in the very different climate of the plains it appears to copulate in May He concludes that the breeding season varies greatly in dependence on climate but believes that the breeding season is always preserved and that it affects the sexual aptitude of the male He could not make his monkeys copulate during February or March but is unable to say whether or not sexual intercourse is generally admitted outside the breeding season He quotes the observation of Breschet that monkeys copulate during pregnancy In primitive human races we very frequently trace precisely the same influence of the seasonal impulse as may be witnessed in the higher animals although among human races it does not always result that the children are born at the time of the greatest plenty and on account of the development of human skill such a result is not necessary Thus doctor Cook found among the Eskimo that during the long winter nights the secretions are diminished muscular power is weak and the passions are depressed Soon after the sun appears a kind of rut affects the young population They tremble with the intensity of sexual passion and for several weeks much of the time is taken up with courtship and love Hence the majority of the children are born nine months later when the four months of perpetual night are beginning A marked seasonal periodicity of this kind is not confined to the Arctic regions We may also find it in the tropics In Cambodia Mondiere has found that twice a year in April and September men seem to experience a veritable rut and will sometimes even kill women who resist them one hundred twenty nine These two periods spring and autumn the season for greeting the appearance of life and the season for reveling in its final fruition seem to be everywhere throughout the world the most usual seasons for erotic festivals In classical Greece and Rome in India among the Indians of North and South America spring is the most usual season while in Africa the yam harvest of autumn is the season chiefly selected There are of course numerous exceptions to this rule and it is common to find both seasons observed Taking indeed a broad view of festivals throughout the world we may say that there are four seasons when they are held the winter solstice when the days begin to lengthen and primitive man rejoices in the lengthening and seeks to assist it one hundred thirty the vernal equinox the period of germination and the return of life the summer solstice when the sun reaches its height and autumn the period of fruition of thankfulness and of repose But it is rarely that we find a people seriously celebrating more than two of these festival seasons In Australia according to Mueller as quoted by Ploss and Bartels marriage and conception take place during the warm season when there is greatest abundance of food and to some extent is even confined to that period Oldfield and others state that the Australian erotic festivals take place only in spring Among some tribes Mueller adds such as the Watschandis conception is inaugurated by a festival called kaaro which takes place in the warm season at the first new moon after the yams are ripe The leading feature of this festival is a moonlight dance representing the sexual act symbolically With their spears regarded as the symbols of the male organ the men attack bushes which represent the female organs They thus work themselves up to a state of extreme sexual excitement one hundred thirty one Among the Papuans of New Guinea also according to Miklucho Macleay conceptions chiefly occur at the end of harvest and Guise describes the great annual festival of the year which takes place at the time of the yam and banana harvest when the girls undergo a ceremony of initiation and marriages are effected one hundred thirty two In Central Africa says Sir H H Johnston in his Central Africa sexual orgies are seriously entered into at certain seasons of the year but he neglects to mention what these seasons are The people of New Britain according to Weisser as quoted by Ploss and Bartels carefully guard their young girls from the young men At certain times however a loud trumpet is blown in the evening and the girls are then allowed to go away into the bush to mix freely with the young men In ancient Peru according to an account derived from a pastoral letter of Archbishop Villagomez of Lima in December when the fruit of the paltay is ripe a festival was held preceded by a five days fast During the festival which lasted six days and six nights men and women met together in a state of complete nudity at a certain spot among the gardens and all raced toward a certain hill Every man who caught up with a woman in the race was bound at once to have intercourse with her Very instructive from our present point of view is the account given by Dalton of the festivals of the various Bengal races Thus the Hos a Kolarian tribe of Bengal are a purely agricultural people and the chief festival of the year with them is the magh parah It is held in the month of January when the granaries are full of grain and the people to use their own expression full of devilry It is the festival of the harvest home the termination of the year s toil and is always held at full moon The festival is a saturnalia when all rules of duty and decorum are forgotten and the utmost liberty is allowed to women and girls who become like bacchantes The people believe that at this time both men and women become overcharged with vitality and that a safety valve is absolutely necessary The festival begins with a religious sacrifice made by the village priest or elders and with prayers for the departed and for the vouchsafing of seasonable rain and good crops The religious ceremonies over the people give themselves up to feasting and to drinking the home made beer the preparation of which from fermented rice is one of a girl s chief accomplishments The Ho population wrote Dalton are at other seasons quiet and reserved in manner and in their demeanor toward women gentle and decorous even in their flirtations they never transcend the bounds of decency The girls though full of spirits and somewhat saucy have innate notions of propriety that make them modest in demeanor though devoid of all prudery and of the obscene abuse so frequently heard from the lips of common women in Bengal they appear to have no knowledge They are delicately sensitive under harsh language of any kind and never use it to others and since their adoption of clothing they are careful to drape themselves decently as well as gracefully but they throw all this aside during the magh feast Their nature appears to undergo a temporary change Sons and daughters revile their parents in gross language and parents their children men and women become almost like animals in the indulgence of their amorous propensities They enact all that was ever portrayed by prurient artists in a bacchanalian festival or pandean orgy and as the light of the sun they adore and the presence of numerous spectators seems to be no restraint on their indulgence it cannot be expected that chastity is preserved when the shades of night fall on such a scene of licentiousness and debauchery While however thus representing the festival as a mere debauch Dalton adds that relationships formed at this time generally end in marriage There is also a flower festival in April and May of religious nature but the dances at this festival are quieter in character one hundred thirty three In Burmah the great festival of the year is the full moon of October following the Buddhist Lent season which is also the wet season during which there is no sexual intercourse The other great festival is the New Year in March one hundred thirty four In classical times the great festivals were held at the same time as in northern and modern Europe The brumalia took place in midwinter when the days were shortest and the rosalia according to early custom in May or June and at a later time about Easter After the establishment of Christianity the Church made constant efforts to suppress this latter festival and it was referred to by an eighth century council as a wicked and reprehensible holiday making These festivals appear to be intimately associated with Dionysus worship and the flower festival of Dionysus as well as the Roman Liberales in honor of Bacchus was celebrated in March with worship of Priapus The festivals of the Delian Apollo and of Artemis both took place during the first week in May and the Roman Bacchanales in October one hundred thirty five The mediaeval Feast of Fools was to a large extent a seasonal orgy licensed by the Church It may be traced directly back through the barbatories of the lower empire to the Roman saturnalia and at Sens the ancient ecclesiastical metropolis of France it was held at about the same time as the saturnalia on the Feast of the Circumcision i e New Year s Day It was not however always held at this time thus at Evreux it took place on the first of May one hundred thirty six The Easter bonfires of northern central Europe the Midsummer saint John s Eve fires of southern central Europe still bear witness to the ancient festivals one hundred thirty seven There is certainly a connection between these bonfires and erotic festivals it is noteworthy that they occur chiefly at the period of spring and early summer which on other grounds is widely regarded as the time for the increase of the sexual instinct while the less frequent period for the bonfires is that of the minor sexual climax Mannhardt was perhaps the first to show how intimately these spring and early summer festivals held with bonfires and dances and the music of violin have been associated with love making and the choice of a mate one hundred thirty eight In spring the first Monday in Lent Quadrigesima and Easter Eve were frequent days for such bonfires In May among the Franks of the Main the unmarried women naked and adorned with flowers danced on the Blocksberg before the men as described by Herbels in the tenth century one hundred thirty nine In the central highlands of Scotland the Beltane fires were kindled on the first of May Bonfires sometimes took place on Halloween October thirty first and Christmas But the great season all over Europe for these bonfires then often held with erotic ceremonial is the summer solstice the twenty threed of June the eve of Midsummer or saint John s Day one hundred forty The Bohemians and other Slavonic races formerly had meetings with sexual license This was so up to the beginning of the sixteenth century on the banks of rivers near Novgorod The meetings took place as a rule the day before the Festival of John the Baptist which in pagan times was that of a divinity known by the name of Jarilo equivalent to Priapus Half a century later a new ecclesiastical code sought to abolish every vestige of the early festivals held on Christmas Day on the Day of the Baptism of Our Lord and on John the Baptist s Day A general feature of all these festivals says Kowalewsky was the prevalence of the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes Among the Ehstonians at the end of the eighteenth century thousands of persons would gather around an old ruined church in the Fellinschen on the Eve of saint John light a bonfire and throw sacrificial gifts into it Sterile women danced naked among the ruins much eating and drinking went on while the young men and maidens disappeared into the woods to do what they would Festivals of this character still take place at the end of June in some districts Young unmarried couples jump barefoot over large fires usually near rivers or ponds Licentiousness is rare one hundred forty one But in many parts of Russia the peasants still attach little value to virginity and even prefer women who have been mothers The population of the Grisons in the sixteenth century held regular meetings not less licentious than those of the Cossacks These were abolished by law Kowalewsky regards all such customs as a survival of early forms of promiscuity one hundred forty two Frazer Golden Bough twod ed nineteen hundred vol iii pp two hundred thirty six three hundred fifty fully describes and discusses the dances bonfires and festivals of spring and summer of Halloween October thirty one and Christmas He also explains the sexual character of these festivals There are clear indications he observes p three hundred five that even human fecundity is supposed to be promoted by the genial heat of the fires It is an Irish belief that a girl who jumps thrice over the midsummer bonfire will soon marry and become the mother of many children and in various parts of France they think that if a girl dances round nine fires she will be sure to marry within a year On the other hand in Lechrain people say that if a young man and woman leaping over the midsummer fire together escape unsmirched the young woman will not become a mother within twelve months the flames have not touched and fertilized her The rule observed in some parts of France and Belgium that the bonfires on the first Sunday in Lent should be kindled by the person who was last married seems to belong to the same class of ideas whether it be that such a person is supposed to receive from or impart to the fire a generative and fertilizing influence The common practice of lovers leaping over the fires hand in hand may very well have originated in a notion that thereby their marriage would be more likely to be blessed with offspring And the scenes of profligacy which appear to have marked the midsummer celebration among the Ehstonians as they once marked the celebration of May Day among ourselves may have sprung not from the mere license of holiday makers but from a crude notion that such orgies were justified if not required by some mysterious bond which linked the life of man to the courses of the heavens at the turning point of the year As regards these primitive festivals although the evidence is scattered and sometimes obscure certain main conclusions clearly emerge In early Europe there were according to Grimm only two seasons sometimes regarded as spring and winter sometimes as spring and autumn and for mythical purposes these seasons were alone available one hundred forty three The appearance of each of these two seasons was inaugurated by festivals which were religious and often erotic in character The Slavonic year began in March at which time there was formerly it is believed a great festival not only in Slavonic but also in Teutonic countries In Northern Germany there were Easter bonfires always associated with mountains or hills The Celtic bonfires were held at the beginning of May while the Teutonic May day or Walpurgisnacht is a very ancient sacred festival associated with erotic ceremonial and regarded by Grimm as having a common origin with the Roman floralia and the Greek dionysia Thus in Europe Grimm concludes there are four different ways of welcoming summer In Sweden and Gothland a battle of winter and summer a triumphal entry of the latter In Schonen Denmark Lower Saxony and England simply May riding or fetching of the May wagon On the Rhine merely a battle of winter and summer without immersion without the pomp of an entry In Franconia Thuringia Meissen Silesia and Bohemia only the carrying out of wintry death no battle no formal introduction of summer Of these festivals the first and second fall in May the third and fourth in March In the first two the whole population take part with unabated enthusiasm in the last two only the lower poorer class Everything goes to prove that the approach of summer was to our forefathers a holy tide welcomed by sacrifice feast and dance and largely governing and brightening the people s life one hundred forty four The early spring festival of March the festival of Ostara the goddess of spring has become identified with the Christian festival of Resurrection just as the summer solstice festival has been placed beneath the patronage of saint John the Baptist but there has been only an amalgamation of closely allied rites for the Christian festival also may be traced back to a similar origin Among the early Arabians the great ragab feast identified by Ewald and Robertson Smith with the Jewish paschal feast fell in the spring or early summer when the camels and other domestic animals brought forth their young and the shepherds offered their sacrifices one hundred forty five Babylonia the supreme early centre of religious and cosmological culture presents a more decisive example of the sex festival The festival of Tammuz is precisely analogous to the European festival of saint John s Day Tammuz was the solar god of spring vegetation and closely associated with Ishtar also an agricultural deity of fertility The Tammuz festival was in the earliest times held toward the summer solstice at the time of the first wheat and barley harvest In Babylonia as in primitive Europe there were only two seasons the festival of Tammuz coming at the end of winter and the beginning of summer was a fast followed by a feast a time of mourning for winter of rejoicing for summer It is part of the primitive function of sacred ritual to be symbolical of natural processes a mysterious representation of natural processes with the object of bringing them about one hundred forty six The Tammuz festival was an appeal to the powers of Nature to exhibit their generative functions its erotic character is indicated not only by the well known fact that the priestesses of Ishtar the Kadishtu or holy ones were prostitutes but by the statements in Babylonian legends concerning the state of the earth during Ishtar s winter absence when the bull the ass and man ceased to reproduce It is evident that the return of spring coincident with the Tammuz festival was regarded as the period for the return of the reproductive instinct even in man one hundred forty seven So that along this line also we are led back to a great procreative festival Thus the great spring festivals were held between March and June frequently culminating in a great orgy on Midsummer s Eve The next great season of festivals in Europe was in autumn The beginning of August was a great festival in Celtic lands and the echoes of it Rhys remarks have not yet died out in Wales one hundred forty eight The beginning of November both in Celtic and Teutonic countries was a period of bonfires one hundred forty nine In Germanic countries especially there was a great festival at the time The Germanic year began at Martinmas November eleventh and the great festival of the year was then held It is the oldest Germanic festival on record and retained its importance even in the Middle Ages There was feasting all night and the cattle that were to be killed were devoted to the gods the goose was associated with this festival one hundred fifty These autumn festivals culminated in the great festival of the winter solstice which we have perpetuated in the celebrations of Christmas and New Year Thus while the two great primitive culminating festivals of spring and autumn correspond exactly as we shall see with the seasons of maximum fecundation even in the Europe of to day the earlier spring March and though less closely autumn November festivals correspond with the periods of maximum spontaneous sexual disturbance as far as I have been able to obtain precise evidence of such disturbance That the maximum of physiological sexual excitement should tend to appear earlier than the maximum of fecundation is a result that might be expected The considerations so far brought forward clearly indicate that among primitive races there are frequently one or two seasons in the year especially spring and autumn during which sexual intercourse is chiefly or even exclusively carried on and they further indicate that these primitive customs persist to some extent even in Europe to day It would still remain to determine whether any such influence affects the whole mass of the civilized population and determines the times at which intercourse or fecundation most frequently takes place This question can be most conveniently answered by studying the seasonal variation in the birthrate calculating back to the time of conception Wargentin in Sweden first called attention to the periodicity of the birthrate in seventeen sixty seven one hundred fifty one The matter seems to have attracted little further attention until Quetelet who instinctively scented unreclaimed fields of statistical investigation showed that in Belgium and Holland there is a maximum of births in February and consequently of conceptions in May and a minimum of births about July with consequent minimum of conceptions in October Quetelet considered that the spring maximum of conceptions corresponded to an increase of vitality after the winter cold He pointed out that this sexual climax was better marked in the country than in towns and accounted for this by the consideration that in the country the winter cold is more keenly felt Later Wappaeus investigated the matter in various parts of northern and southern Europe as well as in Chile and found that there was a maximum of conceptions in May and June attributable to season and in Catholic countries strengthened by customs connected with ecclesiastical seasons This maximum was he found followed by a minimum in September October and November due to gradually increasing exhaustion and the influence of epidemic diseases as well as the strain of harvest work The minimum is reached in the south earlier than in the north About November conceptions again become more frequent and reach the second maximum at about Christmas and New Year This second maximum is very slightly marked in southern countries but strongly marked in northern countries in Sweden the absolute maximum of conceptions is reached in December and is due in the opinion of Wappaeus solely to social causes Villerme reached somewhat similar results Founding his study on seventeen million births he showed that in France it was in April May and June or from the spring equinox to the summer solstice and nearer to the solstice than the equinox that the maximum of fecundations takes place while the minimum of births is normally in July but is retarded by a wet and cold summer in such a manner that in August there are scarcely more births than in July and on the other hand a very hot summer accelerating the minimum of births causes it to fall in June instead of in July one hundred fifty two He also showed that in Buenos Ayres where the seasons are reversed the conception rate follows the reversed seasons and is also raised by epochs of repose of plentiful food and of increased social life Sormani studied the periodicity of conception in Italy and found that the spring maximum in the southern provinces occurs in May and gradually falls later as one proceeds northward until in the extreme north of the peninsula it occurs in July In southern Italy there is only one maximum and one minimum in the north there are two The minimum which follows the spring or summer maximum increases as we approach the south while the minimum associated with the winter cold increases as we approach the north one hundred fifty three Beukemann who studied the matter in various parts of Germany found that seasonal influence was specially marked in the case of illegitimate births The maximum of conceptions of illegitimate children takes place in the spring and summer of Europe generally in Russia it takes place in the autumn and winter when the harvest working months for the population are over and the period of rest and also of minimum deathrate September October and November comes round In Russia the general conception rate has been studied by various investigators Here the maximum number of conceptions is in winter the minimum varying among different elements of the population Looked at more closely there are maxima of conceptions in Russia in January and in April In Russian towns however the maximum number of conceptions occurs in the autumn The special characteristics of the Russian conception rate are held to be due to the prevalence of marriages in autumn and winter one hundred fifty four to the severely observed fasts of spring and to the exhausting harvest work of summer It is instructive to compare the conception rate of Europe with that of a non European country Such a comparison has been made by S A Hill for the Northwest Provinces of India Here the Holi and other erotic festivals take place in spring but spring is not the period when conceptions chiefly take place indeed the prevalence of erotic festivals in spring appears to Hill an argument in favor of those festivals having originated in a colder climate The conceptions show a rise through October and November to a maximum in December and January followed by a steady and prolonged fall to a minimum in September This curve can be accounted for by climatic and economic conditions September is near the end of the long and depressing hot season when malarial influences are rapidly increasing to a maximum the food supply is nearly exhausted and there is the greatest tendency to suicide With October it forms the period of greatest mortality December on the other hand is the month when food is most abundant and it is also a very healthy month one hundred fifty five For a summary of the chief researches into this question see Ploss and Bartels Das Weib also Rosenstadt Zur Frage nach den Ursachen welche die Zahl der Conceptionen et cetera Mittheilungen aus den embryologischen Institute Universitaet Wien second series fasc four eighteen ninety Rosenstadt concludes that man has inherited from animal ancestors a physiological custom which has probably been further favored by climatic and social conditions Primitive man he proceeds had inherited from his ancestors the faculty of only reproducing himself at determined epochs On the arrival of this period of rut fecundation took place on a large scale this being very easy thanks to the promiscuity in which primitive man lived With the development of civilization men give themselves up to sexual relations all the year around but the physiological custom of procreating at a certain epoch has not completely disappeared it remains as a survival of the animal condition and manifests itself in the recrudescence of the number of conceptions during certain months of the year O Rosenbach Bemerkungen ueber das Problem einer Brunstzeit beim Menschen Archiv fuer Rassen und Gesellschafts Biologie Bd III Heft five has also argued in favor of a chief sexual period in the year in man with secondary and even tertiary climaxes in March August and December He finds that in some families for several generations birthdays tend to fall in the same months but his paper is on the whole inconclusive Some years ago Prof J B Haycraft argued on the basis of data furnished by Scotland that the conception rate corresponds to the temperature curve Haycraft Physiological Results of Temperature Variation Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh vol xxix eighteen eighty Temperature he concluded is the main factor regulating the variations in the number of conceptions which occur during the year It increases their number with its elevation and this on an average of zero point five per cent for an elevation of one deg F Whether or not this theory may fit the facts as regards Scotland it is certainly altogether untenable when we take a broader view of the phenomena Recently doctor Paul Gaedeken of Copenhagen has argued in a detailed statistical study La Reaction de l Organisme sous l Influence Physico Chimiques des Agents Meteorologiques Archives d Anthropologie Criminelle Feb nineteen oh nine that the conception rate as well as the periodicity of suicide and allied phenomena is due to the action of the chemical rays on the unpigmented skin in early spring this action being physiologically similar to that of alcohol He seeks thus to account for the marked and early occurrence of such periodic phenomena in Greenland and other northern countries where there is much chemical action owing to the clear air in early spring but little heat This explanation would not cover an autumnal climax the existence of which Gaedeken denies In order to obtain a fairly typical conception curve for Europe and to allow the variations of local habit and custom to some extent to annihilate each other I have summated the figures given by Mayr for about a quarter of a million births in Germany France and Italy one hundred fifty six obtaining a curve Chart two of the conception rate which may be said roughly to be that of Europe generally If we begin at September as the lowest point we find an autumn rise culminating in the lesser maximum of Christmas followed by a minor depression in January and February Then comes the great spring rise culminating in May and followed after June by a rapid descent to the minimum In Canada see e g Report of the Registrar General of the Province of Ontario for nineteen oh four the maximum and minimum of conceptions alike fall later than in Europe the months of maximum conception are June July and August of minimum conception January February and March June is the favorite month for marriage It would be of some interest to know the conception curve for the well to do classes who are largely free from the industrial and social influences which evidently to a great extent control the conception rate It seems probable that the seasonal influence would here be specially well shown The only attempt I have made in this direction is to examine a well filled birthday book The entries show a very high and equally maintained maximum of conceptions throughout April May and June followed by a marked minimum during the next three months and an autumn rise very strongly marked in November There is no December rise As will be seen there is here a fairly exact resemblance to the yearly ecbolic curve of people of the same class The inquiry needs however to be extended to a very much larger number of cases mister John Douglass Brown of Philadelphia has kindly prepared and sent me since the above was written a series of curves showing the annual periodicity of births among the educated classes in the State of Pennsylvania using the statistics as to four thousand sixty six births contained in the Biographical Catalogue of Matriculates of the College of the University of Pennsylvania mister Brown prepared four curves the first covering the earliest period seventeen fifty seven eighteen fifty nine the second the period eighteen sixty eighteen seventy six the third eighteen seventy seven eighteen ninety three while the fourth presented the summated results for the whole period The dates named are those of the entry to classes and not of actual occurrence of birth A very definite and well marked curve is shown and the average number of births not conceptions per day for the whole period is as follows Jan Feb Mar Apr May June July Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec ten point five eleven point four eleven eight point three ten point two ten point five eleven point five twelve point six twelve point three eleven point six twelve eleven point seven There is thus a well marked minimum of conceptions a depression appearing here in each of the three periods separately about the month of July In the second period however which contains the smallest number of births the minimum occurs in September From that low minimum there is steady and unbroken rise up to the chief maximum in November In the first period however the maximum is delayed till January and in the second period it is somewhat diffused There is a tendency to a minor maximum in February specially well marked in the third and most important period and in the first period delayed until March A very curious and perhaps not accidental coincidence might be briefly pointed out before we leave this part of the subject It is found one hundred fifty seven by taking three thousand cases of children dying under one year that among the general population children born in February and September and therefore conceived in May and December appear to possess the greatest vitality and those born in June and therefore conceived in September the least vitality one hundred fifty eight As we have seen May and December are precisely the periods when conceptions in Europe generally are at a maximum and September is precisely the period when they are at a minimum so that if this coincidence is not accidental the strongest children are conceived when there is the strongest tendency to procreate and the feeblest children when that tendency is feeblest Nelson in his study of dreams and their relation to seasonal ecbolic manifestations does not present any yearly ecbolic curve as the two years and a half over which his observations extend scarcely supply a sufficient basis On examining his figures however I find there is a certain amount of evidence of a yearly rhythm There are spring and autumn climaxes throughout in February and in November there is no December rise During one year there is a marked minimum from May to September though it is but slightly traceable in the succeeding year These figures are too uncertain to prove anything but as far as they go they are in fair agreement with the much more extensive record that of W K ante p one hundred thirteen which I have already made use of in discussing the question of a monthly rhythm This record covering nearly twelve years shows a general tendency when the year is divided into four periods November January February April May July August October and the results summated to rise steadily throughout from the minimum in the winter period to the maximum in the autumn period This steady upward progress is not seen in each year taken separately In three years there is a fall in passing from the November January to the February April quarter always followed by a rise in the subsequent quarter in three cases there is a fall in passing from the second to the third quarter again always followed by a rise in the following quarter and in two successive years there is a fall in passing from the third to the fourth quarter If however beginning at the second year we summate the results for each year with those for all previous years a steady rise from season to season is seen throughout If we analyze the data according to the months of the year still more precise and interesting results as shown in the curve Chart three are obtained two maximum points are seen one in spring March one in autumn October or rather August October and each of these maximum points is followed by a steep and sudden descent to the minimum points in April and in December If we compare this result with Perry Coste s also extending over a long series of years we find a marked similarity In both alike there are spring and autumn maxima in both the autumn maximum is the highest and in both also there is an intervening fall In both cases again the maxima are followed by steep descents but while in both the spring maximum occurs in March in Perry Coste s case the second maximum though of precisely similar shape occurs earlier in June September instead of August October In Perry Coste s case also there is an apparently abnormal tendency only shown in the more recent years of the record to an additional maximum in January The records certainly show far more points of agreement than of discrepancy and by their harmony as well with each other as with themselves when the years are taken separately certainly go far to prove that there is a very marked annual rhythm in the phenomena of seminal emissions during sleep or as Nelson has termed it the ecbolic curve We see also that the great yearly organic climax of sexual effervescence corresponds with the period following harvest which throughout the primitive world has been a season of sexual erethism and orgy though those customs have died out of our waking lives they are still imprinted on our nervous texture and become manifest during sleep The fresh records that have reached me since the first edition of this book was published show well marked annual curves though each curve always has some slight personal peculiarities of its own The most interesting and significant is that of E M see ante p one hundred sixteen covering four years It is indicated by the following monthly frequencies summated for the four years Jan Feb Mar Apr May June July Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec sixteen thirteen fourteen twenty two nineteen nineteen twelve twelve fourteen fourteen twelve twenty four E M lives in India April May and June are hot months but not unhealthy and during this season moreover he lives in the hills under favorable conditions getting plenty of outdoor exercise July August and September are nearly as hot but much damper and more trying during these months E M is living in the city and his work is then also more exacting than at other times September is the worst month of all he has a short holiday at the end of it During December January and February the climate is very fine and E M s work is easier It will be seen that his ecbolic curve corresponds to his circumstances and environment although until he analyzed the record he had no idea that any such relationship existed Unfavorable climatic conditions and hard work favorable conditions and lighter work happen to coincide in his life and the former depress the frequency of seminal emissions the latter increase their frequency At the same time the curve is not out of harmony with the northern curves There is what corresponds to a late spring April climax and another still higher late autumn December climax A very interesting point is the general resemblance of the ecbolic curves to the Indian conception curves as set forth by Hill ante p one hundred forty The conception curve is at its lowest point in September and at its highest point in December January and this ecbolic curve follows it except that both the minimum and the maximum are reached a little earlier When compared with the English annual ecbolic curves W K and Perry Coste both spring and autumn maxima fall rather later but all agree in representing the autumn rise as the chief climax The annual curve of A N ante p one hundred seventeen who lives in Indiana U S A also covers four years It presents the usual spring May June in this case and autumn September October climaxes The exact monthly results summated for the four years are given below in order to allow for the irregular lengths of the months I have reduced them to daily averages for convenience treating the four years as one year Jan Feb Mar Apr May June July Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec thirteen nine thirteen twenty twenty three twenty two twenty twenty twenty one twenty three nine sixteen forty two thirty two forty two sixty six seventy four seventy three sixty four sixty four seventy seventy four thirty fifty two In his book on Adolescence Stanley Hall refers to three ecbolic records in his possession all made by men who were doctors of philosophy and all considering themselves normal The best of these records made by a virtuous active and able man covered nearly eight years Stanley Hall thus summarizes the records which are not presented in detail The best of these records averages about three and a half such experiences per month the most frequent being five point fourteen for July and the least frequent two point twenty eight for September for all the years taken together There appears also a slight rise in April and another in November with a fall in December The frequency varies in the different individuals There was no tendency to a monthly cycle In the best case the minimum number for the year was thirty seven and the maximum fifty Fifty nine per cent of all were at an interval of a week or less forty per cent at an interval of from one to four days thirty four per cent at an interval of from eight to seventeen days the longest being forty two days Poor condition overwork and undersleep led to infrequency Early morning was the most common time Normally there was a sense of distinct relief but in low conditions or with over frequency depression G S Hall Adolescence vol i p four hundred fifty three I may add that an anonymous article on Nocturnal Emissions American Journal of Psychology Jan nineteen oh four is evidently a fuller presentation of the first of Stanley Hall s three cases It is the history of a healthy unmarried chaste man who kept a record of his nocturnal emissions and their accompanying dreams from the age of thirty to thirty eight In what American State he lived is not mentioned He was ignorant of the existence of any previous records The yearly average was thirty seven to fifty remaining fairly constant the monthly average was three point forty three I reproduce the total results summated for the months separately and I have worked out the daily average for each month for convenience counting the summated eight years as one year Jan Feb Mar Apr May June July Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec twenty seven twenty seven twenty seven thirty one twenty nine twenty eight thirty six twenty five eighteen twenty seven thirty twenty four eighty seven ninety four eighty seven one point three ninety three ninety three one point sixteen eighty one sixty eighty seven one point zero seventy seven Here as in all the other curves we have been able to consider we may see the usual two points of climax in spring and in autumn the major climax covers April May June and July the minor autumnal climax is confined to November In the light of the evidence which has thus accumulated we may conclude that the existence of an annual ecbolic curve with its spring and autumn climaxes as described in the first edition of this book is now definitely established If we are to believe as these records tend to show that the nocturnal and involuntary voice of the sexual impulse usually speaks at least as loudly in autumn as in spring we are confronted by a certain divergence of the sleeping sexual impulse from the waking sexual instinct as witnessed by the conception curve and also it may be added by the general voice of tradition and indeed of individual feeling which concur on the whole in placing the chief epoch of sexual activity in spring and early summer more especially as regards women one hundred fifty nine It is not impossible to reconcile the contradiction assuming it to be real but I will refrain here from suggesting the various explanations which arise We need a broader basis of facts There are many facts to show that early spring and to a certain extent autumn are periods of visible excitement mainly sexual in character We have already seen that among the Eskimo menstruation and sexual desire occur chiefly in spring but cases are known of healthy women in temperate climes who only menstruate twice a year and in such cases the menstrual epochs appear to be usually in spring and autumn Such at all events was the case in a girl of twenty whose history has been recorded by doctor Mary Wenck of Philadelphia one hundred sixty She menstruated first when fifteen years old Six months later the flow again appeared for the second time and lasted three weeks without cessation Since then for five years she menstruated during March and September only each time for three weeks the flow being profuse but not exhaustingly so without pain or systemic disturbance Examination revealed perfectly normal uterus and ovarian organs Treatment accompanied by sitz baths during the time of month the flow should appear accomplished nothing The semi annual flow continued and the girl seemed in excellent health It is a remarkable fact that as noted by doctor Hamilton Wey at Elmira sexual outbursts among prisoners appear to occur at about March and October Beginning with the middle of February writes doctor Wey in a private letter and continuing for about two months is a season of ascending sexual wave also the latter half of September and the month of October We are now March thirtieth in the midst of a wave According to Chinese medicine it is the spring which awakens human passions In early Greek tradition spring and summer were noted as the time of greatest wantonness In the season of toilsome summer says Hesiod Works and Days xi five hundred sixty nine ninety the goats are fattest wine is best women most wanton and men weakest It was so also in the experience of the Romans Pliny Natural History Bk XII Ch XLIII states that when the asparagus blooms and the cicada sings loudest is the season when women are most amorous but men least inclined to pleasure Paulus AEgineta said that hysteria specially abounds during spring and autumn in lascivious girls and sterile women while more recent observers have believed that hysteria is particularly difficult to treat in autumn Oribasius Synopsis lib i cap six quotes from Rufus to the effect that sexual feeling is most strong in spring and least so in summer Rabelais said that it was in March that the sexual impulse is strongest referring this to the early warmth of spring and that August is the month least favorable to sexual activity Pantagruel liv v Ch XXIX Nipho in his book on love dedicated to Joan of Aragon discussed the reasons why women are more lustful and amorous in summer and men in winter Venette in his Generation de l homme harmonized somewhat conflicting statements with the observation that spring is the season of love for both men and women in summer women are more amorous than men in autumn men revive to some extent but are still oppressed by the heat which sexually has a less depressing effect on women There is probably a real element of truth in this view and both extremes of heat and cold may be regarded as unfavorable to masculine virility It is highly probable that the well recognized tendency of piles to become troublesome in spring and in autumn is due to increased sexual activity Piles are favored by congestion and sexual excitement is the most powerful cause of sudden congestion in the genito anal region Erasmus Darwin called attention to the tendency of piles to recur about the equinoxes Zooenomia Section XXXVI and since his days Gant Bonavia and Cullimore have correlated this periodicity with sexual activity Laycock quoting the opinions of some earlier authorities as to the prevalence of sexual feeling in spring stated that that popular opinion appears to be founded on fact Nervous Diseases of Women p sixty nine I find that many people and perhaps especially women confirm from their own experience the statement that sexual feeling is strongest in spring and summer Wichmann states that pollutions are most common in spring being perhaps the first to make that statement and also nymphomania In the eighteenth century Schurig recorded a case of extreme and life long sexual desire in a woman whose salacity was always at its height towards the festival of saint John Gynaecologia p sixteen A correspondent in the Argentine Republic writes to me that on big estancias where we have a good many shepherds nearly always married or rather I should say living with some woman for our standard of morality is not very high in these parts we always look out for trouble in springtime as it is a very common thing at this season for wives to leave their husbands and go and live with some other man A corresponding tendency has been noted even among children Thus Sanford Bell The Emotion of Love Between the Sexes American Journal Psychology July nineteen oh two remarks The season of the year seems to have its effect upon the intensity of the emotion of sex love among children One teacher from Texas who furnished me with seventy six cases said that he had noticed that in the matter of love children seemed fairly to break out in the springtime Many of the others who reported incidentally mentioned the love affairs as beginning in the spring This also agrees with my own observations Crichton Browne remarks that children in springtime exhibit restlessness excitability perversity and indisposition to exertion that are not displayed at other times This condition sometimes known as spring fever has been studied in over a hundred cases both children and adults by Kline The majority of these report a feeling of tiredness languor lassitude sometimes restlessness sometimes drowsiness There is often a feeling of suffocation and a longing for Nature and fresh air and day dreams while work seems distasteful and unsatisfactory Change is felt to be necessary at all costs and sometimes there is a desire to begin some new plan of life one hundred sixty one In both sexes there is frequently a wave of sexual emotion a longing for love Kline also found by examination of a very large number of cases that between the ages of four and seventeen it is in spring that running away from home most often occurs He suggests that this whole group of phenomena may be due to the shifting of the metabolic processes from the ordinary grooves into reproductive channels and seeks to bring it into connection with the migrations of animals for reproductive purposes one hundred sixty two It has long been known that the occurrence of insanity follows an annual curve one hundred sixty three and though our knowledge of this curve being founded on the date of admissions to asylums cannot be said to be quite precise it fairly corresponds to the outbreaks of acute insanity The curve presented in Chart four shows the admissions to the London County Council Lunatic Asylums during the years eighteen ninety three to eighteen ninety seven inclusive I have arranged it in two month periods to neutralize unimportant oscillations In order to show that this curve is not due to local or accidental circumstances we may turn to France and take a special and chronic form of mental disease Garnier in his Folie a Paris presents an almost exactly similar curve of the admissions of cases of general paralysis to the Infirmerie Speciale at Paris during the years eighteen eighty six eighty eight Chart five Both curves alike show a major climax in spring and a minor climax in autumn Crime in general in temperate climates tends to reach its maximum at the beginning of the hot season usually in June Thus in Belgium the minimum is in February the maximum in June thence gradually diminishing Lentz Bulletin Societe Medecine Mentale Belgique March nineteen oh one In France Lacassagne has summated the data extending over more than forty years and finds that for all crimes June is the maximum month the minimum being reached in November He also gives the figures for each class of crime separately and every crime is found to have its own yearly curve Poisonings show a chief maximum in May with slow fall and a minor climax in December assassinations have a February and a November climax Parricides culminate in May June and in October Lacassagne s tables are given by Laurent Les Habitues des Prisons de Paris Ch one Notwithstanding the general tendency for crime to reach its maximum in the first hot month a tendency not necessarily due to the direct influence of heat we also find when we consider the statistics of crime generally including sexual crime that there is another tendency for minor climaxes in spring and autumn Thus in Italy Penta taking the statistics of nearly four thousand crimes murder highway robbery and sexual offences found the maximum in the first summer months but there were also minor climaxes in spring and in August and September Penta Rivista Mensile di Psichiatria eighteen ninety nine In nearly all Europe as is shown by a diagram given by Lombroso and Laschi at the end of the first volume of Le Crime Politique while the chief climaxes occur about July there is in most countries a distinct tendency to spring usually about March and autumn September and November climaxes though they rarely rise as high as the July climax If we consider the separate periodicity of sexual offences we find that they follow the rule for crimes generally and usually show a chief maximum in early summer Aschaffenburg finds that the annual periodicity of the sexual impulse appears more strongly marked the more abnormal its manifestations which he places in the following order of increasing periodicity conceptions in marriage conceptions out of marriage offences against decency rape assaults on children Centralblatt fuer Nervenheilkunde January nineteen oh three In France rapes and offences against modesty are most numerous in May June and July as Villerme Lacassagne and others have shown Villerme investigating one thousand such cases found a gradual ascent in frequency only slightly broken in March to a maximum in June oscillating between May and July when the years are considered separately and then a gradual descent to a minimum in December Legludic gives for the one hundred fifty nine cases he had investigated a table showing a small February March climax and a large June August maximum the minimum being reached in November January Legludic Attentats aux Moeurs eighteen ninety six p sixteen In Germany Aschaffenburg finds that sexual offences begin to increase in March and April reach a maximum in June or July and fall to a minimum in winter Monatsschrift fuer Psychiatrie nineteen oh three Heft two In Italy Penta shows that sexual offences reach a minor climax in May corresponding in his experience with the maximum for crimes generally as well as with the maximum for conceptions and a more marked climax in August September Penta I Pervertimenti Sessuali eighteen ninety three p one hundred fifteen id Rivista Mensile di Psichiatria eighteen ninety nine Corre in his Crime en Pays Creole presents charts of the seasonal distribution of crime in Guadeloupe with relation to temperature which show that while in a mild temperature like that of France and England crime attains its maximum in the hot season it is not so in a more tropical climate in July when in Guadeloupe the heat attains its maximum degree crime of all kinds falls suddenly to a very low minimum Even in the United States where the summer heat is often excessive it tends to produce a diminution of crime Dexter in an elaborate study of the relationship of conduct to the weather shows that in the United States assaults present the maximum of frequency in April and October with a decrease during the summer and the winter The unusual and interesting fact demonstrated here with a certainty that cannot be doubted is he concludes that the unseasonably hot days of spring and autumn are the pugnacious ones even though the actual heat be much less than for summer We might infer from this that conditions of heat up to a certain extent are vitalizing while at the same time irritating but above that limit heat is so devitalizing in its effects as to leave hardly energy enough to carry on a fight E G Dexter Conduct and the Weather eighteen ninety nine pp sixty three et seq It is not impossible that the phenomena of seasonal periodicity in crimes may possess a real significance in relation to sexual periodicity If as is possible the occurrence of spring and autumn climaxes of criminal activity is due less to any special exciting causes at these seasons than to the depressing influences of heat and cold in summer and winter it may appear reasonable to ask whether the spring and autumn climaxes of sexual activity are not really also largely due to a like depressing influence of extreme temperatures at the other two seasons Not only is there periodicity in criminal conduct but even within the normal range of good and bad conduct seasonal periodicity may still be traced In his Physical and Industrial Training of Criminals H D Wey gives charts of the conduct of seven prisoners during several years as shown by the marks received These charts show that there is a very decided tendency to good behavior during summer and winter while in spring February March and April and in autumn August September and October there are very marked falls to bad conduct each individual tending to adhere to a conduct curve of his own Wey does not himself appear to have noticed this seasonal periodicity Marro however has investigated this question in Turin on a large scale and reaches results not very dissimilar from those shown by Wey s figures in New York He noted the months in which over four thousand punishments were inflicted on prisoners for assaults insults threatening language et cetera and shows the annual curve in Tavola VI of his Caratteri dei Delinquenti There is a marked and isolated climax in May a still more sudden rise leads to the chief maximum of punishment in August and from the minimum in October there is rapid ascent during the two following months to a climax much inferior to that of May The seasonal periodicity of bad conduct in prisons is of interest as showing that we cannot account for psychic periodicity by invoking exclusively social causes This theory of psychic periodicity has been seriously put forward but has been investigated and dismissed so far as crime in Holland is concerned by J R B de Roos in the Transactions of the sixth Congress of Criminal Anthropology at Turin in nineteen oh six Archivio di Psichiatria fasc three nineteen oh six The general statistics of suicides in Continental Europe show a very regular and unbroken curve attaining a maximum in June and a minimum in December the curve rising steadily through the first six months sinking steadily through the last six months but always reaching a somewhat greater height in May than in July one hundred sixty four Morselli shows that in various European countries there is always a rise in spring and in autumn October or November one hundred sixty five Morselli attributes these spring and autumn rises to the influence of the strain of the early heat and the early cold one hundred sixty six In England also if we take a very large number of statistics for instance the figures for London during the twenty years between eighteen sixty five and eighteen eighty four as given by Ogle in a paper read before the Statistical Society in eighteen eighty six we find that although the general curve has the same maximum and minimum points it is interrupted by a break on each side of the maximum and these two breaks occur precisely at about March and October one hundred sixty seven This is shown in the curve in Chart six which presents the daily average for the different months The growth of children follows an annual rhythm Wahl the director of an educational establishment for homeless girls in Denmark who investigated this question found that the increase of weight for all the ages investigated was constantly about thirty three per cent greater in the summer half year than in the winter half year It was noteworthy that even the children who had not reached school age and therefore could not be influenced by school life showed a similar though slighter difference in the same direction It is however Malling Hansen the director of an institution for deaf mutes in Copenhagen who has most thoroughly investigated this matter over a great many years He finds that there are three periods of growth throughout the year marked off in a fairly sharp manner and that during each of these periods the growth in weight and height shows constant characteristics From about the end of November up to about the end of March is a period when growth both in height and weight proceeds at a medium rate reaching neither a maximum nor a minimum increase in weight is slight the increase in height although trifling preponderating After this follows a period during which the children show a marked increase in height while increase in weight is reduced to a minimum The children constantly lose in weight during this period of growth in height almost as much as they gain in the preceding period This period lasts from March and April to July and August Then follows the third period which continues until November and December During this period increase in height is very slight being at its early minimum increase in weight on the other hand at the beginning of the period in September and October is rapid and to the middle of December very considerable daily increase in weight being three times as great as during the winter months Thus it may be said that the spring sexual climax corresponds roughly with growth in height and arrest of growth in weight while the autumn climax corresponds roughly with a period of growth in weight and arrest of growth in height Malling Hansen found that slight variations in the growth of the children were often dependent on changes in temperature in such a way that a rise of temperature even lasting for only a few days caused an increase of growth and a fall of temperature a decrease in growth At Halle Schmid Monnard found that nearly all growth in weight took place in the second half of the year and that the holidays made little difference In America Peckham has shown that increase of growth is chiefly from the first of May to the first of September one hundred sixty eight Among young girls in saint Petersburg Jenjko found that increase in weight takes place in summer Goepel found that increase in height takes place mostly during the first eight months of the year reaching a maximum in August declining during the autumn and winter in February being nil while in March there is sometimes loss in weight even in healthy children In the course of a study as to the consumption of bread in Normal schools during each month of the year as illustrating the relationship between intellectual work and nutrition Binet presents a number of curves which bring out results to which he makes no allusion as they are outside his own investigation Almost without exception these curves show that there is an increase in the consumption of bread in spring and in autumn the spring rise being in February March and April the autumn rise in October or November There are however certain fallacies in dealing with institutions like Normal schools where the conditions are not perfectly regular throughout the year owing to vacations et cetera It is therefore instructive to find that under the monotonous conditions of prison life precisely the same spring and autumn rises are found Binet takes the consumption of bread in the women s prison at Clermont where some four hundred prisoners chiefly between the ages of thirty and forty are confined and he presents two curves for the years eighteen ninety five and eighteen ninety six The curves for these two years show certain marked disagreements with each other but both unite in presenting a distinct rise in April preceded and followed by a fall and both present a still more marked autumn rise in one case in September and November in the other case in October one hundred sixty nine Some years ago Sir J Crichton Browne stated that a manifestation of the sexual stimulus of spring is to be found in the large number of novels read during the month of March Address in Psychology at the annual meeting of the British Medical Association Leeds eighteen eighty nine Lancet August fourteen eighteen eighty nine The statement was supported by figures furnished by lending libraries and has since been widely copied It would certainly be interesting if we could so simply show the connection between love and season by proving that when the birds began to sing their notes the young person s fancy naturally turns to brood over the pictures of mating in novels I accordingly applied to mister Capel Shaw Chief Librarian of the Birmingham Free Libraries specially referred to by Sir J Crichton Browne who furnished me with the Reports for eighteen ninety six and eighteen ninety seven ninety eight this latter report is carried on to the end of March eighteen ninety eight The readers who use the Birmingham Free Lending Libraries are about thirty thousand in number they consist very largely of young people between the ages of fourteen and twenty five somewhat less than half are women Certainly we seem to have here a good field for the determination of this question The monthly figures for each of the ten Birmingham libraries are given separately and it is clear at a glance that without exception the maximum number of readers of prose fiction at all the libraries during eighteen ninety seven ninety eight is found in the month of March I have chiefly taken into consideration the figures for eighteen ninety seven ninety eight the figures for eighteen ninety six are somewhat abnormal and irregular probably owing to a decrease in readers attributed to increased activity in trade and partly to a disturbing influence caused by the opening of a large new library in the course of the year suddenly increasing the number of readers and drafting off borrowers from some of the other libraries Not only so but there is a second or autumnal climax almost equaling the spring climax and occuring with equal certainty appearing during eighteen ninety seven ninety eight either in October or November and during eighteen ninety six constantly in October Thus the periodicity of the rate of consumption of prose fiction corresponds with the periodicity which is found to occur in the conception rate and in sexual ecbolic manifestations It is necessary however to examine somewhat more closely the tables presented in these reports and to compare the rate of the consumption of novels with that of other classes of literature In the first place if instead of merely considering the consumption of novels per month we make allowance for the varying length of the months and consider the average daily consumption per month the supremacy of March at once vanishes February is really the month during which most novels were read during the first quarter of eighteen ninety eight except at two libraries where February and March are equal The result is similar if we ascertain the daily averages for the first quarter in eighteen ninety seven while in eighteen ninety six which however as I have already remarked is a rather abnormal year the daily average for March in many of the libraries falls below that for January as well as for February Again when we turn to the other classes of books we find that this predominance which February possesses and to some extent shares with March and January by no means exclusively applies to novels It is not only shared by both music and poetry which would fit in well with the assumption of a sexual nisus but the department of history biography voyages and travels shares it also with considerable regularity so also does that of arts sciences and natural history and it is quite well marked in theology moral philosophy et cetera and in juvenile literature We even have to admit that the promptings of the sexual instinct bring an increased body of visitors to the reference library where there are no novels for here also both the spring and autumnal climaxes are quite distinct Certainly this theory carries us a little too far The main factor in producing this very marked annual periodicity seems to me to be wholly unconnected with the sexual impulse The winter half of the year from the beginning of October to the end of March when outdoor life has lost its attractions and much time must be spent in the house is naturally the season for reading But during the two central months of winter December and January the attraction of reading meets with a powerful counter attraction in the excitement produced by the approach of Christmas and the increased activity of social life which accompanies and for several weeks follows Christmas In this way the other four winter months October and November at the autumnal end and February and March at the spring end must inevitably present the two chief reading climaxes of the year and so the reports of lending libraries present us with figures which show a striking but fallacious resemblance to the curves which are probably produced by more organic causes I am far from wishing to deny that the impulse which draws young men and women to imaginative literature is unconnected with the obscure promptings of the sexual instinct But until the disturbing influence I have just pointed out is eliminated I see no evidence here for any true seasonal periodicity Possibly in prisons the value of which as laboratories of experimental psychology we have scarcely yet begun to realize more reliable evidence might be obtained and those French and other prisons where novels are freely allowed to the prisoners might yield evidence as regards the consumption of fiction as instructive as that yielded at Clermont concerning the consumption of bread Certain diseases show a very regular annual curve This is notably the case with scarlet fever Caiger found in a London fever hospital a marked seasonal prevalence there was a minor climax in May repeated in July and a great autumnal climax in October falling to a minimum in December and January This curve corresponds closely to that usually observed in London one hundred seventy It is not peculiar to London or to urban districts for in rural districts we find nearly the same spring minor maximum and major autumnal maximum In Russia it is precisely the same Many other epidemic diseases show very similar curves An annual curve may be found in the expulsive force of the bladder as measured by the distance to which the urinary stream can be projected This curve as ascertained for one case is interesting on account of the close relationship between sexual and vesical activity After a minimum point in autumn there is a rise through the early part of the year to a height maintained through spring and summer and reaching its maximum in August one hundred seventy one This may be said to correspond with the general tendency found in some cases of nocturnal seminal emissions from a winter minimum to an autumn maximum There is an annual curve in voluntary muscle strength Thus in Antwerp where the scientific study of children is systematically carried out by a Pedological Bureau Schuyten found that measured by the dynamometer both at the ages of eight and nine both boys and girls showed a gradual increase of strength from October to January a fall from January to March and a rise to June or July March was the weakest month June and July the strongest one hundred seventy two Schuyten also found an annual curve for mental ability as tested by power of attention which for much of the year corresponded to the curve of muscular strength being high during the cold winter months Lobsien at Kiel seeking to test Schuyten s results and adopting a different method so as to gauge memory as well as attention came to conclusions which confirmed those of Schuyten He found a very marked increase of ability in December and January with a fall in April April and May were the minimum months while July and October also stood low one hundred seventy three The inquiries of Schuyten and Lobsien thus seem to indicate that the voluntary aptitudes of muscular and mental force in children reach their maximum at a time of the year when most of the more or less involuntary activities we have been considering show a minimum of energy If this conclusion should be confirmed by more extended investigations it would scarcely be matter for surprise and would involve no true contradiction It would indeed be natural to suppose that the voluntary and regulated activities of the nervous system should work most efficiently at those periods when they are least exposed to organic and emotional disturbance So persistent a disturbing element in spring and autumn suggests that some physiological conditions underlie it and that there is a real metabolic disturbance at these times of the year So few continuous observations have yet been made on the metabolic processes of the body that it is not easy to verify such a surmise with absolute precision Edward Smith s investigations so far as they go support it and Perry Coste s long continued observations of pulse frequency seem to show with fair regularity a maximum in early spring and another maximum in late autumn one hundred seventy four I may also note that Haig who has devoted many years of observations to the phenomena of uric acid excretion finds that uric acid tends to be highest in the spring months March April May and lowest at the first onset of cold in October one hundred seventy five Thus while the sexual climaxes of spring and autumn are rooted in animal procreative cycles which in man have found expression in primitive festivals these again perhaps strengthening and developing the sexual rhythm they yet have a wider significance They constitute one among many manifestations of spring and autumn physiological disturbance corresponding with fair precision to the vernal and autumnal equinoxes They resemble those periods of atmospheric tension of storm and wind which accompany the spring and autumn phases in the earth s rhythm and they may fairly be regarded as ultimately a physiological reaction to those cosmic influences FOOTNOTES one hundred twenty eight F Smith Veterinary Physiology Dalziel The Collie one hundred twenty nine Mondiere Art Cambodgiens Dictionnaire des Sciences Anthropologiques

During Sleep Erotic Dreams The Analogy of Nocturnal Enuresis Differences in the Erotic Dreams of Men and Women The Auto erotic Phenomena of Sleep in the Hysterical Their Frequently Painful Character By auto erotism I mean the phenomena of spontaneous sexual emotion generated in the absence of an external stimulus proceeding directly or indirectly from another person In a wide sense which cannot be wholly ignored here auto erotism may be said to include those transformations of repressed sexual activity which are a factor of some morbid conditions as well as of the normal manifestation of art and poetry and indeed more or less color the whole of life Such a definition excludes the normal sexual excitement aroused by the presence of a beloved person of the opposite sex it also excludes the perverted sexuality associated with an attraction to a person of the same sex it further excludes the manifold forms of erotic fetichism in which the normal focus of sexual attraction is displaced and voluptuous emotions are only aroused by some object hair shoes garments et cetera which to the ordinary lover are of subordinate though still indeed considerable importance one hundred seventy six The auto erotic field remains extensive it ranges from occasional voluptuous day dreams in which the subject is entirely passive to the perpetual unashamed efforts at sexual self manipulation witnessed among the insane It also includes though chiefly as curiosities those cases in which individuals fall in love with themselves Among auto erotic phenomena or on the borderland we must further include those religious sexual manifestations for an ideal object of which we may find evidence in the lives of saints and ecstatics one hundred seventy seven The typical form of auto erotism is the occurrence of the sexual orgasm during sleep I do not know that any apology is needful for the invention of the term auto erotism one hundred seventy eight There is no existing word in current use to indicate the whole range of phenomena I am here concerned with We are familiar with masturbation but that strictly speaking only covers a special and arbitrary subdivision of the field although it is true the subdivision with which physicians and alienists have chiefly occupied themselves Self abuse is somewhat wider but by no means covers the whole ground while for various reasons it is an unsatisfactory term Onanism is largely used especially in France and some writers even include all forms of homosexual connection under this name it may be convenient to do so from a physiological point of view but it is a confusing and antiquated mode of procedure and from the psychological standpoint altogether illegitimate onanism ought never to be used in this connection if only on the ground that Onan s device was not auto erotic but was an early example of withdrawal before emission or coitus interruptus While the name that I have chosen may possibly not be the best there should be no question as to the importance of grouping all these phenomena together It seems to me that this field has rarely been viewed in a scientifically sound and morally sane light simply because it has not been viewed as a whole We have made it difficult so to view it by directing our attention on the special group of auto erotic facts that group included under masturbation which was most easy to observe and which in an extreme form came plainly under medical observation in insanity and allied conditions and we have wilfully torn this group of facts away from the larger group to which it naturally belongs The questions which have been so widely so diversely and it must unfortunately be added often so mischievously discussed concerning the nature and evils of masturbation are not seen in their true light and proportions until we realize that masturbation is but a specialized form of a tendency which in some form or in some degree normally affects not only man but all the higher animals From a medical point of view it is often convenient to regard masturbation as an isolated fact but in order to understand it we must bear in mind its relationships In this study of auto erotism I shall frequently have occasion to refer to the old entity of masturbation because it has been more carefully studied than any other part of the auto erotic field but I hope it will always be borne in mind that the psychological significance and even the medical diagnostic value of masturbation cannot be appreciated unless we realize that it is an artificial subdivision of a great group of natural facts The study of auto erotism is far from being an unimportant or merely curious study Yet psychologists medical and non medical almost without exception treat its manifestations when they refer to them at all in a dogmatic and off hand manner which is far from scientific It is not surprising therefore that the most widely divergent opinions are expressed Nor is it surprising that ignorant and chaotic notions among the general population should lead to results that would be ludicrous if they were not pathetic To mention one instance known to me a married lady who is a leader in social purity movements and an enthusiast for sexual chastity discovered through reading some pamphlet against solitary vice that she had herself been practicing masturbation for years without knowing it The profound anguish and hopeless despair of this woman in face of what she believed to be the moral ruin of her whole life cannot well be described It would be easy to give further examples though scarcely a more striking one to show the utter confusion into which we are thrown by leaving this matter in the hands of blind leaders of the blind Moreover the conditions of modern civilization render auto erotism a matter of increasing social significance As our marriage rate declines and as illicit sexual relationships continue to be openly discouraged it is absolutely inevitable that auto erotic phenomena of one kind or another not only among women but also among men should increase among us both in amount and intensity It becomes therefore a matter of some importance both to the moralist and the physician to investigate the psychological nature of these phenomena and to decide precisely what their attitude should be toward them I do not purpose to enter into a thorough discussion of all the aspects of auto erotism That would involve a very extensive study indeed I wish to consider briefly certain salient points concerning auto erotic phenomena especially their prevalence their nature and their moral physical and other effects I base my study partly on the facts and opinions which during the last thirty years have been scattered through the periodical and other medical literature of Europe and America and partly on the experience of individuals especially of fairly normal individuals Among animals in isolation and sometimes in freedom though this can less often be observed it is well known that various forms of spontaneous solitary sexual excitement occur Horses when leading a lazy life may be observed flapping the penis until some degree of emission takes place Welsh ponies I learn from a man who has had much experience with these animals habitually produce erections and emissions in their stalls they do not bring their hind quarters up during this process and they close their eyes which does not take place when they have congress with mares The same informant observed that bulls and goats produce emissions by using their forelegs as a stimulus bringing up their hind quarters and mares rub themselves against objects I am informed by a gentleman who is a recognized authority on goats that they sometimes take the penis into the mouth and produce actual orgasm thus practicing auto fellatio As regards ferrets the reverend H Northcote states I am informed by a gentleman who has had considerable experience of ferrets that if the bitch when in heat cannot obtain a dog she pines and becomes ill If a smooth pebble is introduced into the hutch she will masturbate upon it thus preserving her normal health for one season But if this artificial substitute is given to her a second season she will not as formerly be content with it one hundred seventy nine Stags in the rutting season when they have no partners rub themselves against trees to produce ejaculation Sheep masturbate as also do camels pressing themselves down against convenient objects and elephants compress the penis between the hind legs to obtain emissions one hundred eighty Blumenbach observed a bear act somewhat similarly on seeing other bears coupling and hyenas according to Ploss and Bartels have been seen practicing mutual masturbation by licking each other s genitals Mammary masturbation remarks Fere is found in certain female and even male animals like the dog and the cat one hundred eighty one Apes are much given to masturbation even in freedom according to the evidence of good observers for while no female apes are celibates many of the males are obliged to lead a life of celibacy one hundred eighty two Male monkeys use the hand in masturbation to rub and shake the penis one hundred eighty three In the human species these phenomena are by no means found in civilization alone To whatever extent masturbation may have been developed by the conditions of European life which carry to the utmost extreme the concomitant stimulation and repression of the sexual emotions it is far from being as Mantegazza has declared it to be one of the moral characteristics of Europeans one hundred eighty four It is found among the people of nearly every race of which we have any intimate knowledge however natural the conditions under which men and women may live one hundred eighty five Thus among the Nama Hottentots among the young women at all events Gustav Fritsch found that masturbation is so common that it is regarded as a custom of the country no secret is made of it and in the stories and legends of the race it is treated as one of the most ordinary facts of life It is so also among the Basutos and the Kaffirs are addicted to the same habit one hundred eighty six The Fuegians have a word for masturbation and a special word for masturbation by women one hundred eighty seven When the Spaniards first arrived at Vizcaya in the Philippines they found that masturbation was universal and that it was customary for the women to use an artificial penis and other abnormal methods of sexual gratification Among the Balinese according to Jacobs as quoted by Ploss and Bartels masturbation is general in the boudoir of many a Bali beauty he adds and certainly in every harem may be found a wax penis to which many hours of solitude are devoted Throughout the East as Eram speaking from a long medical experience has declared masturbation is very prevalent especially among young girls In Egypt according to Sonnini it is prevalent in harems In India a medical correspondent tells me he once treated the widow of a wealthy Mohammedan who informed him that she began masturbation at an early age just like all other women The same informant tells me that on the facade of a large temple in Orissa are bas reliefs representing both men and women alone masturbating and also women masturbating men Among the Tamils of Ceylon masturbation is said to be common In Cochin China Lorion remarks it is practiced by both sexes but especially by the married women one hundred eighty eight Japanese women have probably carried the mechanical arts of auto erotism to the highest degree of perfection They use two hollow balls about the size of a pigeon s egg sometimes one alone is used which as described by Joest Christian and others one hundred eighty nine are made of very thin leaf of brass one is empty the other called the little man contains a small heavy metal ball or else some quicksilver and sometimes metal tongues which vibrate when set in movement so that if the balls are held in the hand side by side there is a continuous movement The empty one is first introduced into the vagina in contact with the uterus then the other the slightest movement of the pelvis or thighs or even spontaneous movement of the organs causes the metal ball or the quicksilver to roll and the resulting vibration produces a prolonged voluptuous titillation a gentle shock as from a weak electric inductive apparatus the balls are called rin no tama and are held in the vagina by a paper tampon The women who use these balls delight to swing themselves in a hammock or rocking chair the delicate vibration of the balls slowly producing the highest degree of sexual excitement Joest mentions that this apparatus though well known by name to ordinary girls is chiefly used by the more fashionable geishas as well as by prostitutes Its use has now spread to China Annam and India Japanese women also it is said frequently use an artificial penis of paper or clay called e g Among the Atjeh again according to Jacobs as quoted by Ploss the young of both sexes masturbate and the elder girls use an artificial penis of wax In China also the artificial penis made of rosin supple and like the classical instrument described by Herondas rose colored is publicly sold and widely used by women one hundred ninety It may be noticed that among non European races it is among women and especially among those who are subjected to the excitement of a life professionally devoted to some form of pleasure that the use of the artificial instruments of auto erotism is chiefly practiced The same is markedly true in Europe The use of an artificial penis in solitary sexual gratification may be traced down from classic times and doubtless prevailed in the very earliest human civilization for such an instrument is said to be represented in old Babylonian sculptures and it is referred to by Ezekiel Ch XVI v seventeen The Lesbian women are said to have used such instruments made of ivory or gold with silken stuffs and linen Aristophanes Lysistrata v one hundred nine speaks of the manufacture by the Milesian women of a leather artificial penis or olisbos In the British Museum is a vase representing a hetaira holding such instruments which as found at Pompeii may be seen in the museum at Naples One of the best of Herondas s mimes The Private Conversation presents a dialogue between two ladies concerning a certain olisbos or nbon which one of them vaunts as a dream of delight Through the Middle Ages when from time to time the clergy reprobated the use of such instruments one hundred ninety one they continued to be known and after the fifteenth century the references to them became more precise Thus Fortini the Siennese novelist of the sixteenth century refers in his Novelle dei Novizi seventh Day Novella XXXIX to the glass object filled with warm water which nuns use to calm the sting of the flesh and to satisfy themselves as well as they can he adds that widows and other women anxious to avoid pregnancy availed themselves of it In Elizabethan England at the same time it appears to have been of similar character and Marston in his satires tells how Lucea prefers a glassy instrument to her husband s lukewarm bed In sixteenth century France also such instruments were sometimes made of glass and Brantome refers to the godemiche in eighteenth century Germany they were called Samthanse and their use according to Heinse as quoted by Duehren was common among aristocratic women In England by that time the dildo appears to have become common Archemholtz states that while in Paris they are only sold secretly in London a certain missus Philips sold them openly on a large scale in her shop in Leicester Square John Bee in eighteen thirty five stating that the name was originally dil dol remarks that their use was formerly commoner than it was in his day In France Madame Gourdan the most notorious brothel keeper of the eighteenth century carried on a wholesale trade in consolateurs as they were called and at her death numberless letters from abbesses and simple nuns were found among her papers asking for a consolateur to be sent one hundred ninety two The modern French instrument is described by Gamier as of hardened red rubber exactly imitating the penis and capable of holding warm milk or other fluid for injection at the moment of orgasm the compressible scrotum is said to have been first added in the eighteenth century one hundred ninety three In Islam the artificial penis has reached nearly as high a development as in Christendom Turkish women use it and it is said to be openly sold in Smyrna In the harems of Zanzibar according to Baumann it is of considerable size carved out of ebony or ivory and commonly bored through so that warm water may be injected It is here regarded as an Arab invention one hundred ninety four Somewhat similar appliances may be traced in all centres of civilization But throughout they appear to be frequently confined to the world of prostitutes and to those women who live on the fashionable or semi artistic verge of that world Ignorance and delicacy combine with a less versatile and perverted concentration on the sexual impulse to prevent any general recourse to such highly specialized methods of solitary gratification On the other hand the use or rather abuse of the ordinary objects and implements of daily life in obtaining auto erotic gratification among the ordinary population in civilized modern lands has reached an extraordinary degree of extent and variety we can only feebly estimate by the occasional resulting mischances which come under the surgeon s hands because only a certain proportion of such instruments are dangerous Thus the banana seems to be widely used for masturbation by women and appears to be marked out for the purpose by its size and shape one hundred ninety five it is however innocuous and never comes under the surgeon s notice the same may probably be said of the cucumbers and other vegetables more especially used by country and factory girls in masturbation a lady living near Vichy told Pouillet that she had often heard and had herself been able to verify the fact that the young peasant women commonly used turnips carrots and beet roots In the eighteenth century Mirabeau in his Erotikca Biblion gave a list of the various objects used in convents which he describes as vast theatres of such practices to obtain solitary sexual excitement In more recent years the following are a few of the objects found in the vagina or bladder whence they could only be removed by surgical interference one hundred ninety six Pencils sticks of sealing wax cotton reels hair pins and in Italy very commonly the bone pins used in the hair bodkins knitting needles crochet needles needle cases compasses glass stoppers candles corks tumblers forks tooth picks toothbrushes pomade pots in a case recorded by Schroeder with a cockchafer inside a makeshift substitute for the Japanese rin no tama while in one recent English case a full sized hen s egg was removed from the vagina of a middle aged married woman More than nine tenths of the foreign bodies found in the female bladder or urethra are due to masturbation The age of the individuals in whom such objects have been found is usually from seventeen to thirty but in a few cases they have been found in girls below fourteen infrequently in women between forty and fifty the large objects naturally are found chiefly in the vagina and in married women one hundred ninety seven Hair pins have above all been found in the female bladder with special frequency this point is worth some consideration as an illustration of the enormous frequency of this form of auto erotism The female urethra is undoubtedly a normal centre of sexual feeling as Pouillet pointed out many years ago a woman medical correspondent also writes that in some women the maximum of voluptuous sensation is at the vesical sphincter or orifice though not always so limited E H Smith indeed considers that the urethra is the part in which the orgasm occurs and remarks that in sexual excitement mucus always flows largely from the urethra one hundred ninety eight It should be added that when once introduced the physiological mechanism of the bladder apparently causes the organ to tend to swallow the foreign object Yet for every case in which the hair pin disappears and is lost in the bladder from carelessness or the oblivion of the sexual spasm there must be a vast number of cases in which the instrument is used without any such unfortunate result There is thus great significance in the frequency with which cases of hair pin in the bladder are strewn through the medical literature of all countries In eighteen sixty two a German surgeon found the accident so common that he invented a special instrument for extracting hair pins from the female bladder as indeed Italian and French surgeons have also done In France Denuce of Bordeaux came to the conclusion that hair pin in the bladder is the commonest result of masturbation as known to the surgeon In England cases are constantly being recorded Lawson Tait stating that most cases of stone in the bladder in women are due to the introduction of a foreign body very often a hair pin adds I have removed hair pins encrusted with phosphates from ten different female bladders and not one of the owners of these bladders would give any account of the incident one hundred ninety nine Stokes again records that during four years he had four cases of hair pin in the female urethra two hundred In New York one physician met with four cases in a short experience two hundred one In Switzerland Professor Reverdin had a precisely similar experience two hundred two There is however another class of material objects widely employed for producing physical auto erotism which in the nature of things never reaches the surgeon I refer to the effects that naturally or unnaturally may be produced by many of the objects and implements of daily life that do not normally come in direct contact with the sexual organs Children sometimes even when scarcely more than infants produce sexual excitement by friction against the corner of a chair or other piece of furniture and women sometimes do the same two hundred three Guttceit in Russia knew women who made a large knot in their chemises to rub against and mentions a woman who would sit on her naked heel and rub it against her Girls in France I am informed are fond of riding on the chevaux de bois or hobby horses because of the sexual excitement thus aroused and that the sexual emotions play a part in the fascination exerted by this form of amusement everywhere is indicated by the ecstatic faces of its devotees two hundred four At the temples in some parts of Central India I am told swings are hung up in pairs men and women swinging in these until sexually excited during the months when the men in these districts have to be away from home the girls put up swings to console themselves for the loss of their husbands It is interesting to observe the very wide prevalence of swinging often of a religious or magic character and the evident sexual significance underlying it although this is not always clearly brought out Groos discussing the frequency of swinging Die Spiele der Menschen p one hundred fourteen refers for instance to the custom of the Gilbert Islanders for a young man to swing a girl from a coco palm and then to cling on and swing with her In ancient Greece women and grown up girls were fond of see saws and swings The Athenians had indeed a swinging festival Athenaeus Bk XIV Ch X Songs of a voluptuous character we gather from Athenaeus were sung by the women at this festival J G Frazer The Golden Bough vol ii note A Swinging as a Magical Rite discusses the question and brings forward instances in which men or especially women swing The notion seems to be he states that the ceremony promotes fertility whether in the vegetable or in the animal kingdom though why it should be supposed to do so I confess myself unable to explain loc cit p four hundred fifty The explanation seems however not far to seek in view of the facts quoted above and Frazer himself refers to the voluptuous character of the songs sometimes sung Even apart from actual swinging of the whole body a swinging movement may suffice to arouse sexual excitement and may at all events in women constitute an essential part of methods of attaining solitary sexual gratification Kiernan thus describes the habitual auto erotic procedure of a young American woman The patient knelt before a chair let her elbows drop on its seat grasping the arms with a firm grip then commenced a swinging writhing motion seeming to fix her pelvis and moving her trunk and limbs The muscles were rigid the face took on a passionate expression the features were contorted the eyes rolled the teeth were set and the lips compressed while the cheeks were purple The condition bore a striking resemblance to the passional stage of grand hysteria The reveling took only a moment to commence but lasted a long time Swaying induced a pleasurable sensation accompanied with a feeling of suction upon the clitoris Almost immediately after a sensation of bursting caused by discharge from the vulvo vaginal glands occurs followed by a rapture prolonged for an indefinite time The accompanying sexual imagery is so vivid as almost to become hallucinatory J G Kiernan Sex Transformation and Psychic Impotence American Journal of Dermatology vol ix No two Somewhat similarly sensations of sexual character are sometimes experienced by boys when climbing up a pole It is not even necessary that there should be direct external contact with the sexual organs and Howe states that gymnastic swinging poles around which boys swing while supporting the whole weight on the hands may suffice to produce sexual excitement Several writers have pointed out that riding especially in women may produce sexual excitement and orgasm two hundred five It is well known also that both in men and women the vibratory motion of a railway train frequently produces a certain degree of sexual excitement especially when sitting forward Such excitement may remain latent and not become specifically sexual two hundred six I am not aware that this quality of railway traveling has ever been fostered as a sexual perversion but the sewing machine has attracted considerable attention on account of its influence in exciting auto erotic manifestations The early type of sewing machine especially was of very heavy character and involved much up and down movement of the legs Langdon Down pointed out many years ago that this frequently produced great sexual erethism which led to masturbation two hundred seven According to one French authority it is a well recognized fact that to work a sewing machine with the body in a certain position produces sexual excitement leading to the orgasm The occurrence of the orgasm is indicated to the observer by the machine being worked for a few seconds with uncontrollable rapidity This sound is said to be frequently heard in large French workrooms and it is part of the duty of the superintendents of the rooms to make the girls sit properly two hundred eight During a visit which I once paid to a manufactory of military clothing Pouillet writes I witnessed the following scene In the midst of the uniform sound produced by some thirty sewing machines I suddenly heard one of the machines working with much more velocity than the others I looked at the person who was working it a brunette of eighteen or twenty While she was automatically occupied with the trousers she was making on the machine her face became animated her mouth opened slightly her nostrils dilated her feet moved the pedals with constantly increasing rapidity Soon I saw a convulsive look in her eyes her eyelids were lowered her face turned pale and was thrown backward hands and legs stopped and became extended a suffocated cry followed by a long sigh was lost in the noise of the workroom The girl remained motionless a few seconds drew out her handkerchief to wipe away the pearls of sweat from her forehead and after casting a timid and ashamed glance at her companions resumed her work The forewoman who acted as my guide having observed the direction of my gaze took me up to the girl who blushed lowered her face and murmured some incoherent words before the forewoman had opened her mouth to advise her to sit fully on the chair and not on its edge As I was leaving I heard another machine at another part of the room in accelerated movement The forewoman smiled at me and remarked that that was so frequent that it attracted no notice It was specially observed she told me in the case of young work girls apprentices and those who sat on the edge of their seats thus much facilitating friction of the labia In cases where the sewing machine does not lead to direct self excitement it has been held as by Fothergill two hundred nine to predispose to frequency of involuntary sexual orgasm during sleep from the irritation set up by the movement of the feet in the sitting posture during the day The essential movement in working the sewing machine is the flexion and extension of the ankle but the muscles of the thighs are used to maintain the feet firmly on the treadle the thighs are held together and there is a considerable degree of flexion or extension of the thighs on the trunk by a special adjustment of the body and sometimes perhaps merely in the presence of sexual hyperaesthesia it is thus possible to act upon the sexual organs but this is by no means a necessary result of using the sewing machine and inquiry of various women with well developed sexual feelings who are accustomed to work the treadle has not shown the presence of any tendency in this direction Sexual irritation may also be produced by the bicycle in women Thus Moll two hundred ten remarks that he knows many married women and some unmarried who experience sexual excitement when cycling in several cases he has ascertained that the excitement is carried as far as complete orgasm This result cannot however easily happen unless the seat is too high the peak in contact with the organs and a rolling movement is adopted in the absence of marked hyperaesthesia these results are only effected by a bad seat or an improper attitude the body during cycling resting under proper conditions on the buttocks and the work being mainly done by the muscles of the thighs and legs which control the ankles flexion of the thigh on the pelvis being very small Most medical authorities on cycling are of opinion that when cycling leads to sexual excitement the fault lies more with the woman than with the machine This conclusion does not appear to me to be absolutely correct I find on inquiry that with the old fashioned saddle with an elevated peak rising toward the pubes a certain degree of sexual excitement not usually producing the orgasm but as one lady expressed it making one feel quite ready for it is fairly common among women Lydston finds that irritation of the genital organs may unquestionably be produced in both males and females by cycling The aggravation of haemorrhoids sometimes produced by cycling indicates also the tendency to local congestion With the improved flat saddles however constructed with more definite adjustment to the anatomical formation of the parts this general tendency is reduced to a negligible minimum Reference may be made at this point to the influence of tight lacing This has been recognized by gynaecologists as a factor of sexual excitement and a method of masturbation two hundred eleven Women who have never worn corsets sometimes find that on first putting them on sexual feeling is so intensified that it is necessary to abandon their use two hundred twelve The reason of this as Siebert points out in his Buch fuer Eltern seems to be that the corset both favors pelvic congestion and at the same time exerts a pressure on the abdominal muscles which brings them into the state produced during coitus It is doubtless for the same reason that as some women have found more distension of the bladder is possible without corsets than with them In a further class of cases no external object whatever is used to procure the sexual orgasm but the more or less voluntary pressure of the thighs alone is brought to bear upon the sexual regions It is done either when sitting or standing the thighs being placed together and firmly crossed and the pelvis rocked so that the sexual organs are pressed against the inner and posterior parts of the thighs two hundred thirteen This is sometimes done by men and is fairly common among women especially according to Martineau two hundred fourteen among those who sit much such as dressmakers and milliners those who use the sewing machine and those who ride Vedeler remarks that in his experience in Scandinavia thigh friction is the commonest form of masturbation in women The practice is widespread and a medical correspondent in India tells me of a Brahmin widow who confessed to this form of masturbation I am told that in London Board Schools at the present time thigh rubbing is not infrequent among the girl scholars the proportion mentioned in one school was about ten per cent of the girls over eleven the thigh rubbing is done more or less openly and is interpreted by the uninitiated as due merely to a desire to relieve the bladder It is found in female infants Thus Townsend records the case of an infant eight months old who would cross her right thigh over the left close her eyes and clench her fists after a minute or two there would be complete relaxation with sweating and redness of face this would occur about once a week or oftener the child was quite healthy with no abnormal condition of the genital organs two hundred fifteen The frequency of thigh friction among women as a form of masturbation is due to the fact that it is usually acquired innocently and it involves no indecorum Thus Soutzo reports the case of a girl of twelve who at school when having to wait her turn at the water closet for fear of wetting herself would put her clothes between her legs and press her thighs together moving them backwards and forwards in the effort to control the bladder she discovered that a pleasurable sensation was thus produced and acquired the habit of practicing the manoeuvre for its own sake at the age of seventeen she began to vary it in different ways thus she would hang from a tree with her legs swinging and her chemise pressed between her thighs which she would rub together two hundred sixteen Thigh friction in some of its forms is so comparatively decorous a form of masturbation that it may even be performed in public places thus a few years ago while waiting for a train at a station on the outskirts of a provincial town I became aware of the presence of a young woman sitting alone on a seat at a little distance whom I could observe unnoticed She was leaning back with legs crossed swinging the crossed foot vigorously and continuously this continued without interruption for some ten minutes after I first observed her then the swinging movement reached a climax she leant still further back thus bringing the sexual region still more closely in contact with the edge of the bench and straightened and stiffened her body and legs in what appeared to be a momentary spasm there could be little doubt as to what had taken place A few moments later she slowly walked from her solitary seat into the waiting room and sat down among the other waiting passengers quite still now and with uncrossed legs a pale quiet young woman possibly a farmer s daughter serenely unconscious that her manoeuvre had been detected and very possibly herself ignorant of its true nature There are many other forms in which the impulse of auto erotism presents itself Dancing is often a powerful method of sexual excitement not only among civilized but among savage peoples and Zache describes the erotic dances of Swaheli women as having a masturbatory object two hundred seventeen Stimulation of the nates is a potent adjuvant to the production of self excitement and self flagellation with rods et cetera is practiced by some individuals especially young women two hundred eighteen Urtication is another form of this stimulation Reverdin knew a young woman who obtained sexual gratification by flogging herself with chestnut burrs and it is stated that in some parts of France departments of the Ain and Cote d Or it is not uncommon for young girls to masturbate by rubbing the leaves of the Linaria cymbalaria here called pinton or timbarde on to the sexual parts thus producing a burning sensation two hundred nineteen Stimulation of the mamma normally an erogenous centre in women may occasionally serve as a method for obtaining auto erotic satisfaction including the orgasm in both sexes I have been told of a case in a man and a medical correspondent in India informs me that he knows a Eurasian woman addicted to masturbation who can only obtain the orgasm by rubbing the genitals with one hand while with the other she rubs and finally squeezes her breasts The tactile stimulation even of regions of the body which are not normally erogenous zones in either sex may sometimes lead on to sexual excitement Hirschsprung as well as Freud believes that this is often the case as regards finger sucking and toe sucking in infancy Even stroking the chin remarks Debreyne may produce a pollution two hundred twenty Taylor refers to the case of a young woman of twenty two who was liable to attacks of choreic movements of the hands which would terminate in alternately pressing the middle finger on the tip of the nose and the tragus of the ear when a far away pleased expression would appear on her face she thus produced sexual excitement and satisfaction She had no idea of wrong doing and was surprised and ashamed when she realized the nature of her act two hundred twenty one Most of the foregoing examples of auto erotism are commonly included by no means correctly under the heading of masturbation There are however a vast number of people possessing strong sexual emotions and living a solitary life who experience sometimes by instinct and sometimes on moral grounds a strong repugnance for these manifestations of auto erotism As one highly intelligent lady writes I have sometimes wondered whether I could produce it complete sexual excitement mechanically but I have a curious unreasonable repugnance to trying the experiment It would materialize it too much The same repugnance may be traced in the tendency to avoid so far as possible the use of the hands It is quite common to find this instinctive unreasoning repugnance among women a healthy repugnance not founded on any moral ground In men the same repugnance exists more often combined with or replaced by a very strong moral and aesthetic objection to such practices But the presence of such a repugnance however invincible is very far from carrying us outside the auto erotic field The production of the sexual orgasm is not necessarily dependent on any external contact or voluntary mechanical cause As an example though not of specifically auto erotic manifestations I may mention the case of a man of fifty seven a somewhat eccentric preacher et cetera who writes My whole nature goes out so to some persons and they thrill and stir me so that I have an emission while sitting by them with no thought of sex only the gladness of soul found its way out thus and a glow of health suffused the whole body There was no spasmodic conclusion but a pleasing gentle sensation as the few drops of semen passed In reality no doubt not semen but urethral fluid This man s condition may certainly be considered somewhat morbid he is attracted to both men and women and the sexual impulse seems to be irritable and weak but a similar state of things exists so often in women no doubt due to sexual repression and in individuals who are in a general state of normal and good health that in these it can scarcely be called morbid Brooding on sexual images which the theologians termed delectatio morosa may lead to spontaneous orgasm in either sex even in perfectly normal persons Hammond described as a not uncommon form of psychic coitus a condition in which the simple act of imagination alone in the presence of the desired object suffices to produce orgasm In some public conveyance theatre or elsewhere the man sees a desirable woman and by concentrating his attention on her person and imagining all the stages of intimacy he quickly succeeds in producing orgasm two hundred twenty two Niceforo refers to an Italian work girl of fourteen who could obtain ejaculation of mucus four times a day in the workroom in the presence of the other girls without touching herself or moving her body by simply thinking of sexual things two hundred twenty three If the orgasm occurs spontaneously without the aid of mental impressions or any manipulations ad hoc though under such conditions it ceases to be sinful from the theological standpoint it certainly ceases also to be normal Serieux records the case of a somewhat neurotic woman of fifty who had been separated from her husband for ten years and since lived a chaste life at this age however she became subject to violent crises of sexual orgasm which would come on without any accompaniment of voluptuous thoughts MacGillicuddy records three cases of spontaneous orgasm in women coming under his notice two hundred twenty four Such crises are frequently found in both men and women who from moral reasons ignorance or on other grounds are restrained from attaining the complete sexual orgasm but whose sexual emotions are literally continually dribbling from them Schrenck Notzing knows a lady who is spontaneously sexually excited on hearing music or seeing pictures without anything lascivious in them she knows nothing of sexual relationships Another lady is sexually excited on seeing beautiful and natural scenes like the sea sexual ideas are mixed up in her mind with these things and the contemplation of a specially strong and sympathetic man brings the orgasm on in about a minute Both these ladies masturbate in the streets restaurants railways theatres without anyone perceiving it two hundred twenty five A Brahmin woman informed a medical correspondent in India that she had distinct though feeble orgasm with copious outflow of mucus if she stayed long near a man whose face she liked and this is not uncommon among European women Evidently under such conditions there is a state of hyperaesthetic weakness Here however we are passing the frontiers of strictly auto erotic phenomena Delectatio morosa as understood by the theologians is distinct from desire and also distinct from the definite intention of effecting the sexual act although it may lead to those things It is the voluntary and complacent dallying in imagination with voluptuous thoughts when no effort is made to repel them It is as Aquinas and others point out constituted by this act of complacent dallying and has no reference to the duration of the imaginative process Debreyne in his Moechialogie pp one hundred forty nine one hundred sixty three deals fully with this question and quotes the opinions of theologians I may add that in the early Penitentials before the elaboration of Catholic theology the voluntary emission of semen through the influence of evil thoughts was recognized as a sin though usually only if it occurred in church In Egbert s Penitential of the eighth or ninth century cap IX twelve the penance assigned for this offence in the case of a deacon is twenty five days in the case of a monk thirty days a priest forty days a bishop fifty Haddon and Stubbs Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents vol iii p four hundred twenty six The frequency of spontaneous orgasm in women seems to have been recognized in the seventeenth century Thus Schurig Syllepsilogia p four apparently quoting Riolan states that some women are so wanton that the sight of a handsome man or of their lover or speech with such a one will cause them to ejaculate their semen There is however a closely allied and indeed overlapping form of auto erotism which may be considered here I mean that associated with revery or day dreaming Although this is a very common and important form of auto erotism besides being in a large proportion of cases the early stage of masturbation it appears to have attracted little attention two hundred twenty six The day dream has indeed been studied in its chief form in the continued story by Mabel Learoyd of Wellesley College The continued story is an imagined narrative more or less peculiar to the individual by whom it is cherished with fondness and regarded as an especially sacred mental possession to be shared only if at all with very sympathizing friends It is commoner among girls and young women than among boys and young men among three hundred fifty two persons of both sexes forty seven per cent among the women and only fourteen per cent among the men have any continued story The starting point is an incident from a book or more usually some actual experience which the subject develops the subject is nearly always the hero or the heroine of the story The growth of the story is favored by solitude and lying in bed before going to sleep is the time specially sacred to its cultivation two hundred twenty seven No distinct reference perhaps naturally enough is made by Miss Learoyd to the element of sexual emotion with which these stories are often strongly tinged and which is frequently their real motive Though by no means easy to detect these elaborate and more or less erotic day dreams are not uncommon in young men and especially in young women Each individual has his own particular dream which is always varying or developing but except in very imaginative persons to no great extent Such a day dream is often founded on a basis of pleasurable personal experience and develops on that basis It may involve an element of perversity even though that element finds no expression in real life It is of course fostered by sexual abstinence hence its frequency in young women Most usually there is little attempt to realize it It does not necessarily lead to masturbation though it often causes some sexual congestion or even spontaneous sexual orgasm The day dream is a strictly private and intimate experience not only from its very nature but also because it occurs in images which the subject finds great difficulty in translating into language even when willing to do so In other cases it is elaborately dramatic or romantic in character the hero or heroine passing through many experiences before attaining the erotic climax of the story This climax tends to develop in harmony with the subject s growing knowledge or experience at first merely a kiss it may develop into any refinement of voluptuous gratification The day dream may occur either in normal or abnormal persons Rousseau in his Confessions describes such dreams in his case combined with masochism and masturbation A distinguished American novelist Hamlin Garland has admirably described in Rose of Dutcher s Coolly the part played in the erotic day dreams of a healthy normal girl at adolescence by a circus rider seen on the first visit to a circus and becoming a majestic ideal to dominate the girl s thoughts for many years two hundred twenty eight Raffalovich two hundred twenty nine describes the process by which in sexual inverts the vision of a person of the same sex perhaps seen in the streets or the theatre is evoked in solitary reveries producing a kind of psychic onanism whether or not it leads on to physical manifestations Although day dreaming of this kind has at present been very little studied since it loves solitude and secrecy and has never been counted of sufficient interest for scientific inquisition it is really a process of considerable importance and occupies a large part of the auto erotic field It is frequently cultivated by refined and imaginative young men and women who lead a chaste life and would often be repelled by masturbation In such persons under such circumstances it must be considered as strictly normal the inevitable outcome of the play of the sexual impulse No doubt it may often become morbid and is never a healthy process when indulged in to excess as it is liable to be by refined young people with artistic impulses to whom it is in the highest degree seductive and insidious two hundred thirty As we have seen however day dreaming is far from always colored by sexual emotion yet it is a significant indication of its really sexual origin that as I have been informed by persons of both sexes even in these apparently non sexual cases it frequently ceases altogether on marriage Even when we have eliminated all these forms of auto erotic activity however refined in which the subject takes a voluntary part we have still left unexplored an important portion of the auto erotic field a portion which many people are alone inclined to consider normal sexual orgasm during sleep That under conditions of sexual abstinence in healthy individuals there must inevitably be some auto erotic manifestations during waking life a careful study of the facts compels us to believe There can be no doubt also that under the same conditions the occurrence of the complete orgasm during sleep with in men seminal emissions is altogether normal Even Zeus himself as Pausanias has recorded was liable to such accidents a statement which at all events shows that to the Greek mind there was nothing derogatory in such an occurrence two hundred thirty one The Jews however regarded it as an impurity two hundred thirty two and the same idea was transmitted to the Christian church and embodied in the word pollutio by which the phenomenon was designated in ecclesiastical phraseology two hundred thirty three According to Billuart and other theologians pollution in sleep is not sin unless voluntarily caused if however it begins in sleep and is completed in the half waking state with a sense of pleasure it is a venial sin But it seems allowable to permit a nocturnal pollution to complete itself on awaking if it occurs without intention and saint Thomas even says Si pollutio placeat ut naturae exoneratio vel alleviatio peccatum non creditur Notwithstanding the fair and logical position of the more distinguished Latin theologians there has certainly been a widely prevalent belief in Catholic countries that pollution during sleep is a sin In the Parson s Tale Chaucer makes the parson say Another sin appertaineth to lechery that cometh in sleeping and the sin cometh oft to them that be maidens and eke to them that be corrupt and this sin men clepe pollution that cometh in four manners these four manners being one languishing of body from rank and abundant humors two infirmity three surfeit of meat and drink and four villainous thoughts Four hundred years later Madame Roland in her Memoires Particulieres presented a vivid picture of the anguish produced in an innocent girl s mind by the notion of the sinfulness of erotic dreams She menstruated first at the age of fourteen Before this she writes I had sometimes been awakened from the deepest sleep in a surprising manner Imagination played no part I exercised it on too many serious subjects and my timorous conscience preserved it from amusement with other subjects so that it could not represent what I would not allow it to seek to understand But an extraordinary effervescence aroused my senses in the heat of repose and by virtue of my excellent constitution operated by itself a purification which was as strange to me as its cause The first feeling which resulted was I know not why a sort of fear I had observed in my Philotee that we are not allowed to obtain any pleasure from our bodies except in lawful marriage What I had experienced could be called a pleasure I was then guilty and in a class of offences which caused me the most shame and sorrow since it was that which was most displeasing to the Spotless Lamb There was great agitation in my poor heart prayers and mortifications How could I avoid it For indeed I had not foreseen it but at the instant when I experienced it I had not taken the trouble to prevent it My watchfulness became extreme I scrupulously avoided positions which I found specially exposed me to the accident My restlessness became so great that at last I was able to awake before the catastrophe When I was not in time to prevent it I would jump out of bed with naked feet on to the polished floor and with crossed arms pray to the Saviour to preserve me from the wiles of the devil I would then impose some penance on myself and I have carried out to the letter what the prophet King probably only transmitted to us as a figure of Oriental speech mixing ashes with my bread and watering it with my tears To the early Protestant mind as illustrated by Luther there was something diseased though not impure in sexual excitement during sleep thus in his Table Talk Luther remarks that girls who have such dreams should be married at once taking the medicine which God has given It is only of comparatively recent years that medical science has obtained currency for the belief that this auto erotic process is entirely normal Blumenbach stated that nocturnal emissions are normal two hundred thirty four Sir James Paget declared that he had never known celibate men who had not such emissions from once or twice a week to twice every three months both extremes being within the limits of good health while Sir Lauder Brunton considers once a fortnight or once a month about the usual frequency at these periods the emissions often following two nights in succession Rohleder believes that they may normally follow for several nights in succession Hammond considers that they occur about once a fortnight two hundred thirty five Ribbing regards ten to fourteen days as the normal interval two hundred thirty six Loewenfeld puts the normal frequency at about once a week two hundred thirty seven this seems to be nearer the truth as regards most fairly healthy young men In proof of this it is only necessary to refer to the exact records of healthy young adults summarized in the study of periodicity in the present volume It occasionally happens however that nocturnal emissions are entirely absent I am acquainted with some cases In other fairly healthy young men they seldom occur except at times of intellectual activity or of anxiety and worry Lately there has been some tendency for medical opinion to revert to the view of Luther and to regard sexual excitement during sleep as a somewhat unhealthy phenomenon Moll is a distinguished advocate of this view Sexual excitement during sleep is the normal result of celibacy but it is another thing to say that it is on that account satisfactory We might then Moll remarks maintain that nocturnal incontinence of urine is satisfactory since the bladder is thus emptied Yet we take every precaution against this by insisting that the bladder shall be emptied before going to sleep Libido Sexualis Bd I p five hundred fifty two This remark is supported by the fact to which I find that both men and women can bear witness that sexual excitement during sleep is more fatiguing than in the waking state though this is not an invariable rule and it is sometimes found to be refreshing In a similar way Eulenburg Sexuale Neuropathie p fifty five states that nocturnal emissions are no more normal than coughing or vomiting Nocturnal emissions are usually though not invariably accompanied by dreams of a voluptuous character in which the dreamer becomes conscious in a more or less fantastic manner of the more or less intimate presence or contact of a person of the opposite sex It would seem as a general rule that the more vivid and voluptuous the dream the greater is the physical excitement and the greater also the relief experienced on awakening Sometimes the erotic dream occurs without any emission and not infrequently the emission takes place after the dreamer has awakened The widest and most comprehensive investigation of erotic dreams is that carried out by Gualino in northern Italy and based on inquiries among one hundred normal men doctors teachers lawyers et cetera who had all had experience of the phenomenon L Gualino Il Sogno Erotico nell Uomo Normale Rivista di Psicologia Jan Feb nineteen oh seven Gualino shows that erotic dreams with emissions whether or not seminal began somewhat earlier than the period of physical development as ascertained by Marro for youths of the same part of northern Italy Gualino found that all his cases had had erotic dreams at the age of seventeen Marro found eight per cent of youths still sexually undeveloped at that age and while sexual development began at thirteen years erotic dreams began at twelve Their appearance was preceded in most cases for some months by erections In thirty seven per cent of the cases there had been no actual sexual experiences either masturbation or intercourse in twenty three per cent there had been masturbation in the rest some form of sexual contact The dreams are mainly visual tactual elements coming second and the dramatis persona is either an unknown woman twenty seven per cent cases or only known by sight fifty six per cent and in the majority is at all events in the beginning an ugly or fantastic figure becoming more attractive later in life but never identical with the woman loved during waking life This as Gualino points out accords with the general tendency for the emotions of the day to be latent in sleep Masturbation only formed the subject of the dream in four cases The emotional state in the pubertal stage apart from pleasure was anxiety thirty seven per cent desire seventeen per cent fear fourteen per cent In the adult stage anxiety and fear receded to seven per cent and six per cent respectively Thirty three of the subjects as a result of sexual or general disturbances had had nocturnal emissions without dreams these were always found exhausting Normally in more than ninety per cent erotic dreams are the most vivid of all dreams In no case was there knowledge of any monthly or other cyclic periodicity in the occurrence of the manifestations In thirty four per cent of cases they tended to occur very soon after sexual intercourse In numerous cases they were peculiarly frequent even three in one night during courtship when the young man was in the habit of kissing and caressing his betrothed but ceased after marriage It was not noted that position in bed or a full bladder exerted any marked influence in the occurrence of erotic dreams repletion of the seminal vesicles is regarded as the main factor In Germany erotic dreams have been discussed by Volkelt Die Traum Phantasie eighteen seventy five pp seventy eight eighty two and especially by Loewenfeld Sexual Probleme Oct nineteen oh eight while in America Stanley Hall thus summarizes the general characteristics of erotic dreams in men In by far the most cases consciousness even when the act causes full awakening from sleep finds only scattered images single words gestures and acts many of which would perhaps normally constitute no provocation Many times the mental activity seems to be remote and incidental and the mind retains in the morning nothing except perhaps a peculiar dress pattern the shape of a finger nail the back of a neck the toss of a head the movement of a foot or the dressing of the hair In such cases these images stand out for a time with the distinctness of a cameo and suggest that the origin of erotic fetichisms is largely to be found in sexual dreams Very rarely is there any imagery of the organs themselves but the tendency to irradiation is so strong as to re enforce the suggestion of so many other phenomena in this field that nature designs this experience to be long circuited and that it may give a peculiar ictus to almost any experience When waking occurs just afterward it seems at least possible that there may be much imagery that existed but failed to be recalled to memory possibly because the flow of psychic impressions was over very familiar fields and this therefore was forgotten while any eruption into new or unwonted channels stood out with distinctness All these psychic phenomena although very characteristic of man in his prime are not so of the dreams of dawning puberty which are far more vivid G Stanley Hall Adolescence vol i p four hundred fifty five I may further quote the experience of an anonymous contributor a healthy and chaste man between thirty and thirty eight years of age to the American Journal of Psychology Nocturnal Emissions Jan nineteen oh four Legs and breasts often figured prominently in these dreams the other sexual parts however very seldom and then they turned out to be male organs in most cases There were but two instances of copulation dreamt Girls and young women were the usual dramatis personae and curiously enough often the aggressors Sometimes the face or faces were well known sometimes only once seen sometimes entirely unknown The orgasm occurs at the most erotic part of the dream the physical and psychical running parallel This most erotic or suggestive part of the dream was very often quite an innocent looking incident enough As for example while passing a strange young woman overtaken on the street she calls after me some question At first I pay no heed but when she calls again I hesitate whether to turn back and answer or not emission Again walking beside a young woman she said Shall I take your arm I offered it and she took it entwining her arm around it and raising it high emission I could feel stronger erection as she asked the question Sometimes a word was enough sometimes a gesture Once emission took place on my noticing the young woman s diminished finger nails Another example of fetichism was my being curiously attracted in a dream by the pretty embroidered figure on a little girl s dress As an illustration of the strange metamorphoses that occur in dreams I one night in my dream I had been observing partridges in the summer fell in love with a partridge which changed under my caresses to a beautiful girl who yet retained an indescribable wild bird innocence grace and charm a sort of Undina These experiences may be regarded as fairly typical of the erotic dreams of healthy and chaste young men The bird for instance that changes into a woman while retaining some elements of the bird has been encountered in erotic dreams by other young men It is indeed remarkable that as De Gubernatis observes the bird is a well known phallic symbol while Maeder finds Interpretations de Quelques Reves Archives de Psychologie April nineteen oh seven that birds have a sexual significance both in life and in dreams The appearance of male organs in the dream woman is doubtless due to the dreamer s greater familiarity with those organs but though it occurs occasionally it can scarcely be said to be the rule in erotic dreams Even men who have never had connection with a woman are quite commonly aware of the presence of a woman s sexual organs in their erotic dreams Moll s comparison of nocturnal emissions of semen with nocturnal incontinence of urine suggests an interesting resemblance and at the same time seeming contrast In both cases we are concerned with viscera which when overfilled or unduly irritable spasmodically eject their contents during sleep There is a further resemblance which usually becomes clear when as occasionally happens nocturnal incontinence of urine persists on to late childhood or adolescence both phenomena are frequently accompanied by vivid dreams of appropriate character See e g Ries Ueber Enuresis Nocturna Monatsschrift fuer Harnkrankheiten und Sexuelle Hygiene nineteen oh four A P Buchan nearly a century ago pointed out the psychic element in the experiences of young persons who wetted the bed Venus sine Concubitu eighteen sixteen p forty seven Thus in one case known to me a child of seven who occasionally wetted the bed usually dreamed at the same time that she wanted to make water and was out of doors running to find a suitable spot which she at last found and on awaking discovered that she had wetted the bed fifteen years later she still sometimes had similar dreams which caused her much alarm until when thoroughly awake she realized that no accident had happened these later dreams were not the result of any actual strong desire to urinate In another case with which I am acquainted a little girl of eight after mental excitement or indigestible meals occasionally wetted the bed dreaming that she was frightened by some one running after her and wetted herself in consequence after the manner of the Ganymede in the eagle s clutch as depicted by Rembrandt These two cases it may be noted belong to two quite different types In the first case the full bladder suggests to imagination the appropriate actions for relief and the bladder actually accepts the imaginative solution offered it is according to Fiorani s phrase somnambulism of the bladder In the other case there is no such somnambulism but a psychic and nervous disturbance not arising in the bladder at all irradiates convulsively and whether or not the bladder is overfull attacks a vesical nervous system which is not yet sufficiently well balanced to withstand the inflow of excitement In children of somewhat nervous temperament manifestations of this kind may occur as an occasional accident up to about the age of seven or eight and thereafter the nervous control of the bladder having become firmly established they cease to happen the nervous energy required to affect the bladder sufficing to awake the dreamer In very rare cases however the phenomenon may still occasionally happen even in adolescence or later in individuals who are otherwise quite free from it This is most apt to occur in young women even in waking life In men it is probably extremely rare The erotic dream seems to differ flagrantly from the vesical dream in that it occurs in adult life and is with difficulty brought under control The contrast is however very superficial When we remember that sexual activity only begins normally at puberty we realize that the youth of twenty is in the matter of sexual control scarcely much older than in the matter of vesical control he was at the age of six Moreover if we were habitually from our earliest years to go to bed with a full bladder as the chaste man goes to bed with unrelieved sexual system it would be fully as difficult to gain vesical control during sleep as it now is to gain sexual control Ultimately such sexual control is attained after the age of forty it seems that erotic dreams with emission become more and more rare either the dream occurs without actual emission exactly as dreams of urination occur in adults with full bladder or else the organic stress with or without dreams serves to awaken the sleeper before any emission has occurred But this stage is not easily or completely attained saint Augustine even at the period when he wrote his Confessions mentions as a matter of course that sexual dreams not merely arouse pleasure but gain the consent of the will X forty one Not infrequently there is a struggle in sleep just as the hypnotic subject may resist suggestions thus a lady of thirty five dreamed a sexual dream and awoke without excitement again she fell asleep and had another dream of sexual character but resisted the tendency to excitement and again awoke finally she fell asleep and had a third sexual dream which was this time accompanied by the orgasm This has recently been described also by Naecke who terms it pollutio interrupta Neurologisches Centralblatt Oct sixteen nineteen oh nine the corresponding voluntary process in the waking state is described by Rohleder and termed masturbatio interrupta Zeitschrift fuer Sexualwissenschaft Aug nineteen oh eight The factors involved in the acquirement of vesical and sexual control during sleep are the same but the conditions are somewhat different There is a very intimate connection between the vesical and the sexual spheres as I have elsewhere pointed out see e g in the third volume of these Studies Analysis of the Sexual Impulse This connection is psychic as well as organic Both in men and women a full bladder tends to develop erotic dreams See e g K A Scherner Das Leben des Traums eighteen sixty one pp one hundred eighty seven et seq Spitta also points out the connection between vesical and erotic dreams Die Schlaf und Traumzustaende twod ed eighteen eighty two pp two hundred fifty et seq Raymond and Janet state Les Obscessions vol ii p one hundred thirty five that nocturnal incontinence of urine accompanied by dreams of urination may be replaced at puberty by masturbation In the reverse direction Freud believes Monatsschrift fuer Psychiatrie Bd XVIII p four hundred thirty three that masturbation plays a large part in causing the bed wetting of children who have passed the age when that usually ceases and he even finds that children are themselves aware of the connection The diagnostic value of sexual dreams as an indication of the sexual nature of the subject when awake has been emphasized by various writers E g Moll Die Kontraere Sexualempfindung Ch IX Naecke Der Traum als feinstes Reagens fuer die Art des sexuellen Empfindens Monatsschrift fuer Kriminalpsychologie nineteen oh five p five hundred Sexual dreams tend to reproduce and even to accentuate those characteristics which make the strongest sexual appeal to the subject when awake At the same time this general statement has to be qualified more especially as regards inverted dreams In the first place a young man however normal who is not familiar with the feminine body when awake is not likely to see it when asleep even in dreams of women in the second place the confusions and combinations of dream imagery often tend to obliterate sexual distinctions however free from perversions the subjects may be Thus a correspondent tells me of a healthy man of very pure character totally inexperienced in sexual matters and never having seen a woman naked who in his sexual dreams always sees the woman with male organs though he has never had any sexual inclinations for men and is much in love with a lady The confusions and associations of dream imagery leading to abnormal combinations may be illustrated by a dream which once occurred to me after reading Joest s account of how a young negress whose tattoo marks he was sketching having become bored suddenly pressed her hands to her breasts spirting two streams of lukewarm milk into his face and ran away laughing I dreamed of a woman performing a similar action not from her breasts however but from a penis with which she was furnished Again by another kind of confusion a man dreams sexually that he is with a man although the figure of the partner revealed in the dream is a woman The following dream in a normal man who had never been or wished to be in the position shown by the dream may be quoted I dreamed that I was a big boy and that a younger boy lay close beside me and that we or certainly he had seminal emissions I was complacently passive and had a feeling of shame when the boy was discovered On awaking I found I had had no emission but was lying very close to my wife The day before I had seen boys in a swimming match This was it seems to me an example of dream confusion and not an erotic inverted dream Naecke also brings forward inverted dreams by normal persons see e g his Beitraege zu den sexuellen Traeumen Archiv fuer Kriminal Anthropologie Bd XX nineteen oh eight p three hundred sixty six So far as I have been able to ascertain there seem to be generally speaking certain differences in the manifestations of auto erotism during sleep in men and women which I believe to be not without psychological significance In men the phenomenon is fairly simple it usually appears about puberty continues at intervals of varying duration during sexual life provided the individual is living chastely and is generally though not always accompanied by erotic dreams which lead up to the climax its occurrence being to some extent influenced by a variety of circumstances physical mental or emotional excitement alcohol taken before retiring position in bed as lying on the back the state of the bladder sometimes the mere fact of being in a strange bed and to some extent apparently by the existence of monthly and yearly rhythms On the whole it is a fairly definite and regular phenomenon which usually leaves little conscious trace on awaking beyond probably some sense of fatigue and occasionally a headache In women however the phenomena of auto erotism during sleep seem to be much more irregular varied and diffused So far as I have been able to make inquiries it is the exception rather than the rule for girls to experience definitely erotic dreams about the period of puberty or adolescence two hundred thirty eight Auto erotic phenomena during sleep in women who have never experienced the orgasm when awake are usually of a very vague kind while it is the rule in a chaste youth for the orgasm thus to manifest itself it is the exception in a chaste girl It is not as a rule until the orgasm has been definitely produced in the waking state under whatever conditions it may have been produced that it begins to occur during sleep and even in a strongly sexual woman living a repressed life it is often comparatively infrequent two hundred thirty nine Thus a young medical woman who endeavors to deal strenuously with her physical sexual emotions writes I sleep soundly and do not dream at all Occasionally but very rarely I have had sensations which awakened me suddenly They can scarcely be called dreams for they are mere impulses nothing connected or coherent yet prompted I know by sexual feeling This is probably an experience common to all Another lady with a restrained psycho sexual tendency to be attracted to both sexes states that her first sexual sensations with orgasm were felt in dreams at the age of sixteen but these dreams which she has now forgotten were not agreeable and not erotic two or three years later spontaneous orgasm began to occur occasionally when awake and after this orgasm took place regularly once or twice a week in sleep but still without erotic dreams she merely dreamt that the orgasm was occurring and awoke as it took place It is possible that to the comparative rarity in chaste women of complete orgasm during sleep we may in part attribute the violence with which repressed sexual emotion in women often manifests itself two hundred forty There is thus a difference here between men and women which is of some significance when we are considering the natural satisfaction of the sexual impulse in chaste women In women who have become accustomed to sexual intercourse erotic dreams of fully developed character occur with complete orgasm and accompanying relief as may occasionally be the case in women who are not acquainted with actual intercourse two hundred forty one some women however even when familiar with actual coitus find that sexual dreams though accompanied by emissions are only the symptoms of desire and do not produce actual relief Some interest attaches to cases in which young women even girls at puberty experience dreams of erotic character or at all events dream concerning coitus or men in erection although they profess and almost certainly with truth to be quite ignorant of sexual phenomena Several such dreams of remarkable character have been communicated to me One can imagine that the psychologists of some schools would see in these dreams the spontaneous eruption of the experiences of the race I am inclined to regard them as forgotten memories such as we know to occur sometimes in sleep The child has somehow seen or heard of sexual phenomena and felt no interest and the memory may subsequently be aroused in sleep under the stimulation of new born sexual sensations It is a curious proof of the ignorance which has prevailed in recent times concerning the psychic sexual nature of women that although in earlier ages the fact that women are normally liable to erotic dreams was fully recognized in recent times it has been denied even by writers who have made a special study of the sexual impulse in women Eulenburg Sexuale Neuropathie eighteen ninety five pp thirty one seventy nine appears to regard the appearances of sexual phenomena during sleep in women as the result of masturbation Adler in what is in many respects an extremely careful study of sexual phenomena in women Die Mangelhafte Geschlechtsempfindung des Weibes nineteen oh four p one hundred thirty boldly states that they do not have erotic dreams In eighteen forty seven E Guibout Des Pollutions Involontaires chez la Femme Union Medicale p two hundred sixty presented the case of a married lady who masturbated from the age of ten and continued the practice even after her marriage at twenty four and at twenty nine began to have erotic dreams with emissions every few nights and later sometimes even several times a night though they ceased to be voluptuous he believed the case to be the first ever reported of such a condition in a woman Yet thousands of years ago the Indian of Vedic days recognized erotic dreams in women as an ordinary and normal occurrence Loewenfeld quotes a passage to this effect from the Oupnek hat Sexualleben und Nervenleiden twod ed p one hundred fourteen Even savages recognize the occurrence of erotic dreams in women as normal for the Papuans for instance believe that a young girl s first menstruation is due to intercourse with the moon in the shape of a man the girl dreaming that a man is embracing her Reports Cambridge Expedition to Torres Straits vol v p two hundred six In the seventeenth century Rolfincius in a well informed study De Pollutione Nocturna a Jena Inaugural Dissertation sixteen sixty seven concluded that women experience such manifestations and quotes Aristotle Galen and Fernelius in the same sense Sir Thomas Overbury in his Characters written in the early part of the same century describing the ideal milkmaid says that her dreams are so chaste that she dare tell them clearly implying that It was not so with most women The notion that women are not subject to erotic dreams thus appears to be of comparatively recent origin One of the most interesting and important characters by which the erotic dreams of women and indeed their dreams generally differ from those of men is in the tendency to evoke a repercussion on the waking life a tendency more rarely noted in men s erotic dreams and then only to a minor extent This is very common even in healthy and normal women and is exaggerated to a high degree in neurotic subjects by whom the dream may even be interpreted as a reality and so declared on oath a fact of practical importance Hersman having met with a case in which a school girl with chorea after having dreamed of an assault accused the principal of a school of assault securing his conviction obtained the opinions of various American alienists as to the frequency with which such dreams in unstable mental subjects lead to delusions and criminal accusations Dercum H C Wood and Rohe had not personally met with such cases Burr believed that there was strong evidence that a sexual dream may be so vivid as to make the subject believe she has had sexual congress Kiernan knew of such cases C H Hughes in persons with every appearance of sanity had known the erotic dreams of the night to become the erotic delusions of the day the patient protesting violently the truth of her story while Hersman reports the case two hundred forty two of a young lady in an asylum who had nightly delusions that a medical officer visited her every night and had to do with her coming up the hot air flue I am acquainted with a similar case in a clever but highly neurotic young woman who writes For years I have been trying to stamp out my passional nature and was beginning to succeed when a strange thing happened to me last autumn One night as I lay in bed I felt an influence so powerful that a man seemed present with me I crimsoned with shame and wonder I remember that I lay upon my back and marveled when the spell had passed The influence I was assured came from a priest whom I believed in and admired above everyone in the world I had never dreamed of love in connection with him because I always thought him so far above me The influence has been upon me ever since sometimes by day and nearly always by night from it I generally go into a deep sleep which lasts until morning I am always much refreshed when I awake This influence has the best effect upon my life that anything has ever had as regards health and mind It is the knowledge that I am loved fittingly that makes me so indifferent to my future What worries me is that I sometimes wonder if I suffer from a nervous disorder merely The subject thus seemed to regard these occurrences as objectively caused but was sufficiently sane to wonder whether her experiences were not due to mental disorder two hundred forty three The tendency of the auto erotic phenomena of sleep to be manifested with such energy as to flow over into the waking life and influence conscious emotion and action while very well marked in normal and healthy women is seen to an exaggerated extent in hysterical women in whom it has therefore chiefly been studied Sante de Sanctis who has investigated the dreams of many classes of people remarks on the frequently sexual character of the dreams of hysterical women and the repercussion of such dreams on the waking life of the following day he gives a typical case of hysterical erotic dreaming in an uneducated servant girl of twenty three in whom such dreams occur usually a few days before the menstrual period her dreams especially if erotic make an enormous impression on her in the morning she is bad tempered if they were unpleasant while she feels lascivious and gives herself up to masturbation if she has had erotic dreams of men she then has a feeling of pleasure throughout the day and her sexual organs are bathed with moisture two hundred forty four Pitres and Gilles de la Tourette two of Charcot s most distinguished pupils in their elaborate works on hysteria both consider that dreams generally have a great influence on the waking life of the hysterical and they deal with the special influence of erotic dreams to which doubtless we must refer those conceptions of incubi and succubi which played so vast and so important a part in the demonology of the Middle Ages and while not unknown in men were most frequent in women Such erotic dreams as these observers confirming the experience of old writers have found among the hysterical to day are by no means always or even usually of a pleasurable character It is very rare Pitres remarks when insisting on the sexual character of the hallucinations of the hysterical for these erotic hallucinations to be accompanied by agreeable voluptuous sensations In most cases the illusion of sexual intercourse even provokes acute pain The witches of old times nearly all affirmed that in their relations with the devil they suffered greatly two hundred forty five They said that his organ was long and rough and pointed with scales which lifted on withdrawal and tore the vagina It seems probable I may remark that the witches representations both of the devil and of sexual intercourse were largely influenced by familiarity with the coupling of animals As Gilles de la Tourette is careful to warn his readers we must not too hastily assume from the prevalence of nocturnal auto erotic phenomena in hysterical women that such women are necessarily sexual and libidinous in excess the disorder is in them psychic he points out and not physical and they usually receive sexual approaches with indifference and repugnance because their sexual centres are anaesthetic or hyperaesthetic During the period of sexual activity they seek much more the care and delicate attention of men than the genital act which they often only tolerate Many households begun under the happiest auspices the bride all the more apt to believe that she loves her betrothed in virtue of her suggestibility easily exalted perhaps at the expense of the senses become hells on earth The sexual act has for the hysterical woman more than one disillusion she cannot understand it it inspires her with insurmountable repugnance two hundred forty six I refer to these hysterical phenomena because they present to us in an extreme form facts which are common among women whom under the artificial conditions of civilized life we are compelled to regard as ordinarily healthy and normal The frequent painfulness of auto erotic phenomena is by no means an exclusively hysterical phenomenon although often seen in a heightened form in hysterical conditions It is probably to some extent simply the result of a conflict in consciousness with a merely physical impulse which is strong enough to assert itself in spite of the emotional and intellectual abhorrence of the subject It is thus but an extreme form of the disgust which all sexual physical manifestations tend to inspire in a person who is not inclined to respond to them Somewhat similar psychic disgust and physical pain are produced in the attempts to stimulate the sexual emotions and organs when these are exhausted by exercise In the detailed history which Moll presents of the sexual experiences of a sister in an American nursing guild a most instructive history of a woman fairly normal except for the results of repressed sexual emotion and with strong moral tendencies various episodes are narrated well illustrating the way in which sexual excitement becomes unpleasant or even painful when it takes place as a physical reflex which the emotions and intellect are all the time struggling against two hundred forty seven It is quite probable however that there is a physiological as well as a psychic factor in this phenomenon and Sollier in his elaborate study of the nature and genesis of hysteria by insisting on the capital importance of the disturbance of sensibility in hysteria and the definite character of the phenomena produced in the passage between anaesthesia and normal sensation has greatly helped to reveal the mechanism of this feature of auto erotic excitement in the hysterical No doubt there has been a tendency to exaggerate the unpleasant character of the auto erotic phenomena of hysteria That tendency was an inevitable reaction against an earlier view according to which hysteria was little more than an unconscious expression of the sexual emotions and as such was unscientifically dismissed without any careful investigation I agree with Breuer and Freud that the sexual needs of the hysterical are just as individual and various as those of normal women but that they suffer from them more largely through a moral struggle with their own instincts and the attempt to put them into the background of consciousness two hundred forty eight In many hysterical and psychically abnormal women auto erotic phenomena and sexual phenomena generally are highly pleasurable though such persons may be quite innocent of any knowledge of the erotic character of the experience I have come across interesting and extreme examples of this in the published experiences of the women followers of the American religious leader T L Harris founder of the Brotherhood of the New Life Thus in a pamphlet entitled Internal Respiration by Respiro a letter is quoted from a lady physician who writes One morning I awoke with a strange new feeling in the womb which lasted for a day or two I was so very happy but the joy was in my womb not in my heart two hundred forty nine At last writes a lady quoted in the same pamphlet I fell into a slumber lying on my back with arms and feet folded a position I almost always find myself in when I awake no matter in which position I may go to sleep Very soon I awoke from this slumber with a most delightful sensation every fibre tingling with an exquisite glow of warmth I was lying on my left side something I am never able to do and was folded in the arms of my counterpart Unless you have seen it I cannot give you an idea of the beauty of his flesh and with what joy I beheld and felt it Think of it luminous flesh and Oh such tints you never could imagine without seeing He folded me so closely in his arms et cetera In such cases there is no conflict between the physical and the psychic and therefore the resulting excitement is pleasurable and not painful At this point our study of auto erotism brings us into the sphere of mysticism Leuba in a penetrating and suggestive essay on Christian mysticism after quoting the present Study refers to the famous passages in which saint Theresa describes how a beautiful little angel inserted a flame tipped dart into her heart until it descended into her bowels and left her inflamed with divine love What physiological difference he asks is there between this voluptuous sensation and that enjoyed by the disciple of the Brotherhood of New Life saint Theresa says bowels the woman doctor says womb that is all two hundred fifty The extreme form of auto erotism is the tendency for the sexual emotion to be absorbed and often entirely lost in self admiration This Narcissus like tendency of which the normal germ in women is symbolized by the mirror is found in a minor degree in some men and is sometimes well marked in women usually in association with an attraction for other persons to which attraction it is of course normally subservient The mirror remarks Bloch Beitraege one p two hundred one plays an important part in the genesis of sexual aberration It cannot be doubted that many a boy and girl have first experienced sexual excitement at the sight of their own bodies in a mirror Valera the Spanish novelist very well described this impulse in his Genio y Figura Rafaela the heroine of this novel says that after her bath I fall into a puerility which may be innocent or vicious I cannot decide I only know that it is a purely contemplative act a disinterested admiration of beauty It is not coarse sensuality but aesthetic platonism I imitate Narcissus and I apply my lips to the cold surface of the mirror and kiss my image It is the love of beauty the expression of tenderness and affection for what God has made manifest in an ingenuous kiss imprinted on the empty and incorporeal reflection In the same spirit the real heroine of the Tagebuch einer Verlorenen p one hundred fourteen at the point when she was about to become a prostitute wrote I am pretty It gives me pleasure to throw off my clothes one by one before the mirror and to look at myself just as I am white as snow and straight as a fir with my long fine hair like a cloak of black silk When I spread abroad the black stream of it with both hands I am like a white swan with black wings A typical case known to me is that of a lady of twenty eight brought up on a farm She is a handsome woman of very large and fine proportions active and healthy and intelligent with however no marked sexual attraction to the opposite sex at the same time she is not inverted though she would like to be a man and has a considerable degree of contempt for women She has an intense admiration for her own person especially her limbs she is never so happy as when alone and naked in her own bedroom and so far as possible she cultivates nakedness She knows by heart the various measurements of her body is proud of the fact that they are strictly in accordance with the canons of proportion and she laughs proudly at the thought that her thigh is larger than many a woman s waist She is frank and assured in her manners without sexual shyness and while willing to receive the attention and admiration of others she makes no attempt to gain it and seems never to have experienced any emotions stronger than her own pleasure in herself I should add that I have had no opportunity of detailed examination and cannot speak positively as to the absence of masturbation In the extreme form in which alone the name of Narcissus may properly be invoked there is comparative indifference to sexual intercourse or even the admiration of the opposite sex Such a condition seems to be rare except perhaps in insanity Since I called attention to this form of auto erotism Alienist and Neurologist April eighteen ninety eight several writers have discussed the condition especially Naecke who following out the suggestion terms the condition Narcissism Among fifteen hundred insane persons Naecke has found it in four men and one woman Psychiatrische en Neurologische Bladen No two eighteen ninety nine doctor C H Hughes writes in a private letter that he is acquainted with such cases in which men have been absorbed in admiration of their own manly forms and of their sexual organs and women likewise absorbed in admiration of their own mammae and physical proportions especially of limbs The whole subject he adds is a singular phase of psychology and it is not all morbid psychology either It is closely allied to that aesthetic sense which admires the nude in art Fere L Instinct Sexuel twod ed p two hundred seventy one mentions a woman who experienced sexual excitement in kissing her own hand Naecke knew a woman in an asylum who during periodical fits of excitement would kiss her own arms and hands at the same time looking like a person in love He also knew a young man with dementia praecox who would kiss his own image Der Kuss bei Geisteskranken Allgemeine Zeitschrift fuer Psychiatrie Bd LXIII p one hundred twenty seven Moll refers to a young homosexual lawyer who experienced great pleasure in gazing at himself in a mirror Kontraere Sexualempfindung threed ed p two hundred twenty eight and mentions another inverted man an

Theil I p sixty Krafft Ebing knew a man who masturbated before a mirror imagining at the same time how much better a real lover would be The best observed cases of Narcissism have however been

hundred twenty five of Berliner Klinik March nineteen oh seven In the two cases investigated by Rohleder both men there was sexual excitement in the contemplation of the individual s own body actually or in a mirror with little or no sexual attraction to other persons Rohleder is inclined to regard the condition as due to a congenital defect in the sexual centre of the brain FOOTNOTES one hundred

opinion expressed by doctor Elizabeth Blackwell that while the sexual impulse in man is usually relieved by seminal emissions during sleep in women it is relieved by the occurrence of menstruation This latter statement is flagrantly at variance with the facts but it may perhaps be quoted in support of the view expressed above as to the comparative rarity of sexual excitement during sleep in young girls two hundred thirty nine Loewenfeld has recently expressed the same opinion Rohleder believes that pollutions are physically impossible in a real virgin but that opinion is too extreme two hundred forty It may be added that in more or less neurotic women and girls erotic dreams may be very frequent and depressing Thus J M Fothergill West Riding Asylum Report eighteen seventy six vol vi remarks These dreams are much more frequent than is ordinarily thought and are the cause of a great deal of nervous depression among women Women of a highly nervous diathesis suffer much more from these drains than robust women Not only are these involuntary orgasms more frequent among such women but they cause more disturbance of the general health in them than in other women two hundred forty one I may remark here that a Russian correspondent considers that I have greatly underestimated the frequency of erotic manifestations during sleep in young girls All the women I have interrogated on this point he informs me say that they have had such pollutions from the time of puberty or even earlier accompanied by erotic dreams I have put the question to some twenty or thirty women It is true that they were of southern race Italian Spanish and French and I believe that Southerners are in this matter franker than northern women who consider the activity of the flesh as shameful and seek to conceal it My correspondent makes no reference to the chief point of sexual difference so far as my observation goes which is that erotic dreams are comparatively rare in those women who have yet had no sort of sexual experience in waking life Whether or not this is correct I do not question the frequency of erotic dreams in girls who have had such experience two hundred forty two C C Hersman

Fallacies Involved Charcot s Attitude the Outcome of his Personal Temperament Breuer and Freud Their Views Supplement and Complete Charcot s At the Same Time they Furnish a Justification for the Earlier Doctrine of Hysteria But They Must Not be Regarded as Final The Diffused Hysteroid Condition in Normal Persons The Physiological Basis of Hysteria True Pathological Hysteria is Linked on to almost Normal States especially to Sex hunger The nocturnal hallucinations of hysteria as all careful students of this condition now seem to agree are closely allied to the hysterical attack proper Sollier indeed one of the ablest of the more recent investigators of hysteria has argued with much force that the subjects of hysteria really live in a state of pathological sleep of vigilambulism two hundred fifty one He regards all the various accidents of hysteria as having a common basis in disturbances of sensibility in the widest sense of the word sensibility as the very foundation of personality while anaesthesia is the real sigillum hysteriae Whatever the form of hysteria we are thus only concerned with a more or less profound state of vigilambulism a state in which the subject seems often even to himself to be more or less always asleep whether the sleep may be regarded as local or general Sollier agrees with Fere that the disorder of sensibility may be regarded as due to an exhaustion of the sensory centres of the brain whether as the result of constitutional cerebral weakness of the shock of a violent emotion or of some toxic influence on the cerebral cells We may therefore fitly turn from the auto erotic phenomena of sleep which in women generally and especially in hysterical women seem to possess so much importance and significance to the question which has been so divergently answered at different periods and by different investigators concerning the causation of hysteria and especially concerning its alleged connection with conscious or unconscious sexual emotion two hundred fifty two It was the belief of the ancient Greeks that hysteria came from the womb hence its name We first find that statement in Plato s Timaeus In men the organ of generation becoming rebellious and masterful like an animal disobedient to reason and maddened with the sting of lust seeks to gain absolute sway and the same is the case with the so called womb or uterus of women the animal within them is desirous of procreating children and when remaining unfruitful long beyond its proper time gets discontented and angry and wandering in every direction through the body closes up the passages of the breath and by obstructing respiration two hundred fifty three drives them to extremity causing all varieties of disease Plato it is true cannot be said to reveal anywhere a very scientific attitude toward Nature Yet he was here probably only giving expression to the current medical doctrine of his day We find precisely the same doctrine attributed to Hippocrates though without a clear distinction between hysteria and epilepsy two hundred fifty four If we turn to the best Roman physicians we find again that Aretaeus the Esquirol of antiquity has set forth the same view adding to his description of the movements of the womb in hysteria It delights also in fragrant smells and advances toward them and it has an aversion to foetid smells and flies from them and on the whole the womb is like an animal within an animal two hundred fifty five Consequently the treatment was by applying foetid smells to the nose and rubbing fragrant ointments around the sexual parts two hundred fifty six The Arab physicians who carried on the traditions of Greek medicine appear to have said nothing new about hysteria and possibly had little knowledge of it In Christian mediaeval Europe also nothing new was added to the theory of hysteria it was indeed less known medically than it had ever been and in part it may be as a result of this ignorance in part as a result of general wretchedness the hysterical phenomena of witchcraft reaching their height Michelet points out in the fourteenth century which was a period of special misery for the poor it flourished more vigorously Not alone have we the records of nervous epidemics but illuminated manuscripts ivories miniatures bas reliefs frescoes and engravings furnish the most vivid iconographic evidence of the prevalence of hysteria in its most violent forms during the Middle Ages Much of this evidence is brought to the service of science in the fascinating works of doctor P Richer one of Charcot s pupils two hundred fifty seven In the seventeenth century Ambroise Pare was still talking like Hippocrates about suffocation of the womb Forestus was still like Aretaeus applying friction to the vulva Fernel was still reproaching Galen who had denied that the movements of the womb produced hysteria It was in the seventeenth century sixteen eighteen that a French physician Charles Lepois Carolus Piso physician to Henry II trusting as he said to experience and reason overthrew at one stroke the doctrine of hysteria that had ruled almost unquestioned for two thousand years and showed that the malady occurred at all ages and in both sexes that its seat was not in the womb but in the brain and that it must be considered a nervous disease two hundred fifty eight So revolutionary a doctrine could not fail to meet with violent opposition but it was confirmed by Willis and in sixteen eighty one we owe to the genius of Sydenham a picture of hysteria which for lucidity precision and comprehensiveness has only been excelled in our own times It was not possible any longer to maintain the womb theory of Hippocrates in its crude form but in modified forms and especially with the object of preserving the connection which many observers continued to find between hysteria and the sexual emotions it still found supporters in the eighteenth and even the nineteenth centuries James in the middle of the eighteenth century returned to the classical view and in his Dictionary of Medicine maintained that the womb is the seat of hysteria Louyer Villermay in eighteen sixteen asserted that the most frequent causes of hysteria are deprivation of the pleasures of love griefs connected with this passion and disorders of menstruation Foville in eighteen thirty three and Landouzy in eighteen forty six advocated somewhat similar views The acute Laycock in eighteen forty quoted as almost a medical proverb the saying Salacitas major major ad hysteriam proclivitas fully indorsing it More recently still Clouston has defined hysteria as the loss of the inhibitory influence exercised on the reproductive and sexual instincts of women by the higher mental and moral functions a position evidently requiring some modification in view of the fact that hysteria is by no means confined to women while the same authority remarks that more or less concealed sexual phenomena are the chief symptoms of hysterical insanity two hundred fifty nine Two gynaecologists of high position in different parts of the world Hegar in Germany and Balls Headley in Australia attribute hysteria as well as anaemia largely to unsatisfied sexual desire including the non satisfaction of the ideal feelings two hundred sixty Lombroso and Ferrero again while admitting that the sexual feelings might be either heightened or depressed in hysteria referred to the frequency of what they termed a paradoxical sexual instinct in the hysterical by which for instance sexual frigidity is combined with intense sexual pre occupations and they also pointed out the significant fact that the crimes of the hysterical nearly always revolve around the sexual sphere two hundred sixty one Thus even up to the time when the conception of hysteria which absolutely ignored and excluded any sexual relationship whatever had reached its height independent views favoring such a relationship still found expression Of recent years however such views usually aroused violent antagonism The main current of opinion was with Briquet eighteen fifty nine who treating the matter with considerable ability and a wide induction of facts indignantly repelled the idea that there is any connection between hysteria and the sexual facts of life physical or psychic As he himself admitted Briquet was moved to deny a sexual causation of hysteria by the thought that such an origin would be degrading for women a quelque chose de degradant pour les femmes It was however the genius of Charcot and the influence of his able pupils which finally secured the overthrow of the sexual theory of hysteria Charcot emphatically anathematized the visceral origin of hysteria he declared that it is a psychic disorder and to leave no loop hole of escape for those who maintained a sexual causation he asserted that there are no varieties of hysteria that the disease is one and indivisible Charcot recognized no primordial cause of hysteria beyond heredity which here plays a more important part than in any other neuropathic condition Such heredity is either direct or more occasionally by transformation any deviation of nutrition found in the ancestors gout diabetes arthritis being a possible cause of hysteria in the descendants We do not know anything about the nature of hysteria Charcot wrote in eighteen ninety two we must make it objective in order to recognize it The dominant idea for us in the etiology of hysteria is in the widest sense its hereditary predisposition The greater number of those suffering from this affection are simply born hysterisables and on them the occasional causes act directly either through autosuggestion or by causing derangement of general nutrition and more particularly of the nutrition of the nervous system two hundred sixty two These views were ably and decisively stated in Gilles de la Tourette s Traite de l Hysterie written under the inspiration of Charcot While Charcot s doctrine was thus being affirmed and generally accepted there were at the same time workers in these fields who though they by no means ignored this doctrine of hysteria or even rejected it were inclined to think that it was too absolutely stated Writing in the Dictionary of Psychological Medicine at the same time as Charcot Donkin while deprecating any exclusive emphasis on the sexual causation pointed out the enormous part played by the emotions in the production of hysteria and the great influence of puberty in women due to the greater extent of the sexual organs and the consequently large area of central innervation involved and thus rendered liable to fall into a state of unstable equilibrium Enforced abstinence from the gratification of any of the inherent and primitive desires he pointed out may be an adequate exciting cause Such a view as this indicated that to set aside the ancient doctrine of a physical sexual cause of hysteria was by no means to exclude a psychic sexual cause Ten years earlier Axenfeld and Huchard had pointed out that the reaction against the sexual origin of hysteria was becoming excessive and they referred to the evidence brought forward by veterinary surgeons showing that unsatisfied sexual desire in animals may produce nervous symptoms very similar to hysteria two hundred sixty three The present writer when in eighteen ninety four briefly discussing hysteria as an element in secondary sexual characterization ventured to reflect the view confirmed by his own observation that there was a tendency to unduly minimize the sexual factor in hysteria and further pointed out that the old error of a special connection between hysteria and the female sexual organs probably arose from the fact that in woman the organic sexual sphere is larger than in man two hundred sixty four When indeed we analyze the foundation of the once predominant opinions of Charcot and his school regarding the sexual relationships of hysteria it becomes clear that many fallacies and misunderstandings were involved Briquet Charcot s chief predecessor acknowledged that his own view was that a sexual origin of hysteria would be degrading to women that is to say he admitted that he was influenced by a foolish and improper prejudice for the belief that the unconscious and involuntary morbid reaction of the nervous system to any disturbance of a great primary instinct can have quelque chose de degradant is itself an immoral belief such disturbance of the nervous system might or might not be caused but in any case the alleged degradation could only be the fiction of a distorted imagination Again confusion had been caused by the ancient error of making the physical sexual organs responsible for hysteria first the womb more recently the ovaries the outcome of this belief was the extirpation of the sexual organs for the cure of hysteria Charcot condemned absolutely all such operations as unscientific and dangerous declaring that there is no such thing as hysteria of menstrual origin two hundred sixty five Subsequently Angelucci and Pierracini carried out an international inquiry into the results of the surgical treatment of hysteria and condemned it in the most unqualified manner two hundred sixty six It is clearly demonstrated that the physical sexual organs are not the seat of hysteria It does not however follow that even physical sexual desire when repressed is not a cause of hysteria The opinion that it was so formed an essential part of the early doctrine of hysteria and was embodied in the ancient maxim Nubat illa et morbus effugiet The womb it seemed to the ancients was crying out for satisfaction and when that was received the disease vanished two hundred sixty seven But when it became clear that sexual desire though ultimately founded on the sexual apparatus is a nervous and psychic fact to put the sexual organs out of count was not sufficient for the sexual emotions may exist before puberty and persist after complete removal of the sexual organs Thus it has been the object of many writers to repel the idea that unsatisfied sexual desire can be a cause of hysteria Briquet pointed out that hysteria is rare among nuns and frequent among prostitutes Krafft Ebing believed that most hysterical women are not anxious for sexual satisfaction and declared that hysteria caused through the non satisfaction of the coarse sensual sexual impulse I have never seen two hundred sixty eight while Pitres and others refer to the frequently painful nature of sexual hallucinations in the hysterical But it soon becomes obvious that the psychic sexual sphere is not confined to the gratification of conscious physical sexual desire It is not true that hysteria is rare among nuns some of the most tremendous epidemics of hysteria and the most carefully studied having occurred in convents two hundred sixty nine while the hysterical phenomena sometimes associated with revivals are well known The supposed prevalence among prostitutes would not be evidence against the sexual relationships of hysteria it has however been denied even by so great an authority as Parent Duchatelet who found it very rare even in prostitutes in hospitals when it was often associated with masturbation in prostitutes however who returned to a respectable life giving up their old habits he found hysteria common and severe two hundred seventy The frequent absence of physical sexual feeling again may quite reasonably be taken as evidence of a disorder of the sexual emotions while the undoubted fact that sexual intercourse usually has little beneficial effect on pronounced hysteria and that sexual excitement during sleep and sexual hallucinations are often painful in the same condition is far from showing that injury or repression of the sexual emotions had nothing to do with the production of the hysteria It would be as reasonable to argue that the evil effect of a heavy meal on a starving man must be taken as evidence that he was not suffering from starvation The fact indeed on which Gilles de la Tourette and others have remarked that the hysterical often desire not so much sexual intercourse as simple affection would tend to show that there is here a real analogy and that starvation or lesion of the sexual emotions may produce like bodily starvation a rejection of those satisfactions which are demanded in health Thus even a mainly a priori examination of the matter may lead us to see that many arguments brought forward in favor of Charcot s position on this point fall to the ground when we realize that the sexual emotions may constitute a highly complex sphere often hidden from observation sometimes not conscious at all and liable to many lesions besides that due to the non satisfaction of sexual desire At the same time we are not thus enabled to overthrow any of the positive results attained by Charcot and his school It may however be pointed out that Charcot s attitude toward hysteria was the outcome of his own temperament He was primarily a neurologist the bent of his genius was toward the investigation of facts that could be objectively demonstrated His first interest in hysteria dating from as far back as eighteen sixty two was in hystero epileptic convulsive attacks and to the last he remained indifferent to all facts which could not be objectively demonstrated That was the secret of the advances he was enabled to make in neurology For purely psychological investigation he had no liking and probably no aptitude Anyone who was privileged to observe his methods of work at the Salpetriere will easily recall the great master s towering figure the disdainful expression sometimes even it seemed a little sour the lofty bearing which enthusiastic admirers called Napoleonic The questions addressed to the patient were cold distant sometimes impatient Charcot clearly had little faith in the value of any results so attained One may well believe also that a man whose superficial personality was so haughty and awe inspiring to strangers would in any case have had the greatest difficulty in penetrating the mysteries of a psychic world so obscure and elusive as that presented by the hysterical two hundred seventy one The way was thus opened for further investigations on the psychic side Charcot had affirmed the power not only of physical traumatism but even of psychic lesions of moral shocks to provoke its manifestations but his sole contribution to the psychology of this psychic malady and this was borrowed from the Nancy school lay in the one word suggestibility the nature and mechanism of this psychic process he left wholly unexplained This step has been taken by others in part by Janet who from eighteen eighty nine onward has not only insisted that the emotions stand in the first line among the causes of hysteria but has also pointed out some portion of the mechanism of this process thus he saw the significance of the fact already recognized that strong emotions tend to produce anaesthesia and to lead to a condition of mental disaggregation favorable to abulia or abolition of will power It remained to show in detail the mechanism by which the most potent of all the emotions effects its influence and by attempting to do this the Viennese investigators Breuer and especially Freud have greatly aided the study of hysteria two hundred seventy two They have not it is important to remark overturned the positive elements in their great forerunner s work Freud began as a disciple of Charcot and he himself remarks that in his earlier investigations of hysteria he had no thought of finding any sexual etiology for that malady he would have regarded any such suggestion as an insult to his patient The results reached by these workers were the outcome of long and detailed investigation Freud has investigated many cases of hysteria in minute detail often devoting to a single case over a hundred hours of work The patients unlike those on whom the results of the French school have been mainly founded all belonged to the educated classes and it was thus possible to carry out an elaborate psychic investigation which would be impossible among the uneducated Breuer and Freud insist on the fine qualities of mind and character frequently found among the hysterical They cannot accept suggestibility as an invariable characteristic of hysteria only abnormal excitability they are far from agreeing with Janet although on many points at one with him that psychic weakness marks hysteria there is merely an appearance of mental weakness they say because the mental activity of the hysterical is split up and only a part of it is conscious two hundred seventy three The superiority of character of the hysterical is indicated by the fact that the conflict between their ideas of right and the bent of their inclinations is often an element in the constitution of the hysterical state Breuer and Freud are prepared to assert that the hysterical are among the flower of humanity and they refer to those qualities of combined imaginative genius and practical energy which characterized saint Theresa the patron saint of the hysterical To understand the position of Breuer and Freud we may start from the phenomenon of nervous shock produced by physical traumatism often of a very slight character Charcot had shown that such nervous shock with the chain of resulting symptoms is nothing more or less than hysteria Breuer and Freud may be linked on to Charcot at this point They began by regarding the most typical hysteria as really a psychic traumatism that is to say that it starts in a lesion or rather in repeated lesions of the emotional organism It is true that the school of Charcot admitted the influence of moral shock especially of the emotion of fear but that merely as an agent provocateur and with a curious perversity Gilles de la Tourette certainly reflecting the attitude of Charcot in his elaborate treatise on hysteria fails to refer to the sphere of the sexual emotions even when enumerating the agents provocateurs two hundred seventy four The influence of fear is not denied by Breuer and Freud but they have found that careful psychic analysis frequently shows that the shock of a commonplace fear is really rooted in a lesion of the sexual emotions A typical and very simple illustration is furnished in a case recorded by Breuer in which a young girl of seventeen had her first hysterical attack after a cat sprang on her shoulders as she was going downstairs Careful investigation showed that this girl had been the object of somewhat ardent attentions from a young man whose advances she had resisted although her own sexual emotions had been aroused A few days before she had been surprised by this young man on these same dark stairs and had forcibly escaped from his hands Here was the real psychic traumatism the operation of which merely became manifest in the cat But in how many cases asks Breuer is a cat thus reckoned as a completely sufficient causa efficiens In every case that they have investigated Breuer and Freud have found some similar secret lesion of the psychic sexual sphere In one case a governess whose training has been severely upright is in spite of herself and without any encouragement led to experience for the father of the children under her care an affection which she refuses to acknowledge even to herself in another a young woman finds herself falling in love with her brother in law again an innocent girl suddenly discovers her uncle in the act of sexual intercourse with her playmate and a boy on his way home from school is subjected to the coarse advances of a sexual invert In nearly every case as Freud eventually found reason to believe a primary lesion of the sexual emotions dates from the period of puberty and frequently of childhood and in nearly every case the intimately private nature of the lesion causes it to be carefully hidden from everyone and even to be unacknowledged by the subject of it In the earlier cases Breuer and Freud found that a slight degree of hypnosis is necessary to bring the lesion into consciousness and the accuracy of the revelations thus obtained has been tested by independent witness Freud has however long abandoned the induction of any degree of hypnosis he simply tries to arrange that the patient shall feel absolutely free to tell her own story and so proceeds from the surface downwards slowly finding and piecing together such essential fragments of the history as may be recovered in the same way he remarks as the archaeologist excavates below the surface and recovers and puts together the fragments of an antique statue Much of the material found however has only a symbolic value requiring interpretation and is sometimes pure fantasy Freud now attaches great importance to dreams as symbolically representing much in the subject s mental history which is otherwise difficult to reach two hundred seventy five The subtle and slender clues which Freud frequently follows in interpreting dreams cannot fail sometimes to arouse doubt in his readers minds but he certainly seems to have been often successful in thus reaching latent facts in consciousness The primary lesion may thus act as a foreign body in consciousness Something is introduced into psychic life which refuses to merge in the general flow of consciousness It cannot be accepted simply as other facts of life are accepted it cannot even be talked about and so submitted to the slow usure by which our experiences are worn down and gradually transformed Breuer illustrates what happens by reference to the sneezing reflex When an irritation to the nasal mucous membrane for some reason fails to liberate this reflex a feeling of excitement and tension arises This excitement being unable to stream out along motor channels now spreads itself over the brain inhibiting other activities In the highest spheres of human activity we may watch the same process It is a result of this process that as Breuer and Freud found the mere act of confession may greatly relieve the hysterical symptoms produced by this psychic mechanism and in some cases may wholly and permanently remove them It is on this fact that they founded their method of treatment devised by Breuer and by him termed the cathartic method though Freud prefers to call it the analytic method It is as Freud points out the reverse of the hypnotic method of suggestive treatment there is the same difference Freud remarks between the two methods as Leonardo da Vinci found for the two technical methods of art per via di porre and per via di levare the hypnotic method like painting works by putting in the cathartic or analytic method like sculpture works by taking out two hundred seventy six It is part of the mechanism of this process as understood by these authors that the physical symptoms of hysteria are constituted by a process of conversion out of the injured emotions which then sink into the background or altogether out of consciousness Thus they found the prolonged tension of nursing a near and dear relative to be a very frequent factor in the production of hysteria For instance an originally rheumatic pain experienced by a daughter when nursing her father becomes the symbol in memory of her painful psychic excitement and this perhaps for several reasons but chiefly because its presence in consciousness almost exactly coincided with that excitement In another way again nausea and vomiting may become a symbol through the profound sense of disgust with which some emotional shock was associated Then the symbol begins to have a life of its own and draws hidden strength from the emotion with which it is correlated Breuer and Freud have found by careful investigation that the pains and physical troubles of hysteria are far from being capricious but may be traced in a varying manner to an origin in some incident some pain some action which was associated with a moment of acute psychic agony The process of conversion was an involuntary escape from an intolerable emotion comparable to the physical pain sometimes sought in intense mental grief and the patient wins some relief from the tortured emotions though at the cost of psychic abnormality of a more or less divided state of consciousness and of physical pain or else anaesthesia In Charcot s third stage of the hysterical convulsion that of attitudes passionnelles Breuer and Freud see the hallucinatory reproduction of a recollection which is full of significance for the origin of the hysterical manifestations The final result reached by these workers is clearly stated by each writer The main observation of our predecessors states Breuer two hundred seventy seven still preserved in the word hysteria is nearer to the truth than the more recent view which puts sexuality almost in the last line with the object of protecting the patient from moral reproaches Certainly the sexual needs of the hysterical are just as individual and as various in force as those of the healthy But they suffer from them and in large measure indeed they suffer precisely through the struggle with them through the effort to thrust sexuality aside The weightiest fact concludes Freud two hundred seventy eight on which we strike in a thorough pursuit of the analysis is this From whatever side and from whatever symptoms we start we always unfailingly reach the region of the sexual life Here first of all an etiological condition of hysterical states is revealed At the bottom of every case of hysteria and reproducible by an analytical effort after even an interval of long years may be found one or more facts of precocious sexual experience belonging to earliest youth I regard this as an important result as the discovery of a caput Nili of neuropathology Ten years later enlarging rather than restricting his conception Freud remarks Sexuality is not a mere deus ex machina which intervenes but once in the hysterical process it is the motive force of every separate symptom and every expression of a symptom The morbid phenomena constitute to speak plainly the patient s sexual activity two hundred seventy nine The actual hysterical fit Freud now states may be regarded as the substitute for a once practiced and then abandoned auto erotic satisfaction and similarly it may be regarded as an equivalent of coitus two hundred eighty It is natural to ask how this conception affects that elaborate picture of hysteria laboriously achieved by Charcot and his school It cannot be said that it abolishes any of the positive results reached by Charcot but it certainly alters their significance and value it presents them in a new light and changes the whole perspective With his passion for getting at tangible definite physical facts Charcot was on very safe ground But he was content to neglect the psychic analysis of hysteria while yet proclaiming that hysteria is a purely psychic disorder He had no cause of hysteria to present save only heredity Freud certainly admits heredity but as he points out the part it plays has been overrated It is too vague and general to carry us far and when a specific and definite cause can be found the part played by heredity recedes to become merely a condition the soil on which the specific etiology works Here probably Freud s enthusiasm at first carried him too far and the most important modification he has made in his views occurs at this point he now attaches a preponderant influence to heredity He has realized that sexual activity in one form or another is far too common in childhood to make it possible to lay very great emphasis on traumatic lesions of this character and he has also realized that an outcrop of fantasies may somewhat later develop on these childish activities intervening between them and the subsequent morbid symptoms He is thus led to emphasize anew the significance of heredity not however in Charcot s sense as general neuropathic disposition but as sexual constitution The significance of infantile sexual lesions has also tended to give place to that of infantilism of sexuality two hundred eighty one The real merit of Freud s subtle investigations is that while possibly furnishing a justification of the imperfectly understood idea that had floated in the mind of observers ever since the name hysteria was first invented he has certainly supplied a definite psychic explanation of a psychic malady He has succeeded in presenting clearly at the expense of much labor insight and sympathy a dynamic view of the psychic processes involved in the constitution of the hysterical state and such a view seems to show that the physical symptoms laboriously brought to light by Charcot are largely but epiphenomena and by products of an emotional process often of tragic significance to the subject which is taking place in the most sensitive recess of the psychic organism That the picture of the mechanism involved presented to us by Professor Freud cannot be regarded as a final and complete account of the matter may readily be admitted It has developed in Freud s own hands and some of the developments will require very considerable confirmation before they can be accepted as generally true two hundred eighty two But these investigations have at least served to open the door which Charcot had inconsistently held closed into the deeper mysteries of hysteria and have shown that here if anywhere further research will be profitable They have also served to show that hysteria may be definitely regarded as in very many cases at least a manifestation of the sexual emotions and their lesions in other words a transformation of auto erotism The conception of hysteria so vigorously enforced by Charcot and his school is thus now beginning to appear incomplete But we have to recognize that that incompleteness was right and necessary A strong reaction was needed against a widespread view of hysteria that was in large measure scientifically false It was necessary to show clearly that hysteria is a definite disorder even when the sexual organs and emotions are swept wholly out of consideration and it was also necessary to show that the lying and dissimulation so widely attributed to the hysterical were merely the result of an ignorant and unscientific misinterpretation of psychic elements of the disease This was finally and triumphantly achieved by Charcot s school There is only one other point in the explanation of hysteria which I will here refer to and that because it is usually ignored and because it has relationship to the general psychology of the sexual emotions I refer to that physiological hysteria which is the normal counterpart of the pathological hysteria which has been described in its physical details by Charcot and to which alone the term should strictly be applied Even though hysteria as a disease may be described as one and indivisible there are yet to be found among the ordinary and fairly healthy population vague and diffused hysteroid symptoms which are dissipated in a healthy environment or pass nearly unnoted only to develop in a small proportion of cases under the influence of a more pronounced heredity or a severe physical or psychic lesion into that definite morbid state which is properly called hysteria This diffused hysteroid condition may be illustrated by the results of a psychological investigation carried on in America by Miss Gertrude Stein among the ordinary male and female students of Harvard University and Radcliffe College The object of the investigation was to study with the aid of a planchette the varying liability to automatic movements among normal individuals Nearly one hundred students were submitted to experiment It was found that automatic responses could be obtained in two sittings from all but a small proportion of the students of both sexes but that there were two types of individual who showed a special aptitude One type probably showing the embryonic form of neurasthenia was a nervous high strung imaginative type not easily influenced from without and not so much suggestible as autosuggestible The other type which is significant from our present point of view is thus described by Miss Stein In general the individuals often blonde and pale are distinctly phlegmatic If emotional decidedly of the weakest sentimental order They may be either large healthy rather heavy and lacking in vigor or they may be what we call anaemic and phlegmatic Their power of concentrated attention is very small They describe themselves as never being held by their work they say that their minds wander easily that they work on after they are tired and just keep pegging away They are very apt to have premonitory conversations they anticipate the words of their friends they imagine whole conversations that afterward come true The feeling of having been there is very common with them that is they feel under given circumstances that they have had that identical experience before in all its details They are often fatalistic in their ideas They indulge in day dreams As a rule they are highly suggestible two hundred eighty three There we have a picture of the physical constitution and psychic temperament on which the classical symptoms of hysteria might easily be built up two hundred eighty four But these persons were ordinary students and while a few of their characteristics are what is commonly and vaguely called morbid on the whole they must be regarded as ordinarily healthy individuals They have the congenital constitution and predisposition on which some severe psychic lesion at the psychological moment might develop the most definite and obstinate symptoms of hysteria but under favorable circumstances they will be ordinary men and women of no more than ordinary abnormality or ordinary power They are among the many who have been called to hysteria at birth they may never be among the few who are chosen We may have to recognize that on the side of the sexual emotions as well as in general constitution a condition may be traced among normal persons that is hysteroid in character and serves as the healthy counterpart of a condition which in hysteria is morbid In women such a condition Has been traced though misnamed by doctor King two hundred eighty five doctor King describes what he calls sexual hysteria in women which he considers a chief variety of hysteria He adds however that it is not strictly a disease but simply an automatic reaction of the reproductive system which tends to become abnormal under conditions of civilization and to be perpetuated in a morbid form In this condition he finds twelve characters one Time of life usually between puberty and climacteric two Attacks rarely occur when subject is alone three Subject appears unconscious but is not really so four She is instinctively ashamed afterward five It occurs usually in single women or in those single or married whose sexual needs are unsatisfied six No external evidence of disease and as Aitken pointed out the nates are not flattened the woman s physical condition is not impaired and she may be specially attractive to men seven Warmth of climate and the season of spring and summer are conducive to the condition eight The paroxysm in short and temporary nine While light touches are painful firm pressure and rough handling give relief ten It may occur in the occupied but an idle purposeless life is conducive eleven The subject delights in exciting sympathy and in being fondled and caressed twelve There is defect of will and a strong stimulus is required to lead to action Among civilized women the author proceeds this condition does not appear to subserve any useful purpose Let us however go back to aboriginal woman to woman of the woods and the fields Let us picture ourselves a young aboriginal Venus in one of her earliest hysterical paroxysms In doing so let us not forget some of the twelve characteristics previously mentioned She will not be acting her part alone or if alone it will be in a place where someone else is likely soon to discover her Let this Venus be now discovered by a youthful Apollo of the woods a man with fully developed animal instincts He and she like any other animals are in the free field of Nature He cannot but observe to himself This woman is not dead she breathes and is warm she does not look ill she is plump and rosy He speaks to her she neither hears apparently nor responds Her eyes are closed He touches moves and handles her at his pleasure She makes no resistance What will this primitive Apollo do next He will cure the fit and bring the woman back to consciousness satisfy her emotions and restore her volition not by delicate touches that might be agonizing to her hyperesthetic skin but by vigorous massage passive motions and succussion that would be painless The emotional process on the part of the woman would end perhaps with mingled laughter tears and shame and when accused afterward of the part which the ancestrally acquired properties of her nervous system had compelled her to act as a preliminary to the event what woman would not deny it and be angry But the course of Nature having been followed the natural purpose of the hysterical paroxysm accomplished there would remain as a result of the treatment instead of one discontented woman two happy people and the possible beginning of a third Natural primary sexual hysteria in woman King concludes is a temporary modification of the nervous government of the body and the distribution of nerve force occurring for the most part as we see it to day in prudish women of strong moral principle whose volition has disposed them to resist every sort of liberty or approach from the other sex consisting in a transient abdication of the general volitional and self preservational ego while the reins of government are temporarily assigned to the usurping power of the reproductive ego so that the reproductive government overrules the government by volition and thus as it were forcibly compels the woman s organism to so dispose itself at a suitable time and place as to allow invite and secure the approach of the other sex whether she will or not to the end that Nature s imperious demand for reproduction shall be obeyed This perhaps rather fantastic description is not a presentation of hysteria in the technical sense but we may admit that it presents a state which if not the real physiological counterpart of the hysterical convulsion is yet distinctly analogous to the latter The sexual orgasm has this correspondence with the hysterical fit that they both serve to discharge the nervous centres and relieve emotional tension It may even happen especially in the less severe forms of hysteria that the sexual orgasm takes place during the hysterical fit this was found by Rosenthal of Vienna to be always the case in the semiconscious paroxysms of a young girl whose condition was easily cured two hundred eighty six no doubt such cases would be more frequently found if they were sought for In severe forms of hysteria however it frequently happens as so many observers have noted that normal sexual excitement has ceased to give satisfaction has become painful perverted paradoxical Freud has enabled us to see how a shock to the sexual emotions injuring the emotional life at its source can scarcely fail sometimes to produce such a result But the necessity for nervous explosion still persists two hundred eighty seven It may indeed persist even in an abnormally strong degree in consequence of the inhibition of normal activities generally The convulsive fit is the only form of relief open to the tension A lady whom I long attended remarks Ashwell always rejoiced when the fit was over since it relieved her system generally and especially her brain from painful irritation which had existed for several previous days That the fit mostly fails to give real satisfaction and that it fails to cure the disease is due to the fact that it is a morbid form of relief The same character of hysteria is seen with more satisfactory results for the most part in the influence of external nervous shock It was the misunderstood influence of such shocks in removing hysteria which in former times led to the refusal to regard hysteria as a serious disease During the Rebellion of seventeen forty five forty six in Scotland Cullen remarks that there was little hysteria The same was true of the French Revolution and of the Irish Rebellion while Rush in a study On the Influence of the American Revolution on the Human Body observed that many hysterical women were restored to perfect health by the events of the time In such cases the emotional tension is given an opportunity of explosion in new and impersonal channels and the chain of morbid personal emotions is broken It has been urged by some that the fact that the sexual orgasm usually fails to remove the disorder in true hysteria excludes a sexual factor of hysteria It is really one may point out an argument in favor of such an element as one of the factors of hysteria If there were no initial lesion of the sexual emotions if the natural healthy sexual channel still remained free for the passage of the emotional overflow then we should expect that it would much oftener come into play in the removal of hysteria In the more healthy merely hysteroid condition the psychic sexual organism is not injured and still responds normally removing the abnormal symptoms when allowed to do so It is the confusion between this almost natural condition and the truly morbid condition alone properly called hysteria which led to the ancient opinion inaugurated by Plato and Hippocrates that hysteria may be cured by marriage two hundred eighty eight The difference may be illustrated by the difference between a distended bladder which is still able to contract normally on its contents when at last an opportunity of doing so is afforded and the bladder in which distension has been so prolonged that nervous control had been lost and spontaneous expulsion has become impossible The first condition corresponds to the constitution which while simulating the hysterical condition is healthy enough to react normally in spite of psychic lesions the second corresponds to a state in which owing to the prolonged stress of psychic traumatism sexual or not a definite condition of hysteria has arisen The one state is healthy though abnormal the other is one of pronounced morbidity The condition of true hysteria is thus linked on to almost healthy states and especially to a condition which may be described as one of sex hunger Such a suggestion may help us to see these puzzling phenomena in their true nature and perspective At this point I may refer to the interesting parallel and probable real relationship between hysteria and chlorosis As Luzet has said hysteria and chlorosis are sisters We have seen that there is some ground for regarding hysteria as an exaggerated form of a normal process which is really an auto erotic phenomenon There is some ground also for regarding chlorosis as the exaggeration of a physiological state connected with sexual conditions more specifically with the preparation for maternity Hysteria is so frequently associated with anaemic conditions that Biernacki has argued that such conditions really constitute the primary and fundamental cause of hysteria Neurologisches Centralblatt March eighteen ninety eight And centuries before Biernacki Sydenham had stated his belief that poverty of the blood is the chief cause of hysteria It would be some confirmation of this position if we could believe that chlorosis like hysteria is in some degree a congenital condition This was the view of Virchow who regarded chlorosis as essentially dependent on a congenital hyoplasia of the arterial system Stieda on the basis of an elaborate study of twenty three cases has endeavored to prove that chlorosis is due to a congenital defect of development Zeitschrift fuer Geburtshuelfe und Gynaekologie vol xxxii Part I eighteen ninety five His facts tend to prove that in chlorosis there are signs of general ill development and that in particular there is imperfect development of the breasts and sexual organs with a tendency to contracted pelvis Charrin again regards utero ovarian inadequacy as at least one of the factors of chlorosis Chlorosis in its extreme form may thus be regarded as a disorder of development a sign of physical degeneracy Even if not strictly a cause a congenital condition may as Stockman believes British Medical Journal December fourteen eighteen ninety five be a predisposing influence However it may be in extreme cases there is very considerable evidence to indicate that the ordinary anaemia of young women may be due to a storing up of iron in the system and is so far normal being a preparation for the function of reproduction Some observations of Bunge s seem to throw much light on the real cause of what may be termed physiological chlorosis He found by a series of experiments on animals of different ages that young animals contain a much greater amount of iron in their tissues than adult animals that for instance the body of a rabbit an hour after birth contains more than four times as much iron as that of a rabbit two and a half months old It thus appears probable that at the period of puberty and later there is a storage of iron in the system preparatory to the exercise of the maternal functions It is precisely between the ages of fifteen and twenty three as Stockman found by an analysis of his own cases British Medical Journal December fourteen eighteen ninety five that the majority of cases occur there was indeed he found no case in which the first onset was later than the age of twenty three A similar result is revealed by the charts of Lloyd Jones which cover a vastly greater number of cases We owe to Lloyd Jones an important contribution to the knowledge of chlorosis in its physiological or normal relationships He has shown that chlorosis is but the exaggeration of a condition that is normal at puberty and in many women at each menstrual period and which there is good reason to believe even has a favorable influence on fertility He found that light complexioned persons are more fertile than the dark complexioned and that at the same time the blood of the latter is of less specific gravity containing less haemoglobin Lloyd Jones also reached the generalization that girls who have had chlorosis are often remarkably pretty so that the tendency to chlorosis is associated with all the sexual and reproductive aptitudes that make a woman attractive to a man His conclusion is that the normal condition of which chlorosis is the extreme and pathological condition is a preparation for motherhood E Lloyd Jones Chlorosis The Special Anaemia of Young Women eighteen ninety seven also numerous reports to the British Medical Association published in the British Medical Journal There was an interesting discussion of the theories of chlorosis at the Moscow International Medical Congress in eighteen ninety eight see proceedings of the congress volume in section v pp two hundred twenty four et seq We may thus perhaps understand why it is that hysteria and anaemia are often combined and why they are both most frequently found in adolescent young women who have yet had no sexual experiences Chlorosis is a physical phenomenon hysteria largely a psychic phenomenon yet both alike may to some extent at least be regarded as sexual aptitude showing itself in extreme and pathological forms FOOTNOTES two hundred fifty one Genese et Nature de l Hysterie eighteen ninety eight and for Sollier s latest statement see Hysterie et Sommeil Archives de Neurologie May and June

could not fail to recognize the erotic tone which often dominates hysterical hallucinations Gilles de la Tourette seeks to minimize it by the remark that it is more mental than real He means to say that it is more psychic than physical but he implies that the physical element in sex is alone real a strange assumption in any case as well as destructive of Gilles de la Tourette s own fundamental

which always terminated in sexual orgasm Fonctions du Cerveau eighteen twenty five vol iii p two hundred forty five two hundred eighty seven There seems to be a greater necessity for such explosive manifestations in women than in men whatever the reason may be I have brought together some of the evidence pointing in this direction in Man and Woman fourth ed revised and enlarged Chapters xii and xiii two hundred eighty eight There is no doubt an element of real truth in this ancient belief though it mainly holds good of minor cases of hysteria Many excellent authorities accept it Hysteria is certainly common in the single Herman remarks Diseases of Women eighteen ninety eight p thirty three and is generally cured by a happy marriage Loewenfeld Sexualleben und Nervenleiden p one hundred fifty three says that it cannot be denied that marriage produces a beneficial change in the general condition of many hysterical patients though he adds it will not remove the hysterical temperament The advantage of marriage for the hysterical is not necessarily due solely or at all to the exercise of sexual functions This is pointed out by Mongeri who observes Allgemeine Zeitschrift fuer Psychiatrie nineteen oh one Heft five p nine hundred seventeen I have known and treated several hysterical girls who are now married and do not show the least neuropathic indications Some of these no longer have any wish for sexual gratification and even fulfil their marital duties unwillingly though loving their husbands and living with them in an extremely happy way In my opinion marriage is a sovereign remedy for neuropathic women who need to find a support in another personality able to share with them the battle of life III The Prevalence of Masturbation Its Occurrence in Infancy and

Catholic Theologians The Mohammedan Attitude The Modern Scientific Attitude In What Sense is Masturbation Normal The Immense Part in Life Played by Transmuted Auto erotic Phenomena The foregoing sketch will serve to show how vast is the field of life of normal and not merely abnormal life more or less infused by auto erotic phenomena If however we proceed to investigate precisely the exact extent degree and significance of such phenomena we are met by many difficulties We find indeed that no attempts have been made to study auto erotic phenomena except as regards the group a somewhat artificial group as I have already tried to show collected under the term masturbation while even here such attempts have only been made among abnormal classes of people or have been conducted in a manner scarcely likely to yield reliable results two hundred eighty nine Still there is a certain significance in the more careful investigations which have been made to ascertain the precise frequency of masturbation Berger an experienced specialist in nervous diseases concluded in his Vorlesungen that ninety nine per cent of young men and women masturbate occasionally while the hundredth conceals the truth two hundred ninety and Hermann Cohn appears to accept this statement as generally true in Germany So high an estimate has of course been called in question and since it appears to rest on no basis of careful investigation we need not seriously consider it It is useless to argue on suppositions we must cling to our definite evidence even though it yields figures which are probably below the mark Rohleder considers that during adolescence at least ninety five per cent of both sexes masturbate but his figures are not founded on precise investigation two hundred ninety one Julian Marcuse on the basis of his own statistics concludes that ninety two per cent male individuals have to some extent masturbated in youth Perhaps also weight attaches to the opinion of Dukes physician to Rugby School who states that from ninety to ninety five per cent of all boys at boarding school masturbate two hundred ninety two Seerley of Springfield Mass found that of one hundred twenty five academic students only eight assured him they had never masturbated while of three hundred forty seven who answered his questions seventy one denied that they practiced masturbation which seems to imply that seventy nine per cent admitted that they practiced it two hundred ninety three Brockman also in America among two hundred thirty two theological students of the average age of two hundred thirty one two years and coming from various parts of the United States found that one hundred thirty two spontaneously admitted that masturbation was their most serious temptation and all but one of these admitted that he yielded sixty nine of them to a considerable extent This is a proportion of at least fifty six per cent the real proportion being doubtless larger since no question had been asked as to sexual offenses seventy five practiced masturbation after conversion and twenty four after they had decided to become ministers only sixty six mentioned sexual intercourse as their chief temptation but altogether sexual temptations outnumbered all others together two hundred ninety four Moraglia who made inquiry of two hundred women of the lower class in Italy found that one hundred twenty acknowledged either that they still masturbate or that they had done so during a long period two hundred ninety five Gualino found that twenty three per cent men of the professional classes in North Italy masturbate about puberty no account was taken of those who began later Here in Switzerland a correspondent writes I have had occasion to learn from adult men whom I can trust that they have reached the age of twenty five or over without sexual congress Wir haben nicht dieses Beduerfniss is what they say But I believe that in the case of the Swiss mountaineers moderate onanism is practiced as a rule In hot countries the same habits are found at a more precocious age In Venezuela for instance among the Spanish creoles Ernst found that in all classes boys and girls are infested with the vice of onanism They learn it early in the very beginning of life from their wet nurses generally low Mulatto women and many reasons help to foster the habit the young men are often dissipated and the young women often remain single two hundred ninety six Niceforo who shows a special knowledge of the working girl class at Rome states that in many milliners and dressmakers workrooms where young girls are employed it frequently happens that during the hottest hours of the day between twelve and two when the mistress or forewoman is asleep all the girls without exception give themselves up to masturbation two hundred ninety seven In France a country cure assured Debreyne that among the little girls who come up for their first communion eleven out of twelve were given to masturbation two hundred ninety eight The medical officer of a Prussian reformatory told Rohleder that nearly all the inmates over the age of puberty masturbated Stanley Hall knew a reform school in America where masturbation was practiced without exception and he who could practice it oftenest was regarded with hero worship two hundred ninety nine Ferriani who has made an elaborate study of youthful criminality in Italy states that even if all boys and girls among the general population do not masturbate it is certainly so among those who have a tendency to crime Among four hundred fifty eight adult male criminals Marro as he states in his Caratteri dei Delinquenti found that only seventy two denied masturbation while three hundred eighty six had practiced it from an early age one hundred forty of them before the age of thirteen Among thirty criminal women Moraglia found that twenty four acknowledged the practice at all events in early youth eight of them before the age of ten a precocity accompanied by average precocity in menstruation while he suspected that most of the remainder were not unfamiliar with the practice Among prostitutes of whatever class or position Moraglia found masturbation though it must be pointed out that he does not appear to distinguish masturbation very clearly from homosexual practices to be universal in one group of fifty prostitutes everyone had practiced masturbation at some period twenty eight began between the ages of six and eleven nineteen between twelve and fourteen the most usual period a precocious one of commencing puberty the remaining three at fifteen and sixteen the average age of commencing masturbation it may be added was eleven while that of the first sexual intercourse was fifteen three hundred In a larger group of one hundred eighty prostitutes belonging to Genoa Turin Venice et cetera and among twenty three elegant cocottes of Italian and foreign origin Moraglia obtained the same results everyone admitted masturbation and not less than one hundred thirteen preferred masturbation either solitary or mutual to normal coitus Among the insane as among idiots masturbation is somewhat more common among males according to Blandford in England as also it is in Germany according to Naecke three hundred one while Venturi in Italy has found it more common among females three hundred two There appears to be no limit to the age at which spontaneous masturbation may begin to appear I have already referred to the practice of thigh rubbing in infants under one year of age J P West has reported in detail three cases of masturbation in very early childhood two in girls one in a boy in which the practice had been acquired spontaneously and could only be traced to some source of irritation in pressure from clothing et cetera three hundred three Probably there is often in such cases some hereditary lack of nervous stability Block has recorded the case of a girl very bright for her age though excessively shy and taciturn who began masturbating spontaneously at the age of two in this case the mother had masturbated all her life even continuing the practice after marriage and though she succeeded in refraining during pregnancy her thoughts still dwelt upon it while the maternal grandmother had died in an asylum from masturbatory insanity Freud considers that auto erotic manifestations are common in infancy and that the rhythmic function of any sensitive spot primarily the lips may easily pass into masturbation He regards the infantile manifestations of which thumb sucking is the most familiar example Luedeln or Lutschen in German as auto erotic the germ arising in sucking the breasts since the lips are an erogenous zone which may easily be excited by the warm stream of milk But this only occurs he points out in subjects in whom the sensitivity of the lip zone is heightened and especially in those who at a later age are liable to become hysterical three hundred four Shuttleworth also points out that the mere fidgetiness of a neurotic infant even when only a few months old sometimes leads to the spontaneous and accidental discovery of pleasurable sexual sensations which for a time appease the restlessness of nervous instability though a vicious circle is thus established He has found that especially among quite young girls of neurotic heredity self induced excitement often in the form of thigh friction is more common than is usually supposed three hundred five Normally there appears to be a varying aptitude to experience the sexual organism or any voluptuous sensations before puberty I find on eliciting the recollections of normal persons that in some cases there have been voluptuous sensations from casual contact with the sexual organs at a very early age in other cases there has been occasional slight excitement from early years in yet other cases complete sexual anaesthesia until the age of puberty That the latter condition is not due to mere absence of peripheral irritation is shown by a case I am acquainted with in which a boy of seven incited by a companion innocently attempted at intervals during several weeks to produce erection by friction of the penis no result of any kind followed although erections occurred spontaneously at puberty with normal sexual feelings three hundred six I am indebted to a correspondent for the following notes From my observation during five years at a boarding school it seems that eight out of ten boys were more or less addicted to the practice But I would not state positively that such was the proportion of masturbators among an average of thirty pupils though the habit was very common I know that in one bedroom sleeping seven boys the whole number masturbated frequently The act was performed in bed in the closets and sometimes in the classrooms during lessons Inquiry among my friends as to onanism in the boarding schools to which they were sent elicited somewhat contradictory answers concerning the frequency of the habit doctor who went to a French school told me that all the older boys had younger accomplices in mutual masturbation He also spoke with experience of the prevalence of the practice in a well known public school in the west of England B said all the boys at his school masturbated G stated that most of his schoolmates were onanists L said more than half was the proportion At my school manual masturbation was both solitary and mutual and sometimes younger boys who had not acquired the habit were induced to manipulate bigger boys One very precocious boy of fifteen always chose a companion of ten because his hand was like a woman s Sometimes boys entered their friend s bed for mutual excitement In after life they showed no signs of inversion Another boy aged about fourteen who had been seduced by a servant girl embraced the bolster the pleasurable sensations according to his statement were heightened by imagining that the bolster was a woman He said that the enjoyment of the act was greatly increased during the holidays when he was able to spread a pair of his sister s drawers upon the pillow and so intensify the illusion Before puberty the boys appeared to be more continent than afterward A few of the older and more intelligent masturbators regulated the habit as some married men regulate intercourse The big boy referred to who chose always the same manipulator professed to indulge only once in twenty days his reason being that more frequent repetition of the act would injure his health About twice a week for boys who had reached puberty and once a week for younger boys was I think about the average indulgence I have never met with a parallel of one of those cases of excessive masturbation recorded by many doctors There may have been such cases at this school but if so the boys concealed the frequency of their gratifications My experience proved that many of the lads regarded masturbation as reprehensible but their plea was everyone does it Some often those who indulged inordinately and more secretly than their companions gravely condemned the practice as sinful A few seemed to think there was no harm in it but that the habit might stunt the growth and weaken the body if practiced very frequently The greater number made no attempt to conceal the habit they enlarged upon the pleasure of it it was ever so much nicer than eating tarts et cetera The chief cause I believe to be initiation by an older schoolmate But I have known accidental causes such as the discovery that swarming up a pole pleasurably excited the organ rubbing to allay irritation and simple curious handling of the erect penis in the early morning before rising from bed I quote the foregoing communication as perhaps a fairly typical experience in a British school though I am myself inclined to think that the prevalence of masturbation in schools is often much overrated for while in some schools the practice is doubtless rampant in others it is practically unknown or at all events only practiced by a few individuals in secret My own early recollections of private school life fail to yield any reminiscences of any kind connected with either masturbation or homosexuality and while such happy ignorance may be the exception rather than the rule I am certainly inclined to believe that owing to race and climate and healthier conditions of life the sexual impulse is less precocious and less prominently developed during the school age in England than in some Continental countries It is probably to this delayed development that we should attribute the contrast that Ferrero finds L Europa Giovane pp one hundred fifty one fifty six and certainly states too absolutely between the sexual reserve of young Englishmen and the sexual immodesty of his own countrymen In Germany Naecke has also stated Kritisches zum Kapitel der Sexualitaet Archiv fuer Psychiatrie pp three hundred fifty four fifty six eighteen ninety nine that he heard nothing at school either of masturbation or homosexuality and he records the experience of medical friends who stated that such phenomena were only rare exceptions and regarded by the majority of the boys as exhibitions of Schweinerei At other German schools as Hoche has shown sexual practices are very prevalent It is evident that at different schools and even at the same school at different times these manifestations vary in frequency within wide limits Such variations it seems to me are due to two causes In the first place they largely depend upon the character of the more influential elder boys In the second place they depend upon the attitude of the head master With reference to this point I may quote from a letter written by an experienced master in one of the most famous English public schools When I first came to a quarter of a century ago doctor was making a crusade against this failing boys were sent away wholesale the school was summoned and lectured solemnly and the more the severities the more rampant the disease I thought to myself that the remedy was creating the malady and I heard afterward from an old boy that in those days they used to talk things over by the fireside and think there must be something very choice in a sin that braved so much doctor went and under we never spoke of such things Curiosity died down and the thing itself I believe was lessened We were told to warn new boys of the dangers to health and morals of such offences lest the innocent should be caught in ignorance I have only spoken to a few I think the great thing is not to put it in boys heads I have noticed solitary faults most commonly and then I tell the boy how he is physically weakening himself If you notice it is puppies that seem to go against Nature but grown dogs never So if two small boys acted thus I should think it merely an instinctive feeling after Nature which would amend itself Many here would consider it a heinous sin but those who think such things sins make them sins I have seen in the old days most delightful little children sent away branded with infamy and scarce knowing why you might as well expel a boy for scratching his head when it itched I am sure the soundest way is to treat it as a doctor would and explain to the boy the physical effects of over indulgence of any sort When it is combated from the monkish standpoint the evil becomes an epidemic I am however far from anxious to indorse the policy of ignoring the sexual phenomena of youth It is not the speaking about such things that should be called in question but the wisdom and good sense of the speaker We ought to expect a head master to possess both an adequate acquaintance with the nature of the phenomena of auto erotism and homosexuality and a reasonable amount of tact in dealing with boys he may then fairly be trusted to exercise his own judgment It may be doubted whether boys should be made too alive to the existence of sexual phenomena there can be no doubt about their teachers The same is of course true as regards girls among whom the same phenomena though less obtrusive are not less liable to occur As to whether masturbation is more common in one sex than the other there have been considerable differences of opinion Tissot considered it more prevalent among women Christian believed it commoner among men Deslandes and Iwan Bloch hold that there are no sexual differences and Garnier was doubtful Lawson Tait in his Diseases of Women stated his opinion that in England while very common among boys it is relatively rare among women and then usually taught Spitzka in America also found it relatively rare among women and Dana considers it commoner in boys than in girls or adults three hundred seven Moll is inclined to think that masturbation is less common in women and girls than in the male sex Rohleder believes that after puberty when it is equally common in both sexes it is more frequently found in men but that women masturbate with more passion and imaginative fervor three hundred eight Kellogg in America says it is equally prevalent in both sexes but that women are more secretive Morris also in America considers on the other hand that persistent masturbation is commoner in women and accounts for this by the healthier life and traditions of boys Pouillet who studied the matter with considerable thoroughness in France came to the conclusion that masturbation is commoner among women among whom he found it to be equally prevalent in rich and poor and especially so in the great centres of civilization In Russia Guttceit states in his Dreissig Jahre Praxis that from the ages of ten to sixteen boys masturbate more than girls who know less about the practice which has not for them the charm of the forbidden but after sixteen he finds the practice more frequent in girls and women than in youths and men Naecke in Germany believes that there is much evidence pointing in the same direction and Adler considers masturbation very common in women Moraglia is decidedly of the opinion on the ground of his own observations already alluded to that masturbation is more frequent among women he refers to the fact a very significant fact as I shall elsewhere have to point out that while in man there is only one sexual centre the penis in woman there are several centres the clitoris the vagina the uterus the breasts three hundred nine and he mentions that he knew a prostitute a well developed brunette of somewhat nervous temperament who boasted that she knew fourteen ways of masturbating herself My own opinion is that the question of the sexual distribution of masturbation has been somewhat obscured by that harmful tendency to which I have already alluded to concentrate attention on a particular set of auto erotic phenomena We must group and divide our facts rationally if we wish to command them If we confine our attention to very young children the available evidence shows that the practice is much more common in females three hundred ten and such a result is in harmony with the fact that precocious puberty is most often found in female children three hundred eleven At puberty and adolescence occasional or frequent masturbation is common in both boys and girls though I believe less common than is sometimes supposed it is difficult to say whether it is more prevalent among boys or girls one is inclined to conclude that it prevails more widely among boys The sexual impulse and consequently the tendency to masturbation tend to be aroused later and less easily in girls than in youths though it must also be remembered that boys traditions and their more active life keep the tendency in abeyance while in girls there is much less frequently any restraining influence of corresponding character three hundred twelve In my study of inversion I have found that ignorance and the same absence of tradition are probably factors in the prevalence of homosexual tendencies among women three hundred thirteen After adolescence I think there can be no doubt that masturbation is more common in women than in men Men have by this time mostly adopted some method of sexual gratification with the opposite sex women are to a much larger extent shut out from such gratification moreover while in rare cases women are sexually precocious it more often happens that their sexual impulses only gain strength and self consciousness after adolescence has passed I have been much impressed by the frequency with which masturbation is occasionally especially about the period of menstruation practiced by active intelligent and healthy women who otherwise lead a chaste life This experience is confirmed by others who are in a position to ascertain the facts among normal people thus a lady who has received the confidence of many women told me that she believes that all women who remain unmarried masturbate as she found so much evidence pointing in this direction three hundred fourteen This statement certainly needs some qualification though I believe it is not far from the truth as regards young and healthy women who after having normal sexual relationships have been compelled for some reason or other to break them off and lead a lonely life three hundred fifteen But we have to remember that there are some women evidently with a considerable degree of congenital sexual anaesthesia no doubt in some respect or another below the standard of normal health in whom the sexual instinct has never been aroused and who not only do not masturbate but do not show any desire for normal gratification while in a large proportion of other cases the impulse is gratified passively in ways I have already referred to The auto erotic phenomena which take place in this way spontaneously by yielding to revery with little or no active interference certainly occur much more frequently in women than in men On the other hand contrary to what one might be led to expect the closely related auto erotic phenomena during sleep seem to take place more frequently in men although in women as we have found ground for concluding they reverberate much more widely and impressively on the waking psychical life We owe to Restif de la Bretonne what is perhaps the earliest precise description of a woman masturbating In seventeen fifty five he knew a dark young woman plain but well made and of warm temperament educated in a convent She was observed one day when gazing from her window at a young man in whom she was tenderly interested to become much excited Her movements became agitated I approached her and really believe that she was uttering affectionate expressions she had become red Then she sighed deeply and became motionless stretching out her legs which she stiffened as if she felt pain It is further hinted that her hands took part in this manoeuvre Monsieur Nicolas vol vi p one hundred forty three Pictorial representations of a woman masturbating also occur in eighteenth century engravings Thus in France Baudouin s Le Midi reproduced in Fuchs s Das Erotische Element in der Karikatur Fig ninety two represents an elegant young lady in a rococo garden bower she has been reading a book she has now just dropped together with her sunshade she leans languorously back and her hand begins to find its way through her placket hole Adler who has studied masturbation in women with more care than any previous writer has recorded in detail the auto erotic manifestations involved in the case of an intelligent and unprejudiced woman aged thirty who had begun masturbating when twenty and practiced it at intervals of a few weeks She experienced the desire for sexual gratification under the following circumstances one spontaneously directly before or after menstruation two as a method to cure sleeplessness three after washing the parts with warm but not cold water four after erotic dreams five quite suddenly without definite cause The phenomena of the masturbatory process fell into two stages one incomplete excitement two the highest pleasurable gratification It only took place in the evening or at night and a special position was necessary with the right knee bent and the right foot against the knee of the extended left leg The bent index and middle fingers of the right hand were then applied firmly to the lower third of the left labium minus which was rubbed against the underlying parts At this stage the manifestations sometimes stopped either from an effort of self control or from fatigue of the arm There was no emission of mucus or general perspiration but some degree of satisfaction and of fatigue followed by sleep If however the manipulation was continued the second stage was reached and the middle finger sank into the vagina while the index finger remained on the labium the rest of the hand holding and compressing the whole of the vulva from pubes to anus against the symphysis with a backwards and forwards movement the left hand also being frequently used to support and assist the right The parts now gave a mushroom like feeling to the touch and in a few seconds or after a longer interval the complete feeling of pleasurable satisfaction was attained At the same moment there was but only after she had had experience of coitus an involuntary elevation of the pelvis together with emission of mucus making the hand wet this mucus having an odor and being quite distinct from the ordinary odorless mucus of the vagina at the same time the finger in the vagina felt slight contractions of the whole vaginal wall The climax of sexual pleasure lasted a few seconds with its concomitant vaginal contractions then slowly subsided with a feeling of general well being the finger at the same time slipping out of the vagina and she was left in a state of general perspiration and sleep would immediately follow when this was not the case she was frequently conscious of some degree of sensibility in the sacrum lasting for several hours and especially felt when sitting When masturbation was the result of an erotic dream which occurred but seldom the first stage was already reached in sleep and the second was more quickly obtained During the act it was only occasionally that any thoughts of men or of coitus were present the attention being fixed on the coming climax The psychic state afterwards was usually one of self reproach O Adler Die Mangelhafte Geschlechtsempfindung des Weibes nineteen oh four pp twenty six twenty nine The phenomena in this case may be regarded as fairly typical but there are many individual variations mucus emissions and vaginal contractions frequently occur before actual orgasm and there is not usually any insertion of the finger into the vagina in women who have never experienced coitus or indeed even in those who have We must now turn to that aspect of our subject which in the past has always seemed the only aspect of auto erotic phenomena meriting attention the symptoms and results of chronic masturbation It appears to have been an Englishman who at the beginning of the eighteenth century first called popular attention to the supposed evils of masturbation His book was published in London and entitled Onania or the Heinous Sin of Self pollution and all its Frightful Consequences in both Sexes Considered with Spiritual and Physical Advice et cetera It is not a serious medical treatise but an early and certainly superior example of a kind of literature which we have since become familiar with through the daily newspapers A large part of the book which is cleverly written is devoted in the later editions to the letters of nervous and hypochondriacal young men and women who are too shy to visit the author but request him to send a bottle of his Strengthening Tincture and mention that they are inclosing half a guinea a guinea or still larger sum Concerning the composition of the Strengthening Tincture we are not informed three hundred sixteen This work which was subsequently attributed to a writer named Bekkers is said to have passed through no less than eighty editions and it was translated into German Tissot a physician of Lausanne followed with his Traite de l Onanisme Dissertation sur les Maladies produites par la Masturbation first published in Latin seventeen sixty then in French seventeen sixty four and afterward in nearly all European languages He regarded masturbation as a crime and as an act of suicide His book is a production of amusing exaggeration and rhetoric zealously setting forth the prodigious evils of masturbation in a style which combines as Christian remarks the strains of Rousseau with a vein of religious piety Tissot included only manual self abuse under the term onanism shortly afterward Voltaire in his Dictionnaire Philosophique took up the subject giving it a wider meaning and still further popularizing it Finally Lallemand at a somewhat later period eighteen thirty six wrote a book which was indeed more scientific in character but which still sought to represent masturbation as the source of all evils These four writers the author of Onania Tissot Voltaire Lallemand are certainly responsible for much The mistaken notions of many medical authorities carried on by tradition even down to our own time the powerful lever which has been put into the hand of unscrupulous quacks the suffering dread and remorse experienced in silence by many thousands of ignorant and often innocent young people may all be traced in large measure back to these four well meaning but on this question misguided authors There is really no end to the list of real or supposed symptoms and results of masturbation as given by various medical writers during the last century Insanity epilepsy numerous forms of eye disease supra orbital headache occipital headache Spitzka strange sensations at the top of the head Savage various forms of neuralgia Anstie J Chapman tenderness of the skin in the lower dorsal region Chapman mammary tenderness in young girls Lacassagne mammary hypertrophy Ossendovsky asthma Peyer cardiac murmurs Seerley the appearance of vesicles on wounds Baraduc acne and other forms of cutaneous eruptions the author of Onania Clipson dilated pupils Skene Lewis Moraglia eyes directed upward and sideways Pouillet dark rings around the eyes intermittent functional deafness Bonnier painful menstruation J Chapman catarrh of uterus and vagina Winckel Pouillet ovarian disease Jessett pale and discolored skin Lewis Moraglia redness of nose Gruner epistaxis Joal J N Mackenzie morbid changes in nose Fliess convulsive cough of puberty Gowers acidity of vagina R W Shufeldt incontinence of urine in young women Girandeau warts on the hands in women Durr Kreichmar von Oye hallucinations of smell and hearing Griesinger Lewis intermittent functional deafness Bonnier indican in the urine Herter an indescribable odor of the skin in women Skene these are but a few of the signs and consequences of masturbation given by various prominent authorities three hundred seventeen That many of these manifestations do occur in connection with masturbation is unquestionable there is also good reason to believe that some of them may be the results of masturbation acting on an imperfectly healthy organism But in all such cases we must speak with great caution for there appears to be little reliable evidence to show that simple masturbation in a well born and healthy individual can produce any evil results beyond slight functional disturbances and these only when it is practiced in excess To illustrate the real pathological relationships of masturbation a few typical and important disorders may be briefly considered The delicate mechanism of the eye is one of the first portions of the nervous apparatus to be disturbed by any undue strain on the system it is not surprising that masturbation should be widely incriminated as a cause of eye troubles If however we inquire into the results obtained by the most cautious and experienced ophthalmological observers it grows evident that masturbation as a cause of disease of the eye becomes merged into wider causes In Germany Hermann Cohn the distinguished ophthalmic surgeon of Breslau has dealt fully with the question three hundred eighteen Cohn who believes that all young men and women masturbate to some extent finds that masturbation must be excessive for eye trouble to become apparent In most of his cases there was masturbation several times daily during from five to seven years in many during ten years and in one during twenty three years In such cases we are obviously dealing with abnormal persons and no one will dispute the possibility of harmful results in some of the cases when masturbation was stopped the eye trouble improved Even in these cases however the troubles were but slight the chief being apparently photopsia a subjective sensation of light with otherwise normal conditions of pupil vision color sense and retina In some cases there was photophobia and he has also found paralysis of accommodation and conjunctivitis At a later date Salmo Cohn in his comprehensive monograph on the relationship between the eye and the sexual organs in women brought together numerous cases of eye troubles in young women associated with masturbation but in most of these cases masturbation had been practiced with great frequency for a long period and the ocular affections were usually not serious three hundred nineteen In England Power has investigated the relations of the sexual system to eye disease He is inclined to think that the effects of masturbation have been exaggerated but he believes that it may produce such for the most part trivial complaints as photopsisae muscsae muscular asthenopia possibly blepharospasm and perhaps conjunctivitis He goes on however to point out that more serious complaints of the eye are caused by excess in normal coitus by sexual abstinence and especially by disordered menstruation Thus we see that even when we are considering a mechanism so delicately poised and one so easily disturbed by any jar of the system as vision masturbation produces no effect except when carried to an extent which argues a hereditarily imperfect organism while even in these cases the effects are usually but slight moreover in no respect specific but are paralleled and even exceeded by the results of other disturbances of the sexual system Let us turn to the supposed influence of masturbation in causing insanity and nervous diseases Here we may chiefly realize the immense influence exerted on medical science by Tissot and his followers during a hundred years Mental weakness is the cause and not the result of excessive masturbation Gall declared three hundred twenty but he was a man of genius in isolation Sir William Ellis an alienist of considerable reputation at the beginning of the last century could write with scientific equanimity I have no hesitation in saying that in a very large number of patients in all public asylums the disease may be attributed to that cause He does indeed admit that it may be only a symptom sometimes but goes on to assert that masturbation has not hitherto been exhibited in the awful light in which it deserves to be shown and that in by far the greater number of cases it is the true cause of dementia three hundred twenty one Esquirol lent his name and influence to a similar view of the pernicious influence of masturbation Throughout the century even down to the present day this point of view has been traditionally preserved in a modified form In apparent ignorance of the enormous prevalence of masturbation and without so far as can be seen any attempt to distinguish between cause and effect or to eliminate the hereditary neuropathic element many alienists have set down a large proportion of cases of insanity idiocy epilepsy and disease of the spinal cord to uncomplicated masturbation Thus at the Matteawan State Hospital New York for criminal lunatics and insane prisoners from eighteen seventy five to nineteen oh seven masturbation was the sole assigned cause of insanity in one hundred sixty men out of twenty five ninety five while according to doctor Clara Barrus among one hundred twenty one cases of insanity in young women masturbation is the cause in ten cases three hundred twenty two It is unnecessary to multiply examples for this traditional tendency is familiar to all It appears to have been largely due to Griesinger in the middle of the last century that we owe the first authoritative appearance of a saner more discriminating view regarding the results of masturbation Although still to some extent fettered by the traditions prevalent in his day Griesinger saw that it was not so much masturbation itself as the feelings aroused in sensitive minds by the social attitude toward masturbation which produced evil effects That constant struggle he wrote against a desire which is even overpowering and to which the individual always in the end succumbs that hidden strife between shame repentance good intentions and the irritation which impels to the act this after not a little acquaintance with onanists we consider to be far more important than the primary direct physical effect He added that there are no specific signs of masturbation and concluded that it is oftener a symptom than a cause The general progress of educated opinions since that date has in the main confirmed and carried forward the results cautiously stated by Griesinger This distinguished alienist thought that when practiced in childhood masturbation might lead to insanity Berkhan in his investigation of the psychoses of childhood found that in no single case was masturbation a cause Vogel Uffelmann and Emminghaus in the course of similar studies have all come to almost similar conclusions three hundred twenty three It is only on a congenitally morbid nervous system Emminghaus insists that masturbation can produce any serious results Most of the cases charged to masturbation writes Kiernan in a private letter basing his opinion on wide clinical experience are either hebephrenia or hysteria in which an effect is taken for the cause Christian during twenty years experience in hospitals asylums and private practice in town and country has not found any seriously evil effects from masturbation three hundred twenty four He thinks indeed that it may be a more serious evil in women than in men But Yellowlees considers that in women it is possibly less exhausting and injurious than in the other sex which was also the opinion of Hammond as well as of Guttceit though he found that women pushed the practice much further than men and Naecke who has given special attention to this point could not find that masturbation is a definite cause of insanity in women in a single case three hundred twenty five Koch also reaches a similar conclusion as regards both sexes though he admits that masturbation may cause some degree of psychopathic deterioration Even in this respect however he points out that when practiced in moderation it is not injurious in the certain and exceptionless way in which it is believed to be in many circles It is the people whose nervous systems are already injured who masturbate most easily and practice it more immoderately than others the chief source of its evil is self reproach and the struggle with the impulse three hundred twenty six Kahlbaum it is true under the influence of the older tradition when he erected katatonia into a separate disorder not always accepted in later times regarded prolonged and excessive masturbation as a chief cause but I am not aware that he ever asserted that it was a sole and sufficient cause in a healthy organism Kiernan one of the earliest writers on katatonia was careful to point out that masturbation was probably as much effect as cause of the morbid nervous condition three hundred twenty seven Maudsley in Body and Mind recognized masturbation as a special exciting cause of a characteristic form of insanity but he cautiously added Nevertheless I think that self abuse seldom if ever produces it without the company operation of the insane neurosis three hundred twenty eight Schuele also recognized a specific masturbatory insanity but the general tendency to reject any such nosological form is becoming marked Krafft Ebing long since rejected it and Naecke decidedly opposes it Kraepelin states that excessive masturbation can only occur in a dangerous degree in predisposed subjects so also Forel and Loewenfeld as at an earlier period Trousseau three hundred twenty nine It is true that Marro in his admirable and detailed study of the normal and abnormal aspects of puberty accepts a form of masturbatory insanity but the only illustrative case he brings forward is a young man possessing various stigmata of degeneracy and the son of an alcoholic father such a case tells us nothing regarding the results of simple masturbation three hundred thirty Even Spitzka who maintained several years ago the traditional views as to the terrible results of masturbation and recognized a special insanity of masturbation stated his conclusions with a caution that undermined his position Self abuse he concluded to become a sole cause of insanity must be begun early and carried very far In persons of sound antecedents it rarely under these circumstances suffices to produce an actual vesania three hundred thirty one When we remember that there is no convincing evidence to show that masturbation is begun early and carried very far by persons of sound antecedents the significance of Spitzka s typical psychosis of masturbation is somewhat annulled It is evident that these distinguished investigators Marro and Spitzka have been induced by tradition to take up a position which their own scientific consciences have compelled them practically to evacuate Recent authorities are almost unanimous in rejecting masturbation as a cause of insanity Thus Rohleder in his comprehensive monograph Die Masturbation eighteen ninety nine pp one hundred eighty five ninety two although taking a very serious view of the evil results of masturbation points out the unanimity which is now tending to prevail on this point and lays it down that masturbation is never the direct cause of insanity Sexual excesses of any kind he adds following Curschmann can at the most merely give an impetus to a latent form of insanity On the whole he concludes the best authorities are unanimous in agreeing that masturbation may certainly injure mental capacity by weakening memory and depressing intellectual energy that further in hereditarily neurotic subjects it may produce slight psychoses like folie du doute hypochondria hysteria that finally under no circumstances can it produce severe psychoses like paranoia or general paralysis If it caused insanity as often as some claim as Kellogg remarks the whole race would long since have passed into masturbatic degeneracy of mind It is especially injurious in the very young and in all who have weak nervous systems but the physical traits attributed to the habit are common to thousands of neurasthenic and neurotic individuals Kellogg A Text book of Mental Diseases eighteen ninety seven pp ninety four ninety five Again at the outset of the article on Masturbation in Tuke s Dictionary of Psychological Medicine Yellowlees states that on account of the mischief formerly done by reckless statements it is necessary to state plainly that unless the practice has been long and greatly indulged no permanent evil effects may be observed to follow Naecke again has declared Kritisches zum Kapitel der Sexualitaet Archiv fuer Psychiatrie eighteen ninety nine There are neither somatic nor psychic symptoms peculiar on onanism Nor is there any specific onanistic psychosis I am prepared to deny that onanism ever produces any psychoses in those who are not already predisposed That such a view is now becoming widely prevalent is illustrated by the cautious and temperate discussion of masturbation in a recent work by a non medical writer Geoffrey Mortimer Chapters on Human Love pp one hundred ninety nine two hundred five The testimony of expert witnesses with regard to the influence of masturbation in producing other forms of psychoses and neuroses is becoming equally decisive and here also the traditions of Tissot are being slowly effaced I have not in the whole of my practice wrote West forty years ago out of a large experience among children and women seen convulsions epilepsy or idiocy induced by masturbation in any child of either sex Neither have I seen any instance in which hysteria epilepsy or insanity in women after puberty was due to masturbation as its efficient cause three hundred thirty two Gowers speaks somewhat less positively but regards masturbation as not so much a cause of true epilepsy as of atypical attacks sometimes of a character intermediate between the hysteroid and the epileptoid form this relationship he has frequently seen in boys three hundred thirty three Leyden among the causes of diseases of the spinal cord does not include any form of sexual excess In moderation Erb remarks masturbation is not more dangerous to the spinal cord than natural coitus and has no bad effects three hundred thirty four it makes no difference Erb considers whether the orgasm is effected normally or in solitude This is also the opinion of Toulouse of Fuerbringer and of Curschmann as at an earlier period it was of Roubaud While these authorities are doubtless justified in refusing to ascribe to masturbation any part in the production of psychic or nervous diseases it seems to me that they are going somewhat beyond their province when they assert that masturbation has no more injurious effect than coitus If sexual coitus were a purely physiological phenomenon this position would be sound But the sexual orgasm is normally bound up with a mass of powerful emotions aroused by a person of the opposite sex It is in the joy caused by the play of these emotions as well as in the discharge of the sexual orgasm that the satisfaction of coitus resides In the absence of the desired partner the orgasm whatever relief it may give must be followed by a sense of dissatisfaction perhaps of depression even of exhaustion often of shame and remorse The same remark has since been made by Stanley Hall three hundred thirty five Practically also as John Hunter pointed out there is more probability of excess in masturbation than in coitus Whether as some have asserted masturbation involves a greater nervous effort than coitus is more doubtful three hundred thirty six It thus seems somewhat misleading to assert that masturbation has no more injurious effect than coitus three hundred thirty seven Reviewing the general question of the supposed grave symptoms and signs of masturbation and its pernicious results we may reach the conclusion that in the case of moderate masturbation in healthy well born individuals no seriously pernicious results necessarily follow three hundred thirty eight With regard to the general signs we may accept as concerns both sexes what the Obstetrical and Gynecological Society of Berlin decided in eighteen sixty one in a discussion of it in women that there are none which can be regarded as reliable three hundred thirty nine We may conclude finally with Clouston that the opposing views on the subject may be simply explained by the fact that the writers on both sides have ignored or insufficiently recognized the influence of heredity and temperament They have done precisely what so many unscientific writers on inebriety have continued to do unto the present day when describing the terrible results of alcohol without pointing out that the chief factor in such cases has not been the alcohol but the organization on which the alcohol acted Excess may act according to the familiar old fashioned adage like the lighted match But we must always remember the obvious truth that it makes a considerable difference whether you threw your lighted match into a powder magazine or into the sea While we may thus dismiss the extravagant views widely held during the past century concerning the awful results of masturbation as due to ignorance and false tradition it must be pointed out that even in healthy or moderately healthy individuals any excess in solitary self excitement may still produce results which though slight are yet harmful The skin digestion and circulation may all be disordered headache and neuralgia may occur and as in normal sexual excess or in undue frequency of sexual excitement during sleep there is a certain general lowering of nervous tone Probably the most important of the comparatively frequent results though this also arises usually on a somewhat morbid soil is neurasthenia with its manifold symptoms There can be little doubt that the ancient belief dating from the time of Hippocrates that sexual excesses produce spinal disease as well as the belief that masturbation causes insanity are largely due to the failure to diagnose neurasthenia The following case of neurasthenia recorded by Eulenburg may be given as a classical picture of the nervous disturbances which may be associated with masturbation and are frequently regarded as solely caused by habits of masturbation Miss H H twenty eight years of age a robust brunette with fully developed figure without any trace of anaemia or chlorosis but with an apathetic expression bluish rings around the eyes with hypochondriacal and melancholy feelings She complains of pressure on the head as if head would burst giddiness ringing in the ears photopsia hemicrania pains in the back and at sacrum and symptoms of spinal adynamia with a sense of fatigue on the least exertion in walking or standing she sways when standing with closed eyes tendon reflexes exaggerated there is a sense of oppression intercostal neuralgia and all the signs of neurasthenic dyspepsia and cardialgia nausea flatulence meteorism and alternate constipation and diarrhoea She chiefly complains of a feeling of weight and pain in the abdomen caused by the slightest movement and of a form of pollution with clitoridian spasms especially near menstruation with copious flow of mucus characteristic pains and hyperexcitability Menstruation was irregular and profuse Examination showed tumid and elongated nymphae with brown pigmentation rather large vagina with rudimentary hymen and retroflexion of uterus After much persuasion the patient confessed that when a girl of twelve and as the result of repeated attempts at coitus by a boy of sixteen she had been impelled to frequent masturbation This had caused great shame and remorse which however had not sufficed to restrain the habit Her mother having died she lived alone with her invalid father and had no one in whom to confide Regarding herself as no longer a virgin she had refused several offers of marriage and thus still further aggravated her mental condition Eulenburg Sexuale Neuropathie p thirty one Since Beard first described neurasthenia many diverse opinions have been expressed concerning the relationships of sexual irregularities to neurasthenia Gilles de la Tourette in his little monograph on neurasthenia following the traditions of Charcot s school dismisses the question of any sexual causation without discussion Binswanger Die Pathologie und Therapie der Neurasthenie while admitting that nearly all neurasthenic persons acknowledge masturbation at some period considers it is not an important cause of neurasthenia only differing from coitus by the fact that the opportunities for it are more frequent and that the sexual disturbances of neurasthenia are in the majority of cases secondary Rohleder on the other hand who takes a very grave view of the importance of masturbation considers that its most serious results are a question of neurasthenia Krafft Ebing has declared his opinion that masturbation is a cause of neurasthenia Christian Leyden Erb Rosenthal Beard Hummel Hammond Hermann Cohn Curschmann Savill Herman Fuerbringer all attach chief importance to neurasthenia as a result of masturbation Collins and Phillip Medical Record March twenty five eighteen ninety nine in an analysis of three hundred thirty three cases of neurasthenia found that one hundred twenty three cases were apparently due to overwork or masturbation Freud concludes that neurasthenia proper can nearly always be traced to excessive masturbation or to spontaneous pollutions E g Sammlung Kleiner Schriften zur Neurosenlehre first series p one hundred eighty seven This view is confirmed by Gattel s careful study Ueber die Sexuellen Ursachen der Neurasthenie und Angstneurose eighteen ninety eight Gattel investigated one hundred consecutive cases of severe functional nervous disorder in Krafft Ebing s clinic at Vienna and found that in every case of neurasthenia in a male twenty eight in all there was masturbation while of the fifteen women with neurasthenia only one is recorded as not masturbating and she practiced coitus reservatus Irrespective of the particular form of the nervous disorder Gattel found that eighteen women out of forty two and thirty six men out of fifty eight acknowledged masturbation This shows a slightly larger proportion among the men but the men were mostly young while the women were mostly of more mature age It must however always be remembered that we have no equally careful statistics of masturbation in perfectly healthy persons We must also remember that we have to distinguish between the post and the propter and that it is quite possible that neurasthenic persons are specially predisposed to masturbation Bloch is of this opinion and remarks that a vicious circle may thus be formed On the whole there can be little doubt that neurasthenia is liable to be associated with masturbation carried to an excessive extent But while neurasthenia is probably the severest affection that is liable to result from or accompany masturbation we are scarcely yet entitled to accept the conclusion of Gattel that in such cases there is no hereditary neurotic predisposition We must steer clearly between the opposite errors of those on the one hand who assert that heredity is the sole cause of functional nervous disorders and those on the other hand who consider that the incident that may call out the disorder is itself a sole sufficient cause In many cases it has seemed to me that masturbation when practiced in excess especially if begun before the age of puberty leads to inaptitude for coitus as well as to indifference to it and sometimes to undue sexual irritability involving premature emission and practical impotence This is however the exception especially if the practice has not been begun until after puberty In women I attach considerable importance as a result of masturbation to an aversion for normal coitus in later life In such cases some peripheral irritation or abnormal mental stimulus trains the physical sexual orgasm to respond to an appeal which has nothing whatever to do with the fascination normally exerted by the opposite sex At puberty however the claim of passion and the real charm of sex begin to make themselves felt but owing to the physical sexual feelings having been trained into a foreign channel these new and more normal sex associations remain of a purely ideal and emotional character without the strong sensual impulses with which under healthy conditions they tend to be more and more associated as puberty passes on into adolescence or mature adult life I am fairly certain that in many women often highly intellectual women the precocious excess in masturbation has been a main cause not necessarily the sole efficient cause in producing a divorce in later life between the physical sensuous impulses and the ideal emotions The sensuous impulse having been evolved and perverted before the manifestation of the higher emotion the two groups of feelings have become divorced for the whole of life This is a common source of much personal misery and family unhappiness though at the same time the clash of contending impulses may lead to a high development of moral character When early masturbation is a factor in producing sexual inversion it usually operates in the manner I have here indicated the repulsion for normal coitus helping to furnish a soil on which the inverted impulse may develop unimpeded This point has not wholly escaped previous observers though they do not seem to have noted its psychological mechanism Tissot stated that masturbation causes an aversion to marriage More recently Loiman Ueber Onanismus beim Weibe Therapeutische Monatshefte April eighteen ninety considered that masturbation in women leading to a perversion of sexual feeling including inability to find satisfaction in coitus affects the associated centres Smith Baker again The Neuropsychical Element in Conjugal Aversion Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease September eighteen ninety two finds that a source of marital aversion seems to lie in the fact that substitution of mechanical and iniquitous excitations affords more thorough satisfaction than the mutual legitimate ones do and gives cases in point Savill also who believes that masturbation is more common in women than is usually supposed regards dyspareunia or pain in coition as one of the signs of the habit Masturbation in women thus becomes as Raymond and Janet point out Les Obsessions vol ii p three hundred seven a frequent cause of sexual frigidity in marriage These authors illustrate the train of evils which may thus be set up by the case of a lady twenty six years of age a normal woman of healthy family who at the age of fifteen was taught by a servant to masturbate At the age of eighteen she married She loved her husband but she had no sexual feelings in coitus and she continued to masturbate sometimes several times a day without evil consequences At twenty four she had to go into a hospital for floating kidney and was so obliged to stop masturbating She here accidentally learnt of the evil results attributed to the habit She resolved not to do it again and she kept her resolution But while still in hospital she fell wildly in love with a man To escape from the constant thought of this man she sought relations with her husband and at times masturbated but now it no longer gave her pleasure She wished to give up sexual things altogether But that was easier said than done She became subject to nervous crises often brought on by the sight of a man and accompanied by sexual excitement They disappeared under treatment and she thereupon became entirely frigid sexually But far from being happy she has lost all energy and interest in life and it is her sole desire to attain the sexual feelings she has lost Adler considers that even when masturbation in women becomes an overmastering passion so far as organic effects are concerned it is usually harmless its effects being primarily psychic and he attaches especial significance to it as a cause of sexual anaesthesia in normal coitus being perhaps the most frequent cause of such anaesthesia He devotes an important chapter to this matter and brings forward numerous cases in illustration Adler Die Mangelhafte Geschlechtsempfindung des Weibes pp ninety three one hundred nineteen also twenty one twenty three Adler considers that the frequency of masturbation in women is largely due to the fact that women experience greater difficulties than men in obtaining sexual satisfaction and so are impelled by unsatisfying coitus to continue masturbation after marriage He adds that partly from natural shyness partly from shame of acknowledging what is commonly accounted a sin and partly from the fear of seeming disgusting or unworthy of sympathy in the doctor s eyes women are usually silent on this matter and very great tact and patience may be necessary before a confession is obtained On the psychic side no doubt the most frequent and the most characteristic result of persistent and excessive masturbation is a morbid heightening of self consciousness without any company ordinated heightening of self esteem three hundred forty The man or woman who is kissed by a desirable and desired person of the opposite sex feels a satisfying sense of pride and elation which must always be absent from the manifestations of auto erotic activity three hundred forty one This must be so even apart from the masturbator s consciousness of the general social attitude toward his practices and his dread of detection for that may also exist as regards normal coitus without any corresponding psychic effects The masturbator if his practice is habitual is thus compelled to cultivate an artificial consciousness of self esteem and may show a tendency to mental arrogance Self righteousness and religiosity constitute as it were a protection against the tendency to remorse A morbid mental soil is of course required for the full development of these characteristics The habitual male masturbator it must be remembered is often a shy and solitary person individuals of this temperament are especially predisposed to excesses in all the manifestations of auto erotism while the yielding to such tendencies increases the reserve and the horror of society at the same time producing a certain suspicion of others In some extreme cases there is no doubt as Kraepelin believes some decrease of psychic capacity an inability to grasp and company ordinate external impressions weakness of memory deadening of emotions or else the general phenomena of increased irritability leading on to neurasthenia I find good reason to believe that in many cases the psychic influence of masturbation on women is different from its effect on men As Spitzka observed although it may sometimes render women self reproachful and hesitant it often seems to make them bold Boys as we have seen early assimilate the tradition that self abuse is unmanly and injurious but girls have seldom any corresponding tradition that it is unwomanly and thus whether or not they are reticent on the matter before the forum of their own conscience they are often less ashamed of it than men are and less troubled by remorse Eulenburg considers that the comparative absence of bad effects from masturbation in girls is largely due to the fact that unlike boys they are not terrorized by exaggerated warnings and quack literature concerning the awful results of the practice Forel who has also remarked that women are often comparatively little troubled by qualms of conscience after masturbation denies that this is due to a lower moral tone than men possess Forel Die Sexuelle Frage p two hundred forty seven In this connection I may refer to History IV recorded in the Appendix to the fifth volume of these Studies in which it is stated that of fifty five prostitutes of various nationalities with whom the subject had had relations eighteen spontaneously told him that they were habitual masturbators while of twenty six normal women thirteen made the same confession unasked Guttceit in Russia after stating that women of good constitution had told him that they masturbated as much as six or ten times a day or night until they fell asleep tired without bad results adds that according to his observations masturbation when not excessive is on the whole a quite innocent matter which exerts little or no permanent effect and adds that it never in any case leads to hypochondria onanica in women because they have not been taught to expect bad results Dreissig Jahre Praxis p three hundred six There is I think some truth though the exceptions are doubtless many in the distinction drawn by W C Krauss Masturbational Neuroses Medical News July thirteen nineteen oh one From my experience it masturbation seems to have an opposite effect upon the two sexes dulling the mental and making clumsy the physical exertions of the male while in the female it quickens and excites the physical and psychical movements The man is rendered hypoesthetic the woman hyperesthetic In either sex auto erotic excesses during adolescence in young men and women of intelligence whatever absence of gross injury there may be still often produce a certain degree of psychic perversion and tend to foster false and high strung ideals of life Kraepelin refers to the frequency of exalted enthusiasms in masturbators and I have already quoted Anstie s remarks on the connection between masturbation and premature false work in literature and art It may be added that excess in masturbation has often occurred in men and women whose work in literature and art cannot be described as premature and false K P Moritz in early adult life gave himself up to excess in masturbation and up to the age of thirty had no relations with women Lenau is said though the statement is sometimes denied to have been a masturbator from early life the habit profoundly effecting his life and work Rousseau in his Confessions admirably describes how his own solitary timid and imaginative life found its chief sexual satisfaction in masturbation three hundred forty two Gogol the great Russian novelist masturbated to excess and it has been suggested that the dreamy melancholy thus induced was a factor in his success as a novelist Goethe it has been asserted at one time masturbated to excess I am not certain on what authority the statement is made probably on a passage in the seventh book of Dichtung und Wahrheit in which describing his student life at Leipzig and his loss of Aennchen owing to his neglect of her he tells how he revenged that neglect on his own physical nature by foolish practices from which he thinks he suffered for a considerable period three hundred forty three The great Scandinavian philosopher Soeren Kierkegaard suffered severely according to Rasmussen from excessive masturbation That at the present day eminence in art literature and other fields may be combined with the excessive practice of masturbation is a fact of which I have unquestionable evidence I have the detailed history of a man of thirty of high ability in a scientific direction who except during periods of mental strain has practiced masturbation nightly though seldom more than once a night from early childhood without any traceable evil results so far as his general health and energy are concerned In another case a schoolteacher age thirty a hard worker and accomplished musician has masturbated every night sometimes more than once a night ever since he was at school without so far as he knows any bad results he has never had connection with a woman and seldom touches wine or tobacco Curschmann knew a young and able author who from the age of eleven had masturbated excessively but who retained physical and mental freshness It would be very easy to refer to other examples and I may remark that as regards the histories recorded in various volumes of these Studies a notable proportion of those in which excessive masturbation is admitted are of persons of eminent and recognized ability It is often possible to trace the precise mechanism of the relationship between auto erotic excitement and intellectual activity Brown Sequard in old age considered that to induce a certain amount of sexual excitement not proceeding to emission was an aid to mental work Raymond and Janet knew a man considering himself a poet who in order to attain the excitation necessary to compose his ideal verses would write with one hand while with the other he caressed his penis though not to the extent of producing ejaculation three hundred forty four We must not believe however that this is by any means the method of workers who deserve to be accepted seriously it would be felt to say the least as unworthy It is indeed a method that would only appeal to a person of feeble or failing mental power What more usually happens is that the auto erotic excitement develops pari passu and spontaneously with the mental activity and at the climax of the latter the auto erotic excitement also culminates almost or even quite spontaneously in an explosion of detumescence which relieves the mental tension I am acquainted with such cases in both young men and women of intellectual ability and they probably occur much more frequently than we usually suspect In illustration of the foregoing observations I may quote the following narrative written by a man of letters From puberty to the age of thirty when I married I lived in virgin continence in accord with my principle During these years I worked exceedingly hard chiefly at art music and poetry My days being spent earning my livelihood these art studies fell into my evening time I noticed that productive power came in periods periods of irregular length and which certainly to a partial extent could be controlled by the will Such a period of vital power began usually with a sensation of melancholy and it quickened my normal revolt against the narrowness of conventional life into a red hot detestation of the paltriness and pettiness with which so many mortals seem to content themselves As the mood grew in intensity this scorn of the lower things mixed with and gave place to a vivid insight into higher truths The oppression began to give place to a realization of the eternity of the heroic things the fatuities were seen as mere fashions love was seen as the true lord of life the eternal romance was evident in its glory the naked strength and beauty of men were known despite their clothes In such mood my work was produced bitter protest and keen sighted passion mingled in its building The arising vitality had certainly deep relation to the periodicity of the sex force of manhood At the height of the power of the art creative mood would come those natural emissions with which Nature calmly disposes of the unused force of the male Such emissions were natural and healthy and not exhaustive or hysterical The process is undoubtedly sane and protective unless the subject be unhealthy The period of creative art power extended a little beyond the end of the period of natural seed emission the art work of this last stage being less vibrant and of a gentler force Then followed a time of calm natural rest which gradually led up to the next sequence of melancholy and power The periods certainly varied in length of time controlled somewhat by the force of the mind and the mental will to create that is to say I could somewhat delay the natural emission by which I gained an extension of the period of power How far masturbation in moderately healthy persons living without normal sexual relationships may be considered normal is a difficult question only to be decided with reference to individual cases As a general rule when only practiced at rare intervals and faute de mieux in order to obtain relief for physical oppression and mental obsession it may be regarded as the often inevitable result of the unnatural circumstances of our civilized social life When as often happens in mental degeneracy and as in shy and imaginative persons perhaps of neurotic temperament may also sometimes become the case it is practiced in preference to sexual relationships it at once becomes abnormal and may possibly lead to a variety of harmful results mental and physical three hundred forty five It must always be remembered however that while the practice of masturbation may be harmful in its consequences it is also in the absence of normal sexual relationships frequently not without good results In the medical literature of the last hundred years a number of cases have been incidentally recorded in which the patients found masturbation beneficial and such cases might certainly have been enormously increased if there had been any open eyed desire to discover them My own observations agree with those of Sudduth who asserts that masturbation is in the main practiced for its sedative effect on the nervous system The relaxation that follows the act constitutes its real attraction Both masturbation and sexual intercourse should be classed as typical sedatives three hundred forty six Gall Fonctions du Cerveau eighteen twenty five vol iii p two hundred thirty five mentioned a woman who was tormented by strong sexual desire which she satisfied by masturbation ten or twelve times a day this caused no bad results and led to the immediate disappearance of a severe pain in the back of the neck from which she often suffered Clouston Mental Diseases eighteen eighty seven p four hundred ninety six quotes as follows from a letter written by a youth of twenty two I am sure I cannot explain myself nor give account of such conduct Sometimes I felt so uneasy at my work that I would go to the water closet to do it and it seemed to give me ease and then I would work like a hatter for a whole week till the sensation overpowered me again I have been the most filthy scoundrel in existence et cetera Garnier presents the case of a monk aged thirty three living a chaste life who wrote the following account of his experiences For the past three years at least I have felt every two or three weeks a kind of fatigue in the penis or rather slight shooting pains increasing during several days and then I feel a strong desire to expel the semen When no nocturnal pollution follows the retention of the semen causes general disturbance headache and sleeplessness I must confess that occasionally to free myself from the general and local oppression I lie on my stomach and obtain ejaculation I am at once relieved a weight seems to be lifted from my chest and sleep returns This patient consulted Gamier as to whether this artificial relief was not more dangerous than the sufferings it relieved Gamier advised that if the ordinary regime of a well ordered monastry together with anaphrodisiac sedatives proved inefficacious the manoeuvre might be continued when necessary P Garnier Celibat et Celibataires eighteen eighty seven p three hundred twenty H C Coe American Journal of Obstetrics p seven hundred sixty six July eighteen eighty nine gives the case of a married lady who was deeply sensitive of the wrong nature of masturbation but found in it the only means of relieving the severe ovarian pain associated with intense sexual excitement which attended menstruation During the intermenstrual period the temptation was absent Turnbull knew a youth who found that masturbation gave great relief to feelings of heaviness and confusion which came on him periodically and Wigglesworth has frequently seen masturbation after epileptic fits in patients who never masturbated at other times Moll Libido Sexualis Bd I p thirteen refers to a woman of twenty eight an artist of nervous and excitable temperament who could not find sexual satisfaction with her lover but only when masturbating which she did once or twice a day or oftener without masturbation she said she would be in a much more nervous state A friend tells me of a married lady of forty separated from her husband on account of incompatibility who suffered from irregular menstruation she tried masturbation and in her own words became normal again she had never masturbated previously I have also been informed of the case of a young unmarried woman intellectual athletic and well developed who from the age of seven or eight has masturbated nearly every night before going to sleep and would be restless and unable to sleep if she did not Judging from my own observations among both sexes I should say that in normal persons well past the age of puberty and otherwise leading a chaste life masturbation would be little practiced except for the physical and mental relief it brings Many vigorous and healthy unmarried women or married women apart from their husbands living a life of sexual abstinence have asserted emphatically that only by sexually exciting themselves at intervals could they escape from a condition of nervous oppression and sexual obsession which they felt to be a state of hysteria In most cases this happens about the menstrual period and whether accomplished as a purely physical act in the same way as they would soothe a baby to sleep by rocking it or patting it or by the company operation of voluptuous mental imagery the practice is not cultivated for its own sake during the rest of the month In illustration of the foregoing statements I will here record a few typical observations of experiences with regard to masturbation The cases selected are all women and are all in a fairly normal and for the most part excellent state of health some of them however belong to somewhat neurotic families and these are persons of unusual mental ability and intelligence OBSERVATION I Unmarried aged thirty eight She is very vigorous and healthy of a strongly passionate nature but never masturbated until a few years ago when she was made love to by a man who used to kiss her et cetera Although she did not respond to these advances she was thrown into a state of restless sexual excitement on one occasion when in bed in this restless state she accidentally found on passing her hand over her body that by playing with a round thing clitoris a pleasurable feeling was produced She found herself greatly relieved and quieted by these manipulations though there remained a feeling of tiredness afterward She has sometimes masturbated six times in a night especially before and after the menstrual period until she was unable to produce the orgasm or any feeling of pleasure OBSERVATION II Unmarried aged forty five of rather nervous temperament She has for many years been accustomed usually about a week before the appearance of the menses to obtain sexual relief by kicking out her legs when lying down In this way she says she obtains complete satisfaction She never touches herself On the following day she frequently has pains over the lower part of the abdomen such pains being apparently muscular and due to the exertion OBSERVATION III Aged twenty nine recently married belonging to a neurotic and morbid family herself healthy and living usually in the country vivacious passionate enthusiastic intellectual and taking a prominent part in philanthropic schemes and municipal affairs at the same time fond of society and very attractive to men For many years she had been accustomed to excite herself though she felt it was not good for her The habit was merely practiced faute de mieux I used to sit on the edge of the bed sometimes she said and it came over me so strongly that I simply couldn t resist it I felt that I should go mad and I thought it was better to touch myself than be insane I used to press my clitoris in It made me very tired afterward not like being with my husband The confession was made from a conviction of the importance of the subject and with the hope that some way might be found out of the difficulties which so often beset women OBSERVATION IV Unmarried aged twenty seven possesses much force of character and high intelligence is actively engaged in a professional career As a child of seven or eight she began to experience what she describes as lightning like sensations mere vague uneasy feelings or momentary twitches which took place alike in the vulva or the vagina or the uterus not amounting to an orgasm and nothing like it These sensations it should be added have continued into adult life I always experience them just before menstruation and afterward for a few days and occasionally though it seems to me not so often during the period itself I may have the sensation four or five times during the day it is not dependent at all upon external impressions or my own thoughts and is sometimes absent for days together It is just one flash as if you would snap your fingers and it is over As a child she was of course quite unconscious that there was anything sexual in these sensations They were then usually associated with various imaginary scenes The one usually indulged in was that a black bear was waiting for her up in a tree and that she was slowly raised up toward the bear by means of ropes and then lowered again and raised feeling afraid of being caught by the bear and yet having a morbid desire to be caught In after years she realized that there was a physical sexual cause underlying these imaginations and that what she liked was a feeling of resistance to the bear giving rise to the physical sensation At a somewhat later age though while still a child she cherished an ideal passion for a person very much older than herself this passion absorbing her thoughts for a period of two years during which however there was no progress made in physical sensation It was when she was nearly thirteen years of age soon after the appearance of menstruation and under the influence of this ideal passion that she first learned to experience conscious orgasm which was not associated with the thought of any person I did not associate it with anything high or beautiful owing to the fact that I had imbibed our current ideas in regard to sexual feelings and viewed them in a very poor light indeed She considers that her sexual feelings were stronger at this period than at any other time in her life She could however often deny herself physical satisfaction for weeks at a time in order that she might not feel unworthy of the object of her ideal passion As for the sexual satisfaction she writes it was experimental I had heard older girls speak of the pleasure of such feelings but I was not taught anything by example or otherwise I merely rubbed myself with the wash rag while bathing waiting for a result and having the same peculiar feeling I had so often experienced I am not aware of any ill effects having resulted but I felt degraded and tried hard to overcome the habit No one had spoken to me of the habit but from the secrecy of grown people and passages I had heard from the Bible I conceived the idea that it was a reprehensible practice And while this did not curb my desire it taught me self control and I vowed that each time should be the last I was often able to keep the resolution for two or three weeks Some four years later she gradually succeeded in breaking herself of the practice in so far as it had become a habit she has however acquired a fuller knowledge of sexual matters and though she has still a great dread of masturbation as a vice she does not hesitate to relieve her physical feelings when it seems best to her to do so I am usually able to direct my thoughts from these sensations she writes but if they seem to make me irritable or wakeful I relieve myself It is a physical act unassociated with deep feeling of any kind I have always felt that it was a rather unpleasant compromise with my physical nature but certainly necessary in my case Yet I have abstained from gratification for very long periods If the feeling is not strong at the menstrual period I go on very well without either the sensation or the gratification until the next period And strange as it may seem the best antidote I have found and the best preventive is to think about spiritual things or someone whom I love It is simply a matter of training I suppose a sort of mental gymnastics which draws the attention away from the physical feelings This lady has never had any sexual relationships and since she is ambitious and believes that the sexual emotions may be transformed so as to become a source of motive power throughout the whole of life she wishes to avoid such relationships OBSERVATION V Unmarried aged thirty one in good health with however a somewhat hysterical excess of energy When I was about twenty six years of age she writes a friend came to me with the confession that for several years she had masturbated and had become such a slave to the habit that she severely suffered from its ill effects At that time I had never heard of self abuse by women I listened to her story with much sympathy and interest but some skepticism and determined to try experiments upon myself with the idea of getting to understand the matter in order to assist my friend After some manipulation I succeeded in awakening what had before been unconscious and unknown I purposely allowed the habit to grow upon me and one night for I always operated upon myself before going to sleep never in the morning I obtained considerable pleasurable satisfaction but the following day my conscience awoke I also felt pain located at the back of my head and down the spinal column I ceased my operations for a time and then began again somewhat regularly once a month a few days after menstruation During those months in which I exercised moderation I think I obtained much local relief with comparatively little injury but later on finding myself in robust health I increased my experiments the habit grew upon me and it was only with an almost superhuman effort that I broke myself free Needless to say that I gave no assistance to my suffering friend nor did I ever refer to the subject after her confession to me Some two years later I heard of sexual practices between women as a frequent habit in certain quarters I again interested myself in masturbation for I had been told something that led me to believe that there was much more for me to discover Not knowing the most elementary physiology I questioned some of my friends and then commenced again I restricted myself to relief from local congestion and irritation by calling forth the emission of mucus rather than by seeking pleasure At the same time I sought to discover what manipulation of the clitoris would lead to The habit grew upon me with startling rapidity and I became more or less its slave but I suffered from no very great ill effects until I started in search of more discoveries I found that I was a complete ignoramus as to the formation of a woman s body and by experiments upon myself sought to discover the vagina I continued my operations until I obtained an entrance I think the rough handling of myself during this final stage disturbed my nervous system and caused me considerable pain and exhaustion at the back of my head the spinal column the back of my eyes and a general feeling of languor et cetera I could not bear to be the slave of a habit and after much suffering and efforts which only led to falls to lower depths of conscious failure my better self rebelled until by a great effort and much prayer I kept myself pure for a whole week This partial recovery gave me hope but then I again fell a victim to the habit much to my chagrin and became hopeless of ever retracing my steps toward my ideal of virtue For some days I lost energy spirit and hope my nervous system appeared to be ruined but I did not really despair of victory in the end I thought of all the drunkards chained by their intemperate habits of inveterate smokers who could not exist without tobacco and of all the various methods by which men were slaves and the longing to be freed of what had in my case proved to be a painful and unnecessary habit increased daily until after one night when I struggled with myself for hours I believed I had finally succeeded At times when I reached a high degree of sexual excitement I felt that I was at least one step removed from those of morbid and repressed sex who had not the slightest suspicion of the latent joys of womanhood within them For a little while the habit took the shape of an exalted passion but I rapidly tired it out by rough thoughtless and too impatient handling Revulsion set in with the pain of an exhausted and badly used nervous system and finding myself the slave of a passion I determined to endeavor to be its master In conclusion I should say that masturbation has proved itself to be to me one of the blind turnings of my life s history from which I have gained much valuable experience The practice was however by no means thus dismissed Some time later the subject writes I have again restarted masturbation for the relief of localized feelings One morning I was engaged in reading a very heavy volume which for convenience sake I held in my lap leaning back on my chair I had become deep in my study for an hour or so when I became aware of certain feelings roused by the weight of the book Being tempted to see what would happen by such conduct I shifted so that the edge of the volume came in closer contact The pleasurable feelings increased so I gave myself up to my emotions for some thirty minutes Notwithstanding the intense pleasure I enjoyed for so long a period I maintain that it is wiser to refrain and although I admit in the same breath that by gentle treatment such pleasure may be harmless to the general health it does lead to a desire for solitude which is not conducive to a happy frame of mind There is an accompanying reticence of speech concerning the pleasure which therefore appears to be unnatural like the eating of stolen fruit After such an event one seems to require to fly to the woods and to listen to the song of the birds so as to shake off after effects In a letter dated some months later she writes I think I have risen above the masturbation habit In the same letter the writer remarks If I had consciously abnormal or unsatisfied appetites I would satisfy them in the easiest and least harmful way Again eighteen months later she writes It is curious to note that for months this habit is forgotten but awakens sometimes to self assertion If a feeling of pressure is felt in the head and a slight irritation elsewhere and experience shows that the time has come for pacification exquisite pleasure can be enjoyed never more than twice a month and sometimes less often OBSERVATION VI Unmarried actively engaged in the practice of her profession Well developed feminine in contour but boyish in manner and movements strong though muscles small and healthy with sound nervous system never had anaemia Thick brown hair pubic hair thick and hair on toes and legs up to umbilicus it began to appear at the age of ten before pubic hair and continued until eighteen A few stray hairs round nipples and much dark down on upper lip as well as light down on arms and hands Hips normal nates small labia minora large and clitoris deeply hooded Hymen thick vagina probably small Considerable pigmentation of parts Menstruation began at fifteen but not regular till seventeen is painless and scanty the better the state of health the less it is No change of sexual or other feelings connected with it it lasts one to three days I believe she writes my first experience of physical sex sensations was when I was about sixteen and in sleep But I did not then recognize it and seldom indeed gave the subject of sex a thought I was a child far beyond the age of childhood The accompanying dreams were disagreeable but I cannot remember what they were about It was not until I was nearly nineteen that I knew the sexual orgasm in my waking state It surprised me completely but I knew that I had known it before in my sleep The knowledge came one summer when I was leading a rather isolated life and my mind was far from sex subjects being deep in books Carlyle Ruskin Huxley Darwin Scott et cetera I noticed that when I got up in the morning I felt very hot and uncomfortable The clitoris and the parts around were swollen and erect and often tender and painful I had no idea what it was but found I was unable to pass my water for an hour or two One day when I was straining a little to pass water the full orgasm occurred The next time it happened I tried to check it by holding myself firmly of course with the opposite result I do not know that I found it highly pleasurable but it was a very great relief I allowed myself a good many experiments to come to a conclusion in the matter and I thought about it I was much too shy to speak to any one and thought it was probably a sin I tried not to do it and not to think about it saying to myself that surely I was lord of my body But I found that the matter was not entirely under my control However unwilling or passive I might be there were times when the involuntary discomfort was not in my keeping My touching myself or not did not save me from it Because it sometimes gave me pleasure I thought it might be a form of self indulgence and did not do it until it could scarcely be helped Soon the orgasm began to occur fairly frequently in my sleep perhaps once or twice a week I had no erotic dreams then or at any other time but I had nights of restless sleep and woke as it occurred dreaming that it was happening as in fact it was At times I hardly awoke but went to sleep again in a moment I continued for two or three years to be sorely tried by day at frequent intervals I acquired a remarkable degree of control so that though one touch or steadily directed thought would have caused the orgasm I could keep it off and go to sleep without wrong doing Of course when I fell asleep my control ended All this gave me a good deal of physical worry and kept my attention unwillingly fixed upon the matter I do not think my body was readily irritable but I had unquestionably very strong sexual impulses After a year or two when I was working hard I could not afford the attention the control cost me or the prolonged mitigated sexual excitement it caused I took drugs for a time but they lost effect produced lassitude and agreed with me badly I therefore put away my scruples and determined to try the effect of giving myself an instant and business like relief Instead of allowing my feelings to gather strength I satisfied them out of hand Instead of five hours of heat and discomfort I did not allow myself five minutes if I could help it The effect was marvelous I practically had no more trouble The thing rarely came to me at all by day and though it continued at times by night it became less frequent and less strong often it did not wake me The erotic images and speculations that had begun to come to me died down I left off being afraid of my feelings or indeed thinking about them I may say that I had decided that I should be obliged to lead a single life and that the less I thought about matters of sex the more easy I should find life Later on I had religious ideas which helped me considerably in my ideals of a decent orderly self contained life I do not lay stress on these they were not at all emotional and my physical and psychical development do not appear to have run much on parallel lines I had a strong moral sense before I had a religious one and a common sense which I perhaps trusted more than either When I was about twenty eight I thought I might perhaps leave off the habit of regular relief I had got into It was not regular as regards time being anything from one day to six weeks The change was probably made easier by a severe illness I had had I gave this abstinence a fair trial for several years until I was about thirty four but my nocturnal manifestations certainly gathered strength especially when I got much better in health and finally as at puberty began to worry my waking life I reasoned that by my attempt at abstinence I had only exchanged control for uncontrol and reverted to my old habits of relief with the same good results as before The whole trouble subsided and I got better at once The orgasm during sleep continued and occurs about once a fortnight it is increased by change of air especially at the seaside when it may occur on two or three nights running I decided that for the proper control of my single life relief was normal and right It would be very difficult for anyone to demonstrate the contrary to me My aim has always been to keep myself in the best condition of physical and mental balance that a single person is capable of There is some interest in briefly reviewing the remarkable transformations in the attitude toward masturbation from Greek times down to our own day The Greeks treated masturbation with little opprobrium At the worst they regarded it as unmanly and Aristophanes in various passages connects the practice with women children slaves and feeble old men AEschines seems to have publicly brought it as a charge against Demosthenes that he had practiced masturbation though on the other hand Plutarch tells us that Diogenes described by Zeller the historian of Greek philosophy as the most typical figure of ancient Greece was praised by Chrysippus the famous philosopher for masturbating in the market place The more strenuous Romans at all events as exemplified by Juvenal and Martial condemned masturbation more vigorously three hundred forty seven Aretaeus without alluding to masturbation dwells on the tonic effects of retaining the semen but on the other hand Galen regarded the retention of semen as injurious and advocated its frequent expulsion a point of view which tended to justify masturbation In classical days doubtless masturbation and all other forms of the auto erotic impulse were comparatively rare So much scope was allowed in early adult age for homosexual and later for heterosexual relationships that any excessive or morbid development of solitary self indulgence could seldom occur The case was altered when Christian ideals became prominent Christian morality strongly proscribed sexual relationships except under certain specified conditions It is true that Christianity discouraged all sexual manifestations and that therefore its ban fell equally on masturbation but obviously masturbation lay at the weakest line of defence against the assaults of the flesh it was there that resistance would most readily yield Christianity thus probably led to a considerable increase of masturbation The attention which the theologians devoted to its manifestations clearly bears witness to their magnitude It is noteworthy that Mohammedan theologians regarded masturbation as a Christian vice In Islam both doctrine and practice tended to encourage sexual relationships and not much attention was paid to masturbation nor even any severe reprobation directed against it Omer Haleby remarks that certain theologians of Islam are inclined to consider the practice of masturbation in vogue among Christians as allowable to devout Mussulmans when alone on a journey he himself regards this as a practice good neither for soul nor body seminal emissions during sleep providing all necessary relief should however a Mussulman fall into this error God is merciful three hundred forty eight In Theodore s Penitential of the seventh century forty days penance is prescribed for masturbation Aquinas condemned masturbation as worse than fornication though less heinous than other sexual offences against Nature in opposition also to those who believed that distillatio usually takes place without pleasure he observed that it was often caused by sexual emotion and should therefore always be mentioned to the confessor Liguori also regarded masturbation as a graver sin than fornication and even said that distillatio if voluntary and with notable physical commotion is without doubt a mortal sin for in such a case it is the beginning of a pollution On the other hand some theologians have thought that distillatio may be permitted even if there is some commotion so long as it has not been voluntarily procured and Caramuel who has been described as a theological enfant terrible declared that natural law does not forbid masturbation but that proposition was condemned by Innocent XI The most enlightened modern Catholic view is probably represented by Debreyne who after remarking that he has known pious and intelligent persons who had an irresistible impulse to masturbate continues Must we excuse or condemn these people Neither the one nor the other If you condemn and repulse absolutely these persons as altogether guilty against their own convictions you will perhaps throw them into despair if on the contrary you completely excuse them you maintain them in a disorder from which they may perhaps never emerge Adopt a wise middle course and perhaps with God s aid you may often cure them Under certain circumstances some Catholic theologians have permitted a married woman to masturbate Thus the Jesuit theologian Gury asserts that the wife does not sin quae se ipsam tactibus excitat ad seminationem statim post copulam in qua vir solus seminavit This teaching seems to have been misunderstood since ethical and even medical writers have expended a certain amount of moral indignation on the Church whose theologians committed themselves to this statement As a matter of fact this qualified permission to masturbate merely rests on a false theory of procreation which is clearly expressed in the word seminatio It was believed that ejaculation in the woman is as necessary to fecundation as ejaculation in the man Galen Avicenna and Aquinas recognized indeed that such feminine semination was not necessary Sanchez however was doubtful while Suarez and Zacchia following Hippocrates regarded it as necessary As sexual intercourse without fecundation is not approved by the Catholic Church it thus became logically necessary to permit women to masturbate whenever the ejaculation of mucus had not occurred at or before coitus The belief that the emission of vaginal mucus under the influence of sexual excitement in women corresponded to spermatic emission has led to the practice of masturbation on hygienic grounds Garnier Celibat p two hundred fifty five mentions that Mesue in the eighteenth century invented a special pessary to take the place of the penis and as he stated effect the due expulsion of the feminine sperm Protestantism no doubt in the main accepted the general Catholic tradition but the tendency of Protestantism in reaction against the minute inquisition of the earlier theologians has always been to exercise a certain degree of what it regarded as wholesome indifference toward the less obvious manifestations of the flesh Thus in Protestant countries masturbation seems to have been almost ignored until Tissot combining with his reputation as a physician the fanaticism of a devout believer raised masturbation to the position of a colossal bogy which during a hundred years has not only had an unfortunate influence on medical opinion in these matters but has been productive of incalculable harm to ignorant youth and tender consciences During the past forty years the efforts of many distinguished physicians a few of whose opinions I have already quoted have gradually dragged the bogy down from its pedestal and now as I have ventured to suggest there is a tendency for the reaction to be excessive There is even a tendency to day to regard masturbation with various qualifications as normal Remy de Gourmont for instance considers that masturbation is natural because it is the method by which fishes procreate All things considered it must be accepted that masturbation is part of the doings of Nature A different conclusion might be agreeable but in every ocean and under the reeds of every river myriads of beings would protest three hundred forty nine Tillier remarks that since masturbation appears to be universal among the higher animals we are not entitled to regard it as a vice it has only been so considered because studied exclusively by physicians under abnormal conditions three hundred fifty Hirth while asserting that masturbation must be strongly repressed in the young regards it as a desirable method of relief for adults and especially under some circumstances for women three hundred fifty one Venturi a well known Italian alienist on the other hand regards masturbation as strictly physiological in youth it is the normal and natural passage toward the generous and healthy passion of early manhood it only becomes abnormal and vicious he holds when continued into adult life The appearance of masturbation at puberty Venturi considers is a moment in the course of the development of the function of that organ which is the necessary instrument of sexuality It finds its motive in the satisfaction of an organic need having much analogy with that which arises from the tickling of a very sensitive cutaneous surface In this masturbation of early adolescence lies according to Venturi the germ of what will later be love a pleasure of the body and of the spirit following the relief of a satisfied need As the youth develops onanism becomes a sexual act comparable to coitus as a dream is comparable to reality imagery forming in correspondence with the desires In its fully developed form in adolescence Venturi continues masturbation has an almost hallucinatory character onanism at this period psychically approximates to the true sexual act and passes insensibly into it If however continued on into adult age it becomes morbid passing into erotic fetichism what in the inexperienced youth is the natural auxiliary and stimulus to imagination in the degenerate onanist of adult age is a sign of arrested development Thus onanism the author concludes is not always a vice such as is fiercely combated by educators and moralists It is the natural transition by which we reach the warm and generous love of youth and in natural succession to this the tranquil positive matrimonial love of the mature man Silvio Venturi Le Degenerazioni Psico sessuale eighteen ninety two pp six nine It may be questioned whether this view is acceptable even for the warm climate of the south of Europe where the impulses of sexuality are undoubtedly precocious It is certainly not in harmony with general experience and opinion in the north this is well expressed in the following passage by Edward Carpenter International Journal of Ethics July eighteen ninety nine After all purity in the sense of continence is of the first importance to boyhood To prolong the period of continence in a boy s life is to prolong the period of growth This is a simple physiological law and a very obvious one and whatever other things may be said in favor of purity it remains perhaps the most weighty To introduce sensual and sexual habits and one of the worst of them is self abuse at an early age is to arrest growth both physical and mental And what is even more it means to arrest the capacity for affection All experience shows that the early outlet toward sex cheapens and weakens affectional capacity I do not consider that we can decide the precise degree in which masturbation may fairly be called normal so long as we take masturbation by itself We are thus in conclusion brought back to the point which I sought to emphasize at the outset masturbation belongs to a group of auto erotic phenomena From one point of view it may be said that all auto erotic phenomena are unnatural since the natural aim of the sexual impulse is sexual conjunction and all exercise of that impulse outside such conjunction is away from the end of Nature But we do not live in a state of Nature which answers to such demands all our life is unnatural And as soon as we begin to restrain the free play of sexual impulse toward sexual ends at once auto erotic phenomena inevitably spring up on every side There is no end to them it is impossible to say what finest elements in art in morals in civilization generally may not really be rooted in an auto erotic impulse Without a certain overheating of the sexual system said Nietzsche we could not have a Raphael Auto erotic phenomena are inevitable It is our wisest course to recognize this inevitableness of sexual and transmuted sexual manifestations under the perpetual restraints of civilized life and while avoiding any attitude of excessive indulgence or indifference three hundred fifty two to avoid also any attitude of excessive horror for our horror not only leads to the facts being effectually veiled from our sight but itself serves to manufacture artificially a greater evil than that which we seek to combat The sexual impulse is not as some have imagined the sole root of the most massive human emotions the most brilliant human aptitudes of sympathy of art of religion In the complex human organism where all the parts are so many fibred and so closely interwoven no great manifestation can be reduced to one single source But it largely enters into and molds all of these emotions and aptitudes and that by virtue of its two most peculiar characteristics it is in the first place the deepest and most volcanic of human impulses and in the second place unlike the only other human impulse with which it can be compared the nutritive impulse it can to a large extent be transmuted into a new force capable of the strangest and most various uses So that in the presence of all these manifestations we may assert that in a real sense though subtly mingled with very diverse elements auto erotism everywhere plays its part In the phenomena of auto erotism when we take a broad view of those phenomena we are concerned not with a form of insanity not necessarily with a form of depravity but with the inevitable by products of that mighty process on which the animal creation rests FOOTNOTES two hundred eighty nine For a bibliography of

of a girl of seven a beautiful child of healthy family and very intelligent who from the age of three was perpetually masturbating when not watched The clitoris and mons veneris were those of a fully grown woman and the child was as well informed upon most subjects as an average woman She was cured by care and hygienic attention and when seen last was in excellent condition A medical friend tells me of a little girl of two whose external genital organs are greatly developed and who is always rubbing herself three hundred twelve R T Morris of New York has also pointed out the influence of traditions in this respect Among boys he remarks there are traditions to the effect that self abuse is harmful Among girls however there are no such saving traditions doctor Kiernan writes in a private letter It has been by experience that from ignorance or otherwise there are young women who do not look upon sexual manipulation with the same fear that men do Guttceit similarly remarks that men have been warned of masturbation and fear its evil results while girls even if warned attach little importance to the warning he adds that in healthy women masturbation even in excess has little bad results The attitude of many women in this matter may be illustrated by the following passage from a letter written by a medical friend in India The other day one of my English women patients gave me the following reason for having taught the seventeen year old daughter of a retired Colonel to masturbate Poor girl she was troubled with dreams of men and in case she should be tempted with one and become pregnant I taught her to bring the feeling on herself as it is safer and after all nearly as nice as with a man three hundred thirteen H Ellis Studies in the Psychology of Sex volume ii

especially stated the harmlessness of masturbation in too absolute a manner Thus John Hunter Treatise on the Venereal Disease seventeen eighty six p two hundred after pointing out that the books on this subject have done more harm than good adds I think I may affirm that this act does less harm to the constitution in general than the natural And Sir James Paget in his lecture on Sexual Hypochondriasis said Masturbation does neither more nor less harm than sexual intercourse practiced with the same frequency in the same conditions of general health and age and circumstances three hundred thirty eight It is interesting to note that an analogous result seems to hold with animals Among highly bred horses excessive masturbation is liable to occur with injurious results It is scarcely necessary to point out that highly bred horses are apt to be abnormal three hundred thirty nine With regard to the physical signs the same conclusion is reached by Legludic in opposition to Martineau on the basis of a large experience He has repeatedly found in young girls who acknowledged frequent masturbation that the organs were perfectly healthy and normal and his convictions are the more noteworthy since he speaks as a pupil of Tardieu who attached very grave significance to the local signs of sexual perversity and excess Legludic Notes et Observations de Medecine Legale eighteen

genitals of women who masturbate Clara Barrus considers that there is no necessary connection between hypertrophy of the external female genital organs and masturbation though in six cases of prolonged masturbation she found such a condition in three American Journal of Insanity April eighteen ninety five p four hundred seventy nine Bachterew denies that masturbation produces enlargement of the penis and Hammond considers there is no evidence to show that it enlarges the clitoris while Guttceit states that it does not enlarge the nymphae this however is doubtful It would not suffice in many cases to show that large sexual organs are correlated with masturbation it would still be necessary to show whether the size of the organs stood to masturbation in the relation of effect or of cause three hundred forty Thus Bechterew La Phobie du Regard Archives de Neurologie July nineteen oh five considers that masturbation plays a large part in producing the morbid fear of the eyes of others three hundred forty one It is especially an undesirable tendency of masturbation that it deadens the need for affection and merely eludes instead of satisfying the sexual impulse Masturbation as Godfrey well says The Science of Sex p one hundred seventy eight though a manifestation of sexual activity is not a sexual act in the higher or even in the real fundamental sense For sex implies duality a characteristic to which masturbation can plainly lay no claim The physical moral and mental reciprocity which gives stability and beauty to a normal sexual intimacy are as foreign to the masturbator as to the celibate In a sense therefore masturbation is as complete a negative of the sexual life as chastity itself It is therefore an evasion of not an answer to the sexual problem and it will ever remain so no matter how surely we may be convinced of its physical harmlessness three hundred forty two I learnt that dangerous supplement Rousseau tells us Part I Bk III which deceives Nature This vice which bashfulness and timidity find so convenient has moreover a great attraction for lively imaginations for it enables them to do what they will so to speak with the whole fair sex and to enjoy at pleasure the beauty who attracts them without having obtained her consent three hundred forty three Ich hatte sie wirklich verloren und die Tollheit mit der ich meinen Fehler an mir

Goethe vol i p eighty eight three hundred forty four Les Obsessions vol ii p one hundred thirty six three hundred forty five A somewhat similar classification has already been made by Max Dessoir who points out that we must distinguish between onanists aus Noth and onanists aus Leidenschaft the latter group alone being of really serious importance The classification of Dallemagne is also somewhat similar he distinguishes onanie par impulsion occurring in mental degeneration and in persons of inferior intelligence from onanie par evocation ou obsession three hundred forty six W Xavier Sudduth A Study in the Psycho physics of Masturbation Chicago Medical Recorder March eighteen ninety eight Haig who reaches a similar conclusion has sought to find its precise mechanism in the blood pressure As the sexual act produces lower and falling blood pressure he remarks it will of necessity relieve conditions which are due to high and rising blood pressure such for instance as mental depression and bad temper and unless my observation deceives me we have here a connection between conditions of high blood pressure with mental and bodily depression and acts of masturbation for this act will relieve these conditions and tend to be practiced for this purpose Uric Acid sixth edition p one hundred fifty four three hundred forty seven Northcote discusses the classic attitude towards

however already guarded myself against this misinterpretation APPENDIX A THE INFLUENCE OF MENSTRUATION ON THE POSITION OF WOMEN A question of historical psychology which so far as I know has never been fully investigated is the influence of menstruation in constituting the emotional atmosphere through which men habitually view women three hundred fifty three I do not purpose to deal fully with this question because it is one which may be more properly dealt with at length by the student of culture and by the historian rather than from the standpoint of empirical psychology It is moreover a question full of complexities in regard to which it is impossible to speak with certainty But we here strike on a factor of such importance such neglected importance for the proper understanding of the sexual relations of men and women that it cannot be wholly ignored Among the negroes of Surinam a woman must live in solitude during the time of her period it is dangerous for any man or woman to approach her and when she sees a person coming near she cries out anxiously Mi kay Mi kay 
5688_41232_000003_000002	train-clean-100	I am unclean 
none	none	I am unclean Throughout the world we find traces of the custom of which this is a typical example but we must not too hastily assume that this custom is evidence of the inferior position occupied by semi civilized women It is necessary to take a broad view not only of the beliefs of semi civilized man regarding menstruation but of his general beliefs regarding the supernatural forces of the world There is no fragment of folk lore so familiar to the European world as that which connects woman with the serpent It is indeed one of the foundation stones of Christian theology three hundred fifty four Yet there is no fragment of folk lore which remains more obscure How has it happened that in all parts of the world the snake or his congeners the lizard and the crocodile have been credited with some design sinister or erotic on women Of the wide prevalence of the belief there can be no doubt Among the Port Lincoln tribe of South Australia a lizard is said to have divided man from woman three hundred fifty five Among the Chiriguanos of Bolivia on the appearance of menstruation old women ran about with sticks to hunt the snake that had wounded the girl Frazer who quotes this example from the Lettres edifiantes et curieuses also refers to a modern Greek folk tale according to which a princess at puberty must not let the sun shine upon her or she would be turned into a lizard three hundred fifty six The lizard was a sexual symbol among the Mexicans In some parts of Brazil at the onset of puberty a girl must not go into the woods for fear of the amorous attacks of snakes and so it is also among the Macusi Indians of British Guiana according to Schomburgk Among the Basutos of South Africa the young girls must dance around the clay image of a snake In Polynesian mythology the lizard is a very sacred animal and legends represent women as often giving birth to lizards three hundred fifty seven At a widely remote spot in Bengal if you dream of a snake a child will be born to you reports Sarat Chandra Mitra three hundred fifty eight In the Berlin Museum fuer Volkerkunde there is a carved wooden figure from New Guinea of a woman into whose vulva a crocodile is inserting its snout while the same museum contains another figure of a snake like crocodile crawling out of a woman s vulva and a third figure shows a small round snake with a small head and closely resembling a penis at the mouth of the vagina All these figures are reproduced by Ploss and Bartels Even in modern Europe the same ideas prevail In Portugal according to Reys it is believed that during menstruation women are liable to be bitten by lizards and to guard against this risk they wear drawers during the period In Germany again it was believed up to the eighteenth century at least that the hair of a menstruating woman if buried would turn into a snake It may be added that in various parts of the world virgin priestesses are dedicated to a snake god and are married to the god three hundred fifty nine At Rome it is interesting to note the serpent was the symbol of fecundation and as such often figures at Pompeii as the genius patrisfamilias the generative power of the family three hundred sixty In Rabbinical tradition also the serpent is the symbol of sexual desire There can be no doubt that as Ploss and Bartels from whom some of these examples have been taken point out in widely different parts of the world menstruation is believed to have been originally caused by a snake and that this conception is frequently associated with an erotic and mystic idea three hundred sixty one How the connection arose Ploss and Bartels are unable to say It can only be suggested that its shape and appearance as well as its venomous nature may have contributed to the mystery everywhere associated with the snake a mystery itself fortified by the association with women to build up this world wide belief regarding the origin of menstruation This primitive theory of the origin of menstruation probably brings before us in its earliest shape the special and intimate bond which has ever been held to connect women by virtue of the menstrual process with the natural or supernatural powers of the world Everywhere menstruating women are supposed to be possessed by spirits and charged with mysterious forces It is at this point that a serious misconception due to ignorance of primitive religious ideas has constantly intruded It is stated that the menstruating woman is unclean and possessed by an evil spirit As a matter of fact however the savage rarely discriminates between bad and good spirits Every spirit may have either a beneficial or malignant influence An interesting instance of this is given in Colenso s Maori Lexicon as illustrated by the meaning of the Maori word atua The importance of recognizing the special sense in which the word unclean is used in this connection was clearly pointed out by Robertson Smith in the case of the Semites The Hebrew word tame unclean he remarked is not the ordinary word for things physically foul it is a ritual term and corresponds exactly to the idea of taboo The ideas unclean and holy seem to us to stand in polar opposition to one another but it was not so with the Semites Among the later Jews the Holy Books defiled the hands of the reader as contact with an impure thing did among Lucian s Syrians the dove was so holy that he who touched it was unclean for a day and the taboo attaching to the swine was explained by some and beyond question correctly explained in the same way Among the heathen Semites three hundred sixty two therefore unclean animals which it was pollution to eat were simply holy animals Robertson Smith here made no reference to menstruation but he exactly described the primitive attitude toward menstruation Wellhausen however dealing with the early Arabians expressly mentions that in pre Islamic days clean and unclean were used solely with reference to women in and out of the menstrual state At a later date Frazer developed this aspect of the conception of taboo and showed how it occurs among savage races generally He pointed out that the conceptions of holiness and pollution not having yet been differentiated women at childbirth and during menstruation are on the same level as divine kings chiefs and priests and must observe the same rules of ceremonial purity To seclude such persons from the rest of the world so that the dreaded spiritual danger shall not spread is the object of the taboo which Frazer compares to an electrical insulator to preserve the spiritual force with which these persons are charged from suffering or inflicting harm by contact with the outer world After describing the phenomena especially the prohibition to touch the ground or see the sun found among various races Frazer concludes The object of secluding women at menstruation is to neutralize the dangerous influences which are supposed to emanate from them at such times The general effect of these rules is to keep the girl suspended so to say between heaven and earth Whether enveloped in her hammock and slung up to the roof as in South America or elevated above the ground in a dark and narrow cage as in New Zealand she may be considered to be out of the way of doing mischief since being shut off both from the earth and from the sun she can poison neither of these great sources of life by her deadly contagion The precautions thus taken to isolate or insulate the girl are dictated by regard for her own safety as well as for the safety of others In short the girl is viewed as charged with a powerful force which if not kept within bounds may prove the destruction both of the girl herself and of all with whom she comes in contact To repress this force within the limits necessary for the safety of all concerned is the object of the taboos in question The same explanation applies to the observance of the same rules by divine kings and priests The uncleanliness as it is called of girls at puberty and the sanctity of holy men do not to the primitive mind differ from each other They are only different manifestations of the same supernatural energy which like energy in general is in itself neither good nor bad but becomes beneficent or malignant according to its application three hundred sixty three More recently this view of the matter has been further extended by the distinguished French sociologist Durkheim Investigating the origins of the prohibition of incest and arguing that it proceeds from the custom of exogamy or marriage outside the clan and that this rests on certain ideas about blood which again are traceable to totemism a theory which we need not here discuss Durkheim is brought face to face with the group of conceptions that now concern us He insists on the extreme ambiguity found in primitive culture concerning the notion of the divine and the close connection between aversion and veneration and points out that it is not only at puberty and each recurrence of the menstrual epoch that women have aroused these emotions but also at childbirth A sentiment of religious horror he continues which can reach such a degree of intensity which can be called forth by so many circumstances and reappears regularly every month to last for a week at least cannot fail to extend its influence beyond the periods to which it was originally confined and to affect the whole course of life A being who must be secluded or avoided for weeks months or years preserves something of the characteristics to which the isolation was due even outside those special periods And in fact in these communities the separation of the sexes is not merely intermittent it has become chronic The two elements of the population live separately Durkheim proceeds to argue that the origin of the occult powers attributed to the feminine organism is to be found in primitive ideas concerning blood Not only menstrual blood but any kind of blood is the object of such feelings among savage and barbarous peoples All sorts of precautions must be observed with regard to blood in it resides a divine principle or as Romans Jews and Arabs believed life itself The prohibition to drink wine the blood of the grape found among some peoples is traced to its resemblance to blood and to its sacrificial employment as among the ancient Arabians and still in the Christian sacrament as a substitute for drinking blood Throughout blood is generally taboo and it taboos everything that comes in contact with it Now woman is chronically the theatre of bloody manifestations and therefore she tends to become chronically taboo for the other members of the community A more or less conscious anxiety a certain religious fear cannot fail to enter into all the relations of her companions with her and that is why all such relations are reduced to a minimum Relations of a sexual character are specially excluded In the first place such relations are so intimate that they are incompatible with the sort of repulsion which the sexes must experience for each other the barrier between them does not permit of such a close union In the second place the organs of the body here specially concerned are precisely the source of the dreaded manifestations Thus it is natural that the feelings of aversion inspired by women attain their greatest intensity at this point Thus it is also that of all parts of the feminine organization it is this region which is most severely shut out from commerce So that while the primitive emotion is mainly one of veneration and is allied to that experienced for kings and priests there is an element of fear in such veneration and what men fear is to some extent odious to them three hundred sixty four These conceptions necessarily mingled at a very early period with men s ideas of sexual intercourse with women and especially with menstruating women Contact with women as Crawley shows by abundant illustration is dangerous In any case indeed the same ideas being transferred to women also coitus produces weakness and it prevents the acquisition of supernatural powers Thus among the western tribes of Canada Boas states Only a youth who has never touched a woman or a virgin both being called te e its can become shamans After having had sexual intercourse men as well as women become t k e el i e weak incapable of gaining supernatural powers The faculty cannot be regained by subsequent fasting and abstinence three hundred sixty five The mysterious effects of sexual intercourse in general are intensified in the case of intercourse with a menstruating woman Thus the ancient Indian legislator declares that the wisdom the energy the strength the sight and the vitality of a man who approaches a woman covered with menstrual excretions utterly perish three hundred sixty six It will be seen that these ideas are impartially spread over the most widely separated parts of the globe They equally affected the Christian Church and the Penitentials ordained forty or fifty days penance for sexual intercourse during menstruation Yet the twofold influence of the menstruating woman remains clear when we review the whole group of influences which in this state she is supposed to exert She by no means acts only by paralyzing social activities and destroying the powers of life by causing flowers to fade fruit to fall from the trees grains to lose their germinative power and grafts to die She is not accurately summed up in the old lines Oh menstruating woman thou rt a fiend From whom all nature should be closely screened Her powers are also beneficial A woman at this time as AElian expressed it is in regular communication with the starry bodies Even at other times a woman when led naked around the orchard protected it from caterpillars said Pliny and this belief is acted upon according to Bastanzi even in the Italy of to day three hundred sixty seven A garment stained with a virgin s menstrual blood it is said in Bavaria is a certain safeguard against cuts and stabs It will also extinguish fire It was valuable as a love philter as a medicine its uses have been endless three hundred sixty eight A sect of Valentinians even attributed sacramental virtues to menstrual blood and partook of it as the blood of Christ The Church soon however acquired a horror of menstruating women they were frequently not allowed to take the sacrament or to enter sacred places and it was sometimes thought best to prohibit the presence of women altogether three hundred sixty nine The Anglo Saxon Penitentials declared that menstruating women must not enter a church It appears to have been Gregory II who overturned this doctrine In our own time the slow disintegration of primitive animistic conceptions aided certainly by the degraded conception of sexual phenomena taught by mediaeval monks for whom woman was templum aedificatum super cloacam has led to a disbelief in the more salutary influences of the menstruating woman A fairly widespread faith in her pernicious influence alone survives It may be traced even in practical and commercial one might add medical quarters In the great sugar refineries in the North of France the regulations strictly forbid a woman to enter the factory while the sugar is boiling or cooling the reason given being that if a woman were to enter during her period the sugar would blacken For the same reason to turn to the East no woman is employed in the opium manufactory at Saigon it being said that the opium would turn and become bitter while Annamite women say that it is very difficult for them to prepare opium pipes during the catamenial period three hundred seventy In India again when a native in charge of a limekiln which had gone wrong declared that one of the women workers must be menstruating all the women Hindus Mahometans aboriginal Gonds et cetera showed by their energetic denials that they understood this superstition three hundred seventy one In eighteen seventy eight a member of the British Medical Association wrote to the British Medical Journal asking whether it was true that if a woman cured hams while menstruating the hams would be spoiled He had known this to happen twice Another medical man wrote that if so what would happen to the patients of menstruating lady doctors A third wrote in the Journal for April twenty seven eighteen seventy eight I thought the fact was so generally known to every housewife and cook that meat would spoil if salted at the menstrual period that I am surprised to see so many letters on the subject in the Journal If I am not mistaken the question was mooted many years ago in the periodicals It is undoubtedly the fact that meat will be tainted if cured by women at the catamenial period Whatever the rationale may be I can speak positively as to the fact It is probably the influence of these primitive ideas which has caused surgeons and gynaecologists to dread operations during the catamenial period Such at all events is the opinion of a distinguished authority doctor William Goodell who wrote in eighteen ninety one three hundred seventy two I have learned to unlearn the teaching that women must not be subjected to a surgical operation during the monthly flux Our forefathers from time immemorial have thought and taught that the presence of a menstruating woman would pollute solemn religious rites would sour milk spoil the fermentation in wine vats and much other mischief in a general way Influenced by hoary tradition modern physicians very generally postpone all operative treatment until the flow has ceased But why this delay if time is precious and it enters as an important factor in the case I have found menstruation to be the very best time to curette away fungous vegetations of the endometrium for being swollen then by the afflux of blood they are larger than at any other time and can the more readily be removed There is indeed no surer way of checking or of stopping a metrorrhagia than by curetting the womb during the very flow While I do not select this period for the removal of ovarian cysts or for other abdominal work such as the extirpation of the ovaries or a kidney or breaking up intestinal adhesions et cetera yet I have not hesitated to perform these operations at such a time and have never had reason to regret the course The only operations that I should dislike to perform during menstruation would be those involving the womb itself It must be added to this that we still have to take into consideration not merely the surviving influence of ancient primitive beliefs but the possible existence of actual nervous conditions during the menstrual period producing what may be described as an abnormal nervous tension In this way we are doubtless concerned with a tissue of phenomena inextricably woven of folk lore autosuggestion false observation and real mental and nervous abnormality Laurent loc cit has brought forward several cases which may illustrate this point Thus he speaks of two young girls of about sixteen and seventeen slightly neuropathic but without definite hysterical symptoms who during the menstrual period feel themselves in a sort of electrical state with tingling and prickling sensations and feelings of attraction or repulsion at the contact of various objects These girls believe their garments stick to their skin during the periods it was only with difficulty that they could remove their slippers though fitting easily stockings had to be drawn off violently by another person and they had given up changing their chemises during the period because the linen became so glued to the skin An orchestral performer on the double bass informed Laurent that whenever he left a tuned double bass in his lodgings during his wife s period a string snapped consequently he always removed his instrument at this time to a friend s house He added that the same thing happened two years earlier with a mistress a cafe concert singer who had indeed warned him beforehand A harpist also informed Laurent that she had been obliged to give up her profession because during her periods several strings of her harp always the same strings broke especially when she was playing A friend of Laurent s an official in Cochin China also told him that the strings of his violin often snapped during the menstrual periods of his Annamite mistress who informed him that Annamite women are familiar with the phenomenon and are careful not to play on their instruments at this time Two young ladies both good violinists also affirmed that ever since their first menstruation they had noted a tendency for the strings to snap at this period one a genuine artist who often performed at charity concerts systematically refused to play at these times and was often embarrassed to find a pretext the other who admitted that she was nervous and irritable at such times had given up playing on account of the trouble of changing the strings so frequently Laurent also refers to the frequency with which women break things during the menstrual periods and considers that this is not simply due to the awkwardness caused by nervous exhaustion or hysterical tremors but that there is spontaneous breakage Most usually it happens that a glass breaks when it is being dried with a cloth needles also break with unusual facility at this time clocks are stopped by merely placing the hand upon them I do not here attempt to estimate critically the validity of these alleged manifestations some of which may certainly be explained by the unconscious muscular action which forms the basis of the phenomena of table turning and thought reading such a task may best be undertaken through the minute study of isolated cases and in this place I am merely concerned with the general influence of the menstrual state in affecting the social position of women without reference to the analysis of the elements that go to make up that influence There is only one further point to which attention may be called I allude to the way in which the more favorable side of the primitive conception of the menstruating woman as priestess sibyl prophetess an almost miraculous agent for good an angel the peculiar home of the divine element was slowly and continuously carried on side by side with the less favorable view through the beginnings of European civilization until our own times The actual physical phenomena of menstruation with the ideas of taboo associated with that state sank into the background as culture evolved but on the other hand the ideas of the angelic position and spiritual mission of women based on the primitive conception of the mystery associated with menstruation still in some degree persisted It is evident however that while in one form or another the more favorable aspect of the primitive view of women s magic function has never quite died out the gradual decay and degradation of the primitive view has on the whole involved a lower estimate of women s nature and position Woman has always been the witch she was so even in ancient Babylonia but she has ceased to be the priestess The early Teutons saw sanctum aliquid et providum in women who for the mediaeval German preacher were only bestiae bipedales and Schopenhauer and even Nietzsche have been more inclined to side with the preacher than with the half naked philosophers of Tacitus s day But both views alike are but the extremes of the same primitive conception and the gradual evolution from one extreme of the magical doctrine to the other was inevitable In an advanced civilization as we see these ideas having their ultimate basis on the old story of the serpent and on a special and mysterious connection between the menstruating woman and the occult forces of magic tend to die out The separation of the sexes they involve becomes unnecessary Living in greater community with men women are seen to possess something it may well be but less than before of the angel devil of early theories Menstruation is no longer a monstrific state requiring spiritual taboo but a normal physiological process not without its psychic influences on the woman herself and on those who live with her FOOTNOTES three hundred fifty three Several recent works however notably Frazer s Golden Bough and Crawley s Mystic Rose throw light directly or indirectly on this question three hundred fifty four Robertson Smith points out that since snakes are the last noxious animals

three hundred seventy two As quoted in the Provincial Medical Journal April eighteen ninety one APPENDIX B SEXUAL PERIODICITY IN MEN BY F H PERRY COSTE B Sc LOND In a recent brochure on the Rhythm of the Pulse three hundred seventy three I showed inter alia that the readings of the pulse in both man and woman if arranged in lunar monthly periods and averaged over several years displayed a clear and sometimes very strongly marked and symmetrical rhythm three hundred seventy four After pointing out that in at any rate some cases the male and female pulse curves both monthly and annual seemed to be converse to one another I added It is difficult to ignore the suggestion that in this tracing of the monthly rhythm of the pulse we have a history of the monthly function in women and that if so the tracing of the male pulse may eventually afford us some help in discovering a corresponding monthly period in men the existence of which has been suggested by mister Havelock Ellis and Professor Stanley Hall among other writers Certainly the mere fact that we can trace a clear monthly rhythm in man s pulse seems to point strongly to the existence of a monthly physiological period in him also Obviously however it is only indirectly and by inference that we can argue from a monthly rhythm of the pulse in men to a male sexual periodicity but I am now able to adduce more direct evidence that will fairly demonstrate the existence of a sexual periodicity in men We will start from the fact that celibacy is profoundly unnatural and is therefore a physical as well as an emotional and intellectual abnormality This being so it is entirety in accord with all that we know of physiology that when relief to the sexual secretory system by Nature s means is denied and when in consequence a certain degree of tension or pressure has been attained the system should relieve itself by a spontaneous discharge such discharge being of course in the strict sense of the term pathological since it would never occur in any animal that followed the strict law of its physical being without any regard to other and higher laws of concern for its fellows Notoriously that which we should have anticipated a priori actually occurs for any unmarried man who lives in strict chastity periodically experiences while sleeping a loss of seminal fluid such phenomena being popularly referred to as wet dreams three hundred seventy five During some eight or ten years I have carefully recorded the occurrence of such discharges as I have experienced myself and I have now accumulated sufficient data to justify an attempt to formulate some provisional conclusions three hundred seventy six In order to render these observations as serviceable as may be to students of periodicity I here repeat at the request of mister Havelock Ellis the statement which was subjoined for the same reasons to my Rhythm of the Pulse These observations upon myself were made between the ages of twenty and thirty three I am about five feet nine inches tall broad shouldered and weigh about ten stone three lbs net this weight being I believe about seven lbs below the normal for my height Also I have green brown eyes very dark brown hair and a complexion that leads strangers frequently to mistake me for a foreigner this complexion being perhaps attributable to some Huguenot blood although on the maternal side I am so far as all information goes pure English I can stand a good deal of heat enjoy relaxing climates am at once upset by bracing sea air hate the cold and sweat profusely after exercise To this it will suffice to add that my temperament is of a decidedly nervous and emotional type Before proceeding to remark upon the various rhythms that I have discovered I will tabulate the data on which my conclusions are founded The numbers of discharges recorded in the years in question are as follows In eighteen eighty six thirty Records commenced in April In eighteen eighty seven forty In eighteen eighty eight thirty seven In eighteen eighty nine eighteen Pretty certainly not fully recorded In eighteen ninety zero No records kept this year three hundred seventy seven In eighteen ninety one nineteen Records recommenced in June In eighteen ninety two thirty five In eighteen ninety three forty In eighteen ninety four thirty eight In eighteen ninety five thirty six In eighteen ninety six thirty six In eighteen ninety seven thirty five Average thirty seven Omitting eighteen eighty six eighteen eighty nine and eighteen ninety one Thus I have complete records for eight years and incomplete records for three more and the remarkable concord between the respective annual numbers of observations in these eight years not only affords us intrinsic evidence of the accuracy of my records but also at once proves that there is an undeniable regularity in the occurrence of these sexual discharges and therefore gives us reason for expecting to find this regularity rhythmical Moreover since it seemed reasonable to expect that there might be more than one rhythm I have examined my data with a view to discovering one an annual two a lunar monthly and three a weekly rhythm and I now proceed to show that all three such rhythms exist THE ANNUAL RHYTHM It is obvious that in searching for an annual rhythm we must ignore the records of the three incomplete years but those of the remaining eight are graphically depicted upon Chart eight The curves speak so plainly for themselves that any comment were almost superfluous and the concord between the various curves although of course not perfect is far greater than the scantiness of the data would have justified us in expecting The curves all agree in pointing to the existence of three well defined maxima viz in March June and September these being therefore the months in which the sexual instinct is most active and the later curves show that there is also often a fourth maximum in January In the earlier years the March and June maxima are more strikingly marked than the September one but the uppermost curve shows that on the average of all eight years the September maximum is the highest the June and January maxima occupying the second place and the March maximum being the least strongly marked of all Now remembering that in calculating the curves of the annual rhythm of the pulse I had found it necessary to average two months records together in order to bring out the full significance of the rhythm I thought it well to try the effect upon these curves also of similarly averaging two months together At first my results were fairly satisfactory but as my data increased year by year I found that these curves were contradicting one another and therefore concluded that I had selected unnatural periods for my averaging My first attempted remedy was to arrange the months in the pairs December January February March et cetera instead of in January February March April et cetera but with these pairs I fared no better than with the former I then arranged the months in the triplets January February March et cetera and the results are graphically recorded on Chart seven Here again comment would be quite futile but I need only point out that on the whole the sexual activity rises steadily during the first nine months in the year to its maximum in September and then sinks rapidly and abruptly during the next three to its minimum in December The study of these curves suggests two interesting questions to neither of which however do the data afford us an answer In the first place are the alterations in my case of the maximum of the discharges from March and June in the earlier years to September in the later and the interpolation of a new secondary maximum in January correlated with the increase in age or is the discrepancy due simply to a temporary irregularity that would have been equally averaged out had I recorded the discharges of eighteen eighty one eighty nine instead of those from eighteen eighty seven to eighteen ninety seven The second question is one of very great importance socially ethically and physically How often in this climate should a man have sexual connection with his wife in order to maintain himself in perfect physiological equilibrium My results enable us to state definitely the minimum limits and to reply that thirty seven embraces annually would be too few but unfortunately they give us no clue to the maximum limit It is obvious that the necessary frequency should be greater than thirty seven times annually possibly very considerably in excess thereof seeing that the spontaneous discharges with which we are dealing are due to over pressure and occur only when the system being denied natural relief can no longer retain its secretions and therefore it seems very reasonable to suggest that the frequency of natural relief should be some multiple of thirty seven I do not perceive however that the data in hand afford us any clue to this multiple or enable us to suggest either two three four or five as the required multiple of thirty seven It is true that other observations upon myself have afforded me what I believe to be a fairly satisfactory and reliable answer so far as concerns myself but these observations are of such a nature that they cannot be discussed here and I have no inclination to offer as a counsel to others an opinion which I am unable to justify by the citation of facts and statistics Moreover I am quite unable to opine whether given thirty seven as the annual frequency of spontaneous discharges in a number of men the multiple required for the frequency of natural relief should be the same in every case For aught I know to the contrary the physiological idiosyncrasies of men may be so varied that given two men with an annual frequency of thirty seven spontaneous discharges the desired multiple may be in one case X and in the other twoX three hundred seventy eight Our data however do clearly denote that the frequency in the six or eight summer months should bear to the frequency of the six or four winter months the proportion of three or four to two three hundred seventy nine It should never be forgotten however that under all conditions both man and wife should exercise prudence both selfward and otherward and that each should utterly refuse to gratify self by accepting a sacrifice however willingly offered that may be gravely prejudicial to the health of the other for only experience can show whether in any union the receptivity of the woman be greater or less than or equal to the physical desire of the man To those of course who regard marriage from the old fashioned and grossly immoral standpoint of Melancthon and other theologians and who consider a wife as the divinely ordained vehicle for the chartered intemperance of her husband it will seem grotesque in the highest degree that a physiological inquirer should attempt to advise them how often to seek the embraces of their wives but those who regard woman from the standpoint of a higher ethics who abhor the notion that she should be only the vehicle for her husband s passions and who demand that she shall be mistress of her own body will not be ungrateful for any guidance that physiology can afford them It will be seen presently moreover that the study of the weekly rhythm does afford us some less inexact clue to the desired solution One curious fact may be mentioned before we quit this interesting question It is stated that Solon required of the husband three payments per month By the Misna a daily debt was imposed upon an idle vigorous young husband twice a week on a citizen once in thirty days on a camel driver once in six months on a seaman three hundred eighty Now it is certainly striking that Solon s three payments per month exactly correspond with my records of thirty seven discharges annually Had Solon similarly recorded a series of observations upon himself THE LUNAR MONTHLY RHYTHM We now come to that division of the inquiry which is of the greatest physiological interest although of little social import Is there a monthly period in man as well as in woman My records indicate clearly that there is In searching for this monthly rhythm I have utilized not only the data of the eight completely recorded years but also those of the three years of eighteen eighty six eighteen eighty nine and eighteen ninety one for although it would obviously have been inaccurate to utilize these incomplete records when calculating the yearly rhythm there seems no objection to making use of them in the present section of the inquiry It is hardly necessary to remark that the terms first day of the month second day third day et cetera are to be understood as denoting new moon day day after new moon third lunar day and so on but it should be explained that since these discharges occur at night I have adopted the astronomical instead of the civil day so that a new moon occurring between noon yesterday and noon to day is reckoned as occurring yesterday and yesterday is regarded as the first lunar day thus a discharge occurring in the night between December thirty first and January first is tabulated as occurring on December thirty first and in the present discussion is assigned to the lunar day comprised between noon of December thirty first and noon of January first Since it is obvious that the number of discharges in any one year averaging as they do only one point twenty five per day are far too few to yield a curve of any value I have combined my data in two series The dotted curve on Chart nine is obtained by combining the results of the years eighteen eighty six ninety two two of these years are incompletely recorded and there are no records for eighteen ninety the total number of observations was one hundred seventy nine The broken curve is obtained by combining those of the years eighteen ninety three ninety seven the total number of observations being one hundred eighty five Even so the data are far too scanty to yield a really characteristic curve but the continuous curve which sums up the results of the eleven years is more reliable and obviously more satisfactory If the two former curves be compared it will be seen that on the whole they display a general concordance such differences as exist being attributable chiefly to two facts one that the second curve is more even throughout neither maximum nor minimum being so strongly marked as in the first and two that the main maximum occurs in the middle of the month instead of on the second lunar day and the absence of the marked initial maximum alters the character of the first week or so of this curve It is however scarcely fair to lay any great stress on the characters of curves obtained from such scanty data and we will therefore pass to the continuous curve the study of which will prove more valuable three hundred eighty one Now even a cursory examination of this continuous curve will yield the following results one The discharges occur most frequently on the second lunar day two The days of the next most frequent discharges are the twenty twod the thirteenth the seventh twentieth and twenty sixth the eleventh and sixteenth so that if we regard only the first six of these we find that the discharges occur most frequently on the twod seventh thirteenth twentieth twenty twod and twenty sixth lunar days i e the discharges occur most frequently on days separated on the average by four day intervals but actually the period between the twentieth and twenty twod days is that characterized by the most frequent discharges three The days of minimum of discharge are the first fifth fifteenth eighteenth and twenty first four The curve is characterized by a continual see sawing so that every notable maximum is immediately followed by a notable minimum Thus the curve is of an entirely different character from that representing the monthly rhythm of the pulse three hundred eighty two and this is only what one might have expected for whereas the mean pulsations vary only very slightly from day to day thus giving rise to a gradually rising or sinking curve a discharge from the sexual system relieves the tension by exhausting the stored up secretion and is necessarily followed by some days of rest and inactivity In the very nature of the case therefore a curve of this kind could not possibly be otherwise than most irregular if the discharges tended to occur most frequently upon definite days of the month and thus the very irregularity of the curve affords us proof that there is a regular male periodicity such that on certain days of the month there is greater probability of a spontaneous discharge than on any other days five Gratifying however though this irregularity of the curve may be yet it entails a corresponding disadvantage for we are precluded thereby from readily perceiving the characteristics of the monthly rhythm as a whole I thought that perhaps this aspect of the rhythm might be rendered plainer if I calculated the data into two day averages and the result as shown in Chart ten is extremely satisfactory Here we can at once perceive the wonderful and almost geometric symmetry of the monthly rhythm indeed if the third maximum were one unit higher if the first minimum were one unit lower and if the lines joining the second minimum and third maximum and the fourth maximum and fourth minimum were straight instead of being slightly broken then the curve would in its chief features be geometrically symmetrical and this symmetry appears to me to afford a convincing proof of the representative accuracy of the curve We see that the month is divided into five periods that the maxima occur on the following pairs of days the nineteenth twentieth thirteenth fourteenth twenty fifth twenty sixth first twod seventh eighth and that the minima occur at the beginning end and exact middle of the month There have been many idle superstitions as to the influence of the moon upon the earth and its inhabitants and some beliefs that once deemed equally idle have now been re instated in the regard of science but it would certainly seem to be a very fascinating and very curious fact if the influence of the moon upon men should be such as to regulate the spontaneous discharges of their sexual system Certainly the lovers of all ages would then have builded better than they knew when they reared altars of devotional verse to that chaste goddess Artemis THE WEEKLY RHYTHM We now come to the third branch of our inquiry and have to ask whether there be any weekly rhythm of the sexual activity A priori it might be answered that to expect any such weekly rhythm were absurd seeing that our week unlike the lunar month of the year is a purely artificial and conventional period while on the other hand it might be retorted that the existence of an induced weekly periodicity is quite conceivable such periodicity being induced by the habitual difference between our occupation or mode of life on one or two days of the week and that on the remaining days In such an inquiry however a priori argument is futile as the question can be answered only by an induction from observations and the curves on Chart eleven A and B prove conclusively that there is a notable weekly rhythm The existence of this weekly rhythm being granted it would naturally be assumed that either the maximum or the minimum would regularly occur on Saturday or Sunday but an examination of the curves discloses the unexpected result that the day of maximum discharge varies from year to year Thus it is three hundred eighty three Sunday in eighteen eighty eight eighteen ninety two eighteen ninety six Tuesday in eighteen ninety four Thursday in eighteen eighty six eighteen ninety seven Friday in eighteen eighty seven Saturday in eighteen ninety three and eighteen ninety five Since in Chart eleven the curves are drawn from Sunday to Sunday it is obvious that the real symmetry of the curve is brought out in those years only which are characterized by a Sunday maximum and accordingly in Chart twelve I have depicted the curves in a more suitable form Chart twelve A is obtained by combining the data of eighteen eighty eight eighteen ninety two and eighteen ninety six the years of a Sunday maximum Curve twelve B represents the results of eighteen ninety four the year of a Tuesday maximum multiplied throughout by three in order to render the curve strictly comparable with the former Curve twelve C represents eighteen eighty six and eighteen ninety seven the years of a Thursday maximum similarly multiplied by one point five In Curve twelve D we have the results of eighteen eighty seven the year of a Friday maximum again multiplied by three and in Curve twelve E those of eighteen ninety three and eighteen ninety five the years of a Saturday maximum multiplied by one point five Finally Curve twelve F represents the combined results of all nine years plus the latter half of eighteen ninety one and this curve shows that on the whole period there is a very strongly marked Sunday maximum I hardly think that these curves call for much comment In their general character they display a notable concord among themselves and it is significant that the most regular of the five curves are A and E representing the combinations of three years and of two years respectively while the least regular is B which is based upon the records of one year only In every case we find that the maximum which opens the week is rapidly succeeded by a minimum which is itself succeeded by a secondary maximum usually very secondary although in eighteen ninety four it nearly equals the primary maximum followed again by a second minimum usually nearly identical with the first minimum after which there is a rapid rise to the original maximum The study of these curves fortunately amplifies the conclusion drawn from our study of the annual rhythm and suggests that in at least part of the year the physiological condition of man requires sexual union at least twice a week As to Curve twelve F its remarkable symmetry speaks for itself The existence of two secondary maxima however has not the same significance as had that of our secondary maximum in the preceding curves for one of these secondary maxima is due to the influence of the eighteen ninety four curve with its primary Tuesday maximum and the other to the similar influence of Curve C with its primary Thursday maximum Similarly the veiled third secondary maximum is due to the influence of Curve E Probably any student of curves will concede that on a still larger average the two secondary maxima of Curve F would be replaced by a single one on Wednesday or Thursday One more question remains for consideration in connection with this weekly rhythm Is it possible to trace any connection between the weekly and yearly rhythms of such a character that the weekly day of maximum discharge should vary from month to month in the year in other words does the greater frequency of a Sunday discharge characterize one part of the year that of a Tuesday another and so on In order to answer this question I have re calculated all my data with results that are graphically represented in Chart thirteen These curves prove that the Sunday maxima discharges occur in March and September and the minima in June that the Monday maxima discharges occur in September Friday in July and so on Thus there is a regular rhythm according to which the days of maximum discharge vary from one month of the year to another and the existence of this final rhythm appears to me very remarkable I would especially direct attention to the almost geometric symmetry of the Sunday curve and to the only less complete symmetry of the Thursday and Friday curves Certainly in these rhythms we have an ample field for farther study and speculation I have now concluded my study of this fascinating inquiry a study that is necessarily incomplete since it is based upon records furnished by one individual only The fact however that even with so few observations and notwithstanding the consequently exaggerated disturbing influence of minor irregularities such remarkable and unexpected symmetry is evidenced by these curves only increases one s desire to have the opportunity of handling a series of observations sufficiently numerous to render the generalizations induced from them absolutely conclusive I would again appeal three hundred eighty four to heads of colleges to assist this inquiry by enlisting in its aid a band of students If only one hundred students living under similar conditions could be induced to keep such records with scrupulous regularity for only twelve months the results induced from such a series of observations would be more than ten times as valuable as those which have only been reached after ten years observations on my part and if other centuries of students in foreign and colonial colleges e g in Italy India Australia and America could be similarly enlisted in this work we should quickly obtain a series of results exhibiting the sexual needs and sexual peculiarities of the male human animal in various climates Obviously however the records of any such students would be worse than useless unless their care and accuracy on the one hand and their habitual chastity on the other could be implicitly guaranteed FOOTNOTES three hundred seventy three First published in the University Magazine and Free Review of February eighteen ninety eight and since reprinted as a pamphlet A preliminary communication appeared in Nature May fourteen eighteen ninety one three hundred seventy four Later study nineteen oh six has convinced me that my attempt to find a lunar monthly period in the female pulse was vitiated by a hopeless error for any monthly rhythm in a woman must be sought by arranging her records according to her own menstrual month and this menstrual month may vary in different women from considerably less than a lunar month to thirty days or more three hundred seventy five I may add however that in my own case these discharges are so far as I can trust my waking consciousness frequently if not usually dreamless and that strictly sexual dreams are extremely rare notwithstanding the possession of a strongly emotional temperament three hundred seventy six If I can trust my memory I first experienced this discharge when a few months under fifteen years of age and if so within a few weeks of the time when I was in an instant suddenly struck with the thought that possibly the religion in which I had been educated might be false It is curiously interesting that the advent of puberty should have been heralded by this intellectual crisis three hundred seventy seven This unfortunate breach in the records was due to the fact that failing to discover any regularity in or law of the occurrences of the discharges I became discouraged and abandoned my records In June eighteen ninety one a re examination of my pulse records having led to my discovery of a lunar monthly rhythm of the pulse my interest in other physiological periodicities was reawakened and I recommenced my records of these discharges three hundred seventy eight As a matter of fact I take it that we may safely assert that no man who is content to be guided by his own instinctive cravings and who neither suppresses these on the one hand nor endeavors to force himself on the other hand will be in any danger of erring by either excess or the contrary three hundred seventy nine It is obvious that the opportunity of continuing such an inquiry as that described in this Appendix ceases with marriage but I may add nineteen oh six that certain notes that I have kept with scrupulous exactness during eight years of married life lend almost no support to the suggestion made in the text i e that sexual desire is greater at one season of the year than at another The nature of these notes I cannot discuss but they clearly indicate that although there is a slight degree more of sexual desire in the second and third quarters of the year than in the first and fourth yet this difference is so slight as to be almost negligible Even if the months be rearranged in the triplets November December January et cetera so as to bring the maximum months of May June and July together the difference between the highest quarter and the lowest amounts to an increase of only ten per cent upon the latter after allowing of course for the abnormal shortness of February and neglecting February the increase in the maximum months June and July over the minimum November is equal to an increase of under fourteen per cent upon the latter These differences are so vastly less than those shown on Chart seven that they possess almost no significance but lest too much stress be laid upon the apparently equalizing influence of married life it must be added that the records discussed in the text were obtained during residence in London whereas since my marriage I have lived in South Cornwall where the climate is both milder and more equable three hundred eighty Selden s Uxor Hebraica as quoted in Gibbon s Decline and Fall vol v p fifty two of Bonn s edition

to chart these two additional curves three hundred eighty two See Rhythm of the Pulse Chart four three hundred eighty three As will be observed I have omitted the results of the incompletely recorded years of eighteen eighty nine and eighteen ninety one The apparent explanation of this curious oscillation will be given directly three hundred eighty four See Rhythm of the Pulse p twenty one APPENDIX C THE AUTO EROTIC FACTOR IN RELIGION The intimate association between the emotions of love and religion is well known to all those who are habitually brought into close contact with the phenomena of the religious life Love and religion are the two most volcanic emotions to which the human organism is liable and it is not surprising that when there is a disturbance in one of these spheres the vibrations should readily extend to the other Nor is it surprising that the two emotions should have a dynamic relation to each other and that the auto erotic impulse being the more primitive and fundamental of the two impulses should be able to pass its unexpended energy over to the religious emotion there to find the expansion hitherto denied it the love of the human becoming the love of the divine I was not good enough for man And so am given to God Even when there is absolute physical suppression on the sexual side it seems probable that thereby a greater intensity of spiritual fervor is caused Many eminent thinkers seem to have been without sexual desire It is a noteworthy and significant fact that the age of love is also the age of conversion Starbuck for instance in his very elaborate study of the psychology of conversion shows that the majority of conversions take place during the period of adolescence that is from the age of puberty to about twenty four or twenty five three hundred eighty five It would be easy to bring forward a long series of observations from the most various points of view to show the wide recognition of this close affinity between the sexual and the religious emotions It is probable as Hahn points out that the connection between sexual suppression and religious rites which we may trace at the very beginning of culture was due to an instinctive impulse to heighten rather than abolish the sexual element Early religious rites were largely sexual and orgiastic because they were largely an appeal to the generative forces of Nature to exhibit a beneficial productiveness Among happily married people as Hahn remarks the sexual emotions rapidly give place to the cares and anxieties involved in supporting children but when the exercise of the sexual function is prevented by celibacy or even by castration the most complete form of celibacy the sexual emotions may pass into the psychical sphere to take on a more pronounced shape three hundred eighty six The early Christians adopted the traditional Eastern association between religion and celibacy and as the writings of the Fathers amply show they expended on sexual matters a concentrated fervor of thought rarely known to the Greek and Roman writers of the best period three hundred eighty seven As Christian theology developed the minute inquisition into sexual things sometimes became almost an obsession So far as I am aware however I cannot profess to have made any special investigation it was not until the late Middle Ages that there is any clear recognition of the fact that between the religious emotions and the sexual emotions there is not only a superficial antagonism but an underlying relationship At this time so great a theologian and philosopher as Aquinas said that it is especially on the days when a man is seeking to make himself pleasing to God that the Devil troubles him by polluting him with seminal emissions With somewhat more psychological insight the wise old Knight of the Tower Landry in the fourteenth century tells his daughters that no young woman in love can ever serve her God with that unfeignedness which she did aforetime For I have heard it argued by many who in their young days had been in love that when they were in the church the condition and the pleasing melancholy in which they found themselves would infallibly set them brooding over all their tender love sick longings and all their amorous passages when they should have been attending to the service which was going on at the time And such is the property of this mystery of love that it is ever at the moment when the priest is holding our Saviour upon the altar that the most enticing emotions come After narrating the history of two queens beyond the seas who indulged in amours even on Holy Thursday and Good Friday at midnight in their oratories when the lights were put out he concludes Every woman in love is more liable to fall in church or at her devotion than at any other time The connection between religious emotion and sexual emotion was very clearly set forth by Swift about the end of the seventeenth century in a passage which it may be worth while to quote from his Discourse Concerning the Mechanical Operation of the Spirit After mentioning that he was informed by a very eminent physician that when the Quakers first appeared he was seldom without female Quaker patients affected with nymphomania Swift continues Persons of a visionary devotion either men or women are in their complexion of all others the most amorous For zeal is frequently kindled from the same spark with other fires and from inflaming brotherly love will proceed to raise that of a gallant If we inspect into the usual process of modern courtship we shall find it to consist in a devout turn of the eyes called ogling an artificial form of canting and whining by rote every interval for want of other matter made up with a shrug or a hum a sigh or a groan the style compact of insignificant words incoherences and repetitions These I take to be the most accomplished rules of address to a mistress and where are these performed with more dexterity than by the saints Nay to bring this argument yet closer I have been informed by certain sanguine brethren of the first class that in the height and orgasmus of their spiritual exercise it has been frequent with them three hundred eighty eight immediately after which they found the spirit to relax and flag of a sudden with the nerves and they were forced to hasten to a conclusion This may be farther strengthened by observing with wonder how unaccountably all females are attracted by visionary or enthusiastic preachers though never so contemptible in their outward mien which is usually supposed to be done upon considerations purely spiritual without any carnal regards at all But I have reason to think the sex hath certain characteristics by which they form a truer judgment of human abilities and performings than we ourselves can possibly do of each other Let that be as it will thus much is certain that however spiritual intrigues begin they generally conclude like all others they may branch upwards toward heaven but the root is in the earth Too intense a contemplation is not the business of flesh and blood it must by the necessary course of things in a little time let go its hold and fall into matter Lovers for the sake of celestial converse are but another sort of Platonics who pretend to see stars and heaven in ladies eyes and to look or think no lower but the same pit is provided for both To come down to recent times in the last century the head master of Clifton College when discussing the sexual vices of boyhood remarked that the boys whose temperament exposes them to these faults are usually far from destitute of religious feelings that there is and always has been an undoubted company existence of religion and animalism that emotional appeals and revivals are far from rooting out carnal sin and that in some places as is well known they seem actually to stimulate even at the present day to increased licentiousness three hundred eighty nine It is not difficult to see how even in technique the method of the revivalist is a quasi sexual method and resembles the attempt of the male to overcome the sexual shyness of the female In each case as W Thomas remarks the will has to be set aside and strong suggestive means are used and in both cases the appeal is not of the conflict type but of an intimate sympathetic and pleading kind In the effort to make a moral adjustment it consequently turns out that a technique is used which was derived originally from sexual life and the use so to speak of the sexual machinery for a moral adjustment involves in some cases the carrying over into the general process of some sexual manifestations three hundred ninety The relationship of the sexual and the religious emotions like so many other of the essential characters of human nature is seen in its nakedest shape by the alienist Esquirol referred to this relationship and many years ago J B Friedreich a German alienist of wide outlook and considerable insight emphasized the connection between the sexual and the religious emotions and brought forward illustrative cases three hundred ninety one Schroeder van der Kolk also remarked I venture to express my conviction that we should rarely err if in a case of religious melancholy we assumed the sexual apparatus to be implicated three hundred ninety two Regis in France lays it down that there exists a close connection between mystic ideas and erotic ideas and most often these two orders of conception are associated in insanity three hundred ninety three Berthier considered that erotic forms of insanity are those most frequently found in convents Bevan Lewis points out how frequently religious exaltation occurs at puberty in women and religious depression at the climacteric the period of sexual decline three hundred ninety four Religion is very closely allied to love remarks Savage and the love of woman and the worship of God are constantly sources of trouble in unstable youth it is very interesting to note the frequency with which these two deep feelings are associated three hundred ninety five Closely connected with salacity particularly in women remarks Conolly Norman when discussing mania Tuke s Dictionary of Psychological Medicine is religious excitement Ecstasy as we see in cases of acute mental disease is probably always connected with sexual excitement if not with sexual depravity The same association is constantly seen in less extreme cases and one of the commonest features in the conversation of an acutely maniacal woman is the intermingling of erotic and religious ideas Patients who believe remarks Clara Barrus that they are the Virgin Mary the bride of Christ the Church God s wife and Raphael s consort are sure sooner or later to disclose symptoms which show that they are some way or other sexually depraved three hundred ninety six Forel who devotes a chapter of his book Die Sexuelle Frage to the subject argues that the strongest feelings of religious emotion are often unconsciously rooted in erotic emotion or represent a transformation of such emotion and in an interesting discussion Ch VI of this question in his Sexualleben unserer Zeit Bloch states that in a certain sense we may describe the history of religions as the history of a special manifestation of the human sexual instinct Ball Brouardel Morselli Vallon and Marie three hundred ninety seven C H Hughes three hundred ninety eight to mention but a few names among many have emphasized the same point three hundred ninety nine Krafft Ebing deals briefly with the connection between holiness and the sexual emotion and the special liability of the saints to sexual temptations he thus states his own conclusions Religious and sexual emotional states at the height of their development exhibit a harmony in quantity and quality of excitement and can thus in certain circumstances act vicariously Both he adds can be converted into cruelty under pathological conditions four hundred After quoting these opinions it is perhaps not unnecessary to point out that while sexual emotion constitutes the main reservoir of energy on which religion can draw it is far from constituting either the whole content of religion or its root Murisier in an able study of the psychology of religious ecstasy justly protests against too crude an explanation of its nature though at the same time he admits that the passion of the religious ecstatic lacks nothing of what goes to make up sexual love not even jealousy four hundred one Serieux in his little work Recherches Cliniques sur les Anomalies de l Instinct Sexuel valuable on account of its instructive cases records in detail a case which so admirably illustrates this phase of auto erotism on the borderland between ordinary erotic day dreaming and religious mysticism the phenomena for a time reaching an insane degree of intensity that I summarize it Therese M aged twenty four shows physical stigmata of degeneration The heredity is also bad the father is a man of reckless and irregular conduct the mother was at one time in a lunatic asylum The patient was brought up in an orphanage and was a troublesome volatile child she treated household occupations with contempt but was fond of study Even at an early age her lively imagination attracted attention and the pleasure which she took in building castles in the air From the age of seven to ten she masturbated At her first communion she felt that Jesus would for ever be the one master of her heart At thirteen after the death of her mother she seemed to see her and to hear her say that she was watching over her child Shortly afterward she was overwhelmed by a new grief the death of a teacher for whom she cherished great affection on account of her pure character On the following day she seemed to see and hear this teacher and would not leave the house where the body lay Tendencies to melancholy appeared Saddened by the funeral ceremonies exhorted by nuns fed on mystic revery she passed from the orphanage to a convent She devoted herself solely to the worship of Jesus to be like Jesus to be near Jesus became her constant pre occupations The Virgin s name was rarely seen in her writings God s name never I wanted she said to love Jesus more than any of the nuns I saw and I even thought that he had a partiality for me She was also haunted by the idea of preserving her purity She avoided frivolous conversation and left the room when marriage was discussed such a union being incompatible with a pure life it was my fixed idea for two years to make my soul ever more pure in order to be agreeable to Him the Beloved is well pleased among the lilies Already however in a rudimentary form appeared contrary tendencies strictly speaking they were not contrary but related tendencies Beneath the mystic passion which concealed it sexual desire was sometimes felt At sixteen she experienced emotions which she could not master when thinking of a priest who she said loved her In spite of all remorse she would have been willing to have relations with him Notwithstanding these passing weaknesses the idea of purity always possessed her The nuns however were concerned about her exaltation She was sent away from the convent became discouraged and took a place as a servant but her fervor continued Her confessor inspired her with great affection she sends him tender letters She would be willing to have relations with him even though she considers the desire a temptation of the devil The ground was now prepared for the manifestation of hallucinations One evening in May she writes after being absorbed in thoughts of my confessor and feeling discouraged as I thought that Jesus whom I loved so much would have nothing to do with me Mother I cried out what must I do to win your son My eyes were fixed on the sky and I remained in a state of mad expectation It was absurd I to become the mother of the World My heart went on repeating Yes he is coming Jesus is coming The psychic erethism reverberating on the sensorial and sensory centres led to genital auditory and visual hallucinations which produced the sensation of sexual connection For the first time I went to bed and was not alone As soon as I felt that touch I heard the words Fear not it is I I was lost in Him whom I loved For many days I was cradled in a world of pleasure I saw Him everywhere overwhelming me with His chaste caresses On the following day at mass she seemed to see Calvary before her Jesus was naked and surrounded by a thousand voluptuous imaginations His arms were loosened from the cross and he said to me Come I longed to fly to Him with my body but could not make up my mind to show myself naked However I was carried away by a force I could not control I threw myself on my Saviour s neck and felt that all was over between the world and me From that day by sheer reasoning she has understood everything Previously she thought that the religious life was a renunciation of the joys of marriage and enjoyment generally now she understands its object Jesus Christ desires that she should have relations with a priest he is himself incarnated in priests just as saint Joseph was the guardian of the Virgin so are priests the guardians of nuns She has been impregnated by Jesus and this imaginary pregnancy pre occupies her in the highest degree From this time she masturbated daily She cannot even go to communion without experiencing voluptuous sensations Her delusions having thus become systematized nothing shakes her tenacity in seeking to carry them out she attempts at all costs to have relations with her confessor embraces him throws herself at his knees pursues him and so becomes a cause of scandal When brought to the asylum there is intense sexual excitement and she masturbates a dozen times a day even when talking to the doctor The sexual organs are normal the vulva moist and red the vagina is painful to touch the contact of the finger causes erectile turgescence She has had no rest she says since she has learned to love her Jesus He desires her to have sexual relations with someone and she cannot succeed all my soul s strength is arrested by this constant endeavor Her new surroundings modify her behavior and now it is the doctor whom she pursues with her obsessions I expected everything from the charity of the priests I have known I have not deserved what I wanted from them But is not a doctor free to do everything for the good of the patients intrusted to him by Providence Cannot a doctor thus devote himself Since I have tasted the tree of life I am tormented by the desire to share it with a loving friend Then she falls in love with an employee and makes the crudest advances to him believing that she is thus executing the will of Jesus Necessity makes laws she exclaims to him the moments are pressing I have been waiting too long She still speaks of her religious vocation which might be compromised by so long a delay I do not want to get married Gradually a transformation took place the love of God was effaced and earthly love became more intense than ever Quitting the heights in which I wished to soar I am coming so near to earth that I shall soon fix my desires there In a last letter Therese recognizes with terror the insanity to which the exaltation of her imagination had led her Now I only believe in God and in suffering I feel that it is necessary for me to get married Mariani four hundred two has very fully described a case of erotico religious insanity climacteric paranoia on an hysterical basis in a married woman of forty four During the early stages of her disorder she inflicted all sorts of penances upon herself fasting constant prayer drinking her own urine cleaning dirty plates with her tongue et cetera Finally she felt that by her penances she had obtained forgiveness of her sins and then began a stage of joy and satisfaction during which she believed that she had entered into a state of the most intimate personal relationship with Jesus She finally recovered Mariani shows how closely this history corresponds with the histories of the saints and that all the acts and emotions of this woman can be exactly paralleled in the lives of famous saints four hundred three The justice of these comparisons becomes manifest when we turn to the records that have been left by holy persons A most instructive record from this point of view is the autobiography of Soeur Jeanne des Anges superior of the Ursulines of Loudun in the seventeenth century four hundred four She was clever beautiful ambitious fond of pleasure still more of power With this as sometimes happens she was highly hysterical and in the early years of her religious life was possessed by various demons of unchastity and blasphemy with whom for many years she was in constant struggle She fell in love with a priest of Loudun Grandier a man whom she had never even seen only knowing of him as a powerful and fascinating personality at whose feet all women fell and she imagined that she and the other nuns of her convent were possessed through his influence She was thus the cause of the trial and execution of Grandier a famous case in the annals of witchcraft In her autobiography Soeur Jeanne describes in detail how the demons assailed her at night appearing in lascivious attitudes making indecent proposals raising the bed clothes touching all parts of her body imploring her to yield to them and she tells how strong her temptation was to yield On one night for instance she writes I seemed to feel someone s breath and I heard a voice saying The time for resistance has gone by you must no longer rebel by putting off your consent to what has been proposed you will be injured you cannot persist in this resistance God has subjected you to the demands of a nature which you must satisfy on occasions so urgent Then I felt impure impressions in my imagination and disordered movements in my body I persisted in saying at the bottom of my heart that I would do nothing I turned to God and asked Him for strength in this extraordinary struggle Then there was a loud noise in my room and I felt as if someone had approached me and put his hand into my bed and touched me and having perceived this I rose in a state of restlessness which lasted for a long time afterward Some days later at midnight I began to tremble all over my body as I lay in bed and to experience much mental anxiety without knowing the cause After this had lasted for some time I heard noises in various parts of my room the sheet was twice pulled without entirely uncovering me the oratory close to my bed was upset I heard a voice on the left side toward which I was lying I was asked if I had thought over the advantageous offer that had been made to me It was added I have come to know your reply I will keep my promise if you will give your consent if on the contrary you refuse you will be the most miserable girl in the world and all sorts of mischances will happen to you I replied If there were no God I would fear those threats I am consecrated to Him It was replied to me You will not get much help from God He will abandon you I replied God is my father He will take care of me I have resolved to be faithful to Him He said I will give you three days to think over it I rose and went to the Holy Sacrament with an anxious mind Having returned to my room and being seated on a chair it was drawn from under me so that I fell on the floor Then the same things happened again I heard a man s voice saying lascivious and pleasant things to seduce me he pressed me to give him room in my bed he tried to touch me in an indecent way I resisted and prevented him calling the nuns who were near my room the window had been open it was closed I felt strong movements of love for a certain person and improper desire for dishonorable things She writes again at a later period These impurities and the fire of concupiscence which the evil spirit caused me to feel beyond all that I can say forced me to throw myself on to braziers of hot coal where I would remain for half an hour at a time in order to extinguish that other fire so that half my body was quite burnt At other times in the depth of winter I have sometimes passed part of the night entirely naked in the snow or in tubs of icy water I have besides often gone among thorns so that I have been torn by them at other times I have rolled in nettles and I have passed whole nights defying my enemies to attack me and assuring them that I was resolved to defend myself with the grace of God With her confessor s permission she also had an iron girdle made with spikes and wore this day and night for nearly six months until the spikes so entered her flesh that the girdle could only be removed with difficulty By means of these austerities she succeeded in almost exorcising the demons of unchastity and a little later after a severe illness of which she believed that she was miraculously cured by saint Joseph she appeared before the world almost as a saint herself possessing a miraculous power of healing she traveled through France bringing healing wherever she went the king the queen and Cardinal Richelieu were at her feet and so great became the fame of her holiness that her tomb was a shrine for pilgrims for more than a century after her death It was not until late in life and after her autobiography terminates that sexual desire in Soeur Jeanne though its sting seems never to have quite disappeared became transformed into passionate love of Jesus and it is only in her later letters that we catch glimpses of the complete transmutation Thus in one of her later letters we read I cried with ardor Lord join me to Thyself transform Thyself into me It seemed to me that that lovable Spouse was reposing in my heart as on His throne What makes me almost swoon with love and admiration is a certain pleasure which it seems to me that He takes when all my being flows into His restoring to Him with respect and love all that He has given to me Sometimes I have permission to speak to our Lord with more familiarity calling Him my Love interesting Him in all that I ask of Him as well for myself as for others The lives of all the great saints and mystics bear witness to operations similar to those so vividly described by Soeur Jeanne des Anges though it is very rarely that any saint has so frankly presented the dynamic mechanism of the auto erotic process The indications they give us however are sufficiently clear It is enough to refer to the special affection which the mystics have ever borne toward the Song of Songs four hundred five and to note how the most earthly expressions of love in that poem enter as a perpetual refrain into their writings four hundred six The courage of the early Christian martyrs it is abundantly evident was in part supported by an exaltation which they frankly drew from the sexual impulse Felicula we are told in the acts of Achilles and Nereus four hundred seven preferred imprisonment torture and death to marriage or pagan sacrifices When on the rack she was bidden to deny Christianity she exclaimed Ego non nego amatorem meum I will not deny my lover who for my sake has eaten gall and drunk vinegar crowned with thorns and fastened to the cross Christian mysticism and its sexual coloring was absorbed by the Islamic world at a very early period and intensified In the thirteenth century it was reintroduced into Christendom in this intensified form by the genius of Raymond Lull who had himself been born on the confines of Islam and his Book of the Lover and the Friend is a typical manifestation of sexual mysticism which inspired the great Spanish school of mystics a few centuries later The delicious agony the sweet martyrdom the strongly combined pleasure and pain experienced by saint Theresa were certainly associated with physical sexual sensations four hundred eight The case of Marguerite Marie Alacoque is typical Jesus as her autobiography shows was always her lover her husband her dear master she is betrothed to Him He is the most passionate of lovers nothing can be sweeter than His caresses they are so excessive she is beside herself with the delight of them The central imagination of the mystic consists essentially as Ribot remarks in a love romance four hundred nine If we turn to the most popular devotional work that was ever written The Imitation of Christ we shall find that the love there expressed is precisely and exactly the love that finds its motive power in the emotions aroused by a person of the other sex A very intellectual woman once remarked to me that the book seemed to her a sort of religious aphrodisiac If we read for instance Book III Chapter V of this work De Mirabili affectu Divini amoris we shall find in the eloquence of this solitary monk in the Low Countries neither more nor less than the emotions of every human lover at their highest limit of exaltation Nothing is sweeter than love nothing stronger nothing higher nothing broader nothing pleasanter nothing fuller nor better in heaven or in earth He who loves flies runs and rejoices he is free and cannot be held He gives all in exchange for all and possesses all in all He looks not at gifts but turns to the giver above all good things Love knows no measure but is fervent beyond all measure Love feels no burden thinks nothing of labor strives beyond its force reckons not of impossibility for it judges that all things are possible Therefore it attempts all things and therefore it effects much when he who is not a lover fails and falls My Love thou all mine and I all thine There is a certain natural disinclination in many quarters to recognize any special connection between the sexual emotions and the religious emotions But this attitude is not reasonable A man who is swayed by religious emotions cannot be held responsible for the indirect emotional results of his condition he can be held responsible for their control Nothing is gained by refusing to face the possibility that such control may be necessary and much is lost There is certainly as I have tried to indicate good reason to think that the action and interaction between the spheres of sexual and religious emotion are very intimate The obscure promptings of the organism at puberty frequently assume on the psychic side a wholly religious character the activity of the religious emotions sometimes tends to pass over into the sexual region the suppression of the sexual emotions often furnishes a powerful reservoir of energy to the religious emotions occasionally the suppressed sexual emotions break through all obstacles FOOTNOTES three hundred eighty five Starbuck The Psychology of Religion eighteen ninety nine Also A H Daniels
