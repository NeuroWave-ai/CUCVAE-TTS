Twinkleheels tiny feet moved so fast that you could scarcely have told one from another Being a pony and only half as big as a horse he had to move his legs twice as quickly as a horse did in order to travel at a horse s speed Twinkleheels friends knew that he didn t care to be beaten by any horse no matter how long legged It s spirit not size that counts Farmer Green often remarked as he watched Twinkleheels tripping out of the yard sometimes with Johnnie on his back sometimes drawing Johnnie in a little red wheeled buggy Old dog Spot agreed with Farmer Green When Twinkleheels first came to live on the farm Spot had thought him something of a joke Huh This pony s nothing but a toy he had told the farmyard folk He s a child s plaything about as much use as the little wooly dog that lives down by the sawmill One trip to the village and back behind Johnnie Green s glistening new buggy was enough to change Spot s opinion of the newcomer Back from the village Twinkleheels came clipping up the road and swung through Farmer Green s front gate as fresh as a daisy And old Spot with his tongue lolling out and panting fast was glad to lie down on the woodshed step to rest My goodness said Spot to Miss Kitty Cat This Twinkleheels is the goingest animal I ever followed He doesn t seem to know the difference between uphill and down It s all the same to him I did think he d walk now and then or I d never have travelled to the village behind him He s not lazy like some people Miss Kitty Cat hissed and then crept into the farmhouse before Spot could chase her She had a poor opinion of old Spot And she never failed to let him know it It was true that Twinkleheels was not lazy And it was just as true that he liked to play When Johnnie Green turned him loose in the pasture he kicked and frisked about so gayly that Jimmy Rabbit and Billy Woodchuck and their friends had to step lively now and then to get out of his way They said they liked high spirits but that Twinkleheels was almost too playful When Twinkleheels took it into his head to do anything he did it without the slightest warning If he decided to shy at a bit of paper he was out of the road before Johnnie Green knew what had happened And if he wanted to take a wrong turn just for fun he darted off so fast that he usually had his way before Johnnie could shout Whoa Everybody said that he was as quick as Miss Kitty Cat And that was the same as saying that there wasn t anybody any quicker unless it was Grumpy Weasel himself But Twinkleheels and Miss Kitty were not alike in any other way for Twinkleheels was both merry and good natured He let Johnnie Green pick up his feet one at a time and clean them And the worst he ever did was to give Johnnie a playful nip just as Johnnie himself might have pinched the boy that sat in front of him at school Only of course Johnnie Green wouldn t have used his teeth to do that II FUN IN THE PASTURE The first time he tried to catch Twinkleheels in the pasture Johnnie Green found his new pet entirely too playful to suit him In response to Johnnie s whistling Twinkleheels came galloping towards the bars But when he caught sight of the halter that Johnnie held he stopped short And he snorted as if to say I don t believe I ll go with you I m having too much fun here Come on Johnnie called We re going to the village But that news didn t catch Twinkleheels When Johnnie Green began to walk towards him Twinkleheels waited until his young master reached out a hand to take hold of his mane Then Twinkleheels wheeled like a flash and tore off across the pasture leaving Johnnie to clutch the empty air Johnnie chased him crying Whoa Whoa It seemed that the faster he ran the faster Twinkleheels drew away from him So Johnnie soon fell into a walk At last Twinkleheels stopped and waited for him pricking up his ears at Johnnie s whistle Now however he wouldn t let Johnnie get within a dozen feet of him This is great sport Twinkleheels chuckled as he dashed away again Johnnie Green however did not enjoy the sport After following Twinkleheels all over the pasture he became tired and breathless Back toward the barn he turned at last As he climbed over the fence he looked at Twinkleheels who stood on a knoll and regarded him pleasantly I ll get you yet Johnnie called to him You needn t think you can beat me Twinkleheels dropped his head flung his hind feet into the air twice and galloped off He was sorry that Johnnie Green had stopped chasing him Johnnie found his father at work in the barn What shall I do Johnnie asked him I can t catch Twinkleheels I ve been trying for about an hour And he won t let me get near enough to him to grab him Farmer Green laughed He s a rascal he said You ll have to coax him with something to eat Put a few handfuls of oats in the four quart measure and hold it up so he can see it Shake it too so he can hear the oats swishing around in it You ll get him that way Johnnie Green hastened to carry out his father s plan And he was smiling as he stepped through the doorway holding the four quart measure and shaking it to hear the sound that the oats made inside it Then his father called to him You d better keep the halter behind you when you get to the pasture Farmer Green said If Twinkleheels saw it he might not come oats or no oats Johnnie Green chuckled III TRICKING TWINKLEHEELS Clutching in one hand the four quart measure with a taste of oats in it and holding the halter carefully behind his back Johnnie Green walked slowly towards Twinkleheels He called with short sharp whistles all on one note And Twinkleheels soon came cantering up from the other side of the brook where he had been feeding As he neared Johnnie Green he slowed down to a walk Johnnie stood still and shook the oats about inside the measure holding it up so that Twinkleheels could see it Twinkleheels whinnied He knew that sound He thought it one of the pleasantest on the farm He too stopped Then he moved forward a few steps stopped again sniffed and at last came straight up to Johnnie and thrust his nose into the grain measure While he was munching the oats Johnnie Green passed the end of the halter rope about his neck There Johnnie cried There young fellow Now I ve got you And you ll never lead me such a merry chase again Twinkleheels acted as mild as the Muley Cow He stood perfectly still while Johnnie slipped the halter on his head and buckled it Then he followed Johnnie to the pasture bars down the lane and into the barn I got him Johnnie called to his father I thought you would said Farmer Green That pony likes oats too well to resist a taste of them After that Johnnie had little trouble catching Twinkleheels in the pasture Somehow the sound of the shaking oats and the sight of the grain measure seemed to put all thought of the halter out of his head To be sure once Johnnie forgot what he was doing and hid the oats behind his back while he held the halter up in front of him and shook that at Twinkleheels And it was an hour that time before Twinkleheels would let Johnnie come near him But that was a mistake One day Johnnie Green was in a great hurry He was going to ride over the hill to play with some friends Running to the barn he caught up Twinkleheels halter and snatched the four quart measure off the top of a barrel I won t stop to take any oats to day Johnnie said to himself I ll fool Twinkleheels It will be a good joke on him when he puts his nose into the measure and finds it empty Johnnie Green hurried to the pasture At his first whistle Twinkleheels pricked up his ears He had come to think only of one thing when that whistle sounded in the pasture That one thing was oats And now Twinkleheels squealed and kicked and tore down the hillside to the bars where Johnnie Green stood and waved the grain measure in the air Twinkleheels had long since given up stopping to listen for the swish of the oats inside the measure He came trotting up to Johnnie and reached his head out for the treat that he had always found waiting for him He thrust his nose into the measure There was something wrong He blew into the measure Then he snorted and drew back And if Johnnie Green hadn t been spry Twinkleheels would have given him the slip But Johnnie grabbed him and had the halter on him in a twinkling I fooled you this time said Johnnie as he turned to let down the pasture bars Twinkleheels hung his head IV THE CHEATER CHEATED Johnnie Green thought he had done something quite clever He had coaxed Twinkleheels up to him in the pasture with an empty grain measure Twinkleheels however had his own ideas about the matter This boy he said to old dog Spot has cheated me Spot lay on the barn floor looking on while Johnnie Green harnessed Twinkleheels This boy Twinkleheels explained made me think he had some oats for me He caught me unfairly Old dog Spot grinned Can t you take a joke he asked This is no joke Twinkleheels grumbled Johnnie is going to drive me over the hill They re going to have a ball game over there And you know folks are always in a hurry when they re going to a ball game especially boys And they re in the most terrible hurry of all when somebody else has to get them there If Johnny Green had to walk maybe he d think there was time to stop and rest now and then Old Spot recalled the day when he followed Twinkleheels to the village and back I don t see what you re grumbling about he remarked I ve run behind your little buggy and you kept snapping the miles off as if it was the easiest thing you did You d grumble yourself if you were cheated of a taste of oats that you were expecting said Twinkleheels I never eat oats Spot retorted Then you don t know what s good Twinkleheels declared After getting your mouth all made up for oats it s pretty disappointing to chew on nothing more appetizing than an iron bit Old dog Spot snickered Twinkleheels stamped one of his tiny feet upon the barn floor It will never happen again he cried Old Spot gave him a sharp look I hope he said you don t intend to hurt Johnnie Green I hope you aren t planning to run away with him No Twinkleheels assured him I m too well trained to run away though I must say Johnnie Green deserves a spill But of course I wouldn t do such a thing as to tip the buggy over What I have in mind is something quite different It s harmless And that was all he would say He took Johnnie Green to the ball game And he brought him home again He was so well behaved that when Johnnie turned him into the pasture afterward Johnnie never dreamed that Twinkleheels could be planning any mischief The next morning Johnnie took Twinkleheels halter and the four quart measure with three big handfuls of oats in it Then he walked up the lane to the pasture leaned over the bars and whistled Though there was no pony in sight Twinkleheels soon came strolling out from behind a clump of bushes He took his own time in picking his way down the hillside as though he might be glad to keep Johnnie Green waiting Come on Come on Johnnie called Come and get your oats And he shook the measure before him To his great surprise Twinkleheels didn t come running up and reach out to get the oats Instead he stopped short with his feet planted squarely under him as if he didn t intend to budge Johnnie Green took one step towards him And then Twinkleheels whisked around and ran He shook his head and kicked up his heels And something very like a laugh came floating back to Johnnie Green s ears Johnnie followed him all over the pasture And when the dinner horn sounded at the farmhouse Johnnie had to go home without Twinkleheels The afternoon was half gone before Twinkleheels let his young master put the halter on him By that time Johnnie Green had learned something that he never forgot Never again did he cheat Twinkleheels with an empty measure He knew that Twinkleheels expected fair play just as much as the boys with whom Johnnie played ball over the hill V FLYING FEET When July brought hot dry weather and the grass became short in the pasture Johnnie Green no longer turned Twinkleheels out to graze He kept him in a stall in the barn and fed him oats and hay three times a day It was at that time that Johnnie Green made an interesting discovery A row of currant bushes grew behind the barn And one day when Johnnie stripped off a few stems of the red fruit and stood in the back door of the barn eating it he happened to snap a currant at Twinkleheels The result both pleased and surprised him When the currant struck Twinkleheels he laid back his ears dropped his head and let fly with both hind feet Johnnie Green promptly forgot that he had intended to eat those currants One by one he threw them at Twinkleheels It made no difference where they hit the pony Whenever he felt one he kicked Sometimes he kicked only the air sometimes his feet crashed against the side of his stall Throwing currants at Twinkleheels became one of Johnnie Green s favorite sports Whenever boys from neighboring farms came to play with him Johnnie was sure to entertain them by taking them out behind the barn to show them how high he could make Twinkleheels kick As a mark of special favor Johnnie would sometimes let his friends flick a few currants at his pet And sometimes they would even pelt the old horse Ebenezer who stood in the stall next to Twinkleheels There was little fun in that however Ebenezer refused to kick The first currant generally brought him out of a doze with a start But after that he wouldn t budge except perhaps to turn his head and look with a bored expression at the boys in the doorway Johnnie Green and his friends were not alone in enjoying this sport Old dog Spot joined them when he could Unfortunately when Twinkleheels kicked old Spot always wanted to bark And Johnnie didn t like noise at such times He and his friends were always amazingly quiet when they were engaged in currant throwing behind the barn And they were always peering about as if they didn t want to be caught there Run out to the barn and tell your father that dinner s almost ready missus Green said to Johnnie one day He s not in the barn Johnnie answered Are you sure missus Green asked I thought I heard him hammering out there a few minutes ago No Johnnie murmured Father s in the hayfield That s queer said his mother I was sure I heard hammering Well blow the horn then I don t want dinner to spoil So Johnnie Green blew several loud blasts on the horn And he was glad to do it for it gave him an excuse for having a red face He threw no more currants at Twinkleheels that day Somehow it didn t seem just the wisest thing to do But the next morning he made Twinkleheels kick a few times It s really good for him Johnnie tried to make himself believe He needs the exercise VI PICKING CURRANTS If there was one sort of work that Johnnie Green had always disliked more than another it was picking currants Of course he didn t object to strolling up to a currant bush and taking a few currants for his own use on the spot What he hated was having to fill pail after pail full of currants for his mother to make jelly and jam It was queer He certainly liked jelly And he liked jam But he had never found currant picking anything but dull He always groaned aloud when his mother told him that the currants were ripe enough to be picked And he always had a dozen reasons why he couldn t pick them just then Now however currant picking didn t seem such a bore to Johnnie When his mother announced at the supper table one evening that Johnnie would have to begin picking currants right after breakfast the next morning he didn t make a single objection And he had intended to go swimming the next day I think Johnnie remarked I think some of the boys would like to help After supper I ll ride Twinkleheels over the hill and ask the boys to pick currants with me in the morning Farmer Green and his wife listened to this speech with amazement I never heard of a boy that liked to pick currants said Johnnie s father Still you can try if you want to Come home before it gets dark said his mother Look out for that pony Farmer Green exclaimed I don t know what s come over him I stepped into his stall to day and he kicked at me I ve never known him to do that before Johnnie Green promised to be careful and to come home early Having important business on his hands he hurried away without a second piece of cake And that was a most unusual oversight on his part In the morning three boys appeared before Johnnie had finished his breakfast Though they had already eaten theirs they accepted missus Green s invitation to sit at the table and have some griddlecakes and maple syrup If you boys are going to pick currants you ll want a good big breakfast she told them There was no doubt that they agreed with her If they re as lively at picking as they are at eating you ll have all the currants in the kitchen by noon Farmer Green remarked to his wife with a laugh as the boys trooped off toward the barn with their tin pails A few minutes later a noise as of terrific pounding reached the ears of Farmer Green as he stood talking with his wife What s that he muttered It sounds as if the barn was falling down He ran out of doors The racket came from the barn There was no doubt of that And he could hear Spot barking Farmer Green hurried across the yard Somehow he guessed that Johnnie and his helpers had a hand in whatever was going on Farmer Green did not run toward the broad front door of the barn Instead he circled to the back of the barn and peeped around the corner What he saw caused him no great surprise VII CAUGHT There was a good deal of giggling and loud whispering at the back door of the barn It ceased instantly when Farmer Green cried Stop that in a loud voice Johnnie Green and his friends looked startled and sheepish too They had been throwing currants through the doorway to make Twinkleheels kick The boys fell back a few steps as Farmer Green joined them Was Twinkleheels doing all that kicking Farmer Green asked Johnnie It was so loud that I thought the barn would fall down any minute We threw a few currants at old Ebenezer Johnnie Green explained somewhat faintly His father gave him a sharp look Huh Farmer Green grunted He didn t kick did he N no N no sir Did you throw at the bays Johnnie s father demanded Only once or twice Johnnie confessed Once or twice is too much his father said sternly Don t meddle with the bays And don t tease the pony either You ve chosen the surest way to make a kicker of him How long Farmer Green demanded has this business been going on Only a short time Johnnie assured him I never threw any currants until they began to ripen Illustration Twinkleheels Tells Spot About Kicking Page thirty four I suppose said his father you never threw any until there were some to throw Johnnie Green appeared much more cheerful when he heard that remark of his father s Although Farmer Green s face wore a frown and his voice sounded most severe Johnnie could tell that he was laughing inside Come on Johnnie cried to his friends Let s get to work If we hustle we can get the currants all picked by noon So long as Farmer Green stood there they all picked as busily as squirrels But after he left them the boys found so much to talk about that they made little progress It was a temptation too to flick a currant into the face of another picker and see him jump Finally the neighbors boys announced that they were going swimming Come along over to the swimming hole they urged Johnnie You can finish picking these currants later But Johnnie Green said that he couldn t leave his work Though his helpers left him he stayed behind the barn and picked currants Somehow he felt that he ought to be on his best behavior at least for a day or two It was a pity that Johnnie Green s father caught him old dog Spot remarked to Twinkleheels after Farmer Green put an end to the boys fun I enjoyed the sport said Spot If you re so fond of kicking just step up behind me Twinkleheels urged him No thank you said Spot I don t want one of my ribs cracked Ho cried Twinkleheels Who said anything about one rib I ll crack all of them for you if you ll come where I can reach you Spot moved further away Do you mean that he asked in a somewhat frightened voice Certainly not said Twinkleheels You kicked at Farmer Green yesterday Spot reminded him Yes But I never touched him Twinkleheels answered I only wanted to see him jump VIII A GOOD SLEEPER Twinkleheels stall was an end one Next to him stood the old horse Ebenezer and beyond Ebenezer were the two bays Twinkleheels often wished that he might have someone for his nearest neighbor that was a bit livelier than Ebenezer When the old horse stayed in the barn he spent a great deal of his time with his eyes half shut dozing If Twinkleheels spoke to him Ebenezer seldom heard him the first time And often Ebenezer even fell asleep while Twinkleheels was talking to him Twinkleheels always moved smartly Ebenezer took his time about everything When anybody backed him between the thills of a wagon he was as slow as Timothy Turtle and no more graceful And while people harnessed him he usually sighed heavily now and then because he dreaded being hurried along the road Before Twinkleheels came to the farm to live Johnnie Green had thought it quite a lark to drive or ride Ebenezer Now however Johnnie paid little heed to the old horse And to tell the truth Ebenezer was content to be let alone This boy must have found it a bit poky riding you Twinkleheels remarked to Ebenezer one day when he noticed that the old horse was actually wide awake He found me safe Ebenezer replied That s why Farmer Green let Johnnie ride me It s a wonder you didn t fall asleep and tumble down and throw Johnnie Twinkleheels said I m very sure footed Ebenezer told him proudly Of course a person will step on a loose stone now and then But I ve never really stumbled in my whole life How old are you Twinkleheels inquired I m twenty Ebenezer told him And you ve never stumbled in all that time Twinkleheels cried How did you manage to stay on your feet like that By minding my business Ebenezer explained with a shrewd glance at his young companion The answer and the look were both lost on Twinkleheels I heard Farmer Green tell Johnnie to turn me and you into the pasture to morrow he told Ebenezer Don t you mean you and me Ebenezer suggested mildly Well it s the same thing isn t it Twinkleheels retorted There s a slight difference said Ebenezer I see there are some things you ve never been taught Colts were different when I was a yearling Twinkleheels looked almost angry I hope he snapped you don t take me for a yearling Just because I m a pony and small you needn t think I m an infant Why I m five years old Old Ebenezer yawned It seemed as if he was always sleepy You ve a good deal to learn he said When I was five I thought I knew everything I still find that I can learn something almost every day Twinkleheels sniffed I don t believe you ve picked up much that was new to day he said You ve been dozing every moment except when you ate your meals To his great disgust Ebenezer gave a sort of snort He no longer heard anything that his youthful neighbor said I ll see that he learns something in the pasture to morrow Twinkleheels promised himself I ll get him to race with me if he can stay awake long enough And I ll show him such a burst of speed as he s never seen in all his twenty years IX THE RACE When Johnnie Green turned Twinkleheels and the old horse Ebenezer into the pasture the first thing they did was to drop down on the grass and enjoy a good roll There was a vast difference in their actions Twinkleheels was as spry as a squirrel He rolled from one side to the other and back again jumped up and shook himself like old dog Spot almost before Ebenezer had picked out a nice smooth place to roll on Ebenezer bent his legs beneath him in a gingerly fashion and sank with something like a sigh upon the green grassy carpet It was only with a great effort that he managed at last to roll all the way over and then he couldn t roll back again Clumsily he flung his fore feet in front of himself and by a mighty heave pulled himself off the ground Slow isn t he Twinkleheels remarked to the Muley Cow who was chewing her cud and looking on He doesn t get up the right way said the Muley Cow When rising from the ground one should stand on his hind feet first I don t agree with you Twinkleheels told her Ebenezer uses the right method But he s terribly poky about it You can almost hear his joints creak The Muley Cow was somewhat offended I ve known Ebenezer a great many years she snapped I don t care to hear a young upstart a mere pony make fun of him Twinkleheels moved away He felt the least bit uncomfortable I don t like your young friend said the Muley Cow to the old horse Ebenezer He hasn t a proper respect for old people like you and me Oh he s not a bad sort Ebenezer replied He has a good many things to learn Perhaps he ll be wiser by night I shouldn t worry about him if I were you The Muley Cow told Ebenezer that he was entirely too good natured And they went their own ways grazing and rambling aimlessly about the pasture Now and then during the day they chanced to meet And always the Muley Cow asked Ebenezer if Twinkleheels had learned anything more Not yet Ebenezer said each time The day s not done till sunset Well late in the afternoon Johnnie Green came slowly up the lane and stood by the pasture bars and whistled Twinkleheels and Ebenezer happened to be together when they heard that cheerful chirp I ll race you to the bars Twinkleheels exclaimed Agreed cried Ebenezer The word was no sooner out of his mouth than he started with a rush He was three jumps ahead of Twinkleheels before that surprised pony began to run I ll soon catch the old horse Twinkleheels thought He can t last long I ll pass him before we reach the brook Before Twinkleheels came to the brook Ebenezer had crossed it in one mighty leap He was pounding along with a powerful stride over the firm turf of the pasture And behind him Twinkleheels pattering feet struggled to shorten the distance between them To Twinkleheels dismay he saw that Ebenezer was steadily drawing away from him Although Twinkleheels ran his fastest Ebenezer reached the bars six good lengths ahead of him X EBENEZER S RECORD The old horse Ebenezer had beaten Twinkleheels in the race to the bars While Johnnie Green slipped their halters on them and they munched the oats that he gave them neither of them spoke Johnnie mounted Ebenezer bareback and leading Twinkleheels he turned down the lane You re not as slow as I thought you were Twinkleheels said to Ebenezer as they drew near the barn And somehow I couldn t seem to get to running smoothly I d like to race you again I think I could beat you next time Perhaps you could said Ebenezer I don t often run nowadays But I did running enough when I was younger I used to race at the county fair every fall Did you ever win a race at the fair Twinkleheels inquired Yes Ebenezer answered Yes I can remember winning a race now and then He never lost a race in his whole life cried the Muley Cow who was walking just ahead of them Ebenezer used to be known as the fastest horse in these parts He had a record Twinkleheels gasped A record he exclaimed What s that I don t know exactly said the Muley Cow I never saw Ebenezer s But it must have been a fine one for Farmer Green was always talking about it A horse s record Ebenezer explained is the fastest time he ever makes in a race Then he added to Twinkleheels You and I will have another race the next time we re in the pasture together Twinkleheels gave him an odd look Somehow Ebenezer did not seem just a poky old farm horse as Twinkleheels had always regarded him For the first time Twinkleheels noticed that Ebenezer had many good points There wasn t a single bunch on his legs And his muscles showed plainly as they rippled on his lean frame beneath a coat that was both short and fine I don t believe I could beat you if we raced a hundred times Twinkleheels blurted Of course you couldn t the Muley Cow interrupted again Oh you might Ebenezer said There d be no harm in trying anyhow Racing with me would be good practice for you even if I did win If you re going to have a race don t look for an easy one Choose a hard one That s the kind that will make you do your best Twinkleheels thanked him It s very kind of Ebenezer to race with you the Muley Cow bellowed You ought to feel honored I do said Twinkleheels But please don t talk so loud I don t want everybody on the farm laughing at me because I lost a race The Muley Cow went into the barn grumbling That pony is a young upstart she muttered The idea of his telling me not to talk so loud Ebenezer is altogether too pleasant to him Old Ebenezer continued to be agreeable to Twinkleheels They often raced in the pasture later And though Twinkleheels never won once he enjoyed the sport And he never called Ebenezer poky again XI BRIGHT AND BROAD Farmer Green had a yoke of oxen called Bright and Broad They were huge slow moving fellows as different from Johnnie Green s pony Twinkleheels as any pair could be They never frisked about in the pasture They never ran nor jumped nor kicked They seldom even trotted And when they did move faster than a walk they lurched into a queer shambling swing The first time Twinkleheels saw them travelling at that gait he couldn t help giggling They look as if their legs were going to knock down all the fence posts on the farm he exclaimed Despite their clumsiness Bright and Broad did many a day s hard work in an honest fashion for Farmer Green Of course he never drove them to the village when he was in a hurry But whenever there was a heavy load to pull he depended on Bright and Broad to help him If the pair of bays couldn t haul a wagon out of a mud hole Farmer Green would call on Bright and Broad And when they lunged forward the wagon just had to move or something broke Though Twinkleheels admired their strength he didn t care much for Bright and Broad s company They were too sober to suit him They were more than likely to stand and chew their cuds and look out upon the world with vacant stares and say nothing I used to think Ebenezer was a slow old horse Twinkleheels remarked to the bays on a winter s day as they stood in the barn I thought I could beat him easily until he showed me that I was mistaken But I can certainly beat Bright and Broad They re the slowest pair I ever saw The bays glanced at each other You can t always tell by a person s looks what he can do one of them remarked Let Bright and Broad choose the race course and they d leave you behind Nonsense Twinkleheels cried They couldn t beat anybody unless it s Timothy Turtle who lives over in Black Creek The bays winked at each other over the low partition that separated their stalls Maybe you ll find out that you re wrong they told Twinkleheels Maybe you ll learn that Bright and Broad are faster than you think they are We ve known Farmer Green to take them and leave us here in the barn when he was in a hurry to go somewhere too Ha ha Twinkleheels laughed You re joking You re trying to fool me Oh no the bays cried Ask Bright and Broad themselves So Twinkleheels spoke to Bright and Broad the very next day when he met them in the barnyard While he told them what the bays had said to him they chewed their cuds and listened with a dreamy look in their great mild eyes Twinkleheels paused and waited for them to speak But they said nothing Their jaws moved steadily as they chewed but they said never a word Can t you answer when you re spoken to Twinkleheels cried at last Yes they said speaking as one for they always did everything together Yes But you haven t asked us a question Is this true what the bays told me about you he snapped We can t deny it they chanted Twinkleheels was never more surprised XII NO SCHOOL TO DAY And that night it snowed In the morning when Johnnie Green crawled from his bed and looked out of the window he could scarcely see the barn A driving white veil flickered across the farmyard The wind howled The blinds rattled Even the whole house shook now and then as a mighty blast rocked it It was just the sort of weather to suit Johnnie Green There won t be any school to day he cried And he hurried into his clothes much faster than he usually did Illustration Twinkleheels Talks to the Oxen Page sixty four Though Johnnie Green was eager to get out of doors most of those that lived in the barn were quite content to stay there during such a storm The old horse Ebenezer especially looked pleased This will be a fine day to doze he remarked to the pony Twinkleheels Farmer Green won t make me do any work in this weather The roads must be blocked with drifts already Twinkleheels moved restlessly in his stall I don t want to stand here with nothing to do he grumbled If I could sleep in the daytime as you do perhaps I wouldn t mind And if I were like the Muley Cow maybe I could pass the hours away by chewing a cud Bright and Broad can do that too said Twinkleheels Oh Farmer Green will have the oxen out as soon as the storm slackens old Ebenezer told him And no doubt you ll get outside as soon as they do for Johnnie Green will want you to play with him in the snow or I don t know anything about boys Good Twinkleheels exclaimed I hope he ll take me out It would be great fun to toss him into a snowdrift But I don t see what Farmer Green wants of Bright and Broad on a day like this They ll be slower than ever if the roads are choked with snow The old horse Ebenezer smiled to himself as he shut his eyes for another cat nap before breakfast He thought that Twinkleheels would learn a thing or two a little later Johnnie Green was the first one to plough his way out to the barn that morning He burst into the barn and stamped the snow off his feet And Twinkleheels stamped too because he wanted something to eat Johnnie fed Twinkleheels and Ebenezer and the bays He was shaking some hay in front of the Muley Cow who belonged to him when his father arrived The worst storm of the winter Farmer Green observed We ll have work enough after this breaking the roads out I ll help Johnnie said I ll take Twinkleheels and work hard I suppose said his father we ought to get the road to the schoolhouse cleared first Oh no cried Johnnie Let s leave that till the last If we left it for you and Twinkleheels to clear you wouldn t get back to school before spring Farmer Green declared Twinkleheels had been listening eagerly to all this Now I wonder what Farmer Green means by that he muttered I hope he doesn t think I can t get through the drifts as well as anybody I can certainly make my way through the snow better than those clumsy old oxen Bright and Broad XIII FUN AND GRUMBLES It stopped snowing at last and the weather turned clear and crisp The sun came out And so did Johnnie Green riding on Twinkleheels He did not get far from the barn however Where the snow wasn t piled in drifts high above Twinkleheels head it reached up on his fat sides He floundered about the farmyard for a time And falling once he dumped Johnnie Green neatly into a drift head first The spill didn t hurt Johnnie in the least But snow went up the inside of his sleeves and down his neck and into his eyes and ears and even his mouth He jumped up spluttering And Twinkleheels jumped at the same time He tried to run But he could make little headway in the snow and Johnnie caught his bridle rein and stopped him You d better put that pony back in the barn Farmer Green called from the woodshed door After I yoke up Bright and Broad and break out the drive to the road you can ride Twinkleheels again He might cut himself in this heavy going Twinkleheels sniffed as he heard what Farmer Green said This is all nonsense he grumbled to the old horse Ebenezer as Johnnie led him into his stall Farmer Green doesn t know what he s talking about I m a hundred times sprier than Bright And I m a hundred times sprier than Broad That makes me two hundred times sprier than both of them It s silly to put me in my stall and take them out They won t be able to move They ll get stuck fast in a drift and goodness knows how we ll ever haul them out I shouldn t worry about the oxen if I were you Ebenezer replied It seems to me Bright and Broad are old enough and big enough to look out for themselves That s just the trouble cried Twinkleheels They re too old and they re too big They re terribly heavy If they were stuck in a drift I don t believe you and the bays could pull them out not even if I helped you Ebenezer sighed deeply I m going to sleep now he told Twinkleheels Soon Twinkleheels could hear Farmer Green shouting Gee and Haw There Twinkleheels called to the two bays There s Farmer Green talking to Bright and Broad I hope they re not helpless already The bays snickered Don t laugh Twinkleheels begged them It s not funny It would be awful for them to spend the rest of the winter in a snow bank We weren t laughing at Bright and Broad the bays explained Twinkleheels tried to look at them but old Ebenezer s bony back was in the way I don t know what amuses you then he snapped Maybe you ll find out later the bays told him And he did When Johnnie Green next led him out of the barn Twinkleheels discovered that a broad path had been opened from the barn to the highway And a little distance up the road Farmer Green and Bright and Broad were battling with the drifts XIV STUCK IN A DRIFT Outside the barn in the snow covered farmyard Johnnie Green mounted Twinkleheels and rode him beyond the gate where he could watch the fun up the road Yoked to a sort of plough Bright and Broad the oxen tore through the piled up snow and threw it to either side in great ridges I m going ahead to the crossroads Johnnie Green told his father That plan pleased Twinkleheels Before Farmer Green could speak he plunged out of the broken road and wallowed in snow up to his neck He was going to show Bright and Broad that he could get to the crossroads before they did Don t do that Farmer Green shouted to Johnnie He was too late The words were scarcely out of his mouth before Twinkleheels was reaching desperately for a footing His toes found nothing firm beneath them nothing but yielding snow And his frantic struggles only made him sink the deeper Johnnie Green slid off Twinkleheels back and tried to help him He could do nothing And he turned a somewhat frightened face to his father We re stuck he faltered I can get out but Twinkleheels can t Do you suppose Bright and Broad could pull him out They could yank twenty of him back on the road Farmer Green declared But we don t need them I ll dig the pony out Seizing a shovel Johnnie s father slowly dug his way to Twinkleheels who had stopped struggling and was waiting glumly for help In a few minutes more he had scrambled out of the ditch and gained the road again through the path that Farmer Green made for him Now said Farmer Green don t leave the broken road This pony s too small to handle himself in these drifts I wouldn t try to put even a full sized horse through them It takes oxen in such going They re slow but they re strong and sure footed too And they can go where horses couldn t do anything but flounder and probably cut themselves with their own feet That s why we always use Bright and Broad to gather sap in the sugar bush I ll put Twinkleheels in the barn again said Johnnie Then I ll come back on foot and help you So he rode Twinkleheels back and hitched him in his stall once more Old Ebenezer woke up as Twinkleheels pattered over the barn floor What cried the old horse Back again so soon Did you race with Bright and Broad The snow s too deep for a good race Twinkleheels told him Bright and Broad don t mind the snow much do they Ebenezer asked Oh no Twinkleheels answered They re getting on slowly up the road They take their time of course Couldn t they beat you to the crossroads if you raced with them to day Well yes Twinkleheels admitted And he gave Ebenezer a sharp look Who s been talking with you he demanded Nobody said Ebenezer I ve been dozing here all the morning Not even a sparrow Twinkleheels asked No Nobody has said a word to me That s strange Twinkleheels mused I was almost sure a little bird had told you something XV STEPPING HIGH Twinkleheels was feeling quite important Something that Farmer Green had said to Johnnie in his hearing made him hold his head higher than he usually did and step higher too You seem very proud to day the old horse Ebenezer said to him When Johnnie Green led you back from the watering trough I noticed that you were strutting in quite a lordly fashion You made me think of Turkey Proudfoot Ah Twinkleheels exclaimed I ve just heard some news I m going to the blacksmith s to day to be shod You know I ve never worn any shoes And I ve always wanted some Old Ebenezer smiled down at Twinkleheels Well well he said I don t blame you for feeling a bit proud I remember the day I got my first set of shoes You see I was young once myself The old horse seemed to feel like talking Twinkleheels was glad of that for he felt that he must chatter about the new shoes he was going to have or burst Of course said Twinkleheels most folks are shod before they re as old as I am But I ve spent a good deal of my time in the pasture and I don t often travel over hard roads How old were you when you first visited the blacksmith s shop Ebenezer shut his eyes for a moment or two And Twinkleheels feared he was going to sleep But he was only thinking hard I must have been about two months old Ebenezer declared Goodness cried Twinkleheels I didn t suppose colts of that age ever wore shoes They don t Ebenezer replied You didn t ask me when I had my first shoes You asked me when I first visited a smithy At the age of two months I jogged alongside my mother when she went to be shod I must have been about three years old when the blacksmith nailed my first shoes to my feet Twinkleheels gave Ebenezer an uneasy glance Does it hurt he asked when they drive the nails into your hoofs Oh no Ebenezer assured him To be sure a careless blacksmith could prick you But Farmer Green always takes us to the best one he can find To tell the truth Twinkleheels confessed I m a bit timid about going to the smithy I don t know what to do when I get there I don t know which foot to hold up first Don t worry about that said old Ebenezer They ll tell you everything Just pay attention and obey orders and you won t have any trouble Twinkleheels thanked Ebenezer It s pleasant he said to have a kind wise horse like you in the next stall There are some matters that I shouldn t care to mention to the bays They re almost sure to laugh at me if I ask them a question The old horse Ebenezer nodded his head They re young and somewhat flighty he admitted You know they even ran away last summer You ll be better off if you don t seek their advice about things I wish you were going to the blacksmith s shop with me Twinkleheels told Ebenezer wistfully Somehow I d feel better about being shod if you were there I shouldn t be surprised if I went along with you Ebenezer told him I cast a shoe yesterday And the three that I have left are well worn And sure enough Inside a half hour Farmer Green harnessed Ebenezer to an open buggy Johnnie Green brought Twinkleheels out of the barn by his halter led him up behind the buggy and jumped in and sat beside his father Then they started off We re going to the village to get some new shoes Twinkleheels called to old dog Spot Why don t you come too I would Spot barked but I always follow right behind the buggy and you ve gone and taken my place XVI THE BLACKSMITH S SHOP Twinkleheels trotted proudly behind the buggy in which the old horse Ebenezer was pulling Johnnie Green and his father towards the village Once Twinkleheels would have chafed at having to suit his pace to Ebenezer s He would have thought Ebenezer s gait too slow But ever since Ebenezer won a race with him in the pasture Twinkleheels had thought more highly of his elderly friend He knew that if Ebenezer chose to take his time it wasn t because he couldn t have hurried had he cared to They reached the blacksmith shop at last where Ebenezer and Twinkleheels were to get new shoes Having been there many a time before Ebenezer was quite calm Twinkleheels however was somewhat uneasy He had never visited a smithy And he looked with wide staring eyes at the low dingy building On the threshold he drew back as he sniffed odors that were strange to him Johnnie Green spoke to him and urged him forward I ll wait for Ebenezer Twinkleheels decided And he wouldn t budge until Farmer Green led the old horse into the smithy Then Twinkleheels followed Goodness he cried to Ebenezer a moment later This place is afire Let s get outside at once He had caught sight of a sort of flaming table against one of the walls Don t be alarmed Ebenezer said That s only the forge That s where the blacksmith heats the shoes red hot so he can pound them into the proper shape to fit the feet Twinkleheels had trembled with fear And now he had scarcely recovered from his fright when a terrible clanging clatter startled him He snorted and pulled back He would have run out of the smithy had not Johnnie Green tied his halter rope to a ring in the wall Don t do that the old horse Ebenezer called to him There s no danger That noise is nothing to be afraid of It s only the smith pounding a horseshoe on his anvil Twinkleheels looked relieved and just a bit sheepish I m glad you came with me he said I d have been frightened if you A queer hiss made Twinkleheels forget what he was saying What s that he cried Is there a goose hidden somewhere in the smithy No The smith put the hot shoe into a tub of water to cool Ebenezer explained He couldn t help smiling a bit A scrubby looking white mare who was being shod turned her head and stared at Ebenezer and his small companion It s easy to see she exclaimed that that colt has never been in a smithy before In my opinion he ought to be at home with his mother This is no place for children Before Ebenezer could answer her Twinkleheels himself spoke up sharply I don t know who you are madam he snapped But I d like you to understand that I m no colt I m a pony And I must say that I think you owe me an apology XVII A WHITE VIXEN The white mare that the blacksmith was shoeing looked much surprised when Twinkleheels told her he was not a colt Well well she cried A pony eh Who d have thought it Anyhow you ve never been shod in your life I can tell that by the way you act And she cackled in a most unpleasant fashion What shall I say to her Twinkleheels asked Ebenezer She hasn t apologized to me Pay no attention to her the old horse advised him in an undertone She s a low bred person I ve often met her on the road and she always wants to stop and talk But I hurry past her What are you saying the white mare asked in a sour tone Are you gossiping about me She laid her ears back and showed her yellow teeth You see why I don t care to have anything to do with her Ebenezer muttered to Twinkleheels I d kick you if I could reach you and that pony too the white mare squealed I m a lady I am And you d better be careful what you say about me Because she was angry and couldn t kick either Twinkleheels or Ebenezer she felt that she must kick somebody So she let fly at the blacksmith who had just stepped up beside her Strangely enough instead of jumping away from her the blacksmith crowded as close to her as he could get He knew what he was about He hadn t shod horses for twenty years without learning something about them He stood so near the white mare that her kick hadn t room to get going well And the blacksmith wasn t hurt He was merely disgusted I declare he said to Farmer Green this mare is the meanest critter that comes into my shop She doesn t know anything except how to kick and bite That old horse of yours is worth a dozen like her I d give more for his tail than I would for her Ebenezer tried to look unconcerned The blacksmith had a hearty voice Nobody in the shop could help hearing what he said And Twinkleheels made up his mind that the blacksmith shouldn t have any reason to speak of him as he had of the silly white mare Twinkleheels watched sharply as the blacksmith captured a hind foot of the white mare s and held it between his knees Then he began to nail on the shoe One thing puzzled Twinkleheels Every time the blacksmith struck a blow with his hammer he gave a funny grunt Twinkleheels nudged Ebenezer with his nose Do you hear that he asked Is he related to Grunty Pig a sort of cousin perhaps The old horse Ebenezer gasped Bless you no he exclaimed Then why does he grunt Oh that s just a way he has said Ebenezer Some blacksmiths think it s stylish to grunt like that By this time the white mare seemed to be in a pleasanter frame of mind At least she let the blacksmith nail a shoe on each of her feet without making any objection except to switch her tail now and then And just as the blacksmith finished with her a man came and led her away Now said the blacksmith I m ready to shoe the pony And if he s as clever as he looks I shan t have a bit of trouble with him When he heard that Twinkleheels made up his mind that he would behave his best no matter what happened XVIII NEW SHOES The blacksmith patted Twinkleheels and picked up one of his forefeet Then the blacksmith took a chisel and began to pare away at the horny hoof Twinkleheels looked over the blacksmith s shoulder And what he saw gave him a start Great green grass he cried to Ebenezer Is he going to cut my foot off No indeed Ebenezer answered The blacksmith always pares my feet a bit when he fits new shoes He may have to trim yours a good deal because you ve never worn shoes and your feet have never been pared In spite of his resolve to be on his best behavior Twinkleheels had been tempted to pull his foot from between the blacksmith s knees And if Ebenezer hadn t explained that he was in no danger of losing a foot there s no knowing what might have happened Twinkleheels breathed a sigh of relief and he made not the slightest trouble for the blacksmith but waited patiently while his little shoes were being hammered into shape When the blacksmith took the first one that he made and held it by a pair of pincers against Twinkleheels hoof there was a quick sizzling And a horrid smoke arose Twinkleheels snorted with fear Easy Easy boy the blacksmith said to him And old Ebenezer made haste to explain that there was no danger Won t my foot be burned Twinkleheels faltered Not enough to do any harm said Ebenezer You don t feel any pain do you No The shoe s not very hot and the blacksmith wouldn t hold it against your hoof long enough to harm you Ebenezer assured him Twinkleheels wriggled his nose I must say I don t care for this smoke he remarked It s no pleasanter for the blacksmith than for you Ebenezer reminded him If I were you I shouldn t complain Just see what pretty shoes the blacksmith has made for you Illustration Spot Tells Twinkleheels He is Slow Page ninety They re the nicest I ve ever seen Twinkleheels said After I wear them a while and they get shiny on the bottoms how they will twinkle in the sunlight when I m trotting along the road In a few minutes more the blacksmith had nailed all of Twinkleheels four shoes to his feet It seemed to Twinkleheels that he could never wait until Ebenezer was shod He was in a great hurry to get out on the street and show his new shoes to the people in the village At last Ebenezer too was fitted out with new shoes As Farmer Green led him out of the shop and Johnnie Green led Twinkleheels a queer look came over Twinkleheels face My goodness he cried My feet feel very strange What s the matter Ebenezer asked him Surely your new shoes don t hurt you No They don t hurt exactly Twinkleheels replied But my feet feel terribly heavy These iron shoes aren t as comfortable to wear as I had expected You ll soon get used to them said Ebenezer In a short time you won t know you re wearing shoes unless you happen to lose one Twinkleheels had supposed that when they reached Farmer Green s place everybody that he met would speak about his new shoes But nobody paid any attention to them Everybody seemed to stare at Johnnie Green as soon as he jumped out of the buggy Why are folks looking at Johnnie Twinkleheels asked old dog Spot who had come running up to meet him Haven t you noticed Spot cried Didn t you hear anything when Johnnie began to walk on the barn floor No Well you re slow to day said Spot Johnnie Green s wearing some new shoes that his father bought for him in the village It s queer that you didn t notice them Aren t they nice and squeaky XIX THRASHING TIME The pair of bays were feeling grumpy Thrashing time had come And they knew that they would have to spend long hours in the tread mill out in the field where the oats were stacked They grumbled a good deal as they stood in their stalls I don t see why you object to turning the tread mill for Farmer Green Twinkleheels said to them I d like to try my hand at it or my feet I should say I should think it would be great fun Yesterday I saw Johnnie Green and some other boys walking on the tread mill and making it go They seemed to find it a lark Huh said one of the bays They d hate it if they had to walk up hill hour after hour and never get anywhere The noise of the tread mill and the thrashing machine is most unpleasant It wouldn t be so bad said his mate if Farmer Green would let us eat all we wanted of the oats that we help thrash But he doesn t give us even an extra measure We d run away remarked the bay that had spoken first except that running away wouldn t do us any good All our running would only make the mill turn faster We can t even stand still if we want to his mate muttered There s a bar that crosses the top of the tread mill right in front of us Farmer Green ties us to it There we are When he unlocks the tread mill we have to start walking or we d slide down backwards and unless our halters broke our necks would get a terrible stretching The old horse Ebenezer who stood between Twinkleheels and the bays and couldn t miss hearing what was said looked scornfully at the two grumblers Think of the oats Farmer Green gives you every day he exclaimed I should suppose you d be glad to earn some of them The trouble is said the bay nearest him the trouble is we have to earn not only the oats that we eat but those that Farmer Green feeds to you and that pony I ve helped thrash many a time Ebenezer declared Well I dare say you have the bay admitted But what about that pony I never saw him do any work I venture to say that he s never done a day s work in his life Twinkleheels couldn t help feeling uncomfortable I d be glad to help with the thrashing he said But what can I do if Farmer Green won t let me The bays talked to each other in an undertone Then one of them said You might refuse to eat any more oats Somehow Twinkleheels did not care for that suggestion and he said as much What s the matter with hay the other bay asked him If you have plenty of hay you ought to be satisfied No Twinkleheels told him I can t get along on hay alone Johnnie Green expects me to be spry and playful And you know very well that a horse or a pony can t be spirited without plenty of oats Once more the bays muttered to each other in a low tone And at last they told Twinkleheels that he was greedy You don t need any oats they said You have more to eat than we do all the time Twinkleheels was astonished I don t know what you mean he cried Johnnie Green feeds me only oats and hay and that s no more than you have We don t agree with you the bays retorted You have meal And you must eat a lot of it too Never Twinkleheels declared Why do you say that You have a mealy nose they explained It always looks as if you d just eaten out of the meal bin XX A MEALY NOSE It was true as the bays had said that Twinkleheels had a mealy nose So perhaps it was only natural that they should think he had meal to eat when they didn t And he hastened to explain matters to them My mealy nose he said doesn t mean that I ve been eating meal My nose happens to be the color of meal All the brushing in the world wouldn t change it The bay pair snorted It was plain that they didn t believe what Twinkleheels told them You can ask Ebenezer Twinkleheels advised them He ll tell you that what I say is true We don t want to ask him said the bays Ask him yourself Don t be rude to this pony the old horse Ebenezer chided them If you had spent more of your time off the farm and seen more horses you d know that mealy noses like his are not uncommon In my younger days when I went to the county fair every fall I used to meet a great many horses And I learned then that mealy noses are by no means rare The bays stamped impatiently We don t care to argue about this pony s nose said the one whose stall was next to Ebenezer s His nose is a small matter We do insist however that he help with the thrashing Maybe you ve done your share of the thrashing in times past But this pony s a loafer We want to see him work Poor Twinkleheels felt most unhappy Haven t I said I d like to walk on the tread mill Twinkleheels cried But Farmer Green would never allow me to We don t care to argue with you said the bay who stood beside Ebenezer You are altogether too small for us to bother with any longer If I m so small then I shouldn t think what few oats I eat would annoy you said Twinkleheels Oh your appetite s big enough cried the other bay You re always eating something Yesterday we saw Johnnie Green ride you up to the kitchen window where missus Green was peeling potatoes And she gave you a potato And you ate it People are always feeding you echoed the bay s bay mate How can I help that Twinkleheels asked them You could decline with thanks they explained Twinkleheels shook his head It wouldn t be polite he said Besides I like potatoes and apples and carrots even more than oats and hay Just then Farmer Green came into the barn and backed the bays out of their stalls They both sighed We re in for it now they told Ebenezer He s going to take us out and make us walk on the tread mill A little later Johnnie Green saddled Twinkleheels and followed his father and the bays to the field where the thrashing machine stood beside several stacks of oats Before Johnnie and Twinkleheels arrived on the scene a great clatter warned them that thrashing had already begun Hurrying up they found the bays toiling up the endless path that slid always downward beneath them The bays were a glum appearing pair Twinkleheels tried to speak to them but the thrashing machine made such a racket that they couldn t hear him whinny and he couldn t catch their eyes They wouldn t look at him A stream of oats was pouring out of the grain spout Johnnie Green dismounted Picking up a handful of the newly thrashed oats he fed Twinkleheels The bays looked at Twinkleheels then They looked at him with envy That pony has begun to eat up the new oats already said one of the bays to his mate I hoped he d have the decency to decline them when Johnnie Green offered him a taste Not he groaned his mate That pony even hinted to Johnnie Green that he d like some oats I saw him hint out of the corner of my eye Ah cried the other bay Twinkleheels not only has a mealy nose He s mealy mouthed as well XXI JUMPING MUD PUDDLES Johnnie Green had often ridden bareback Lacking a pony before Twinkleheels came to the farm to live he had ridden the old horse Ebenezer back and forth between the barn and the pasture guiding him by his halter rope Ebenezer was a steady old fellow He never jumped nor shied He preferred walking to any other gait Without a whip Johnnie Green had hard work to make him trot It took a great deal of drumming against his ribs by Johnnie Green s heels to induce him to hurry his steps Twinkleheels was different from Ebenezer He was frisky Yet Johnnie sometimes put a bridle on him and rode him without a saddle Especially after the circus men came along and pasted posters on the barn Johnnie Green liked to ride bareback He had a notion that some day he would learn to ride standing on Twinkleheels back Farmer Green however did not approve of that plan When Johnnie mentioned it to him he said No in a most decided fashion That pony would be sure to throw you he told Johnnie I could try standing on Ebenezer first Johnnie suggested His back is broader And he certainly wouldn t object Somehow his father didn t care for that scheme either We don t want any broken legs around here he declared nor necks either Broken necks are very slow to mend So Johnnie Green had to give up his plan for the time being He made up his mind however that when he was grown up he would learn to ride standing up and turn somersaults in the air off a horse s back But now he knew that he must content himself with less risky sports Something happened one day that caused Johnnie to admit to himself the wisdom of his father s advice He was riding Twinkleheels along the road bareback after a heavy rain And the first thing that Johnnie knew he was sitting almost on Twinkleheels tail Instead of splashing through a big mud puddle Twinkleheels had taken it into his head to jump it His leap took his rider unawares Johnnie had slipped to the rear as if Twinkleheels back had been greased And if he hadn t clutched the bridle reins he would have dropped off into the very middle of the puddle After that Johnnie kept a sharp eye out for mud puddles When he knew that Twinkleheels was going to jump one he had no trouble in sticking to his seat Soon Johnnie decided once more that it would be easy to learn to be a circus rider Certainly it was no trick at all to sit on Twinkleheels bare back so long as he knew what the pony was going to do It was as easy as walking a tight rope And that was a feat that Johnnie Green had already mastered He only broke a collar bone learning that XXII THE CIRCUS RIDER The next afternoon when Johnnie went to the pasture with old dog Spot to drive the cows home he climbed a tree not that climbing a tree helped in any way to get the cows into the lane Just for the moment Johnnie was a sailor in his mind s eye He went up aloft to watch for a desert island where pirate gold was hidden And circus riding would never have entered his head had not Twinkleheels who had been grazing in the pasture come and stood under the tree into which his young master had climbed When Johnnie came down out of the rigging of his ship or when he slipped down through the branches of the tree Twinkleheels stood just beneath the lowest limb Johnnie Green swung off it hung by his arms for a moment and then dropped astride of Twinkleheels back It may have been because old dog Spot let out a delighted yelp at that instant It may have been that Twinkleheels hadn t expected Johnnie to mount him in that unusual fashion Anyhow he gave one jump and then stood up on his hind legs Johnnie Green didn t even have time to grab at Twinkleheels mane He slid off Twinkleheels back and struck the ground with a dull thud For a few moments he lay there unable to breathe Then he struggled to his feet and ran round and round in a circle doubled up and groaning There was a strange strange feeling in the pit of his stomach He feared he would never be able to get his breath again Twinkleheels paid no heed to him but nibbled at choice clumps of grass and clover quite as if nothing had happened Old dog Spot however seemed to think that Johnnie Green was having a good time and enjoying himself thoroughly Spot capered about him barking furiously Don t Johnnie managed to gasp Don t laugh Spot I m terribly hurt I don t believe I ll ever get well again But in a few moments he succeeded in drawing a long deep breath He lay down upon the ground then and drew another and another and another Already he began to feel better And soon he stood up gingerly and felt of himself all over To his great surprise nothing seemed to be broken except his suspenders Old Spot came up and put his paws against Johnnie and barked Let s have a good romp he begged Or at least that was what Johnnie understood him to say No Spot Johnnie answered Not now I don t feel like running You wouldn t either if you had just had the breath knocked out of you Then Johnnie went soberly about the business of driving the cows home At last he got them all started down the lane put up the bars and followed them As he reached the barn Johnnie looked up curiously at the pictures of circus riders in pink tights gayly disporting themselves on the backs of dappled gray horses Humph he muttered I don t believe that s half the fun I always thought it was XXIII GOING FISHING Twinkleheels never had any great liking for whips Johnnie Green kept a long one in the socket beside the dashboard of his little red wheeled buggy And he had a shorter one that he carried in his hand when he rode on Twinkleheels back Whenever Twinkleheels drew the buggy he seemed always to keep at least one eye on the snapper of the whip for Twinkleheels could see behind him easily He rarely needed urging On the contrary Johnnie Green often had to pull quite hard upon the reins to keep him from going too fast And when a lazy mood came over Twinkleheels the merest shake of the whip in its socket was enough to send him forward with a jump When Johnnie rode him he never had to give Twinkleheels a cut with his riding whip Just a touch of it was all that was needed if Twinkleheels happened to be a bit headstrong and didn t quite agree with Johnnie as to where they should go Well on a certain summer s day after school was out Johnnie Green decided to go fishing in Black Creek His mother made him a luncheon to take with him he dug some angleworms in the garden for bait and the hired man consented to let him take a long pole that he used himself when he fished in the river Then Johnnie backed Twinkleheels out of his stall and threw the saddle on him Farmer Green chanced to be in the barn at the time You don t intend to ride the pony and carry all those things do you he asked Johnnie It seems to me that a basket a tin can a fish pole and a boy would ride much better in the buggy than horseback Now Johnnie Green did not always agree with his father He expected to meet some other boys at the creek They were going on horseback And Johnnie wanted to do likewise Besides there might be a horseback race And he didn t want to miss that I don t want to bother with the buggy he told his father This way s easier I shan t have any trouble carrying these things Suit yourself then said Farmer Green I think my way s better But if you want to try yours go ahead You won t be half as comfortable though as you would be if you went in the buggy And you know you may have some fish to carry too when you come home Yes said Johnnie But I won t have any lunch Being determined to ride on Twinkleheels back he buckled the saddle girth and slipped on the pony s bridle Then he led him out of the barn clutched the basket the tin pail and the reins as well in one hand mounted and then reached out his other hand for the pole which he had leaned against the side of the barn I ll show Father that he s mistaken he said to himself XXIV BOYS WILL BE BOYS Up to the moment that Johnnie Green reached out a hand for the long fish pole Twinkleheels had behaved like a little gentleman 
7925-116154-0000	train-other-500	He saw that something unusual was afoot And feeling quite sure that it was some kind of fun he was glad that he was going to have a part in it I hope Johnnie has some oats for me in that basket he thought
7925-116154-0001	train-other-500	Just then Johnnie caught up the pole Oats and corn Twinkleheels exclaimed What s he going to do with that enormous whip He was so startled that he jumped sideways
7925-116154-0002	train-other-500	and Johnnie Green all but lost his seat on Twinkleheels back
none	none	 As he lurched in the saddle he brought the fish pole smartly 
7925-116154-0003	train-other-500	against Twinkleheels head I won t stand this Twinkleheels decided I don t see what Johnnie is thinking of to beat me over the head I ve certainly done nothing to deserve such treatment
none	none	 Thereupon he dashed madly across the farmyard 
7925-116154-0004	train-other-500	and made for the orchard Whoa cried Johnnie Green Whoa cried his father Stop him Hang to him Don t let him run
none	none	 He ll have to drop that great whip 
7925-116154-0005	train-other-500	if he expects me to mind Twinkleheels said with a snort
none	none	 Johnnie s hands were so full of a number of things that he could do little more than stick to the saddle 
7925-116154-0006	train-other-500	Drop that junk that you re carrying Farmer Green shouted Why doesn t he tell Johnnie to drop that long whip Twinkleheels muttered to himself What Farmer Green said

7925-116154-0008	train-other-500	The tin pail containing Johnnie s bait slipped from his grasp and clattered upon the ground causing Twinkleheels to run all the faster The fish pole struck the tree trunks right and left
