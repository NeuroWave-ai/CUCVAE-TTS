GREAT FORTRESS This etext was produced by Gardner Buchanan CHRONICLES OF CANADA Edited by George M Wrong and H H Langton In thirty two volumes Volume eight THE GREAT FORTRESS A Chronicle of Louisbourg seventeen twenty seventeen sixty By WILLIAM WOOD TORONTO nineteen fifteen PREFACE Louisbourg was no mere isolated stronghold which could be lost or won without affecting the wider issues of oversea dominion On the contrary it was a necessary link in the chain of waterside posts which connected France with America by way of the Atlantic the saint Lawrence the Great Lakes and the Mississippi But since the chain itself and all its other links and even the peculiar relation of Louisbourg to the Acadians and the Conquest have been fully described elsewhere in the Chronicles of Canada the present volume only tries to tell the purely individual tale Strange to say this tale seems never to have been told before at least not as one continuous whole Of course each siege has been described over and over again in many special monographs as well as in countless books about Canadian history But nobody seems to have written any separate work on Louisbourg showing causes crises and results all together in the light of the complete naval and military proof So perhaps the following short account may really be the first attempt to tell the tale of Louisbourg from the foundation to the fall W W fifty nine GRANDE ALLEE QUEBEC second January nineteen fifteen CHAPTER I THE LAST SEA LINK WITH FRANCE seventeen twenty seventeen forty four The fortress of Louisbourg arose not from victory but from defeat not from military strength but from naval weakness not from a new adventurous spirit of attack but from a half despairing hope of keeping one last foothold by the sea It was not begun till after the fortunes of Louis XIV had reached their lowest ebb at the Treaty of Utrecht in seventeen thirteen It lived a precarious life of only forty years from seventeen twenty to seventeen sixty And nothing but bare ruins were left to mark its grave when it finally passed unheeded and unnamed into the vast dominions of the conquering British at the Peace of Paris in seventeen sixty three The Treaty of Utrecht narrowed the whole French sea coast of America down to the single island of Cape Breton Here after seven years of official hesitation and maritime exhaustion Louisbourg was founded to guard the only harbour the French thought they had a chance of holding A medal was struck to celebrate this last attempt to keep the one remaining seaway open between Old France and New Its legend ran thus Ludovicoburgum Fundatum et Munitum M DCC XX Louisbourg Founded and Fortified seventeen twenty Its obverse bore the profile of the young Louis XV whose statesmen hoped they had now established a French Gibraltar in America where French fleets and forts would command the straits leading into the saint Lawrence and threaten the coast of New England in much the same way as British fleets and forts commanded the entrance to the Mediterranean and threatened the coasts of France and Spain This hope seemed flattering enough in time of peace but it vanished at each recurrent shock of war because the Atlantic then became a hostile desert for the French while it still remained a friendly highway for the British The first French settlers in Louisbourg came over from Newfoundland which had been given up to the British by the treaty The fishermen of various nations had frequented different ports all round these shores for centuries and by the irony of fate the new French capital of Cape Breton was founded at the entrance to the bay which had long been known as English Harbour Everything that rechristening could do however was done to make Cape Breton French Not only was English Harbour now called Louisbourg but saint Peter s became Port Toulouse saint Anne s became Port Dauphin and the whole island itself was solemnly christened Ile Royale The shores of the saint Lawrence up to Quebec and Montreal were as entirely French as the islands in the Gulf But Acadia which used to form the connection by land between Cape Breton and Canada had now become a British possession inhabited by the so called neutral French These Acadians few in numbers and quite unorganized were drawn in opposite directions on the one hand by their French proclivities on the other by their rooted affection for their own farms Unlike the French Newfoundlanders who came in a body from Plaisance now Placentia the Acadians preferred to stay at home In seventeen seventeen an effort was made to bring some of them into Louisbourg But it only succeeded in attracting the merest handful On the whole the French authorities preferred leaving the Acadians as they were in case a change in the fortunes of war might bring them once more under the fleurs de lis when the connection by land between Quebec and the sea would again be complete A plan for promoting the immigration of the Irish Roman Catholics living near Cape Breton never got beyond the stage of official memoranda Thus the population of the new capital consisted only of government employees French fishermen from Newfoundland and other neighbouring places waifs and strays from points farther off bounty fed engages from France and a swarm of camp following traders The regular garrison was always somewhat of a class apart The French in Cape Breton needed all the artificial aid they could get from guns and forts Even in Canada there was only a handful of French all told at the time of the Treaty of Utrecht twenty five thousand while the British colonists in North America numbered fifteen times as many The respective populations had trebled by the time of the Cession of Canada to the British fifty years later but with a tendency for the vast British preponderance to increase still more Canada naturally had neither men nor money to spare for Louisbourg so the whole cost of building the fortress thirty million livres came direct from France This sum was then the equivalent in purchasing power of at least as many dollars now though the old French livre was only rated at the contemporary value of twenty cents But the original plans were never carried out moreover not half the money that actually was spent ever reached the military chest at all There were too many thievish fingers by the way The French were not a colonizing people their governing officials hated a tour of duty oversea and Louisbourg was the most unpopular of all the stations in the service Those Frenchmen who did care for outlandish places went east to India or west to Canada Nobody wanted to go to a small dull out of the way garrison town like Louisbourg where there was no social life whatever nothing but fishermen smugglers petty traders a discontented garrison generally half composed of foreigners and a band of dishonest second rate officials whose one idea was how to get rich and get home The inspectors who were sent out either failed in their duty and joined the official gang of thieves or else resigned in disgust Worse still because this taint was at the very source the royal government in France was already beset with that entanglement of weakness and corruption which lasted throughout the whole century between the decline of Louis XIV and the meteoric rise of Napoleon The founders of Louisbourg took their time to build it It was so very profitable to spin the work out as long as possible The plan of the fortress was good It was modelled after the plans of Vauban who had been the greatest engineer in the greatest European army of the previous generation But the actual execution was hampered at every turn by want of firmness at headquarters and want of honest labour on the spot Sea sand was plentiful worthless and cheap So it was used for the mortar with most disastrous results The stone was hewn from a quarry of porphyritic trap near by and used for the walls in the rough Cut stone and good bricks were brought out from France as ballast by the fishing fleet Some of these finer materials were built into the governor s and the intendant s quarters Others were sold to New England traders and replaced by inferior substitutes Of course direct trade between the opposing colonies was strictly forbidden by both the French and British navigation acts But the Louisbourg officials winked at anything that would enrich them quickly while the New Englanders pushed in eagerly wherever a profit could be made by any means at all Louisbourg was intended to be the general rendezvous of the transatlantic French fishing vessels a great port of call between France Canada and the French West Indies and a harbour of refuge in peace and war But the New England shipping was doing the best trade at Louisbourg and doing it in double contraband within five years of the foundation Cod caught by Frenchmen from Louisbourg itself French wines and brandy brought out from France tobacco and sugar brought north from the French West Indies all offered excellent chances to enterprising Yankees who came in with foodstuffs and building materials of their own One vessel sailed for New York with a cargo of claret and brandy that netted her owners a profit of a hundred per cent even after paying the usual charges demanded by the French custom house officials for what really was a smuggler s licence Fishing smuggling and theft were the three great industries of Louisbourg The traders shared the profits of the smuggling But the intendant and his officials kept most of the choice thieving for themselves The genuine settlers and a starveling crew they were wrested their debt laden livelihood from the local fishing This was by no means bad in itself But like other fishermen before and since they were in perpetual bondage to the traders who took good care not to let accounts get evened up A happier class of fishermen made up the engages who were paid by government to play settler for a term of years during which they helped to swell the official census of uncongenial Louisbourg The regular French fishing fleet of course returned to France at the end of every season and thus enjoyed a full spell of French delights on shore The Acadians supplied Louisbourg with meat and vegetables These were brought in by sea for there were no roads worth mentioning nor in the contemporary state of Cape Breton was there any need for roads The farmers were few widely scattered and mostly very poor The only prosperous settlement within a long day s march was situated on the beautiful Mira river James Gibson a Boston merchant and militiaman who served against Louisbourg in seventeen forty five was much taken by the appearance of an establishment at the mouth of a large salmon fishery by one very handsome house with two large barns two large gardens and fine fields of corn and by another with six rooms on a floor and well furnished He adds that in one of the barns were fifteen loads of hay and room sufficient for sixty horses and cattle In seventeen fifty three the intendant sent home a report about a proposed German settlement near the Grand Lake of Mira A new experiment was then being tried the importation of settlers from Alsace Lorraine But five years afterwards Cape Breton had been lost to France for ever The fact is that the French never really colonized Cape Breton at large and Louisbourg least of all They knew the magnificent possibilities of Sydney harbour but its mere extent prevented their attempting to make use of it They saw that the whole island was a maritime paradise with seaports in its very heart as well as round its shores But they were a race of gallant industrious landsmen at home with neither the wish nor the aptitude for a nautical life abroad They could not have failed to see that there was plenty of timber in some parts of the island and that the soil was fit to bear good crops of grain in others A little prospecting would also have shown them iron coal and gypsum But their official parasites did not want to see smuggling and peculation replaced by industry and trade Nothing indeed better proves how little they thought of making Ile Royale a genuine colony than their utter failure to exploit any one of its teeming natural resources in forest field or mine What the French did with extraneous resources and artificial aids in the town of Louisbourg is more to the purpose in hand The problem of their position and of its strength and weakness in the coming clash of arms depended on six naval military and governmental factors each one of which must be considered before the whole can be appreciated These six factors were the government the garrison the militia the Indians the navy and the fortress Get rich and go home The English speaking peoples whose ancestors once went to England as oversea emigrants and two thirds of whom are now themselves the scions of successive migrations across the Seven Seas cannot understand how intensely the general run of French officials detested colonial service especially in a place like Louisbourg which was everything the average Frenchman hated most This British failure to understand a national trait which is still as strongly marked as ever accounts for a good deal of the exaggerated belief in the strength of the French position in America The British Americans who tried to think out plans of conquest were wont to under estimate their own unorganized resources and to over estimate the organized resources of the French especially when they set their minds on Louisbourg The British also entertained the erroneous idea that the whole country was under one command This was the very thing it was not The French system was the autocratic one without the local autocrat for the functions of the governor and the intendant overlapped each other and all disputes had to be referred to Quebec where the functions of another governor and another intendant also overlapped each other If no decision could be reached at Quebec and the question at issue was one of sufficient importance the now double imbroglio would be referred to the Supreme Council in France which would write back to Quebec whence the decision would be forwarded to Louisbourg where it would arrive months after many other troubles had grown out of the original dispute The system was false from the start because the overlapping was intentional The idea was to prevent any one man from becoming too strong and too independent The result was to keep governors and intendants at perpetual loggerheads and to divide every station into opposing parties Did the governor want money and material for the fortifications Then the intendant was sure the military chest which was in his own charge could not afford it The governor might sometimes gain his ends by giving a definite emergency order under his hand and seal But if the emergency could not be proved this laid him open to great risks from the intendant s subsequent recriminations before the Superior Council in Quebec or the Supreme Council in France The only way such a system could be worked at all was either by corrupt collusion or by superhuman company operation between the two conflicting parties or by appointing a man of genius who could make every other official discharge his proper duties and no more Corrupt collusion was not very common because the governors were mostly naval or military men and the naval and military men were generally honest company operation was impossible between two merely average men and no genius was ever sent to such a place as Louisbourg The ablest man in either of the principal posts was the notorious intendant Bigot who began here on a small scale the consummate schemes that proved so disastrously successful at Quebec Get rich and go home The minor governmental life of Louisbourg was of a piece with the major There were four or five lesser members of the Superior Council which also had jurisdiction over Ile saint Jean as Prince Edward Island was then called The lucrative chances of the custom house were at the mercy of four under paid officials grandiloquently called a Court of Admiralty An inferior court known as the bailiwick tried ordinary civil suits and breaches of the peace This bailiwick also offered what might be euphemistically called business opportunities to enterprising members True there was no police to execute its decrees and at one time a punctilious resident complained that there was not even a common hangman nor a jail nor even a tormentor to rack the criminals or inflict other appropriate tortures But appeals took a long time and cost much money so even the officials of the bailiwick could pick up a living by threats of the law s delay on the one hand and promises of perverted local justice on the other That there was money to be made in spite of the meagre salaries is proved by the fact that the best journeyman wig maker in Louisbourg grew extremely rich in different branches of commerce especially in the contraband after filling the dual position of judge of the admiralty and judge of the bailiwick both to the apparent satisfaction of his friend the intendant The next factor was the garrison of regulars This was under the direct command of the king s lieutenant who took his orders from the governor The troops liked Louisbourg no better than the officials did True there were taverns in plenty even before Louisbourg was officially founded they had become such a thriving nuisance that orders for their better control had been sent out from France But there was no other place for the ordinary soldier to go to in his spare time The officers felt the want of a larger outlook even more than the men did and neither man nor officer ever went to Louisbourg if he could help it When Montcalm the greatest Frenchman the New World ever saw came out to Canada there was eager competition among the troops at home to join his army in the field Officers paid large sums for the honour of exchanging into any one of the battalions ordered to the front and when volunteers were called for from the ranks every single man stepped forward But no Montcalm came out to Louisbourg and nothing but bounties could get a volunteer There were only between five and six hundred regulars in the whole garrison during the first siege twenty five years after the foundation and nearly half of these were foreigners mostly pay fighting Swiss The third factor was the militia Every able bodied man not specially exempt for other duties was liable for service in time of war and the whole island could be drawn upon for any great emergency at Louisbourg Between thirteen and fourteen hundred men were got under arms for the siege of seventeen forty five Those who lived in Louisbourg had the advantage of a little slack discipline and a little slack drill Those in the country had some practice in the handling of firearms But taken all round it would be an exaggeration to call them even quarter trained soldiers The fourth factor was the Indians They belonged to the Micmac tribe of the great Algonquin family and probably numbered no more than about four thousand throughout the whole French sphere of influence in what are now the Maritime Provinces A few hundred braves might have been ready to take the war path in the wilds of Cape Breton but sieges were not at all in their line except when they could hang round the besiegers inland flanks on the chance of lifting scalps from careless stragglers or ambushing an occasional small party gone astray As in Canada so in Cape Breton the Indians naturally sided with the French who disturbed them less and treated them better than the British did The British who enjoyed the inestimable advantage of superior sea power had more goods to exchange But in every other respect the French were very much preferred The handful of French sent out an astonishingly great number of heroic and sympathetic missionaries to the natives The many British sent out astonishingly few The Puritan clergy did shamefully little compared with the wonderful Jesuits Moreover while the French in general made the Indian feel he was at all events a fellow human being the average British colonist simply looked on him as so much vermin to be destroyed together with the obstructive wilds that harboured him The fifth factor the navy brings us into contact with world wide problems of sea power which are too far reaching for discussion here Footnote See in this Series The Winning of Canada and The Passing of New France where they are discussed Suffice it to say that while Louisbourg was an occasional convenience it had also peculiar dangers for a squadron from the weaker of two hostile navies as squadrons from France were likely to be The British could make for a dozen different harbours on the coast The French could make for only this one Therefore the British had only to guard against this one stronghold if the French were in superior force they could the more easily blockade it if the French were in equal force and they could the more easily annihilate it if it was defended by an inferior force The last factor was the fortress itself This so called Gibraltar of the West this Quebec by the sea this Dunkirk of New France was certainly first of its kind But it was first only in a class of one while the class itself was far from being a first among classes The natural position was vastly inferior to that of Quebec or Gibraltar while the fortifications were not to be compared with those of Dunkirk which in one sense they were meant to replace Dunkirk had been sold by Charles II to Louis XIV who made it a formidable naval base commanding the straits of Dover When the Treaty of Utrecht compelled its demolition the French tried to redress the balance a little by building similar works in America on a very much smaller scale with a much more purely defensive purpose and as an altogether subsidiary undertaking Dunkirk was a pistol held at England s head because it was an integral part of France which was the greatest military country in the world and second to England alone on the sea Louisbourg was no American Dunkirk because it was much weaker in itself because it was more purely defensive because the odds of population and general resources as between the two colonies were fifteen to one in favour of the British and because the preponderance of British sea power was even greater in America than it was in Europe The harbour of Louisbourg ran about two miles north east and south west with a clear average width of half a mile The two little peninsulas on either side of the entrance were nearly a mile apart But the actual fairway of the entrance was narrowed to little more than a clear quarter of a mile by the reefs and islands running out from the south western peninsula on which the fortress stood This low nubbly tongue of land was roughly triangular It measured about three quarters of a mile on its longest side facing the harbour over half a mile on the land side facing the enemy s army and a good deal under half a mile on the side facing the sea It had little to fear from naval bombardment so long as the enemy s fleet remained outside because fogs and storms made it a very dangerous lee shore and because then as now ships would not pit themselves against forts unless there was no rival fleet to fight and unless other circumstances were unusually propitious The entrance was defended by the Island Battery which flanked the approach with thirty nine guns and the Royal Battery which directly faced it with thirty guns Some temporary lines with a few more guns were prepared in time of danger to prevent the enemy from landing in Gabarus Bay which ran for miles south west of Louisbourg But the garrison even with the militia was never strong enough to keep the enemy at arm s length from any one of these positions Moreover the north east peninsula where the lighthouse stood commanded the Island Battery and the land side of Louisbourg itself was commanded by a range of low hillocks less than half a mile away It was this land side containing the citadel and other works which so impressed outsiders with the idea of impregnable strength The glacis was perfect not an inch of cover wherever you looked and the approach was mostly across a slimy bog The ditch was eighty feet wide The walls rose over thirty feet above the ditch There were embrasures for one hundred and forty eight guns all round though not more than ninety were ever actually mounted On the seaward face Louisbourg was not so strongly fortified but in the centre of this face there were a deep ditch and high wall with bastions on each immediate flank and lighter defences connecting these with the landward face A dozen streets were laid out so as to divide the whole town into conveniently square little blocks The area of the town itself was not much more than a hundred acres altogether rather close quarters for several thousand men women and children during a siege If reports and memoranda could defend a fortress then Louisbourg ought indeed to have been impregnable Of course every official trust entails endless correspondence But quite apart from the stated returns that go through the usual channel of communication reams and reams of paper were filled with special reports inspections complaints and good advice The governor wrote home most elaborately in seventeen twenty four about the progress of the works Ten years later he announced the official inauguration of the lighthouse on the first of April In seventeen thirty six the chief item was the engineer s report on the walls Next year the great anxiety was about a dangerous famine with all its attendant distress for the many and its shameless profits for the few On November twenty three seventeen forty four reinforcements and provisions were asked for because intelligence had been received that the New Englanders were going to blockade Louisbourg the following summer At the same time the discontent of the garrison had come to a head and a mutiny had broken out because the extra working pay had not been forthcoming After this the discipline became not sterner but slacker than ever especially among the hireling Swiss On February eight seventeen forty five within three months of the first siege a memorandum was sent in to explain what was still required to finish the works begun twenty five years before But after all it was not so much the defective works that really mattered as the defective garrison behind them English speaking civilians who have written about Louisbourg have sometimes taken partial account of the ordinary Frenchman s repugnance to oversea duty in time of peace and of the little worth of hireling foreigners in time of war But they have always ignored that steady drip drip drip of deterioration which reduces the efficiency of every garrison condemned to service in remote and thoroughly uncongenial countries Louisbourg was remote weeks away from exchanges with Quebec months from exchanges with any part of France or Switzerland And what other foreign station could have been more thoroughly uncongenial except perhaps a convict station in the tropics Bad quarters were endurable in Paris or even in the provinces where five minutes walk would take one into something pleasanter Bad fortifications would inspire less apprehension anywhere in France where there was at least an army always ready to take the field But cold cramped quarters in foggy little Louisbourg between the estranging sea and an uncouth land of rock bog sand and scrubby vegetation made all the world of difference in the soldier s eyes Add to this his want of faith in works which he saw being scamped by rascally contractors and we can begin to understand why the general attitude of town and garrison alike was one of Here to day and gone to morrow

2061_147110_000004_000002	train-clean-360	He was much disliked in Louisbourg 
none	none	He drank hard cursed his subordinates when in his cups and set the whole place by the ears Moreover many of those under him wished to avoid giving the British Americans any provocation in the hope that the war might be confined to Europe But none dared to refuse a legal and positive order So in May his expedition left for Canso where there was a little home made British fort on the strait between Cape Breton and the mainland of Nova Scotia The eighty fishermen in Canso surrendered to du Vivier the French commander who sent them on to Boston after burning their fort to the ground Elated by this somewhat absurd success and strengthened by nearly a hundred regulars and four hundred Indians who raised his total force to at least a thousand men du Vivier next proceeded against Annapolis on the west side of Nova Scotia But Mascarene the British commander there stood fast on his defence though his men were few and his means small The Acadian French in the vicinity were afraid to join du Vivier openly The siege dragged on The British received a slight reinforcement 
2061_147110_000004_000013	train-clean-360	The French did not

2061_147110_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The burning of Canso and the attack on Annapolis stirred up the wrath of New England 
2061_147110_000005_000001	train-clean-360	A wild enthusiast William Vaughan urged Governor Shirley of Massachusetts to make an immediate counter attack 
none	none	Shirley was an English lawyer good at his own work but very anxious to become famous as a conqueror He lent a willing ear to Vaughan and astounded the General Court of Massachusetts on January twenty one seventeen forty five by first inducing the members to swear secrecy and then asking them to consider a plan for a colonial expedition against Louisbourg He and they were on very good terms But they were provincial cautious and naturally slow when it came to planning campaigns and pledging their credit for what was then an enormous sum of money 
2061_147110_000005_000006	train-clean-360	Nor could they be blamed 
none	none	None of them knew much about armies and navies most thought Louisbourg was a real transatlantic Dunkirk and all knew that they were quite insolvent already Their joint committee of the two Houses reported against the scheme whereupon each House carried a secret adverse vote by a large majority But just before these votes were taken a Puritan member from a country district wrestled in what he thought confidential prayer with such loud ejaculations that an eavesdropper overheard him and passed the secret on Of course the momentous news at once began to run like wildfire through the province Still the Noes had it both in the country and the House 
2061_147110_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Shirley was dejected and in doubt what to do next 
none	none	But James Gibson the merchant militiaman suddenly hit on the idea of getting up a petition among the business community The result surpassed every expectation 
2061_147110_000006_000006	train-clean-360	All the merchants were eager for attack

none	none	But his successor du Chambon was no better as a commandant Perhaps the kindest thing to say of du Chambon is that he was the foolish father of a knavish son of that du Chambon de Vergor who in the next war surrendered Fort Beausejour without a siege and left one sleepy sentry to watch Wolfe s Cove the night before the Battle of the Plains It is true that du Chambon had succeeded to a thoroughly bad command He had no naval force whatever and the military force had become worse instead of better The mutiny in December had left the five hundred sixty regulars in a very sullen frame of mind They knew that acquisitive government officials were cheating them out of their proper rations of bacon and beans The officials knew that the soldiers knew And so suspicion and resentment grew strong between them The only other force was the militia which with certain exceptions comprised every male inhabitant of Cape Breton who could stand on two legs and hold a musket with both hands There were boys in their early teens and old men in their sixties Nearly eighteen hundred ought to have been available But four or five hundred that might have been brought in never received their marching orders So the total combatants only amounted to some nineteen hundred of whom thirteen fifty were militia The non combatants numbered nearly as many The cramped hundred acres of imprisoned Louisbourg thus contained almost four thousand people mutineers and militia women and children drones and other officials all huddled up together

2061_147110_000021_000004	train-clean-360	Vaughan then retired for the night 
none	none	On his return to the Royal Battery in the morning with only thirteen men he was astounded to see no sign of life there Suspecting a ruse he bribed an Indian with a flask of brandy to feign being drunk and reel up to the walls The Indian reached the fort unchallenged climbed into an embrasure and found the whole place deserted Vaughan followed at once and a young volunteer shinning up the flag pole made his own red coat fast to the top This defiance was immediately answered by a random salvo from Louisbourg less than a mile across the harbour Vaughan s next move was to write a dispatch to Pepperrell May it please your Honour to be informed that by the Grace of God and the courage of thirteen Men I entered the Royal Battery about nine o the clock and am waiting for a reinforcement and a flag He had hardly sent this off before he was attacked by four boats from Louisbourg Quite undaunted however he stood out on the open beach with his thirteen men and kept them all at bay till the reinforcement and the flag arrived with Bradstreet who was afterwards to win distinction as the captor of Fort Frontenac during the great campaign of seventeen fifty nine This disgraceful abandonment and this dramatic capture of the Royal Battery marked the first and most decisive turning point in the fortunes of the siege The French were dismayed the British were elated and both the dismay and the elation grew as time wore on because everything seemed to conspire against the French and in favour of the British Even the elements as the anonymous Habitant de Louisbourg complains in his wonderfully candid diary seemed to have taken sides There had never been so fine a spring for naval operations But this was the one thing which was entirely independent of French fault or British merit All the other strokes of luck owed something to human causes Wise acres had shaken their heads over the crazy idea of taking British cannon balls solely to fit French cannon that were to be taken at the beginning of the siege it was too much like selling the pelt before the trap was sprung Yet these balls actually were used to load the forty two pounders taken with the Royal Battery Moreover as if to cap the climax ten other cannon were found buried in the North East Harbour and again spare British balls were found to fit exactly The fact is that what we should now call the Intelligence Department had been doing good work the year before by spying out the land at Louisbourg and reporting to the proper men in Boston The Bostonians had always intended to take the Royal Battery at the earliest possible moment But nobody had thought that the French would abandon it without a blow and leave it intact for their enemy with all its armament complete The French council of war apparently shrank from hurting the feelings of the engineer in charge who had pleaded for its preservation They then ran away without spiking the guns properly and without making the slightest attempt either to burn the carriages or knock the trunnions off The invaluable stores were left in their places The only real destruction was caused by a barrel of powder which some bunglers blew up by mistake The inevitable consequence of all this French ineptitude was that the Royal Battery roared against Louisbourg the very next morning with tremendous effect smashing the works most exposed to its fire bringing down houses about the inhabitants ears and sending the terrified non combatants scurrying off to underground cover Meanwhile the bulk of the New Englanders were establishing their camp along the brook which fell into Gabarus Bay beside Flat Point and within two miles of Louisbourg Equipment of all kinds was very scarce Tents were so few and bad that old sails stretched over ridge poles had to be used instead When sails ran short brushwood shelters roofed in with overlapping spruce boughs were used as substitutes Landing the four thousand men had been comparatively easy work But landing the stores was very hard indeed while landing the guns was not only much harder still but full of danger as well Many a flat boat was pounded into pulpwood while unloading the stores though the men waded in waist deep and carried all the heavy bundles on their heads and shoulders When it came to the artillery it meant a boat lost for every single piece of ordnance landed Nor was even this the worst for strange as it may seem there was at first more risk of foundering ashore than afloat There were neither roads nor yet the means to make them There were no horses oxen mules or any other means of transport except the brawny men themselves who literally buckled to with anchor cable drag ropes a hundred pair of straining men for each great lumbering gun Over the sand they went at a romp Over the rocks they had to take care and in the dense obstructing scrub they had to haul through by main force But this was child s play to what awaited them in the slimy shifting and boulder strewn bog they had to pass before reaching the hillocks which commanded Louisbourg The first attempts here were disastrous The guns sank out of sight in the engulfing bog while the toiling men became regular human targets for shot and shell from Louisbourg It was quite plain that the British batteries could never be built on the hillocks if the guns had nothing to keep them from a boggy grave and if the men had no protection from the French artillery 
2061_147110_000027_000003	train-clean-360	But a ship builder colonel Meserve of New Hampshire came to the rescue by designing a gun sleigh sixteen feet in length and five in the beam 
none	none	Then the crews were told off again two hundred men for each sleigh and orders were given that the work should not be done except at night or under cover of the frequent fogs After this things went much better than before But the labour was tremendous still while the danger from random shells bursting among the boulders was not to be despised Four hundred struggling feet four hundred straining arms each team hove on its long taut cable through fog rain and the blackness of the night till every gun had been towed into one of the batteries before the walls The triumph was all the greater because the work grew not easier but harder as it progressed The same route used twice became an impassable quagmire So when the last two hundred men had wallowed through the whole ensnaring bog was seamed with a perfect maze of decoying death trails snaking in and out of the forbidding scrub and boulders Pepperrell s dispatches could not exaggerate these almost incredible hardships Afloat and ashore awake and asleep the men were soaking wet for days together At the end of the longest haul they had nothing but a choice of evils They could either lie down where they were on hard rock or oozing bog exposed to the enemy s fire the moment it was light enough to see the British batteries or they could plough their way back to camp Here they were safe enough from shot and shell but in other respects no better off than in the batteries 
2061_147110_000028_000004	train-clean-360	Most men s kits were of the very scantiest 
2061_147110_000028_000005	train-clean-360	Very few had even a single change of clothing 
none	none	A good many went bare foot Nearly all were in rags before the siege was over When twenty five pieces had been dragged up to Green Hill and its adjoining hillocks the bombardment at last began The opening salvo seemed to give the besiegers new life No sooner was their first rough line of investment formed than they commenced gaining ground with a disregard for cover which would have cost them dear if the French practice had not been quite as bad as their own A really wonderful amount of ammunition was fired off on both sides without hitting anything in particular Louisbourg itself was of course too big a target to be missed as a rule and the besiegers soon got so close that they simply had to be hit themselves now and then But generally speaking it may be truthfully said that while in an ordinary battle it takes a man s own weight in cartridges to kill him in this most extraordinary siege it took at least a horse s weight as well The approach to the walls defied all the usual precautions of regular war But the circumstances justified its boldness With only four thousand men at the start with nearly half of this total on the sick list at one rather critical juncture with very few trained gunners and without any corps of engineers at all the Provincials adapted themselves to the situation so defiantly that they puzzled shook and overawed the French who thought them two or three times stronger than they really were Recklessly defiant though they were however they did provide the breaching batteries with enough cover for the purpose in hand This is amply proved both by the fewness of their casualties and by the evidence of Bastide the British engineer at Annapolis who inspected the lines of investment on his arrival twelve days before the surrender and reported them sufficiently protected Where the Provincials showed their prentice hands to genuine disadvantage was in their absurdly solemn and utterly futile councils of war No schoolboys debating club could well have done worse than the council held to consider du Chambon s stereotyped answer to the usual summons sent in at the beginning of a siege The formula that his cannon would answer for him provoked a tremendous storm in the council s teacup and immediately resulted in the following resolution Advised Unanimously that the Towne of Louisbourg be Attacked this Night But confronted with a great Dissatysfaction in many of the officers and Souldiers at the designed attack of the towne this Night it was Advised Unanimously by a second council called in great haste that the Said Attack be deferred for the Present This Present lasted during the rest of the siege Once the New Englanders had settled down however they wisely began to increase their weight of metal as well as to decrease the range at which they used it They set to work with a will to make a breach at the North West Gate of Louisbourg near where the inner angle of the walls abutted on the harbour and they certainly needed all their indomitable perseverance when it came to arming their new North Western or Titcomb s Battery The twenty two pounders had required two hundred men apiece The forty two pounders took three hundred Two of these unwieldy guns were hauled a couple of miles round the harbour in the dark from that Royal Battery which Vaughan had taken by the Grace of God and the courage of thirteen Men and then successfully mounted at Titcomb s just where they could do the greatest damage to their former owners the French Well trained gunners were exceedingly scarce Pepperrell could find only six among his four thousand men But Warren lent him three more whom he could ill spare as no one knew when a fleet might come out from France With these nine instructors to direct them Pepperrell s men closed in their line of fire till besieged and besiegers came within such easy musket shot of one another that taunting challenges and invitations could be flung across the intervening space Each side claimed advantages and explained shortcomings to its own satisfaction A New England diarist says We began our fire with as much fury as possible and the French returned it as warmly with Cannon Mortars and continual showers of musket balls but by eleven o clock we had beat them all from their guns A French diarist of the same day says that the fire from the walls was stopped on purpose chiefly to save powder while the same reason is assigned for the British order to cease fire exactly one hour later The practice continued to be exceedingly bad on both sides so bad indeed that the New Englanders suffered more from the bursting of their own guns than from the enemy s fire The nine instructors could not be everywhere and all their good advice could not prevent the eager amateurs from grossly overloading the double shotted pieces Another forty two pound gun burst at the Grand Battery Captain Hale is dangerously hurt by the bursting of another gun He was the mainstay of our gunnery since Captain Rhodes s misfortune a misfortune due to the same cause But in spite of all such drawbacks on the British side Louisbourg got much the worst of it The French had to fire from the centre outwards at a semicircle of batteries that fired back convergingly at them Besides it was almost as hard to hit the thin irregular line of British batteries as it was to miss the deep wide target of overcrowded Louisbourg

none	none	Many houses were laid in ruins only one remained intact when the siege was over The non combatants who now exceeded the garrison effectives were half buried in the smothering casemates underground and though the fighting men had light air and food enough and though they were losing very few in killed and wounded they too began to feel that Louisbourg must fall if it was not soon relieved from outside The British on the contrary grew more and more confident both afloat and ashore though they had one quite alarming scare ashore They knew their navy outmatched the French and they saw that while Warren was being strengthened du Chambon was being left as devoid of naval force as ever But their still greater confidence ashore was for the time being very rudely shaken when they heard that Marin the same French guerilla leader who had been sent down from Quebec against Annapolis with six or seven hundred whites and Indians had been joined by the promised reinforcements from France and was coming to take the camp in rear The truth was that the reinforcements never arrived that Marin had failed to take Annapolis and that there was no real danger from his own dwindling force even if it had tried to relieve Louisbourg in June 
2061_147110_000036_000004	train-clean-360	But the rumour ran quickly through the whole camp probably not without Pepperrell s own encouragement and at once produced not a panic but the most excellent effect

none	none	The guns had to be taken round by sea out of range of the Island Battery hauled up low but very dangerous cliffs and then dragged back overland another mile and a quarter The directing officer was Colonel Gridley who drew the official British maps and plans of Louisbourg in seventeen forty five and who thirty years later traced the American defences on the slopes of Bunker s Hill Du Chambon had attempted to make an attack on Gorham s Post as soon as it was established His idea was that his men should follow the same route as the British guns had followed that is that they should run the gauntlet between the British fleet and army land well north of Gorham s Post and take it by surprise from the rear But his detachment which was wholly inadequate failed to strike its blow and was itself very nearly cut off by Warren s guard boats on its crest fallen return to Louisbourg Gridley s Lighthouse Battery soon over matched the Island Battery where powder was getting dangerously scarce Many of the French guns were knocked off their mountings while the walls were breached Finally the British bombardment became so effective that Frenchmen were seen running into the water to escape the bursting shells It was now past the middle of June and the siege had lasted more than a month The circle of fire was closing in on the beleaguered garrison Their total effectives had sunk to only a thousand men This thousand laboured harder in its losing cause than might have been expected Perhaps the mutineers hoped to be pardoned if they made a firm defence Perhaps the militia thought they ought not to be outdone by mutineers and hireling foreigners But whatever the reason great efforts were certainly made to build up by night what the British knocked down by day Two could play at that game however and the British had the men and means to win Their western batteries from the land were smashing the walls into ruins

none	none	Breaches were yawning elsewhere British fascines were visible in large quantities ready to fill up the ditch which was already half full of debris The French scouts reported hundreds of scaling ladders on the reverse slopes of the nearest hillocks Warren s squadron had just been again reinforced and now numbered eleven sail carrying five hundred fifty four guns and three thousand men There was no sign of help by land or sea for shrunken battered and despairing Louisbourg Food ammunition stores were all running out Moreover the British were evidently preparing a joint attack which would result in putting the whole garrison to the sword if a formal surrender should not be made in time Now that the Island Battery had been silenced there was no reason why Warren s plan should not be crowned with complete success Accordingly he arranged with Pepperrell to run in with the first fair wind at the head of the whole fleet which with the Provincial armed vessels now numbered twenty four sail carried seven hundred seventy guns and was manned by four thousand sailors Half these men could be landed to attack the inner water front while Pepperrell could send another two thousand against the walls The total odds against Louisbourg would thus be about four to one in men and over eight to one in guns actually engaged But this threatened assault was never made In the early morning of June twenty seven the non combatants in Louisbourg unanimously petitioned du Chambon to surrender forthwith They crept out of their underground dungeons and gazed with mortal apprehension at the overwhelming forces that stood arrayed against their crumbling walls and dwindling garrison Noon came and their worst fears seemed about to be realized

none	none	Then both moved into the British lines and beyond to where Warren and Pepperrell were making their last arrangements on Green Hill After a short consultation the British leaders sent in a joint reply to say that du Chambon could have till eight the next morning to make his proposals These proved to be so unacceptable that Pepperrell refused to consider them and at once sent counter proposals of his own Du Chambon had now no choice between annihilation and acceptance so he agreed to surrender Louisbourg the following day He was obliged to guarantee that none of the garrison should bear arms against the British in any part of the world for a whole year Every one in Louisbourg was of course promised full protection for both property and person Du Chambon s one successful stipulation was that his troops should march out with the honours of war drums beating bayonets fixed and colours flying Warren and Pepperrell willingly accorded this on the twenty eighth and the formal transfer took place next day exactly seven weeks since the first eager New Englanders had waded ashore through the thundering surf of Gabarus Bay The total losses in killed and wounded were never precisely determined Each side minimized its own and maximized the enemy s But as du Chambon admitted a loss of one hundred and forty five and as the Provincials claimed to have put three hundred out of action the true number is probably about two hundred or just over ten per cent of the whole garrison 
2061_147110_000052_000003	train-clean-360	The Provincials reported their own killed quite correctly at a hundred 
none	none	The remaining deaths on both sides were due to disease The Provincial wounded were never grouped together in any official returns 
2061_147110_000052_000006	train-clean-360	They amounted to about three hundred 
none	none	This brings the total casualties in Pepperrell s army up to four hundred and gives the same percentage as the French The highest proportion of casualties among all the different forces was the fifteen per cent lost by the French on board the Vigilant in less than five hours fighting The lowest was in Warren s squadron and the Provincial Marine about five in each The loss of material suffered by the French was of course on quite a different scale Every fortification and other building in Louisbourg with the remarkable exception of a single house was at least partly demolished by the nine thousand cannon balls and six hundred shells that hit the target of a hundred acres peopled by four thousand souls On the twenty ninth the French marched out with the honours of war laid down their arms and were put under guard as prisoners pending their transport to France Du Chambon handed the keys to Pepperrell at the South Gate The victorious but disgusted Provincials marched in by the West Gate and found themselves set to protect the very houses that they had hoped to plunder Was it not high time to recoup themselves for serving as soldiers at sixpence a day Great Babylon had fallen and ought to be destroyed of course with due profit to the destroyers There was a regular Louisbourg legend current in New England that stores of goods and money were to be found in the strong rooms of every house So we can understand the indignation of men whose ideas were coloured by personal contact with smuggling and privateering and sometimes with downright piracy when they were actually told off as sentries over these mythical hoards of wealth One diarist made the following entry immediately after he had heard the news Sabbath Day ye sixteenth June Old Style they came to Termes for us to enter ye Sitty to morrow and Poore Termes they Bee too Another added that there was a great Noys and hubbub a mongst ye Solders a bout ye Plunder Som a Cursing Som a Swarein Five days later a third indignant Provincial wrote Ye French keep possession yet and we are forsed to stand at their Dores to gard them Another sympathetic chronicler after pouring out the vials of his wrath on the clause which guaranteed the protection of French private property lamented that by these means the poor souldiers lost all their hopes and just demerit sic of plunder promised them While Parson Moody was preaching a great thanksgiving sermon and all the senior officers were among his congregation there was what responsible officials called excessive stealing in every part of the Towne Had this stealing really been very excessive no doubt it would have allayed the grumbling in the camp But as a matter of fact there was so little to steal that the looters began to suspect collusion between their leaders and the French Another fancied wrong exasperated the Provincials at this critical time A rumour ran through the camp that Warren had forestalled Pepperrell by receiving the keys himself 
2061_147110_000054_000004	train-clean-360	Warren was cursed Pepperrell blamed and a mutinous spirit arose 
none	none	Then it was suddenly discovered that Pepperrell had put the keys in his pocket Meanwhile the fleet was making haul after haul When Pepperrell marched through the battered West Gate at the head of his motley army Warren had led his squadron into the harbour and both commanders had saluted the raising of the Union Jack which marked the change of ownership But no sooner had the sound of guns and cheering died away than the Union Jack was lowered and the French flag was raised again both over the citadel of Louisbourg and over the Island Battery This stratagem succeeded beyond Warren s utmost expectations Several French vessels were lured into Louisbourg and captured with stores and men enough to have kept the British out for some weeks longer Their cargoes were worth about a million dollars Then just as the naval men were wondering whether their harvest was over or not a fine French frigate made for the harbour quite unsuspectingly and only discovered her fatal mistake too late to turn back By the irony of circumstances she happened to be called Notre Dame de la Delivrance Among her passengers was the distinguished man of science Don Antonio de Ulloa on his way to Paris with all the results of those explorations in South America which he afterwards embodied in a famous book of travel Warren treated him with the greatest courtesy and promised that all his collections should be duly forwarded to the Royal Academy of Sciences Once this exchange of international amenities had been ended however the usual systematic search began The visible cargo was all cocoa But hidden underneath were layers and layers of shining silver dollars from Peru and underneath this double million another two million dollars worth of ingots of silver and ingots of gold The contrast between the poverty of Louisbourg where so much had been expected and the rich hauls of prize money made by the fleet was gall and wormwood to the Provincials But their resentment was somewhat tempered by Warren s genial manner towards them Warren was at home with all sorts and conditions of men His own brother officers statesmen and courtiers distinguished strangers like Ulloa and colonial merchants like Pepperrell were equally loud in his praise With the lesser and much more easily offended class of New Englanders found in the ranks he was no less popular A rousing speech in which he praised the magnificently stubborn work accomplished by my wife s fellow countrymen a hearty generosity all round and a special hogshead of the best Jamaica rum for the garrison of the Royal Battery won him a great deal of goodwill in spite of the fact that his Admiral s eighth of the naval prize money amounted to some sixty thousand pounds while Pepperrell found himself ten thousand pounds out of pocket at the end of the siege Pepperrell however was a very rich man for those colonial days and he could well afford to celebrate the fall of Louisbourg by giving the chief naval and military officers a dinner the fame of which will never fade away from some New England memories

bearing it arrived in the middle of the night But long before the summer sun was up the streets were filled with shouts of triumph while the church bells rang in peals of exultation and all the guns and muskets in the place were fired as fast as men could load them The mother country s joy was less exuberant There were so many other things to think of nearer home among them the British defeat at Fontenoy and the landing of the Young Pretender Nor was the actual victory without alloy for prescient people feared that a practically independent colonial army had been encouraged to become more independent still And who can say the fear was groundless Louisbourg really did serve to blood New Englanders for Bunker s Hill But in spite of this one drawback the news was welcomed partly because any victory was welcome at such a time and partly because the fall of Louisbourg was a signal assertion of British sea power on both sides of the Atlantic London naturally made overmuch of Warren s share just as Boston made overmuch of Pepperrell s But the Imperial government itself perfectly understood that the fleet and the army were each an indispensable half of one company operating whole Warren was promoted rear admiral of the blue the least that could be given him Pepperrell received much higher honours He was made a baronet and like Shirley was given the colonelcy of a regiment which was to bear his name Such colonelcies do not imply the actual command of men but are honorary distinctions of which even kings and conquerors are proud Nor was the Provincial Marine forgotten Rous of the Shirley was sent to England with dispatches and was there made a post captain in the Royal Navy for his gallantry in action against the Vigilant He afterwards enjoyed a distinguished career and died an admiral It was in his ship the Sutherland that Wolfe wrote the final orders for the Battle of the Plains fourteen years after this first siege of Louisbourg CHAPTER III THE LINK RECOVERED seventeen forty eight Louisbourg was the most thoroughly hated place in all America The French government hated it as Napoleon hated the Peninsula because it was a drain on their resources The British government hated it because it cut into their oversea communications The American colonists hated it because it was a standing menace to their ambitious future And every one who had to live in it no matter whether he was French or British European or American naval or military private or official hated it as only exiles can But perhaps even exiled Frenchmen detested it less heartily than the disgusted Provincials who formed its garrison from the summer of seventeen forty five to the spring of the following year Warren and Pepperrell were obliged to spend half their time in seeing court martial justice done The bluejackets fretted for some home port in which to enjoy their plentiful prize money The Provincials fretted for home at any cost They were angry at being kept on duty at sixpence a day after the siege was over They chafed against the rules about looting as well as against what they thought the unjust difference between the million sterling that had been captured at sea under full official sanction and the ridiculous collection of odds and ends that could be stolen on land at the risk of pains and penalties Imagine the rage of the sullen Puritan even if he had a sense of humour when after hearing a bluejacket discussing plans for spending a hundred golden guineas he had to make such entries in his diary as these of Private Benjamin Crafts Saturday Recd a half pint of Rum to Drinke ye King s Health The Lord look upon Us and prepare us for His Holy Day Sunday Blessed be the Lord that has given us to enjoy another Sabath Monday Last Night I was taken verry Bad The Lord be pleased to strengthen my Inner Man May we all be Prepared for his Holy Will Recd part of Plunder nine Small tooth combs No wonder there was trouble in plenty The routine of a small and uncongenial station is part of a regular s second nature though a very disagreeable part But it maddens militiamen when the stir of active service is past and they think they are being kept on such duty overtime The Massachusetts men had the worst pay and the best ringleaders so they were the first to break out openly One morning they fell in without their officers marched on to the general parade and threw their muskets down This was a dramatic but ineffectual form of protest because nearly all the muskets were the private property of the men themselves who soon came back to take their favourite weapons up again One of their most zealous chaplains however was able to enter in his diary perhaps not without a qualm but certainly not without a proper pride in New England spirit the remark of a naval officer that he had thought the New England men were cowards But that Now he thought that if they had a Pick ax and Spade they would digg ye way to Hell and storm it The only relief from the deadly monotony and loneliness of Louisbourg was to be found in the bad bargains and worse entertainment offered by the camp followers who quickly gathered like a flock of vultures to pick the carcass to the bone There were few pickings to be had but these human parasites held on until the bones were bare Of course they gave an inordinate amount of trouble They always do But well organized armies keep them in their place while militiamen can not Between the camp followers and the men Pepperrell was almost driven mad He implored Shirley to come and see things for himself Shirley came He arrived at the end of August accompanied both by his own wife and by Warren s He delivered a patriotic speech in which he did not stint his praise of what had really been a great and notable achievement His peroration called forth some genuine enthusiasm It began with a promise to raise the pay of the Massachusetts contingent by fifteen shillings a month and ended with free rum all round and three cheers for the king The prospect thereupon brightened a little The mutineers kept quiet for several days and a few men even agreed to re enlist until the following June Shirley was very much pleased with the immediate result and still more pleased with himself His next dispatch assured the Duke of Newcastle that nobody else could have quelled the incipient mutiny so well Nor was the boast in one sense vain since nobody else had the authority to raise the men s pay But discontent again became rife when it began to dawn on the Provincials that they would have to garrison Louisbourg till the next open season The unwelcome truth was that except for a few raw recruits no reliefs were forthcoming from any quarter The promised regulars had left Gibraltar so late that they had to be sent to Virginia for the winter lest the sudden change to cold and clammy Louisbourg should put them on the sick list The two new regiments Shirley s and Pepperrell s which were to be recruited in the American colonies and form part of the Imperial Army could not be raised in time There even seemed to be some doubt as to whether they could be raised at all The absence of Pepperrell from New England the hatred of garrison duty in Louisbourg and resentment at seeing some Englishmen commissioned to command Americans were three great obstacles in the way The only other resource was the colonial militia whose waifs and strays alone could be induced to enlist Thus once the ice began to form the despairing Provincial garrison saw there could be no escape The only discharge was death What were then known as camp fevers had already broken out in August As many as twenty seven funerals in a single day passed by the old lime kiln on the desolate point beyond the seaward walls of Louisbourg After we got into the Towne a sordid indolence or Sloth for want of Discipline induced putrid fevers and dyssentrys which at length became contagious and the people died like rotten sheep Medical men were ignorant and few Proper attendance was wholly lacking But the devotion of the Puritan chaplains rivalling that of the early Jesuits ran through those awful horrors like a thread of gold Here is a typical entry of one day s pastoral care Prayed at Hospital Prayed at Citadel Preached at Grand Batery Visited a long list of names all verry Sick More names Dy d Am but poorly myself but able to keep about No survivor ever forgot the miseries of that dire winter in cold and clammy Louisbourg When April brought the Gibraltar regiments from Virginia Pepperrell sent in to Shirley his general report on the three thousand men with whom he had begun the autumn Barely one thousand were fit for duty Eleven hundred lay sick and suffering in the ghastly hospital Eight hundred and ninety lay buried out on the dreary tongue of land between the lime pit and the fog bound ice encumbered sea Warren took over the command of all the forces as he had been appointed governor of Louisbourg by the king s commission Shirley had meanwhile been revolving new plans this time for the complete extirpation of the French in Canada during the present summer of seventeen forty six He suggested that Warren should be the naval joint commander and Warren of course was nothing loth Massachusetts again rose grandly to the situation She voted three thousand five hundred men with a four pound sterling bounty to each one of them New Hampshire Connecticut and Rhode Island followed well New York and New Jersey did less in proportion Maryland did less still Virginia would only pass a lukewarm vote for a single hundred men Pennsylvania as usual refused to do anything at all The legislature was under the control of the Quakers who when it came to war were no better than parasites upon the body politic They never objected to enjoying the commercial benefits of conquest any more than they objected to living on land which could never have been either won or held without the arms they reprobated But their principles forbade them to face either the danger or expense of war The honour of the other Pennsylvanians was however nobly saved by a contingent of four hundred raised as a purely private venture Altogether the new Provincial army amounted to over eight thousand men The French in Canada were thoroughly alarmed Rumour had magnified the invading fleet and army till in July the Acadians reported the combined forces British regulars included at somewhere between forty and fifty thousand But the alarm proved groundless The regulars were sent on an abortive expedition against the coast of France while the Duke of Newcastle ordered Shirley to discharge the very expensive Provincials who were now in Imperial pay as cheap as possible This was then done to the intense disgust of the colonies concerned New York and Massachusetts however were so loth to give up without striking a single blow that they raised a small force on their own account to take Crown Point and gain control of Lake Champlain Footnote An account of this expedition will be found in Chapter ii of The War Chief of the Six Nations in this Series Before October came the whole of the colonies were preparing for a quiet winter except that it was to be preceded by the little raid on Crown Point when quite suddenly astounding news arrived from sea This was that the French had sent out a regular armada to retake Louisbourg and harry the coast to the south Every ship brought in further and still more alarming particulars The usual exaggerations gained the usual credence But the real force if properly handled and combined was dangerous enough It consisted of fourteen sail of the line and twenty one frigates with transports carrying over three thousand veteran troops altogether about seventeen thousand men or more than twice as many as those in the contingents lately raised for taking Canada New York and Massachusetts at once recalled their Crown Point expeditions Boston was garrisoned by eight thousand men All the provinces did their well scared best There was no danger except along the coast for there were enough armed men to have simply mobbed to death any three thousand Frenchmen who marched into the hostile continent which would engulf them if they lost touch with the fleet and wear them out if they kept communications open Those who knew anything of war knew this perfectly well and they more than half suspected that the French force had been doubled or trebled by the panic mongers But the panic spread and spread inland for all that No British country had ever been so thoroughly alarmed since England had watched the Great Armada sailing up the Channel The poets and preachers quickly changed their tune Ames s Almanac for seventeen forty six had recently edified Bostonians with a song of triumph over fallen Louisbourg Bright Hesperus the Harbinger of Day Smiled gently down on Shirley s prosperous sway The Prince of Light rode in his burning car To see the overtures of Peace and War Around the world and bade his charioteer Who marks the periods of each month and year Rein in his steeds and rest upon High Noon To view our Victory over Cape Brittoon But now the Reverend Thomas Prince s litany rhymed by a later bard summed up the gist of all the supplications that ascended from the Puritans O Lord We would not advise But if in Thy Providence A Tempest should arise To drive the French fleet hence And scatter it far and wide Or sink it in the sea We should be satisfied And Thine the Glory be Strange to say this pious suggestion had been mostly answered before it had been made Disaster after disaster fell upon the doomed French fleet from the very day it sailed The admiral was the Duc d Anville one of the illustrious La Rochefoucaulds whose family name is known wherever French is read He was not wanting either in courage or good sense but like his fleet he had little experience at sea The French ships as usual were better than the British But the French themselves were a nation of landsmen They had no great class of seamen to draw upon at will a fact which made an average French crew inferior to an average British one This was bad enough But the most important point of all was that their fleets were still worse than their single ships The British always had fleets at sea constantly engaged in combined manoeuvres The French had not and in face of the British command of the sea they could not have them The French harbours were watched so closely that the French fleets were often attacked and defeated before they had begun to learn how to work together Consequently they found it still harder to unite two different fleets against their almost ubiquitous enemy D Anville s problem was insoluble from the start Four large men of war from the West Indies were to join him at Chibucto Bay now the harbour of Halifax under Admiral Conflans the same who was defeated by Hawke in Quiberon Bay thirteen years later on the very day that Wolfe was buried Each contributory part of the great French naval plan failed in the working out D Anville s command was a collection of ships not a company ordinated fleet The French dockyards had been neglected so some of the ships were late which made it impossible to practise manoeuvres before sailing for the front Then in the bungling hurry of fitting out the hulls of several vessels were left foul which made them dull sailers while nearly all the holds were left unscoured which of course helped to propagate the fevers scurvy plague and pestilence brought on by bad food badly stowed Nor was this all Officers who had put in so little sea time with working fleets were naturally slack and inclined to be discontented The fact that they were under sealed orders which had been communicated only to d Anville roused their suspicions while his weakness in telling them they were bound for Louisbourg almost produced a mutiny The fleet left France at midsummer had a very rough passage through the Bay of Biscay and ran into a long dead calm off the Azores This ended in a storm during which several vessels were struck by lightning which in one case caused a magazine explosion that killed and wounded over thirty men It was not till the last week of September that d Anville made the excellently safe harbour of Halifax The four ships under Conflans were nowhere to be seen They had reached the rendezvous at the beginning of the month had cruised about for a couple of weeks and had then gone home D Anville was now in no position to attack Louisbourg much less New England Some of his vessels were quite unserviceable There was no friendly port nearer than Quebec All his crews were sickly and the five months incessant and ever increasing strain had changed him into a broken hearted man He died very suddenly in the middle of the night some said from a stroke of apoplexy while others whispered suicide His successor d Estournel summoned a council of war which overruled the plan for an immediate return to France Presently a thud followed by groans of mortal agony was heard in the new commander s cabin The door was burst open and he was found dying from the thrust of his own sword La Jonquiere afterwards governor general of Canada thereupon succeeded d Estournel This commander the third within three days was an excellent naval officer and a man of strong character He at once set to work to reorganize the fleet But reorganization was now impossible Storms wrecked the vessels The plague killed off the men nearly three thousand had died already Only a single thousand one tenth of the survivors were really fit for duty Yet La Jonquiere still persisted in sailing for Annapolis One vessel was burned while four others were turned into hospital ships which trailed astern dropping their dead overside hour after hour as they went But Annapolis was never attacked The dying fleet turned back and at last reached Port Louis on the coast of Brittany There it found La Palme a frigate long since given up for lost lying at anchor after a series of adventures that seem wellnigh impossible First her crew s rations had been cut down to three ounces a day Then the starving men had eaten all the rats in her filthy hold and when rats failed they had proposed to eat their five British prisoners The captain did his best to prevent this crowning horror But the men who were now ungovernable had already gone below to cut up one prisoner into three ounce rations when they were brought on deck again just in time by the welcome cry of sail ho The Portuguese stranger fortunately proved to have some sheep which were instantly killed and eaten raw News of these disasters to the French arms at length reached the anxious British colonies The militia were soon discharged The danger seemed past And the whole population spent a merrier Christmas than any one of them had dared to hope for In May of the next year seventeen forty seven La Jonquiere again sailed for Louisbourg But when he was only four days out he was overtaken off Cape Finisterre by a superior British fleet under Anson and Warren and was totally defeated after a brave resistance In seventeen forty eight the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle gave Louisbourg back to the French The British colonies were furious New England particularly so But the war at large had not gone severely enough against the French to force them to abandon a stronghold on which they had set their hearts and for which they were ready to give up any fair equivalent The contemporary colonial sneer often repeated since and quite commonly believed was that the important island of Cape Breton was exchanged for a petty factory in India This was not the case Every power was weary of the war But France was ready to go on with it rather than give up her last sea link with Canada Unless this one point was conceded the whole British Empire would have been involved in another vast and perhaps quite barren campaign The only choice the British negotiators could apparently make was a choice between two evils And of the two they chose the less CHAPTER IV LOST FOR EVER seventeen fifty eight The ten years of the second French regime in Louisbourg were divided into very different halves During the first five years from seventeen forty nine to seventeen fifty three the mighty rivals were as much at peace all over their conflicting frontiers as they ever had been in the past But from seventeen fifty four to seventeen fifty eight a great and this time a decisive war kept drawing continually nearer until its strangling coils at last crushed Louisbourg to death Three significant events marked seventeen forty nine the first of the five peaceful years Louisbourg was handed over to its new French garrison the British founded Halifax and the Imperial government indemnified New England in full for the siege of seventeen forty five Halifax was intended partly as a counterpoise to Louisbourg and partly as a place d armes for one of the two local footholds of British sea power Nova Scotia and Newfoundland which between them narrowed the French line of communication with Canada into a single precarious strait The New England indemnity was meant in the first instance to be a payment for service done But it was also intended to soften colonial resentment at the giving up of Louisbourg A specially gracious royal message was sent to The Council and Assembly of Massachusetts assuring them in His Majesty s name that their conduct will always entitle them in a particular manner to his Royal favour and protection This message however did not reconcile the Provincial army to the disappointment of their own expectations Nor did it dispose the colonies in general to be any the more amenable to government from London They simply regarded the indemnity as the skinflint payment of an overdue debt and the message as no more than the thanks they had well deserved But the money was extremely welcome to people who would have been bankrupt without it Nearly a quarter of a million sterling was sent out in two hundred seventeen cases of Spanish dollars and one hundred barrels of coppers which were driven through the streets of Boston in twenty seven trucks The next three years in Louisbourg were completely uneventful The town resumed its former life but in a still more makeshift fashion Nobody knew how long the truce would last and nobody wanted to take root commercially in a place that might experience another violent change at any time Nevertheless smuggling flourished as vigorously as before British shipping did most of it Many vessels came from England many from Boston some and very active ones from Halifax Joshua Mauger smuggled from France to Louisbourg from Louisbourg to Mauger s Beach near Halifax and from Halifax all over Acadia and the adjacent colonies He also supplied the Micmacs with scalping knives and tomahawks for use against his own countrymen He died a very rich man in England leaving his fortune to his daughter who with her spendthrift husband the Duc de Bouillon was guillotined during the French Revolution The officials were naturally affected by the same uncertainty which made them more than ever determined to get rich and go home The intendant Bigot was promoted to Quebec there to assist his country s enemies by the worst corruption ever known in Canada But the new intendant Prevost though a man of very inferior talent did his best to follow Bigot s lead French regulars still regarded the Louisbourg routine as their most disgusting duty But it became more tolerable with the increase of the garrison The fortifications were examined reported on repaired and extended The engineers like all the other Frenchmen connected with unhappy Louisbourg Bigot alone excepted were second and third rate men and the actual work was done as badly as before But on the whole the place was strengthened especially by a battery near the lighthouse With this and the Island Battery one on either side of the narrow entrance which the Royal Battery faced directly almost a hundred guns could be brought to bear on any vessels trying to force their way in The end of the five years truce was marked by voluminous reports and elaborate arguments to prove how well Louisbourg was being governed how admirably the fortifications had been attended to with the inadequate means at the intendant s disposal and how desirable it was from every point of view for the king to spend a great deal more money all round in the immediate future Fisheries shipbuilding fortification Indians trade religion the naval and military situation were all represented as only needing more money to become quite perfect Louisbourg was correctly enough described as an indispensable link between France and the long chain of French posts in the valleys of the Mississippi and the saint Lawrence But less well explained in America and less well understood in Europe was the fact that the separate military chains in Old France and New could never hold an oversea dominion unless a naval chain united them Some few Frenchmen understood this thoroughly But most did not And France as a whole hoped that a vigorous offensive on land would more than counterbalance whatever she might lose by an enforced defensive on the sea In seventeen fifty four Washington s first shot beyond the Alleghanies broke the hollow truce between the French and British colonies whose lines of expansion had once more inevitably crossed each other s path This proved to be the beginning of the last French and Indian War in American history of that British Conquest of Canada which formed part of what contemporary Englishmen called the Maritime War and of that great military struggle which continental Europe called the Seven Years War The year seventeen fifty five saw Braddock s Defeat in the west the battle of Lake George in the centre and two pregnant events in the east one on either side of Louisbourg the expulsion of the Acadians and the capture by Boscawen of two French men of war with several hundred soldiers who were to reinforce the army that was soon to be commanded by Montcalm The next year seventeen fifty six saw the formal declaration of war in Europe its continued prosecution in America and the taking of Oswego which was the first of Montcalm s four victories against the overwhelming British But Louisbourg still remained untouched Not till seventeen fifty seven was the first attempt made to break this last sea link with France There was a very natural anxiety among the British on both sides of the Atlantic to do conspicuously well against Louisbourg Fort Necessity Braddock s Defeat and Montcalm s daring capture of Oswego coming with cumulative effect in three successive campaigns had created a feeling of bitter disappointment in America while the Black Hole of Calcutta the loss of Minorca and worse still Byng s failure to bring a British fleet into decisive action had wounded the national pride in England But seventeen fifty seven turned out to be no better than its disconcerting predecessors True England s ally Frederick the Great won consummate victories at Rossbach and at Leuthen But that was at the end of a very desperate campaign True also that Clive won Plassey and took Chandernagore But those were far away from English speaking homes while heavy reverses close at hand brought down the adverse balance Pitt the greatest of all civilian ministers of War was dismissed from office and not reinstated till the British Empire had been without a cabinet for eleven weeks The French overran the whole of Hanover and rounded up the Duke of Cumberland at Kloster Seven Mordaunt and his pettifogging councils of war turned the joint expedition against Rochefort into a complete fiasco while Montcalm again defeated the British in America by taking Fort William Henry The taking of Louisbourg would have been a very welcome victory in the midst of so much gloom But the British were engaged in party strife at home They were disunited in America And neither the naval nor the military leader of the joint expedition against Louisbourg was the proper man to act either alone or with his colleague Speed was of prime importance Yet Admiral Holbourne did not sail from England for Halifax till May General the Earl of Loudoun was slower yet He drew in the troops from the northern frontier concentrated them in New York and laid an embargo on shipping to keep a secret which was already out Finally he and Sir Charles Hardy sailed for Halifax to keep their rendezvous with Holbourne from whom no news had come They arrived there before him but his fleet came limping in during the next ten days after a bad buffeting on its transatlantic voyage Loudoun now had nearly twelve thousand men whom he landed and drilled throughout July His preparations were so meticulously careful that they even included a vegetable garden which though an excellent precaution in its own way ought to have been left to the commandant of the base So thought Sir Charles Hay who was put under arrest for saying that all the money was being spent in fighting sham battles and planting out cabbages However a reconnaissance of Louisbourg had been made by Gorham of the Rangers whose very imperfect report induced Holbourne and Loudoun to get ready to sail But just as they were preparing to begin too late a Newfoundland vessel came in with captured French dispatches which showed that Admiral La Motte had united his three squadrons in Louisbourg harbour where he was at anchor with twenty two ships of the line and several frigates the whole carrying thirteen sixty guns This was correct But the garrison was exaggerated by at least a third in the same dispatch which estimated it as numbering over seven thousand men The lateness of the season the strength of the French and the practical certainty of failing to take Louisbourg by forcing the attack home at any cost were very sensibly held under existing circumstances to be sufficient cause for withdrawing the army The fleet however sailed north in the hope of inducing La Motte to come out for a battle in the open But at that particular juncture La Motte was right not to risk decisive action A week later he was equally wrong to refuse it Holbourne s fleet had been dispersed by a September hurricane of extraordinary violence One ship became a total wreck Nine were dismasted Several had to throw their guns overboard None was fit for immediate service But La Motte did not even reconnoitre much less annihilate his helpless enemy Pitt returned to power at the end of June seventeen fifty seven in time to plan a world wide campaign for seventeen fifty eight though not in time to choose the best commanders and to change the whole course of the war This became possible only in the Empire Year of seventeen fifty nine The English speaking peoples have nearly always begun their great wars badly and have gradually worked up to a climax of victory after being stung into proper leadership and organization by several exasperating failures and though now in the third year of their most momentous struggle for oversea dominion they were not even yet altogether prepared Nevertheless Pitt wielded the amphibious might of Britain with a master hand Sea power mercantile and naval enabled him to command the riches of the world and become the paymaster of many thousand Prussians under Frederick the Great and Ferdinand of Brunswick He also sent a small British army to the Continent But he devoted his chief attention to working out a phase of the Maritime War which included India on one flank and the Canadian frontiers on the other Sometimes with and sometimes without a contingent from the Army the British Navy checkmated isolated or defeated the French in Europe Asia Africa and America The preliminary isolation of Louisbourg was a particularly effective stroke of naval strategy Even before seventeen fifty eight began the first French fleet that left for Louisbourg had been shadowed from Toulon and had been shut up in Cartagena A second French fleet was then sent to help the first one out But it was attacked on the way and totally defeated In April the first fleet made another attempt to sail but it was chased into Rochefort by Hawke and put out of action for the rest of the campaign The third French fleet did manage to reach Louisbourg But its admiral du Chaffault rightly fearing annihilation in the harbour there and wishing to keep some touch between Old France and New sailed for Quebec with most of his best ships Quebec and the rest of Canada were themselves on the defensive for Abercromby was leading fifteen thousand men the largest single army America had ever seen straight up the line of Lake Champlain Montcalm defeated him at Ticonderoga in July But that gave no relief to Louisbourg because the total British forces threatening the Canadian inland frontier were still quite strong enough to keep the French on the strict defensive Thus Louisbourg was completely isolated both by land and sea It was stronger and more extensive than during the first siege It had a better governor Drucour a better and a larger garrison more food and ammunition and what it formerly lacked altogether the support of a considerable fleet Drucour was a gallant soldier His garrison numbered nearly three thousand effective regulars with about one thousand militiamen and some five hundred Indians Seventeen mortars and over two hundred cannon were mounted on the walls as well as on the outworks at the Royal Island and Lighthouse Batteries There were thirteen vessels in the fleet mounting five hundred ninety guns and carrying over three thousand five hundred men This made the French grand total about eight hundred guns and eight thousand men But not all these were really effective Ships at anchor lose a good deal of their fighting value Crews are less efficient when ashore than when they are afloat and the French ships were mostly fought at anchor while the crews were gradually landed for the defence of the crowded little town Then the Indians were comparatively useless in a fort The militia were not good soldiers anywhere Moreover the three kinds of regulars French Canadian and foreign did not get on very well together while the fleet as a whole got on no better with the army as a whole The British amphibious force presented a striking contrast to this Its naval and military parts worked together like the two branches of one United Service The Army and Navy naturally understood each other better than the two services of less amphibious countries and when a statesman like Pitt and a first lord of the Admiralty like Anson were together at headquarters there was no excuse for misunderstandings at the front Boscawen and Amherst both distinguished members of distinguished Service families were the best of colleagues Boscawen had somewhat over Amherst a little under twelve thousand men Boscawen s fleet comprised thirty nine sail from a ninety gun ship of the line down to a twelve gun sloop The British grand total therefore exceeded Drucour s by over three to one counting mere numbers alone If expert efficiency be taken for the sake of a more exact comparison it is not too much to say that the odds in favour of the British personnel and armament were really four to one On the other hand the French had the walls of Louisbourg to redress the balance in their favour These walls were the crucial factor in the problem Both sides knew they were far from being impregnable But how long could they withstand a regular siege If for only one month then they were useless as a protection to Quebec If for two months then Quebec and New France were safe until the following year Boscawen left England in February Amherst followed separately One of the three brigadier generals in Amherst s army was Wolfe of whom we shall hear more presently The rendezvous was Halifax where boat work and landing exercises were sedulously carried out by the troops Towards the end of May Boscawen sailed out of Halifax though Amherst had not yet arrived They met at sea The Dublin which had brought Amherst across so slowly then went very sickly into Halifax while Amherst joined Boscawen and the whole fleet and convoy bore away for Louisbourg The French had been expecting them for at least a month as scouts kept appearing almost every day while Hardy s squadron of nine sail had been maintaining a sort of open blockade On the night of June one the French look outs in Gabarus Bay saw more lights than usual to the southward Next morning Louisbourg was early astir anxiously eager to catch the first glimpse of this great destroying armada which for several expectant hours lay invisible and dread behind a curtain of dense fog Then a light sea breeze came in from the Atlantic The curtain drew back at its touch And there in one white enormous crescent all round the deep blue offing stood the mighty fleet closing in for the final death grip on its prey Nearly a whole week went by before the British landed Each day the scouting boats and vessels stood in as close as possible along the shore But they always found the smashing surf too high At last on the eighth the whole army put off in three brigades of boats supported by the frigates which fired at the French defences All three landing places were threatened simultaneously White Point Flat Point and Kennington Cove These landing places were respectively one two and four miles west of Louisbourg The intervening ground mostly hid them from the ramparts and they had to depend upon their own defences Drucour had sent out two thirds of his garrison to oppose the landing Each point was protected by artillery and entrenchments Eight guns were mounted and a thousand men stood guard over the quarter mile of beach which lay between the two little surf lashed promontories of Kennington Cove But Wolfe s brigade made straight for shore The French held their fire until the leading boats were well within short musket shot Then they began so furiously that Wolfe whose tall lank figure was most conspicuous as he stood up in the stern sheets waved his cane to make the boats sheer off It looked as if the first successful landing would have to be made elsewhere a bitter disappointment to this young and ardent brigadier whose command included the pick of the grenadiers light infantry and Highlanders But three boatloads of light infantry pushed on against the inner point of the cove Perhaps their officers turned their blind eye on Wolfe s signal as Nelson did on Parker s recall at Copenhagen But whatever the reason these three boats went in smash against the rocks and put their men ashore drenched to the skin Major Scott commanding the light infantry and rangers followed them at once Then Wolfe seeing they had gained a foothold where the point afforded them a little cover signalled the whole brigade to land there in succession He pushed his own boat through jumped in waist deep and waded ashore This sudden change quite unexpected by either friend or foe greatly disconcerted the French They attacked Major Scott who withstood them with a handful of men till reinforcements came clambering up the rocks behind him With these reinforcements came Wolfe who formed the men into line and carried the nearest battery with the bayonet The remaining French seeing that Wolfe had effected a lodgment on their inner flank were so afraid of being cut off from Louisbourg that they ran back and round towards the next position at Flat Point But before they reached it they saw its own defenders running back because the British were also landing at White Point Here too the defences were abandoned as soon as the little garrison found itself faced by greatly superior numbers afloat and deserted by its fellow garrisons ashore The retreating French kept up a sort of running fight till they got under the covering fire of Louisbourg when the pursuing British immediately drew off Considering the number of boats that were stove and the intensity of the first French fire the British loss was remarkably small only one hundred and nine killed wounded and drowned The French loss was still less but in view of the difference between the respective grand totals it was a good deal heavier in proportion That night the glare of a big fire inside the harbour showed that Drucour felt too weak to hold the Royal Battery Unlike his incompetent predecessor however he took away everything movable that could be turned to good account in Louisbourg and he left the works a useless ruin The following day he destroyed and abandoned the battery at Lighthouse Point Thus two fortifications were given up one of them for the second time before a single shot had been fired either from or against them Time labour and expense had all gone for worse than nothing as the positions were at once used by the enemy on each occasion The wasted expense was of the usual kind one half spent on inferior construction the other pocketed by the Louisbourg officials Drucour himself was not at all to blame either for the way the works were built or the way in which they had to be abandoned With odds of more than three to one against him he had no men to spare for trying to keep the British at arm s length Amherst pitched his camp in a crescent two miles long facing Louisbourg two miles off His left overlooked the French squadron in the south west harbour next to Louisbourg at the distance of a mile His right rested on Flat Point Thus Louisbourg itself was entirely surrounded both by land and sea for the gaps left at the Royal Battery and Lighthouse Point were immediately seized by the British Wolfe marched round the harbour on the twelfth with thirteen hundred infantry and a strong detachment of artillery The guns for the Royal Battery and other points inside the harbour were hauled into place by teams of about a hundred men each Those for Lighthouse Point were sent round by sea landed with immense difficulty more than a mile distant on the rock bound shore hauled up the cliff and then dragged back over the roughest of ground to the battery It was in fact a repetition of what the American militiamen had done in seventeen forty five Wolfe worked incessantly directing and encouraging his toiling men The bluejackets seconded his efforts by doing even harder work Their boats were often stove and a catamaran was wrecked with a brass twenty four pounder on board But nothing could stop the perfect company operation between the two halves of the single United Service The Admiral and General wrote Wolfe have carried on the public service with great harmony industry and union mister Boscawen has given all and even more than we could ask of him He has furnished arms and ammunition pioneers sappers miners gunners carpenters and boats While Wolfe was doing his eight days work of preparation at the Lighthouse Battery between the twelfth and the twentieth Amherst whose favourite precept was slow and sure was performing an even more arduous task by building a road from Flat Point to where he intended to make his trenches This road meandered over the least bad line that could be found in that country of alternate rock bog sand scrub bush and marshy ponds The working party was always a thousand strong and shifts of course were constant Boscawen landed marines to man the works along the shore and bluejackets for any handy man s job required This proved of great advantage to the army which had so many more men set free for other duties The landing of stores went on from sunrise to sunset whenever the pounding surf calmed down enough Landing the guns was of course much harder still It accounted for most of the hundred boats that were dashed to pieces against that devouring shore Thorough and persistent as this work was however it gave the garrison of Louisbourg little outward sign of what was happening just beyond the knolls and hillocks Besides just at this time when there was a lull before the storm that was soon to burst from Wolfe and Amherst both sides had more dramatic things to catch the general eye First there was the worthy namesake of the saucy Arethusa in the rival British Navy the Arethuse whose daring and skilful captain Vauquelin had moored her beside the Barachois or sea pond so that he could outflank Amherst s approach against the right land face of Louisbourg Then of still more immediate interest was the nimble little Echo which tried to run the gauntlet of the British fleet on June eighteen a day long afterwards made famous on the field of Waterloo Drucour had entrusted his wife and several other ladies to the captain of the Echo who was to make a dash for Quebec with dispatches for the governor of Canada A muffling fog shut down and seemed to promise her safety from the British though it brought added danger from that wrecking coast With infinite precautions she slipped out on the ebb between the French at the Island Battery and Wolfe s strenuous workers at the Lighthouse Point But the breeze that bore her north also raised the fog enough to let the Juno and Sutherland sight her and give chase She crowded on a press of sail till she was overhauled when she fought her captors till her case was hopeless Madame Drucour and the other ladies were then sent back to Louisbourg with every possible consideration for their feelings This act of kindness was remembered later on when a regular interlude of courtesies followed Drucour s offer to send his own particularly skilful surgeon to any wounded British officer who might need his services Amherst sent in several letters and messages from wounded Frenchmen and a special message from himself to Madame Drucour complimenting her upon her bravery and begging her acceptance of some West Indian pineapples Once more the flag of truce came out this time to return the compliment with a basket of wine As the gate swung to the cannon roared again on either side Amherst s was no unmerited compliment for Madame Drucour used to mount the ramparts every day no matter what the danger was and fire three cannon for the honour of her king But the French had no monopoly in woman s work True there were no officers wives to play the heroine on the British side But there were others to play a humbler part and play it well In those days each ship or regiment bore a certain proportion of women on their books for laundering and other work which is still done at their own option by women married on the strength of the Army Most of the several hundred women in the besieging fleet and army became so keen to see the batteries armed that they volunteered to team the guns which in some cases they actually did with excellent effect By June twenty six Louisbourg had no defences left beyond its own walls except the reduced French squadron huddled together in the south west harbour The more exposed ships had come down on the twenty first after a day s bombardment from Wolfe s terrific battery at Lighthouse Point they in return making an Infernall Fire from all their Broadsides but wonderfull to think of no harm done us Five days later every single gun in the Island Battery was dumb At the same time Amherst occupied Green Hill directly opposite the citadel and only half a mile away Yet Drucour with dauntless resolution resisted for another month His object was not to save his own doomed fortress but Quebec He needed all his resolution The British were pressing him on every side determined to end the siege in time to transfer their force elsewhere Louisbourg itself was visibly weakening The walls were already crumbling under Amherst s converging fire though the British attack had not yet begun in earnest Surely thoroughly and with an irresistible zeal the besiegers had built their road dragged up their guns and begun to worm their way forward under skilfully constructed cover towards the right land face of Louisbourg next to the south west harbour where the ground was less boggy than on the left The French ships fired on the British approaches but with one notable exception not effectively because some of them masked others while they were all under British fire themselves both from the Lighthouse and the Royal Batteries as well as from smaller batteries along the harbour Vauquelin who shares with Iberville the honour of being the naval hero of New France was the one exception He fought the Arethuse so splendidly that he hampered the British left attack long enough to give Louisbourg a comparative respite for a few hasty repairs But nothing could now resist Boscawen if the British should choose to run in past the demolished Island Battery and attack the French fleet first from a distance with the help of the Lighthouse and Royal Batteries and then hand to hand So the French admiral des Gouttes agreed to sink four of his largest vessels in the fairway This however still left a gap so two more were sunk The passage was then mistakenly reported to be safely closed The crews two thousand strong were landed and camped along the streets This caused outspoken annoyance to the army and to the inhabitants who thought the crews had not shown fight enough afloat who consequently thought them of little use ashore who found them in the way and who feared they had come in without bringing a proper contribution of provisions to the common stock The Arethuse was presently withdrawn from her perilous berth next to the British left approach as she was the only frigate left which seemed to have a chance of running the gauntlet of Boscawen s fleet Her shot holes were carefully stopped and on the night of July fourteen she was silently towed to the harbour mouth whence she sailed for France with dispatches from Drucour and des Gouttes The fog held dense but the wind was light and she could hardly forge ahead under every stitch of canvas All round her the lights of the British fleet and convoy rose and fell with the heaving rollers like little embers blurring through the mist Yet Vauquelin took his dark and silent way quite safely in and out between them and reached France just after Louisbourg had fallen Meanwhile Drucour had made several sorties against the British front while Boishebert had attacked their rear with a few hundred Indians Acadians and Canadians Boishebert s attack was simply brushed aside by the rearguard of Amherst s overwhelming force The American Rangers ought to have defeated it themselves without the aid of regulars But they were not the same sort of men as those who had besieged Louisbourg thirteen years before The best had volunteered then The worst had been enlisted now Of course there were a few good men with some turn for soldiering But most were of the wastrel and wharf rat kind Wolfe expressed his opinion of them in very vigorous terms About five hundred Rangers are come which to appearance are little better than la canaille These Americans are in general the dirtiest most contemptible cowardly dogs that you can conceive There is no depending upon em in action They fall down dead in their own dirt and desert by battalions officers and all Drucour s sorties made by good French regulars were much more serious than Boishebert s feeble irregular attack On the night of July eight while Montcalm s Ticonderogan heroes were resting on their hard won field a thousand miles inland Drucour s best troops crept out unseen and charged the British right Lord Dundonald and several of his men were killed while the rest were driven back to the second approach where desperate work was done with the bayonet in the dark But Wolfe commanded that part of the line and his supports were under arms in a moment The French attack had broken up into a score of little rough and tumble fights bayonets butts and swords all at it friend and foe mixed up in wild confusion So the first properly formed troops carried all before them The knots of struggling combatants separated into French and British The French fell back on their defences Their friends inside fired on the British and Wolfe having regained his ground retired in the same good order on his lines A week later Wolfe suddenly dashed forward on the British left and seized Gallows Hill within a musket shot of the French right bastion Here his men dug hard all night long in spite of the fierce fire kept up on them at point blank range In the morning reliefs marched in and the digging still continued Sappers miners and infantry reliefs they never stopped till they had burrowed forward another hundred yards and the last great breaching battery had opened its annihilating fire By the twenty first both sides saw that the end was near so far as the walls were concerned But it was not only the walls that were failing For that very afternoon of the twenty first a British seaman gunner s cleverly planted bomb found out a French ship s magazine exploded it with shattering force and set fire to the ships on either side All three blazed furiously The crews ran to quarters and did their best But all to no purpose Meanwhile the British batteries had turned every available gun on the conflagration so as to prevent the French from saving anything Between the roaring flames the bursting shells and the whizzing cannon balls the three doomed vessels soon became an inferno too hot for men to stay in The crews swarmed over the side and escaped not however without losing a good many of their number Then the British concentrated on the only two remaining vessels the Prudent and the Bienfaisant But the French sailors with admirable pluck and judgment managed to haul them round to a safer berth Next day a similar disaster befell the Louisbourg headquarters A shell went through the roof of the barracks at the King s Bastion burst among the men there and set the whole place on fire As the first tongues of flame shot up the British concentrated on them The French ran to the threatened spot and worked hard in spite of the storm of British shot and shell But nothing was saved except Drucour s own quarters During the confusion the wind blew some burning debris against the timbers which protected the nearest casemates from exploding shells An alarm was raised among the women and children inside A panic followed and the civilians of both sexes had their nerves so shaken that they thought of nothing but surrender on the spot Hardly had this excitement been allayed when the main barracks themselves caught fire Fortunately they had been cleared when the other fire had shown how imminent the danger was to every structure along the walls The barracks were in special danger of fire for they had been left with the same wooden roof which the New Englanders had put on thirteen years before Again the British guns converged their devastating fire on the point of danger and the whole place was burned to the ground Most of the troops were now deprived of all shelter They had no choice but to share the streets with a still larger number of sailors than those to whom they had formerly objected Yet they had scarcely tried to settle down and make the best of it before another batch of sailors came crowding in from the last of the whole French fleet At one o clock in the morning of July twenty five a rousing British cheer from the harbour had announced an attack on the Prudent and the Bienfaisant by six hundred bluejackets who had stolen in with muffled oars just on the stroke of midnight Presently the sound of fighting died away and all was still At first the nearest gunners on the walls had lost their heads and begun blazing away at random But they were soon stopped and neither side dared fire not knowing whom the shots might kill Then as the escaping French came in to the walls a bright glare told that the Prudent was on fire She had cut her cable during the fight and was lying hopelessly stranded right under the inner walls of Louisbourg The Bienfaisant however though now assailed by every gun the French could bring to bear was towed off to a snug berth beside the Lighthouse Battery the British bluejackets showing the same disregard of danger as their gallant enemies had shown on the twenty first when towing her to safety in the opposite direction At daylight Drucour made a thorough inspection of the walls while the only four serviceable cannon left fired slowly on as if for the funeral of Louisbourg The British looked stronger than ever and so close in that their sharpshooters could pick off the French gunners from the foot of the glacis The best of the French diarists made this despairing entry Not a house in the whole place but has felt the force of their cannonade Between yesterday morning and seven o clock to night from a thousand to twelve hundred shells have fallen inside the town while at least forty cannon have been firing incessantly as well The surgeons have to run at many a cry of Ware Shell for fear lest they should share the patients fate Amherst had offered to spare the island or any one of the French ships if Drucour would put his hospital in either place But for some unexplained reason Drucour declined the offer though Amherst pointed out that no spot within so small a target as Louisbourg itself could possibly be made immune by any gunners in the world Reduced to the last extremity the French council of war decided to ask for terms Boscawen and Amherst replied that the whole garrison must surrender in an hour Drucour sent back to beg for better terms But the second British answer was even sterner complete surrender yes or no in half an hour Resentment still ran high against the French for the massacre at Fort William Henry the year before The actual massacre had been the work of drunken Indians The Canadians present had looked on The French headed by Montcalm had risked their lives to save the prisoners But such distinctions had been blotted out in the general rage among the British on both sides of the Atlantic and so Louisbourg was now made the scapegoat Drucour at once wrote back to say that he stood by his first proposal which meant of course that he was ready to face the storming of his works and no quarter for his garrison His flag of truce started off with this defiance But Prevost the intendant with other civilians now came forward on behalf of the inhabitants to beg for immediate surrender on any terms rather than that they should all be exposed to the perils of assault Drucour then gave way and sent an officer running after the defiant flag of truce As soon as this second messenger got outside the walls he called out at the top of his voice We accept We accept He then caught up to the bearer of the flag of truce when both went straight on to British headquarters Boscawen and Amherst were quite prepared for either surrender or assault The storming parties had their scaling ladders ready The Forlorn Hopes had been told off to lead the different columns Every gun was loaded afloat and ashore The fleet were waiting for the signal to file in and turn a thousand cannon against the walls Nothing was lacking for complete success On the other hand their terms were also ready waiting The garrison was to be sent to England as prisoners of war The whole of Louisbourg Cape Breton and Isle saint Jean now Prince Edward Island were to be surrendered immediately with all the public property they contained The West Gate was to be handed over to a British guard at eight the next morning and the French arms were to be laid down for good at noon With this document the British commanders sent in the following note SIR We have the honour to send Your Excellency the signed articles of Capitulation Lieutenant Colonel d Anthony has spoken on behalf of the people in the town We have no intention of molesting them but shall give them all the protection in our power Your Excellency will kindly sign the duplicate of the terms and send it back to us It only remains for us to assure Your Excellency that we shall seize every opportunity of convincing you that we are with the most perfect consideration Your Excellency s most Obedient Servants E BOSCAWEN J AMHERST No terms were offered either to the Indians or to the armed Canadians on account of Fort William Henry and it is certain that all these would have been put to the sword to the very last man had Drucour decided to stand an assault To the relief of every one concerned the Indians paddled off quietly during the night which luckily happened to be unusually dark and calm The Canadians either followed them or mingled with the unarmed inhabitants This awkward problem therefore solved itself Few went to bed that last French night in Louisbourg All responsible officials were busy with duties reports and general superintendence The townsfolk and soldiery were restless and inclined to drown their humiliation in the many little cabarets which stood open all night A very different place the parish church was also kept open and for a very different purpose Many hasty marriages were performed partly from a wholly groundless fear of British licence and partly because those who wished to remain in Cape Breton thought they would not be allowed to do so unless they were married Precisely at eight the next morning Major Farquhar drew up his grenadiers in front of the West Gate which was immediately surrendered to him No one but the officers concerned witnessed this first ceremony But the whole population thronged every point of vantage round the Esplanade to see the formal surrender at noon All the British admirals and generals were present on parade as Drucour stepped forward saluted and handed his sword to Boscawen His officers followed his example Then the troops laid down their arms in the ranks as they stood many dashing down their muskets with a muttered curse The French naval military and civilian were soon embarked The curse of Louisbourg followed most of them in one form or another The combatants were coldly received when they eventually returned to France in spite of their gallant defence and in spite of their having saved Quebec for that campaign Several hundreds of the inhabitants were shipwrecked and drowned One transport was abandoned off the coast of Prince Edward Island with the loss of two hundred lives Another sprang a leak as she was nearing England whereupon to their eternal dishonour the crew of British merchant seamen took all the boats and started to pull off alone The three hundred French prisoners men women and children crowded the ship s side and begged that if they were themselves to be abandoned their priest should be saved A boat reluctantly put back for him Then leaving the ship to her fate the crew pulled for Penzance where the people had just been celebrating the glorious victory of Louisbourg The French loss had been enough without this About one in five of all the combatants had been hit Twice as many were on the sick list Officers and men officials and traders fishermen and other inhabitants all lost something in certain cases everything they had and it was to nothing but the sheer ruin of all French power beside the American Atlantic that Madame Drucour waved her long white scarf in a last farewell France was stung to the quick Her sea link gone she feared that the whole of Canada would soon be won by the same relentless British sea power which was quite as irresistible as it was ubiquitous in the mighty hands of Pitt So deeply did her statesmen feel her imminent danger on the sea and resent this particular British triumph in the world wide Maritime War that they took the unusual course of sending the following circular letter to all the Powers of Europe We are advised that Louisbourg capitulated to the English on July twenty six We fully realize the consequences of such a grave event But we shall redouble our efforts to repair the misfortune All commercial nations ought now to open their eyes to their own interests and join us in preventing the absolute tyranny which England will soon exercise on every sea if a stop be not put to her boundless avarice and ambition For a century past the Powers of Europe have been crying out against France for disturbing the balance of power on the Continent But while England was artfully fomenting this trouble she was herself engaged in upsetting that balance of power at sea without which these different nations independent power on land cannot subsist All governments ought to give their immediate and most serious attention to this subject as the English now threaten to usurp the whole world s seaborne commerce for themselves While the French were taken up with unavailing protests and regrets the British were rejoicing with their whole heart Their loss had been small Only a twentieth of their naval and military total had been killed or wounded or had died from sickness during the seven weeks siege Their gain had been great The one real fortress in America the last sea link between Old France and New the single sword held over their transatlantic shipping was now unchallengeably theirs The good news travelled fast Within three weeks of the surrender the dispatches had reached England Defeats disasters and exasperating fiascos had been common since the war began But at last there was a genuine victory British through and through won by the Army and Navy together and won over the greatest of all rivals France When we lost Minorca said the London Chronicle just a month after the surrender a general panic fell upon the nation but now that Louisbourg is taken our streets echo with triumph and blaze with illuminations Loyal addresses poured in from every quarter The king stood on the palace steps to receive the eleven captured colours and then attended by the whole court went in state to the royal thanksgiving service held in saint Paul s Cathedral The thanks of parliament were voted to Amherst and Boscawen Boscawen received them in person being a member of the House of Commons The speaker read the address which was couched in the usual verbiage worked up by one of the select committees employed on such occasions But Boscawen replied as men of action should with fewer words and much more force and point mister Speaker Sir I am happy to have been able to do my duty I have no words to express my sense of the distinguished reward that has been conferred upon me by this House nor can I thank you Sir enough for the polite and elegant manner in which you have been pleased to convey its resolution to me The American colonists in general rejoiced exceedingly that Louisbourg and all it meant had been exterminated But especially in New England their joy was considerably tempered by the reflection that the final blow had been delivered without their aid and that the British arms had met with a terrible reverse at Ticonderoga where the American militia had outnumbered the old country regulars by half as much again Nevertheless Boston built a stately bonfire which made a lofty and prodigious blaze while Philadelphia despite its parasitic Quakers had a most elaborate display of fireworks representing England Louisbourg the siege the capture the triumph and reflected glory generally At the inland front near Lake Champlain where Abercromby now went by the opprobrious nickname of missus Nabbycrumby The General put out orders that the breastwork should be lined with troops and to fire three rounds for joy and give thanks to God in a Religious Way But the joy was more whole hearted among the little half forgotten garrisons of Nova Scotia At Annapolis no news arrived till well on in September when a Boston sloop came sailing up the bay Captain Knox that most industrious of diarists records the incident Every soul was impatient yet shy of asking At length I called out What news from Louisbourg To which the master simply replied and with some gravity Nothing strange This threw us all into great consternation and some of us even turned away But one of our soldiers called out with some warmth Damn you Pumpkin isn t Louisbourg taken yet The poor New England man then answered Taken yes above a month ago and I have been there since but if you haven t heard of it before I have a good parcel of letters for you now Instantly all hats flew off and we made the neighbouring woods resound with our cheers for almost half an hour Halifax naturally heard the news sooner than other places and being then as now a naval port and a garrison town it gave full vent to its feelings Bells pealed Bonfires blazed Salutes thundered from the fort and harbour But all this was a mere preliminary canter The real race came off when the victorious fleet and army returned in triumph Land and water were then indeed alive with exultant crowds The streets were like a fair and a noisy one at that Soldiers sailors and civilians drank standing toasts the whole night through The commissioner of excise recorded not without a touch of proper pride that quite apart from all illicit wines and spirits no less than sixty thousand gallons of good Jamaica rum were drunk in honour of the fall of Louisbourg In higher circles where wine was commoner than spirits the toasts were honoured just as often Governor Lawrence fresh from Louisbourg himself opened the new Government House with a grand ball and Wolfe whom all now thought the coming man drank healths sang songs and danced with pretty partners to his heart s content CHAPTER V ANNIHILATION seventeen sixty The new garrison of Louisbourg hated it as thoroughly as any of their predecessors French or British They repaired the breaches in a temporary way and ran up shelters for the winter Interest revived with the spring for Wolfe was coming back again this time to command an army of his own and take Quebec The great absorbing question was Who s for the front and who for the base Both fleet and army made their rendezvous at Louisbourg a larger fleet and a smaller army than those of the year before Two new toasts were going the rounds of the Service Here s to the eye of a Hawke and the heart of a Wolfe and Here s to British colours on every French fort port and garrison in America Of course they were standing toasts The men who drank them already felt the presage of Pitt s great Empire Year of seventeen fifty nine The last two weeks in May and the first in June were full of glamour in crowded stirring Louisbourg There was Wolfe s picked army of nine thousand men with Saunders s mighty fleet of fifty men of war mounting two thousand guns comprising a quarter of the whole Royal Navy and convoying more than two hundred transports and provision ships all coming and going landing embarking drilling dividing massing every one expectant of glorious results and eager to begin Who wouldn t be for the front at the climax of a war like this Then came the final orders issued in Louisbourg first June seventeen fifty nine The Troops land no more The flat bottomed boats to be hoisted in that the ships may be ready to sail at the first signal second June seventeen fifty nine The Admiral purposes sailing the first fair wind On the fourth a hundred and forty one sail weighed anchor together All that day and the next they were assembling outside and making for the island of Scatari just beyond the point of Cape Breton which is only ten miles north of Louisbourg By noon on the sixth the last speck of white had melted away from the Louisbourg horizon and the men for the front were definitely parted from those left behind at the base Great things were dared and done at the front that year in Europe Asia and America But nothing was done at dull little Louisbourg except the wearisome routine of a disgustingly safe base Rocks bogs fogs sand and scrubby bush ashore Tantalizing news from the stirring outside world afloat So the long blank summer days wore through The second winter proved a little more comfortable than the first had been But there was less far less for the garrison to expect in the spring In February seventeen sixty the death warrant of Louisbourg was signed in London by Pitt and King George II In the following summer it was executed by Captain John Byron R N the poet s grandfather Sailors sappers and miners worked for months together laying the pride of Louisbourg level with the dust That they carried out their orders with grim determination any one can see to day by visiting the grave in which they buried so many French ambitions All the rest of Ile Royale lost its French life in the same supreme catastrophe the little forts and trading posts the fishing villages and hamlets even the farms along the Mira which once were thought so like the promise of a second French Acadia Nothing remains of that dead past anywhere inland except a few gnarled weather beaten stumps of carefully transplanted plum and apple trees with here and there a straggling little patch of pale forlorn narcissus now soothing the alien air in vain round shapeless ruins as absolute and lone as those of Louisbourg itself BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE There is no complete naval and military history of Louisbourg in either French or English The first siege is a prominent feature in all histories of Canada New England and the United States though it is not much noticed in works written in the mother country The second siege is noticed everywhere The beginning and end of the story is generally ignored and the naval side is always inadequately treated Parkman gives a good account of the first siege in A Half Century of Conflict and a less good account of the second in Montcalm and Wolfe Kingsford s accounts are in volumes iii and iv of the History of Canada Sir John Bourinot a native of the island wrote a most painstaking work on Cape Breton and its Memorials of the French Regime which was first published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for eighteen ninety one Garneau and other French Canadian historians naturally emphasize a different set of facts and explanations An astonishingly outspoken account of the first siege is given in the anonymous Lettre d un Habitant de Louisbourg which has been edited with a translation by Professor Wrong The gist of many accounts is to be found unpretentiously put together in The Last Siege of Louisbourg by C O Macdonald New England produced many contemporary and subsequent accounts of the first siege and all books concerned with the Conquest give accounts of the second Those who wish to go straight to original sources will find useful bibliographies in the notes to Parkman s and Bourinot s books as well as in Justin Winsor s Narrative and Critical History of America But none of these includes some important items to be found either in or through the Dominion Archives at Ottawa the Public Records Office in London and the Archives de la Marine in Paris End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Great Fortress by
