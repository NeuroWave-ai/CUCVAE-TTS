none	none	one of the weirdest cases on my hands that I have ever been mixed up in and I think that you ll forgive me for calling you when I tell you about it doctor Bird groaned into the telephone transmitter I took a vacation last summer or tried to and you hauled me away from the best fishing I have found in years to help you on a case This year I traveled all the way from Washington to San Francisco to get away from you and the very day that I get here you are after me I won t have anything to do with it Where are you anyway I am at Fallon Nevada Doctor I m sorry that you won t help me out because the case promises to be unusually interesting Let me at least tell you about it doctor Bird groaned louder than ever into the telephone transmitter All right go ahead and tell me about it if it will relieve your mind but I have given you my final answer I am not a bit interested in it That is quite all right Doctor I don t expect you to touch it I hope however that you will be able to give me an idea of where to start Did you ever see a man s body broken in pieces Do you mean badly smashed up No indeed I mean just what I said broken in pieces Legs snapped off as though the entire flesh had become brittle No I didn t and neither did anyone else I have seen it Doctor Hooey What had you been drinking Operative Carnes of the United States Secret Service chuckled softly to himself The voice of the famous scientist of the Bureau of Standards plainly showed an interest which was quite at variance with his words I was quite sober Doctor and so was Hughes and we both saw it Who is Hughes He is an air mail pilot one of the crack fliers of the Transcontinental Airmail Corporation Let me tell you the whole thing in order All right I have a few minutes to spare but I ll warn you again that I don t intend to touch the case Suit yourself Doctor I have no authority to requisition your services As you know the T A C has been handling a great deal of the transcontinental air mail with a pretty clean record on accidents The day before yesterday a special plane left Washington to carry two packages from there to San Francisco One of them was a shipment of jewels valued at a quarter of a million consigned to a San Francisco firm and the other was a sealed packet from the War Department No one was supposed to know the contents of that packet except the Chief of Staff who delivered it to the plane personally but rumors got out as usual and it was popularly supposed to contain certain essential features of the Army s war plans This much is certain The plane carried not only the regular T A C pilot and courier but also an army courier and it was guarded during the trip by an army plane armed with small bombs and a machine gun I rode in it My orders were simply to guard the ship until it landed at Mills Field and then to guard the courier from there to the Presidio of San Francisco until his packet was delivered personally into the hands of the Commanding General of the Ninth Corps Area The trip was quiet and monotonous until after we left Salt Lake City at dawn this morning Nothing happened until we were about a hundred miles east of Reno We had taken elevation to cross the Stillwater Mountains and were skimming low over them my plane trailing the T A C plane by about half a mile I was not paying any particular attention to the other ship when I suddenly felt our plane leap ahead It was a fast Douglas and the pilot gave it the gun and made it move I can tell you I yelled into the speaking tube and asked what was the reason My pilot yelled back that the plane ahead was in trouble As soon as it was called to my attention I could see myself that it wasn t acting normally It was losing elevation and was pursuing a very erratic course Before we could reach it it lost flying speed and fell into a spinning nose dive and headed for the ground I watched expecting every minute to see the crew make parachute jumps but they didn t and the plane hit the ground with a terrific crash It caught fire of course No Doctor that is one of the funny things about the accident It didn t It hit the ground in an open place free from brush and literally burst into pieces but it didn t flame up We headed directly for the scene of the crash and we encountered another funny thing We almost froze to death

none	none	Exactly what I say Of course it s pretty cold at that altitude all the time but this cold was like nothing I had ever encountered It seemed to freeze the blood in our veins and it congealed frost on the windshields and made the motor miss for a moment It was only momentary and it only existed directly over the wrecked plane We went past it and swung around in a circle and came back over the wreck but we didn t feel the cold again The next thing we tried to do was to find a landing place That country is pretty rugged and rough and there wasn t a flat place for miles that was large enough to land a ship on Hughes and I talked it over and there didn t seem to be much of anything that we could do except to go on until we found a landing place I had had no experience in parachute jumping and I couldn t pilot the plane if Hughes jumped We swooped down over the wreck as close as we dared and that was when we saw the condition of the bodies The whole plane was cracked up pretty badly but the weird part of it was the fact that the bodies of the crew had broken into pieces as though they had been made of glass Arms and legs were detached from the torsos and lying at a distance There was no sign of blood on the ground We saw all this with our naked eyes from close at hand and verified it by observations through binoculars from a greater height When we had made our observations and marked the location of the wreck as closely as we could we headed east until we found a landing place near Fallon Hughes dropped me here and went on to Reno or to San Francisco if necessary to report the accident and get more planes to aid in the search I was wholly at sea but it seemed to be in your line and as I knew that you were at the saint Francis I called you up What are your plans I made none until I talked with you The country where the wreck occurred is unbelievably wild and we can t get near it with any transportation other than burros The only thing that I can see to do is to gather together what transportation I can and head for the wreck on foot to rescue the packets and to bring out the bodies Can you suggest anything better When do you expect to start As soon as I can get my pack train together Possibly in three or four hours Carnes are you sure that those bodies were broken into bits An arm or a leg might easily be torn off in a complete crash They were smashed into bits as nearly as I could tell Doctor Hughes is an old flier and he has seen plenty of crashes but he never saw anything 
8088_284756_000079_000004	train-clean-100	like this 
none	none	It beats anything that I ever saw If your observations were accurate there could be only one cause and that one is a patent impossibility I haven t a bit of equipment here but I expect that I can get most of the stuff I want from the University of California across the bay at Berkeley I can get a plane at Crissy Field I ll tell you what to do Carnes Get your burro train together and start as soon as you can but leave me half a dozen burros and a guide at Fallon I ll get up there as soon as I can and I ll try to overtake you before you get to the wreck If I don t don t disturb anything any more than you can help until my arrival Do you

none	none	I thought that you were on your vacation Doctor Oh shut up Like most of my vacations this one will have to be postponed I ll move as swiftly as I can and I ought to be at Fallon to night if I m lucky and don t run into any obstacles Burros are fairly slow but I ll make the best time possible I rather expected you would Doctor I can t get my pack train together until evening so I ll wait for you right here I m mighty glad that you are going to get in on it Silently Carnes and doctor Bird surveyed the wreck of the T A C plane The observations of the secret service operative had been correct The bodies of the unfortunate crew had been broken into fragments Their limbs had not been twisted off as a freak of the fall but had been cleanly broken off as though the bodies had suddenly become brittle and had shattered on their impact with the ground Not only the bodies but the ship itself had been broken up Even the clothing of the men was in pieces or had long splits in the fabric whose edges were as clean as though they had been cut with a knife doctor Bird picked up an arm which had belonged to the pilot and examined it The brittleness if it had ever existed was gone and the arm was limp No rigor mortis commented the Doctor How long ago was the wreck About seventy two hours ago Hm m What about those packets that were on the plane Carnes stepped forward and gingerly inspected first the body of the army courier and then that of the courier of the T A C Both gone Doctor he reported straightening up doctor Bird s face fell into grim lines There is more to this case than appears on the surface Carnes he said This was no ordinary wreck Bring up that third burro I want to examine these fragments a little Bill he went on to one of the two guides who had accompanied them from Fallon you and Walter scout around the ground and see what you can find out I especially wish to know whether anyone has visited the scene of the wreck The guides consulted a moment and started out Carnes drove up the burro the Doctor had indicated and doctor Bird unpacked it He opened a mahogony case and took from it a high powered microscope Setting the instrument up on a convenient rock he subjected portions of the wreck including several fragments of flesh to a careful scrutiny When he had completed his observations he fell into a brown study from which he was aroused by Carnes What did you find out about the cause of the wreck Doctor
8088_284756_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t know 
none	none	what to think The immediate cause was that everything was frozen The plane ran into a belt of cold which froze up the motor and which probably killed the crew instantly It was undoubtedly the aftermath of that cold which you felt when you swooped down over the wreck It seems impossible that it could have suddenly got cold enough to freeze everything up like that It does and yet I am confident that that is what happened It was no ordinary cold Carnes it was cold of the type that infests interstellar space cold beyond any conception you have of cold cold near the range of the absolute zero of temperature nearly four hundred and fifty degrees below zero on the Fahrenheit scale At such temperatures things which are ordinarily quite flexible and elastic such as rubber or flesh become as brittle as glass and would break in the manner which these bodies have broken An examination of the tissues of the flesh shows that it has been submitted to some temperature that is very low in the scale probably below that of liquid air Such a temperature would produce instant death and the other phenomena which we can observe What could cause such a low temperature Doctor I don t know yet although I hope to find out before we are finished Cold is a funny thing Carnes Ordinarily it is considered as simply the absence of heat and yet I have always held it to be a definite negative quantity All through nature we observe that every force has its opposite or negative force to oppose it We have positive and negative electrical charges positive and negative or north and south magnetic poles We have gravity and its opposite apergy and I believe cold is really negative heat I never heard of anything like that Doctor I always thought that things were cold because heat was taken from them not because cold was added It sounds preposterous Such is the common idea and yet I cannot accept it for it does not explain all the recorded phenomena You are familiar with a searchlight are you not In a general way yes A searchlight is merely a source of light and of course of heat which is placed at the focus of a parabolic reflector so that all of the rays emanating from the source travel in parallel lines A searchlight of course gives off heat If we place a lens of the same size as the searchlight aperture in the path of the beam and concentrate all the light and heat at one spot the focal point of the lens the temperature at that point is the same as the temperature of the source of the light less what has been lost by radiation You understand that do you not Certainly Suppose that we place at the center of the aperture of the searchlight a small opaque disc which is permeable neither to heat nor light in such a manner as to interrupt the central portion of the beam As a result the beam will go out in the form of a hollow rod or pipe of heat and light with a dark cold core This core will have the temperature of the surrounding air plus the small amount which has radiated into it from the surrounding pipe If we now pass this beam of light through a lens in order to concentrate the beam both the pipe of heat and the cold core will focus If we place a temperature measuring device near the focus of the dark core we will find that the temperature is lower than the surrounding air This means that we have focused or concentrated cold That sounds impossible But I can offer no other criticism Nevertheless it is experimentally true It is one of the facts which lead me to consider cold as negative heat However this is true of cold as it is of the other negative forces they exist and manifest themselves only in the presence of the positive forces No one has yet concentrated cold except in the presence of heat as I have outlined How this cold belt which the T A C plane encountered came to be there is another question The thing which we have to determine is whether it was caused by natural or artificial forces Both of the packets which the plane carried are gone Doctor observed Carnes Yes and that seems to add weight to the possibility that the cause was artificial but it is far from conclusive The packets might not have been on the men when the plane fell or someone may have passed later and taken them for safekeeping The doctor s remarks were interrupted by the guides Someone has been here since the wreck Doctor said Bill Walter and I found tracks where two men came up here and prowled around for some time and then left by the way they came They went off toward the northwest and we followed their trail for about forty rods and then lost it We weren t able to pick it up again Thanks Bill replied the doctor Well Carnes that seems to add more weight to the theory that the spot of cold was made and didn t just happen If a prospecting party had just happened along they would either have left the wreck alone or would have made some attempt to inter the bodies That cold belt must have been produced artificially by men who planned to rob this plane after bringing it down and who were near at hand to get their plunder Is there any chance of following that trail I doubt it Doc Walter and I scouted around quite a little but we couldn t pick it up again Is there any power line passing within twenty miles of here None that Walter and I know of Doc Funny Such a device as must have been used would need power and lots of it for operation Well I ll try my luck Carnes help me unpack and set up the rest of my apparatus With the aid of the operative doctor Bird unpacked two of the burros and extracted from cases where they were carefully packed and padded some elaborate electrical and optical apparatus The first was a short telescope of large diameter which he mounted on a base in such a manner that it could be elevated or depressed and rotated in any direction At the focal point of the telescope was fastened a small knot of wire from which one lead ran to the main piece of apparatus which he sat on a flat rock The other lead from the wire knot ran into a sealed container surrounded by a water bath under which a spirit lamp burned From the container another lead led to the main apparatus This main piece consisted of a series of wire coils mounted on a frame and attached to the two leads The doctor took from a padded case a tiny magnet suspended on a piece of wire of exceedingly small diameter which he fastened in place inside the coils Cemented to the magnet was a tiny mirror What is that apparatus asked Carnes as the doctor finished his set up and surveyed it with satisfaction Merely a thermocouple attached to a D Arsonval galvanometer replied the doctor This large squat telescope catches and concentrates on the thermocouple and the galvanometer registers the temperature You re out of my depth What is a thermocouple A juncture of two wires made of dissimilar metals in this case of platinum and of platinum iridium alloy There is another similar junction in this case which is kept at a constant temperature by the water bath When the temperatures of the two junctions are the same the system is in equilibrium When they are at different temperatures an electrical potential is set up which causes a current to flow from one to the other through the galvanometer The galvanometer consists of a magnet set up inside coils through which the current I spoke of flows This current causes the magnet to rotate and by watching the mirror the rotation can be detected and measured This device is one of the most sensitive ever made and is used to measure the radiation from distant stars Currents as small as one ampere have been detected and measured This particular instrument is not that sensitive to begin with and has its sensitivity further reduced by having a high resistance in one of the leads What are you going to use it for I am going to try to locate somewhere in these hills a patch of local cold It may not work but I have hopes If you will manipulate the telescope so as to search the hills around here I will watch the galvanometer For several minutes Carnes swung the telescope around Twice doctor Bird stopped him and decreased the sensitiveness of his instrument by introducing more resistance in the lines in order to keep the magnet from twisting clear around due to the fluctuations in the heats received on account of the varying conditions of reflection As Carnes swung the telescope again the magnet swung around sharply nearly to a right angle to its former position Stop cried the doctor Read your azimuth Carnes read the compass bearing on the protractor attached to the frame which supported the telescope doctor Bird took a pair of binoculars and looked long and earnestly in the indicated direction With a sigh he laid down the glasses I can t see a thing Carnesy he said We ll have to move over to the next crest and make a new set up Plant a rod on the hill so that we can get an azimuth bearing and get the airline distance with a range finder On the hilltop which doctor Bird had pointed out the apparatus was again set up For several minutes Carnes swept the hills before an exclamation from the doctor told him to pause He read the new azimuth and the doctor laid off the two readings on a sheet of paper with a protractor and made a few calculations I don t know he said reflectively when he had finished his computations This darned instrument is still so sensitive that you may have merely focused on a deep shadow or a cold spring or something of that sort but the magnet kicked clear around and it may mean that we have located what we are looking for It should be about two miles away and almost due west of here There is no spring that I know of Doc and I think I know of every water hole in this country remarked Bill There could hardly be a spring at this elevation anyway replied the doctor Maybe it is what we are seeking We ll start out in that direction anyway Bill you had better take the lead for you know the country Spread out a little so that we won t be too bunched if anything happens For three quarters of an hour the little group of men made their way through the wilderness in the direction indicated by the doctor Presently Bill who was in the lead held up his hand with a warning gesture The other three closed up as rapidly as cautious progress would allow What is it Bill asked the doctor in an undertone Slip up ahead and look over that crest The doctor obeyed instructions As he glanced over he gave vent to a low whistle of surprise and motioned for Carnes to join him The operative crawled up and glanced over the crest In a hollow before them was a crude one storied house and erected on an open space before it was a massive piece of apparatus It consisted of a number of huge metallic cylinders from which lines ran to a silvery concave mirror mounted on an elaborate frame which would allow it to be rotated so as to point in any direction What is it whispered Carnes Some kind of a projector muttered the doctor I never saw one quite like it but it is meant to project something I can t make out the curve of that mirror It isn t a parabola and it isn t an ellipse It must be a high degree subcatenary or else built on a transcendental function He raised himself to get a clearer view and as he did so a puff of smoke came from the house to be followed in a moment by a sharp crack as a bullet flattened itself a few inches from his head The doctor tumbled back over the crest out of sight of the house Bill and Walter hurried forward their rifles held ready for action Get out on the flanks men directed the doctor The man we want is in a house in that hollow He s armed and he means business Bill and Walter crawled under the shelter of the rocks to a short distance away and then rifles ready advanced to the attack A report came from the hollow and a bullet whined over Bill s head Almost instantly a crack came from Walter s rifle and splinters flew from the building in the hollow a few inches from a loophole through which projected the barrel of a rifle The rifle barrel swung rapidly in a circle and barked in Walter s direction but as it did so Bill s gun spoke and again splinters flew from the building Good work ejaculated doctor Bird as he watched the slow advance of the two guides If we just had rifles we could join in the party but it s a little far for effective pistol work Let s go ahead and we may get close enough to do a little shooting Pistols in hand Carnes and the doctor crawled over the crest and joined the advance Again and again the rifle spoke from the hollow and was answered by the vicious barks of the rifles in the hands of the guides Carnes and the doctor resting their pistols on rocks and sending an occasional bullet toward the loophole The conditions of light and the moving target were not conducive to good marksmanship on the part of the besieged man and none of the attackers were hit Presently Walter succeeded in sending a bullet through the loophole The rifle barrel suddenly disappeared With a shout the four men rose from their cover and advanced toward the building at a run As they did so an ominous whirring sound came from the apparatus in front of the house and a sudden chill filled the air Back shouted doctor Bird Back below the hill if you value your lives He turned and raced at full speed toward the sheltering crest of the hill the others following him closely The whirring sound continued and the concave reflector turned with a grating sound on its gears As the path of its rays struck the ground the rocks became white with frost and one rock split with a sharp report one fragment rolling down the slope carrying others in its trail With panic stricken faces the four men raced toward the sheltering crest but remorselessly the reflector swung around in their direction The intense cold numbed the racing men cutting off their breath and impeding their efforts for speed Stop cried the doctor suddenly Fire at that reflector It s our only chance He set the example by turning and emptying his pistol futilely at the turning mirror Bill Walter and Carnes followed his example Nearer and nearer to them came the deadly ray Bill was the nearest to its path and he suddenly stiffened and fell forward his useless gun still grasped in his hands As his body struck the ground it rolled down hill for a few feet the deadly ray following it His head struck a rock and Carnes gave a cry of horror as it broke into fragments Walter threw his rifle to his shoulder and fired again and again at the rotating disc The cold had became intense and he could not control the actions of his muscles and his rifle wavered about He threw himself flat on the ground and with an almost superhuman effort steadied himself for a moment and fired His aim was true and with a terrific crash the reflector split into a thousand fragments doctor Bird staggered to his feet It s out of order for a moment he cried To the house while we can As swiftly as his numbed feet would allow him he stumbled toward the house The muzzle of the rifle again projected from the loophole and with its crack the doctor staggered for a moment and then fell Walter s rifle spoke again and the rifle disappeared through the loophole with a spasmodic jerk Carnes stumbled over the doctor Are you hit badly he gasped through chattering teeth I m not hit at all muttered the doctor I stumbled and fell just as he fired Look out He s going to shoot again The rifle barrel came slowly into view through the loophole Walter fired but his bullet went wild Carnes threw himself behind a rock for protection The rifle swung in Walter s direction and paused As it did so from the house came a strangled cry and a sound as of a blow The rifle barrel disappeared and the sounds of a struggle came from the building Come on cried Carnes as he rose to his feet and made his stumbling way forward the others following at the best speed which their numbed limbs would allow As they reached the door they were aware of a struggle which was going on inside With an oath the doctor threw his massive frame against the door It creaked but the solid oak of which it was composed was proof against the attack and he drew back for another onslaught From the house came a pistol shot followed by a despairing cry and a guttural shout Reinforced by Carnes the doctor threw his weight against the door again With a rending crash it gave and they fell sprawling into the cabin The doctor was the first one on his feet Who are you asked a voice from one corner The doctor whirled like a flash and covered the speaker with his pistol Put them up he said tersely I am unarmed the voice replied Who are you We re from the United States Secret Service replied Carnes who had gained his feet The game is up for you and you d better realize it Secret Service Thank

none	none	cried the voice Get Koskoff he has the plans He has gone out through the tunnel Where is it demanded Carnes The entrance is that iron plate on the floor Carnes and the doctor jumped at the plate and tried to lift it without result There was no handle or projection on which they could take hold Not that way cried the voice That cover is fastened on the inside Go outside the building he ll come out about two hundred yards north Shoot him as he appears or he ll get away The three men nearly tumbled over each other to get through the doorway into the bitter cold outside As they emerged from the cabin the gaze of the guide swept the surrounding hills There he goes he cried Get him said Carnes sharply Walter ran forward a few feet and dropped prone on the ground cuddling the stock of his rifle to his cheek Two hundred yards ahead a figure was scurrying over the rocks away from the cabin Walter drew in his breath and his hand suddenly grew steady as his keen gray eyes peered through the sights Carnes and the doctor held their breath in sympathy Suddenly the rifle spoke and the fleeing man threw up his arms and fell forward on his face Got him said Walter laconically Go bring the body in Carnes exclaimed the doctor I ll take care of the chap inside Did you get him asked the voice eagerly as the doctor stepped inside He s dead all right replied the doctor grimly Who the devil are you and what are you doing here There is a light switch on the left of the door as you come in was the reply doctor Bird found the switch and snapped on a light He turned toward the corner from whence the voice had come and recoiled in horror Propped in the corner was the body of a middle aged man daubed and splashed with blood which ran from a wound in the side of his head Good Lord he ejaculated Let me help you There s not much use replied the man rather faintly I am about done in This face wound doesn t amount to much but I am shot through the body and am bleeding internally If you try to move me it may easily kill me Leave me alone until your partners come The doctor drew a flask of brandy from his pocket and advanced toward the corner Take a few drops of this he advised With an effort the man lifted the flask to his lips and gulped down a little of the fiery spirit A sound of tramping feet came from the outside and then a thud as though a body had been dropped Carnes and Walter entered the cabin He s dead as a mackerel said Carnes in answer to the doctor s look Walter got him through the neck and broke his spinal cord He never knew what hit him The plans came in a gasping voice from the man in the corner We got them too replied Carnes He had both packets inside his coat They have been opened but I guess they are all here Who the devil are you Since Koskoff is dead and I am dying there is no reason why I shouldn t tell you was the answer Leave that brandy handy to keep up my strength I have only a short time and I can t repeat As to who I am or what I was it doesn t really matter Koskoff knew me as John Smith and it will pass as well as any other name Let my past stay buried I am or was a scientist of some ability but fortune frowned on me and I was driven out of the world Money would rehabilitate me money will do anything nowadays so I set out to get it In the course of my experimental work I had discovered that cold was negative heat and reacted to the laws which governed heat I knew that cried doctor Bird but I never could prove it Who are you demanded John Smith doctor Bird of the Bureau of Standards Oh Bird I ve heard of you You can understand me when I say that as heat positive heat is a concomitant of ordinary light I have found that cold negative heat is a concomitant of cold light Is my apparatus in good shape outside The reflector is smashed I m sorry You would have enjoyed studying it I presume that you saw that it was a catenary curve I rather thought so It was and it was also adjustable I could vary the focal point from a few feet to several miles With that apparatus I could throw a beam of negative heat with a focal point which I could adjust at will Close to the apparatus I could obtain a temperature almost down to absolute zero but at the longer ranges it wasn t so cold due to leakage into the atmosphere Even at two miles I could produce a local temperature of three hundred degrees below zero What was the source of your cold Liquid helium Those cylinders contain or rather did contain for I expect that Koskoff has emptied them helium in a liquid state Where is your compressor I didn t have to use one I developed a cold light under whose rays helium would liquefy and remain in a state of equilibrium until exposed to light rays Those cylinders had merely enough pressure to force the liquid out to where the sun could hit it and then it turned to a gas dropping the temperature at the first focal point of the reflector to absolute zero When I had this much done Koskoff and I packed the whole apparatus here and were ready for work We were on the path of the transcontinental air mail and I bided my time until an especially valuable shipment was to be made My plans which worked perfectly were to freeze the plane in midair and then rob the wreck I heard of the jewel shipment the T A C was to carry and I planned to get it When the plane came over Koskoff and I brought it down The unsuspected presence of another plane upset us a little and I started to bring it down But we had been all over this country and knew there was no place that a plane could land I let it go on in safety Thank you replied Carnes with a grimace We robbed the wreck and we found two packets one the jewels I was after and the other a sealed packet which proved to contain certain War Department plans That was when I learned who Koskoff was I had hired him in San Francisco as a good mechanic who had no principles He was to get one fourth of the loot When we found these plans he told me who he was He was really a Russian secret agent and he wanted to deliver the plans to Russia I may be a thief and a murderer but I am not yet ready to betray my country and I told him so He offered me almost any price for the plans but I wouldn t listen We had a serious quarrel and he overpowered me and bound me We had a radio set here and he called San Francisco and sent some code message I think he was waiting here for someone to come Had we followed our original plans we would have been miles from here before you arrived He had me bound and helpless as he thought but I worked my bonds a little loose I didn t let him know it for I knew that the plane I had let get away would guide a party here and I thought I might be able to help out When you came and attacked the house I worked at my bonds until they were loose enough to throw off I saw Koskoff start my cold apparatus to working and then he quit because he ran out of helium When he started shooting again I worked out of my bonds and tackled him He was a better man than I gave him credit for or else he suspected me for about the time I grabbed him he whirled and struck me over the head with his gun barrel and tore my face open The blow stunned me and when I came to I was thrown into this corner I meant to have another try at it but I guess you rushed him too fast He turned and ran for the tunnel but as he did so he shot me through the body I guess I didn t look dead enough to suit him You gentlemen broke open the door and came in That s all Not by a long shot it isn t exclaimed doctor Bird Where is that cold light apparatus of yours In the tunnel How do you get into it If you will open that cupboard on the wall you ll find an open knife switch on the wall Close it doctor Bird found the switch and closed it As he did so the cabin rocked on its foundations and both Carnes and Walter were thrown to the ground The thud of a detonation deep in the earth came to their ears What was that cried the doctor That replied Smith with a wan smile was the detonation of two hundred pounds of T N T When you dig down into the underground cave where we used the cold light apparatus you will find it in fragments It was my only child and I ll take it with me As he finished his head slumped forward on his chest With an exclamation of dismay doctor Bird sprang forward and tried to lift the prostrate form In an agony of desire the Doctor tightened his grip on the dying man s shoulder But Smith collapsed into a heap doctor Bird bent forward and tore open his shirt and listened at his chest Presently he straightened up He is gone he said sadly and I guess the results of his genius have died with him He doesn t strike me as a man who left overmuch to chance Carnes is your case completed Very satisfactorily Doctor I have both of the lost packets All right then come back to the wreck and help me pack my burros I can make my way back to Fallon without a guide Where are you going Doctor That Carnes old dear is none of your blankety blanked business Permit me to remind you that I am on my vacation I haven t decided yet just where I am going but I can tell you one thing It s going to be some place where you can t call me on the telephone Brigands of the Moon The Book of Gregg Haljan BEGINNING A FOUR PART NOVEL By Ray Cummings Black mutiny and brigandage stalk the Space ship Planetara as she speeds to the Moon to pick up a fabulously rich cache of radium ore Illustration I stood on the turret balcony of the Planetara with doctor Frank watching the arriving passengers Foreword by Ray Cummings I have been thinking that if during one of those long winter evenings at Valley Forge someone had placed in George Washington s hands one of our present day best sellers the illustrious Father of our Country would have read it with considerable emotion I do not mean what we call a story of science or fantasy just a novel of action adventure and romance The sort of thing you and I like to read but do not find amazing in any way at all But I fancy that George Washington would have found it amazing Don t you It might picture for instance a factory girl at a sewing machine George Washington would be amazed at a sewing machine And the girl journeying in the subway to and from her work Stealing an opportunity to telephone her lover at the noon hour going to the movies in the evening or listening to a radio And there might be a climax perhaps with the girl and the villain in a transcontinental railway Pullman and the hero sending frantic telegrams or telephoning the train and then chasing it in his airplane George Washington would have found it amazing And I am wondering how you and I would feel if someone were to give us now a book of ordinary adventure of the sort which will be published a hundred and fifty years hence I have been trying to imagine such a book and the nature of its contents Let us imagine it together Suppose we walk down Fifth Avenue a pleasant spring morning of May twenty eighty Fifth Avenue no doubt will be there I don t know whether the New York Public Library will be there or not We ll assume that it is and that it has some sort of books printed or in whatever fashion you care to imagine The young man library attendant is surprised at our curiously antiquated aspect We look as though we were dressed for some historical costume ball We talk old fashioned English like actors in an historical play of the nineteen thirty period But we get the book The attendant assures us it is a good average story of action and adventure Nothing remarkable but he read it himself and found it interesting We thank him and take the book But we find that the language in which it is written is too strange for comfortable reading And it names so many extraordinary things so casually As though we knew all about them which we certainly do not So we take it to the kind hearted librarian in the language division He modifies it to old fashioned English of nineteen thirty and he puts occasional footnotes to help explain some of the things we might not understand Why he should bother to do this for us I don t know but let us assume that he does And now we take the book home in the pneumatic tube or aerial moving sidewalk or airship or whatever it is we take to get home And now that we are home let s read the book It ought to be interesting CHAPTER I Tells of the Grantline Moon Expedition and of the Mysterious Martian Who Followed Us in the City Corridor One may write about oneself and still not be an egoist Or so at least they tell me My narrative went broadcast with a fair success It was pantomimed and the public flashed me a reasonable approval And so my disc publishers have suggested that I record it in more permanent form I introduce myself begging grace that I intrude upon your busy minutes with my only excuse that perhaps I may amuse you For what the commercial sellers of my pictured version were pleased to blare as my handsome face I ask your indulgence My feminine audience of the pantomimes was undoubtedly graciously pleased at my personality and physical aspect That I am tall as a Viking of old and handsome as a young Norse God is very pretty talk in the selling of my product But I deplore its intrusion into the personality of this my recorded narrative And so now for preface to all my audience I do give earnest assurance that Gregg Haljan is no conceited zebra handsomely striped by nature and proud of it Not so I am I do beg you to believe a very humble fellow striving for your approval hoping only to entertain you My introduction My name Gregg Haljan My age twenty five years I was at the time my narrative begins Third Officer on the Space Ship Planetara Our line was newly established in twenty seventy to be exact following the modern improvements of the Martel Magnetic Levitation one Our ship whose home port was Great New York carried mail and passenger traffic to and from both Venus and Mars Of astronomical necessity our flights were irregular This spring with the two other planets both close to the earth we were making two complete round trips We had just arrived in Great New York this May evening from Grebhar Venus Free State With only five hours in port here we were departing the same night at the zero hour for Ferrok Shahn capital of the Martian Union We were no sooner at the landing stage than I found a code flash summoning Dan Dean and me to Divisional Detective Headquarters Dan Snap Dean was one of my closest friends He was radio helio operator of the Planetara A small wiry red headed chap with a quick ready laugh and a wit that made everyone like him The summons to Detective Colonel Halsey s office surprised us Snap eyed me You haven t been opening any treasury vaults have you Gregg He wants you also I retorted He laughed Well he can roar at me like a traffic switchman and my private life will remain my own We could not think why we should be wanted It was the darkness of mid evening when we left the Planetara for Halsey s office It was not a long trip We went direct in the upper monorail descending into the subterranean city at Park Circle thirty We had never been to Halsey s office before We found it to be a gloomy vaultlike place in one of the deepest corridors The door lifted Gregg Haljan and Daniel Dean The guard stood aside Come in I own that my heart was unduly thumping as we entered The door dropped behind us It was a small blue lit apartment a steel lined room like a vault Colonel Halsey sat at his desk And the big heavy set florid Captain Carter our commander of the Planetara was here That surprised us we had not seen him leave the ship Halsey smiled at us gravely Captain Carter said Sit down lads We took the seats There was an alarming solemnity about this If I had been guilty of anything that I could think of it would have been frightening But Halsey s first words reassured me It s about the Grantline Moon Expedition In spite of our secrecy the news has gotten out We want to know how Can you tell us Captain Carter s huge bulk he was about as tall as I am towered over us as we sat before Halsey s desk If you lads have told anyone said anything let slip the slightest hint about it Snap smiled with relief but he turned solemn at once I haven t Not a word Nor have I I declared The Grantline Moon Expedition We had not thought of that as a reason for this summons Johnny Grantline was a close friend to us both He had organized an exploring expedition to the Moon Uninhabited with its bleak forbidding airless waterless surface the Moon even though so close to the Earth was seldom visited No regular ship ever stopped there A few exploring parties of recent years had come to grief But there was a persistent rumor that upon the Moon mineral riches of fabulous wealth were awaiting discovery The thing had already caused some interplanetary complications The aggressive Martians would be only too glad to explore the Moon But the U S W two definitely warned them away The Moon was World Territory we announced and we would protect it as such The threatened conflict between the Earth and Mars had come to nothing There was this year of twenty seventy nine a thorough amity between all three of the inhabited planets It still holds and I pray that it may always hold There was nevertheless a realization by our government that whatever riches might be upon the Moon should be seized at once and held by some reputable Earth Company And when Johnny Grantline applied with his father s wealth and his own scientific record of attainment the government was only too glad to grant him its writ The Grantline Expedition had started six months ago The Martian government had acquiesced in our ultimatum yet brigands have been known to be financed under cover of a governmental disavowal And so the expedition was kept secret My words need give no offense to any Martian who comes upon them I refer to the history of our earth only The Grantline Expedition was on the Moon now No word had come from it One could not flash helios even in code without letting all the universe know that explorers were on the Moon And why they were there anyone could easily guess And now Colonel Halsey was telling us that the news was abroad Captain Carter eyed us closely his flashing eyes under the white bushy brows would pry a secret from anyone You re sure A girl of Venus perhaps with her cursed seductive lure A chance word with you lads befuddled by alcolite We assured him we had been careful By the heavens I know that I had been Not a whisper even to Snap of the name Grantline in six months or more Captain Carter added abruptly We re insulated here Halsey Yes talk as freely as you like An eavesdropping ray will never get into these walls They questioned us They were satisfied at last that though the secret had escaped we had not done it Hearing it discussed it occurred to me to wonder why Carter was concerned I was not aware that he knew of Grantline s venture I learned now the reason why the Planetara upon each of her voyages had managed to pass fairly close to the Moon It had been arranged with Grantline that if he wanted help or had any important message he was to flash it locally to our passing ship And this Snap knew and had never mentioned it even to me Halsey was saying Well we can t blame you but the secret is out Snap and I regarded each other What could anyone do What would anyone dare do Captain Carter said abruptly Look here lads this is my chance now to talk plainly to you Outside anywhere outside these walls an eavesdropping ray may be upon us You know that One may never even dare whisper since that accursed ray was developed Snap opened his mouth to speak but decided against it

none	none	Captain Carter went on I know I can trust you two more than anyone else under me on the Planetara What do you mean by that I demanded What He interrupted me Nothing at all but what I say Halsey smiled grimly What he means Haljan is that things are not always what they seem these days One cannot always tell a friend from an enemy The Planetara is a public vessel You have how many is it Carter thirty or forty passengers this trip to night Thirty eight said Carter There are thirty eight people listed for the flight to Ferrok Shahn to night Halsey said slowly And some may not be what they seem He raised his thin dark hand We have information He paused I confess we know almost nothing hardly more than enough to alarm us Captain Carter interjected I want you and Dean to be on your guard Once on the Planetara it is difficult for us to talk openly but be watchful I will arrange for us to be doubly armed Vague perturbing words Halsey said They tell me George Prince is listed for the voyage I am suggesting Haljan that you keep your eye especially upon him Your duties on the Planetara leave you comparatively free don t they Yes I agreed With the first and second officers on duty and the captain aboard my routine was more or less that of an understudy I said George Prince Who is he A mechanical engineer said Halsey An under official of the Earth Federated Radium Corporation But he associates with bad companions particularly Martians I had never heard of this George Prince though I was familiar with the Federated Radium Corporation of course A semi government trust which controlled virtually the entire Earth supply of radium He was in the Automotive Department Carter put in You ve heard of the Federated Radium Motor We had of course A recent Earth invention which promised to revolutionize the automotive industry An engine of a new type using radium as its fuel Snap demanded What in the stars has this got to do with Johnny Grantline Much said Halsey quietly or perhaps nothing But George Prince some years ago mixed in rather unethical transactions We had him in custody once He is known now as unusually friendly with several Martians in New York of bad reputation Well began Snap What you don t know Halsey went on quietly is that Grantline expects to find radium on the Moon We gasped Exactly said Halsey The ill fated Ballon Expedition thought they had found it on the Moon some years ago A new type of ore as rich in radium as our gold bearing sands are rich in gold Ballon s first samples gave uranium atoms with a fair representation of ionium and thorium A richly radio active ore A lode of the pure radium is there somewhere without doubt He added vehemently Do you understand now why we should be suspicious of this George Prince He has a criminal record He has a thorough technical knowledge of radium ores He associates with Martians of bad reputation A large Martian Company has recently developed a radium engine to compete with our Earth motor You know that You know that there is very little radium available on Mars and our government will not allow our own radium supply to be exported That Martian Company needs radium It will do anything to get radium What do you suppose it would pay for a few tons of really rich radio active ore such as Grantline may have found on the Moon But I objected that is a reputable Martian company It s backed by the government of the Martian Union The government of Mars would not dare Of course not Captain Carter exclaimed sardonically Not openly But if Martian brigands had a supply of radium I don t imagine where it came from would make much difference That Martian Company would buy it Halsey added And George Prince my agents inform me seems to know that Grantline is on the Moon Put it all together lads Little sparks show the hidden current More than that George Prince knows that we have arranged to have the Planetara stop at the Moon and bring back Grantline s radium ore This is your last voyage this year You ll hear from Grantline this time we re convinced He ll probably give you the signal as you pass the Moon on your way out Coming back you ll stop at the Moon and transport whatever radium ore Grantline has ready The Grantline Flyer is too small for ore transportation Halsey s voice turned grimly sarcastic Doesn t it seem queer that George Prince and a few of his Martian friends happen to be listed as passengers for this voyage In the silence that followed Snap and I regarded each other Halsey added abruptly We had George Prince typed that time we arrested him four years ago I ll show him to you He snapped open an alcove and said to his waiting attendant Get me the type of George Prince The disc in a moment came through the pneumatic Halsey smiling wryly adjusted it A nice looking fellow Nicely spoken Though at the time we made this he was somewhat annoyed naturally He is older now Twenty nine to be exact Here he is The image glowed on the grids before us His name George Prince in letters illumined upon his forehead showed for a moment and then faded He stood smiling sourly before us as he repeated the official formula My name is George Prince I was born in Great New York City twenty five years ago I gazed at this life size moving image of George Prince He stood somber in the black detention uniform A dark almost a girlishly handsome fellow well below medium height the rod beside him showed five feet four inches Slim and slight Long wavy black hair falling about his ears A pale clean cut really handsome face almost beardless I regarded it closely A face that would have been femininely beautiful without its masculine touch of heavy black brows and firmly set jaw His voice as he spoke was low and soft but at the end with the concluding words I am innocent it flashed into strong masculinity His eyes shaded with long girlish black lashes by chance met mine I am innocent His curving sensuous lips drew down into a grim sneer The type faded at its end Halsey replaced the disc in its box and waved the attendant away Thank you He turned back to Snap and me Well there he is We have nothing tangible against him now But I ll say this he s a clever fellow one to be afraid of I would not blare it from the newscasters microphone but if he is hatching any plot he has been too clever for my agents We talked for another half hour and then Captain Carter dismissed us We left Halsey s office with Carter s final words ringing in our ears Whatever comes lads remember I trust you Snap and I decided to walk a portion of the way back to the ship It was barely more than a mile through this subterranean corridor to where we could get the vertical lift direct to the landing stage We started off on the lower level Once outside the insulation of Halsey s office we did not dare talk of this thing Not only electrical ears but every possible eavesdropping device might be upon us The corridor was two hundred feet or more below the ground level At this hour of the night this business section was comparatively deserted The through tube sounded over our heads with the passing of its occasional trains The ventilators buzzed and whirred At the cross intersections the traffic directors dozed at their posts It was hot and sticky down here and gloomy with the daylight globes extinguished and only the night lights to give a dim illumination The stores and office arcades were all closed and deserted only an occasional night light burning behind their windows Our footfalls echoed on the metal grids as we hurried along Nice evening said Snap awkwardly Yes I said isn t it I felt oppressed As though prying eyes and ears were here We walked for a time in silence each of us busy with memory of what had transpired in Halsey s office Suddenly Snap gripped me What s that Where I whispered We stopped at a corner An entryway was here Snap pulled me into it I could feel him quivering with excitement What is it I demanded in a whisper We re being followed Did you hear anything No Yet I thought now I could hear something Vague footfalls A rustling And a microscopic electrical whine as though some device were near us Snap was fumbling in his pocket Wait I ve got a pair of low scale phones He put the little grids against his ears I could hear the sharp intake of his breath Then he seized me pulled me down to the metal floor of the entryway Back Gregg Get back I could barely hear his whisper We crouched as far back into the doorway as we could get I was armed My official permit for the carrying of the pencil heat ray allowed me to have it always with me I drew it now But there was nothing to shoot at I felt Snap clamping the grids on my ears And now I heard something An intensification of the vague footsteps I had thought I heard before There was something following us Something out in the corridor there now A street light was nearby The corridor was dim but plainly visible and to my sight it was empty But there was something there Something invisible I could hear it moving Creeping towards us I pulled the grids off my ears Snap murmured You ve got a local phone Yes I ll get them to give us the street glare I pressed the danger signal giving our location to the nearest operator In a second or two we got the light The street in all this neighborhood burst into a brilliant actinic glare The thing menacing us was revealed A figure in a black cloak crouching thirty feet away across the corridor Snap was on his feet His voice rang shrilly There it is Give it a shot Gregg Snap was unarmed but he flung his hands out menacingly The figure which may perhaps not have been aware of our city safeguard was taken wholly by surprise A human figure Seven feet tall at the least and therefore I judged doubtless a Martian man The black cloak covered his head He took a step toward us hesitated and then turned in confusion Snap s shrill voice was bringing help The whine of a street guard s alarm whistle nearby sounded The figure was making off My pencil ray was in my hand and I pressed its switch The tiny heat ray stabbed through the glare but I missed The figure stumbled but did not fall I saw a bare gray arm come from the cloak flung up to maintain its balance Or perhaps my pencil ray of heat had seared the arm The gray skinned arm of a Martian Snap was shouting Give him another But the figure passed beyond the actinic glare and vanished We were detained in the turmoil of the corridor for ten minutes or more with official explanations Then a message from Halsey released us The Martian who had been following us in his invisible cloak was never caught We escaped from the crowd at last and made our way back to the Planetara where the passengers were already assembling for the outward Martian voyage CHAPTER II A Fleeting Glance I stood on the turret balcony of the Planetara with Captain Carter and doctor Frank the ship surgeon watching the arriving passengers It was close to the zero hour the level of the stage was a turmoil of confusion The escalators with the last of the freight aboard were folded back But the stage was jammed with the incoming passenger baggage the interplanetary customs and tax officials with their X ray and Zed ray paraphernalia and the passengers themselves lined up for the export inspection At this height the city lights lay spread in a glare of blue and yellow beneath us The individual local planes came dropping like birds to our stage Thirty eight passengers for this flight to Mars but that accursed desire of every friend and relative to speed the departing voyager brought a hundred or more extra people to crowd our girders and bring added difficulty to everybody Carter was too absorbed in his duties to stay with us long But here in the turret doctor Frank and I found ourselves at the moment with nothing much to do but watch Think we ll get away on time Gregg No I said And this of all voyages I checked myself with thumping heart My thoughts were so full of what Halsey and Carter had told us that it was difficult to rein my tongue Yet here in the turret unguarded by insulation I could say nothing Nor would I have dared mention the Grantline Moon Expedition to doctor Frank I wondered what he knew of this affair Perhaps as much as I perhaps nothing He was a thin dark rather smallish man of fifty this ship s surgeon trim in his blue and white uniform I knew him well we had made several flights together An American I fancy of Jewish ancestry A likable man and a skillful doctor and surgeon He and I had always been good friends Crowded he said Johnson says thirty eight I hope they re experienced travelers This pressure sickness is a rotten nuisance keeps me dashing around all night assuring frightened women they re not going to die Last voyage coming out of the Venus atmosphere He plunged into a lugubrious account of his troubles with space sick voyagers But I was in no mood to listen My gaze was down on the spider incline up which over the bend of the ship s sleek silvery body the passengers and their friends were coming in little groups The upper deck was already jammed with them The Planetara as flyers go was not a large vessel Cylindrical of body forty feet maximum beam and two hundred and seventy five feet in overall length The passenger superstructure no more than a hundred feet long was set amidships A narrow deck metallic enclosed and with large bulls eye windows encircled the superstructure Some of the cabins opened directly onto the deck Others had doors to the interior corridors There were half a dozen small but luxurious public rooms The rest of the vessel was given to freight storage and the mechanism and control compartments Forward of the passenger structure the deck level continued under the cylindrical dome roof to the bow The forward watch tower observatory was here officers cabins Captain Carter s navigating rooms and doctor Frank s office Similarly under the stern dome was the stern watch tower and a series of power compartments Above the superstructure a confusion of spider bridges ladders and balconies were laced like a metal network The turret in which doctor Frank and I now stood was perched here Fifty feet away like a bird s nest Snap s instrument room stood clinging to the metal bridge The dome roof with the glassite windows rolled back now rose in a mound peak to cover this highest middle portion of the vessel Below in the main hull blue lit metal corridors ran the entire length of the ship Freight storage compartments gravity control rooms the air renewal systems heater and ventilators and pressure mechanisms all were located there And the kitchens stewards compartments and the living quarters of the crew We carried a crew of sixteen this voyage exclusive of the navigating officers and the purser Snap Dean and doctor Frank The passengers coming aboard seemed a fair representation of what we usually had for the outward voyage to Ferrok Shahn Most were Earth people and returning Martians doctor Frank pointed out one A huge Martian in a gray cloak A seven foot fellow His name is Set Miko doctor Frank remarked Ever heard of him No I said Should I Well The doctor suddenly checked himself as though he were sorry he had spoken I never heard of him I repeated slowly An awkward silence fell suddenly between us There were a few Venus passengers I saw one of them presently coming up the incline and recognized her A girl traveling alone We had brought her from Grebhar last voyage but one I remembered her An alluring sort of girl as most of them are Her name was Venza She spoke English well A singer and dancer who had been imported to Great New York to fill some theatrical engagement She d made quite a hit on the Great White Way She came up the incline with the carrier ahead of her Gazing up she saw doctor Frank and me at the turret window and waved her white arm in greeting And flashed us a smile doctor Frank laughed By the gods of the airways there s Alta Venza You saw that look Gregg That was for me not you Reasonable enough I retorted But I doubt it the Venza was nothing if not impartial I wondered what could be taking Venza now to Mars I was glad to see her She was diverting Educated Well traveled Spoke English with a colloquial theatrical manner more characteristic of Great New York than of Venus And for all her light banter I would rather put my trust in her than any Venus girl I had ever met The hum of the departing siren was sounding Friends and relatives of the passengers were crowding the exit incline The deck was clearing I had not seen George Prince come aboard And then I thought I saw him down on the landing stage just arrived from a private tube car A small slight figure The customs men were around him I could only see his head and shoulders Pale girlishly handsome face long black hair to the base of his neck He was bareheaded with the hood of his traveling cloak pushed back I stared and I saw that doctor Frank was also gazing down But neither of us spoke Then I said upon impulse Suppose we go down to the deck Doctor He acquiesced We descended to the lower room of the turret and clambered down the spider ladder to the upper deck level The head of the arriving incline was near us Preceded by two carriers who were littered with hand baggage George Prince was coming up the incline He was closer now I recognized him from the type we had seen in Halsey s office And then with a shock I saw it was not so This was a girl coming aboard An arch light over the incline showed her clearly when she was half way up A girl with her hood pushed back her face framed in thick black hair I saw now it was not a man s cut of hair but long braids coiled up under the dangling hood doctor Frank must have remarked my amazed expression Little beauty isn t she Who is she We were standing back against the wall of the superstructure A passenger was near us the Martian whom doctor Frank had called Miko He was loitering here quite evidently watching this girl come aboard But as I glanced at him he looked away and casually sauntered off The girl came up and reached the deck I am in A twenty two she told the carrier My brother came aboard two hours ago doctor Frank answered my whisper That s Anita Prince She was passing quite close to us on the deck following the carrier when she stumbled and very nearly fell I was nearest to her I leaped forward and caught her as she went down Oh she cried With my arm about her I raised her up and set her upon her feet again She had twisted her ankle She balanced herself upon it The pain of it eased up in a moment I m all right thank you In the dimness of the blue lit deck I met her eyes I was holding her with my encircling arm She was small and soft against me Her face framed in the thick black hair smiled up at me Small oval face beautiful yet firm of chin and stamped with the mark of its own individuality No empty headed beauty this I m all right thank you very much I became conscious that I had not released her I felt her hands pushing at me And then it seemed that for an instant she yielded and was clinging And I met her startled upflung gaze Eyes like a purple night with the sheen of misty starlight in them I heard myself murmuring I beg your pardon Yes of course I released her She thanked me again and followed the carrier along the deck She was limping slightly from the twisted ankle An instant while she had clung to me and I had held her A brief flash of something from her eyes to mine from mine back to hers The poets write that love can be born of such a glance The first meeting across all the barriers of which love springs unsought unbidden defiant sometimes And the troubadours of old would sing A fleeting glance a touch two wildly beating hearts and love was born I think with Anita and me it must have been like that I stood gazing after her unconscious of doctor Frank who was watching me with his humorous smile And presently no more than a quarter beyond the zero hour the Planetara got away With the dome windows battened tightly we lifted from the landing stage and soared over the glowing city The phosphorescence of the electronic tubes was like a comet s tail behind us as we slid upward At the trinight hour the heat of our atmospheric passage was over The passengers had all retired The ship was quiet with empty decks and dim silent corridors Vibrationless with the electronic engines cut off and only the hum of the Martel magnetizers to break the unnatural stillness We were well beyond the earth s atmosphere heading out in the cone path of the earth s shadow in the direction of the moon CHAPTER III In the Helio room At six A M earth Eastern time which we were still carrying Snap Dean and I were alone in his instrument room perched in the network over the Planetara s deck The bulge of the dome enclosed us it rounded like a great observatory window some twenty feet above the ceiling of this little metal cubby hole The Planetara was still in the earth s shadow The firmament black interstellar space with its blazing white red and yellow stars lay spread around us The moon with nearly all its disc illumined hung a great silver ball over our bow quarter Behind it to one side Mars floated like the red tip of a smoldering cigarillo in the blackness The earth behind our stern was dimly redly visible a giant sphere etched with the configurations of its oceans and continents Upon one limb a touch of the sunlight hung on the mountain tops with a crescent red yellow sheen And then we plunged from the cone shadow The sun with the leaping Corona burst through the blackness behind us The earth lighted into a huge thin crescent with hooked cusps To Snap and me the glories of the heavens were too familiar to be remarked And upon this voyage particularly we were in no mood to consider them I had been in the helio room several hours When the Planetara started and my few routine duties were over I could think of nothing save Halsey s and Carter s admonition Be on your guard And particularly watch George Prince I had not seen George Prince But I had seen his sister whom Carter and Halsey had not bothered to mention My heart was still pounding with the memory When the passengers had retired and the ship quieted I prowled through the passenger corridors This was about the trinight hour three Hot as the corridors of hell with our hull and the glassite dome seething with the friction of our atmospheric flight But the refrigerators mitigated that the ventilators blasted cold air from the renewers into every corner of the vessel Within an hour or two with the cold of space striking us it was hot air that was needed doctor Frank evidently was having little trouble with pressure sick passengers four the Planetara s equalizers were fairly efficient I did not encounter doctor Frank I prowled through the silent metal lounges and passages I went to the door of A twenty two It was on the deck level in a tiny transverse passage just off the main lounging room Its name grid glowed with the letters Anita Prince I stood in my short white trousers and white silk shirt like a cabin steward gawping Anita Prince I had never heard the name until this night But there was magic music in it now as I murmured it to myself Anita Prince She was here doubtless asleep behind this small metal door It seemed as though that little oval grid were the gateway to a fairyland of my dreams I turned away And thought of the Grantline Moon Expedition stabbed at me George Prince Anita s brother he whom I had been told to watch This renegade associate of dubious Martians plotting God knows what I saw upon the adjoining door A twenty George Prince I listened In the humming stillness of the ship s interior there was no sound from these cabins A twenty was without windows I knew But Anita s room had a window and a door which gave upon the deck I went through the lounge out its arch and walked the deck length The deck door and window of A twenty two were closed and dark The ten foot wide deck was dim with white starlight from the side ports Chairs were here but they were all empty From the bow windows of the arching dome a flood of moonlight threw long slanting shadows down the deck At the corner where the superstructure ended I thought I saw a figure lurking as though watching me I went that way but it vanished I turned the corner went the width of the ship to the other side There was no one in sight save the observer on his spider bridge high in the bow network and the second officer on duty on the turret balcony almost directly over me As I stood and listened I suddenly heard footsteps From the direction of the bow a figure came Purser Johnson He greeted me Cooling off Gregg Yes I said He went past me and turned into the smoking room door nearby I stood a moment at one of the deck windows gazing at the stars and for no reason at all I realized I was tense Johnson was a great one for his regular sleep it was wholly unlike him to be roaming about the ship at such an hour Had he been watching me I told myself it was nonsense I was suspicious of everyone everything this voyage I heard another step Captain Carter appeared from his chart room which stood in the center of the narrowing open deck space near the bow I joined him at once Who was that he half whispered Johnson Oh yes He fumbled in his uniform his gaze swept the moonlit deck Gregg take this He handed me a small metal box I stuffed it at once into my shirt An insulator he added swiftly Snap is in his office Take it to him Gregg Stay with him you ll have a measure of security and you can help him to make the photographs He was barely whispering I won t be with you no use making it look as though we were doing anything unusual If your graphs show anything or if Snap picks up any message bring it to me He added aloud Well it will be cool enough presently Gregg He sauntered away toward his chart room By heavens what a relief Snap murmured as the current went on We had wired his cubby with the insulator within its barrage we could at last talk with a degree of freedom You ve seen George Prince Gregg No He s assigned A twenty But I saw his sister Snap no one ever mentioned Snap had heard of her but he hadn t known that she was listed for this voyage A real beauty so I ve heard Accursed shame for a decent girl to have a brother like that I could agree with him there but I made no comment It was now six A M Snap had been busy all night with routine cosmo radios from the earth following our departure He had a pile of them beside him Many were for the passengers but anything that savored of a code was barred Nothing queer looking I suggested No Not a thing We were at this time no more than some sixty five thousand miles from the moon s surface The Planetara presently would swing upon her direct course for Mars There was nothing which could cause passenger comment in this close passing of the moon normally we used the satellite s attraction to give us additional starting speed It was now or never that a message would come from Grantline He was supposed to be upon this earthward side of the moon While Snap had rushed through with his routine I had searched the moon surface with our glass as I knew Carter was searching it and also the observer in his tower very possibly But there was nothing Copernicus and Kepler lay in full sunlight The heights of the lunar mountains the depths of the barren empty seas were etched black and white clear and clean Grim forbidding desolation this unchanging moon In romance moonlight may shimmer and sparkle to light a lover s smile but the reality of the moon is cold and bleak There was nothing to show my prying eyes where the intrepid Grantline might be Nothing at all Snap And Snap s helio mirrors attuned for an hour now to pick up the faintest signal were motionless If he has concentrated any appreciable amount of radio active ore said Snap we should get an impulse from its Gamma rays But our receiving shield was dark untouched We tried taking hydrogen photographic impressions of the visible moon surface A sequence of them with stereoscopic lenses forty eight to the second Our mirror grid gave the magnified images the spectro heliograph with its wave length selection pictured the mountain levels and slowly descended into the deepest seas There was nothing Yet in those moon caverns a million million recesses amid the crags of that tumbled barren surface the pin point of movement which might have been Grantline s expedition could so easily be hiding Could he have the ore insulated fearing its Gamma rays would betray its presence to hostile watchers Or might disaster have come to him Or he might not be upon this hemisphere of the moon at all My imagination sharpened by fancy of a lurking menace which seemed everywhere about the Planetara this voyage ran rife with fears for Johnny Grantline He had promised to communicate this voyage It was now or perhaps never Six thirty came and passed We were well beyond the earth s shadow now The firmament blazed with its vivid glories the sun behind us was a ball of yellow red leaping flames The earth hung opened to a huge dull red half sphere We were within some forty thousand miles of the moon Giant white ball all of its disc visible to the naked eye It poised over the bow and presently as the Planetara swung upon her course for Mars it shifted sidewise The light of it glared white and dazzling in our tiny side windows Snap with his habitual red celluloid eyeshade shoved high on his forehead worked over our instruments Gregg The receiving shield was glowing a trifle Gamma rays were bombarding it It glowed gleamed phosphorescent and the audible recorder began sounding its tiny tinkling murmurs Gamma rays Snap sprang to the dials The direction and strength were soon obvious A richly radio active ore body of considerable size was concentrated upon this hemisphere of the moon It was unmistakable He s got it Gregg He s The tiny helio mirrors began quivering Snap exclaimed triumphantly Here he comes By God the message at last Bar off that light I flung on the absorbers The moonlight bathing the little room went into them and darkness sprang around us Snap fumbled at his instrument board Actinic light showed dimly in the quivering thumbnail mirrors Two of them They hung poised on their cobweb wires infinitely sensitive to the infra red light rays Grantline was sending from the moon The mirrors in a moment began swinging On the scale across the room the actinic beams from them were magnified into sweeps of light The message Snap spelled it out decoded it Success Stop for ore on your return voyage Will give you our location later Success beyond wildest hopes The mirrors hung motionless The shield where the Gamma rays were bombarding went suddenly dark Snap murmured That s all He s got the ore Success beyond wildest hopes That must mean an enormous quantity of it available We were sitting in darkness and abruptly I became aware that across our open window where the insulation barrage was flung the air was faintly hissing An interference there I saw a tiny swirl of purple sparks Someone some hostile ray from the deck beneath us or from the spider bridge that led to our little room someone out there trying to pry in Snap impulsively reached for the absorbers to let in the outside light it was all darkness to us outside But I checked him Wait I cut off our barrage opened our door and stepped to the narrow metal bridge Wait Snap You stay there I added aloud Well Snap I m going to bed Glad you ve cleaned up that batch of work I banged the door upon him The lacework of metal bridges and ladders seemed empty I gazed up to the dome and forward and aft Twenty feet beneath me was the metal roof of the cabin superstructure Below it both sides of the deck showed All patched with moonlight No one visible down there I descended a ladder The deck was empty But in the silence something was moving Footsteps moving away from me down the deck I followed and suddenly I was running Chasing something I could hear but could not see It turned into the smoking room I burst in And a real sound smothered the phantom Johnson the purser was sitting here alone in the dimness He was smoking I noticed that his cigar held a long frail ash It could not have been him I was chasing He was sitting there quite calmly A thick necked heavy fellow easily out of breath But he was breathing calmly now He sat up with amazement at my wild eyed appearance and the ash jarred from his cigar Gregg What in the devil I tried to grin I m on my way to bed worked all night helping Snap with those damn Earth messages I went past him out the door into the main interior corridor It was the only way the invisible prowler could have gone But I was too late now I could hear nothing I dashed forward into the main lounge It was empty dim and silent a silence broken presently by a faint click a stateroom door hastily closing I swung and found myself in a tiny transverse passage The twin doors of A twenty two and A twenty were before me The invisible eavesdropper had gone into one of these rooms I listened at each of the panels but there was only silence within The interior of the ship was suddenly singing with the steward s siren the call to awaken the passengers It startled me I moved swiftly away But as the siren shut off in the silence I heard a soft musical voice Wake up Anita I think that s the breakfast call And her answer All right George I hear it CHAPTER IV A Burn on a Martian Arm I did not appear at that morning meal I was exhausted and drugged with lack of sleep I had a moment with Snap to tell him what had occurred Then I sought out Carter He had his little chart room insulated And we were cautious I told him what Snap and I had learned the Gamma rays from the moon proving that Grantline had concentrated a considerable ore body I also told him the message from Grantline We ll stop on the way back as he directs Gregg He bent closer to me At Ferrok Shahn I m going to bring back a cordon of Interplanetary Police The secret will be out of course when once we stop at the moon We have no right even now to be flying this vessel as unguarded as it is He was very solemn And he was grim when I told him of the invisible eavesdropper You think he overheard Grantline s message I don t know I said Who was it You seem to feel it was George Prince Yes I was convinced that the prowler had gone into A twenty When I mentioned the purser who seemed to have been watching me earlier in the night and again was sitting in the smoking room when the eavesdropper fled past Carter looked startled Johnson is all right Gregg Is he Does he know anything about this Grantline affair No no said the captain hastily You haven t mentioned it have you Of course I haven t I ve been wondering why Johnson didn t hear that eavesdropper I could hear him when I was chasing him But Johnson sat perfectly unmoved and let him go by What was he sitting there for anyway at that hour of the morning You re too suspicious Gregg Overwrought But you re right we can t be too careful I m going to have that Prince suite searched when I catch it unoccupied Passengers don t ordinarily travel with invisible cloaks Go to bed Gregg you need a rest I went to my cabin It was located aft on the stern deck space near the stern watch tower A small metal room with a desk a chair and bunk I made sure no one was in it I sealed the lattice grill and the door set the alarm trigger against any opening of them and went to bed The siren for the mid day meal awakened me I had slept heavily I felt refreshed And hungry I found the passengers already assembled at my table when I arrived in the dining salon It was a low vaulted metal room of blue and yellow tube lights At the sides its oval windows showed the deck with its ports of the dome side through which a vista of the starry firmament was visible We were well on our course to Mars The moon had dwindled to a pin point of light beside the crescent earth And behind them our sun blazed visually the largest orb in the heavens It was some sixty eight million miles from the earth to Mars this voyage A flight under ordinary circumstances of some ten days There were five tables in the dining salon each with eight seats Snap and I had one of the tables We sat at the ends with three passengers on each of the sides Snap was in his seat when I arrived He eyed me down the length of the table Good morning Gregg We missed you at breakfast Not pressure sick I hope There were three passengers already seated at our table all men Snap in a gay mood introduced me This is our third officer Gregg Haljan Big handsome fellow isn t he And as pleasant as he is good looking Gregg this is Sero Ob Hahn I met the keen dark eyed somber gaze of a Venus man of middle age A small slim graceful man with sleek black hair His pointed face accentuated by the pointed beard was pallid He wore a white and purple robe upon his breast was a huge platinum ornament a device like a star and cross entwined I am happy to meet you sir His voice was soft and sleek Ob Hahn I repeated I should have heard of you no doubt But A smile plucked at his thin gray lips That is the error of mine not yours My mission is that all the universe shall hear of me He s preaching the religion of the Venus Mystics Snap explained And this enlightened gentleman said Ob Hahn ironically has just termed it fetishism The ignorance Oh I say protested the man at Ob Hahn s side I mean you seem to think I intended something opprobrious As a matter of fact We ve an argument Gregg laughed Snap This is Sir Arthur Coniston an English gentleman lecturer and sky trotter that is he will be a sky trotter he tells us he plans a number of voyages The tall Englishman in his white linen suit bowed acknowledgment My compliments mister Haljan I hope you have no strong religious convictions else we will make your table here very miserable The third passenger had evidently kept out of the argument Snap introduced him as Rance Rankin An American a quiet blond fellow of thirty five or forty I ordered my breakfast and let the argument go on Won t make me miserable said Snap I love an argument You said Sir Arthur I mean to say I think I said too much mister Rankin you are more diplomatic Rankin laughed I am a magician he said to me A theatrical entertainer I deal in tricks how to fool an audience His keen amused gaze was on Ob Hahn This gentleman from Venus and I have too much in common to argue A nasty one the Englishman exclaimed By Jove Really mister Rankin you re a bit too cruel I could see we were doomed to have turbulent meals this voyage I like to eat in quiet arguing passengers always annoy me There were still three seats vacant at our table I wondered who would occupy them I soon learned the answer for one seat at least Rankin said calmly Where is the little Venus girl this meal His glance went to the empty seat at my right hand The Venza wasn t that her name She and I are destined for the same theater in Ferrok Shahn So Venza was to sit beside me It was good news Ten days of a religious argument three times a day would be intolerable But the cheerful Venza would help She never eats the mid day meal said Snap She s on the deck having orange juice I guess it s the old gag about diet eh My attention wandered about the salon Most of the seats were occupied At the captain s table I saw the objects of my search George Prince and his sister sat one on each side of the captain I saw George Prince in the life now as a man who looked hardly twenty five He was at this moment evidently in a gay mood His clean cut handsome profile with its poetic dark curls was turned toward me There seemed little of the villain about him And I saw Anita Prince now as a dark haired black eyed little beauty in feature resembling her brother very strongly She presently finished her meal She rose with him after her She was dressed in Earth fashion white blouse and dark jacket wide knee length trousers of gray with a red sash her only touch of color She went past me flashed me her smile and nod My heart was pounding I answered her greeting and met George Prince s casual gaze He too smiled as though to signify that his sister had told him of the service I had done her Or was his smile an ironical memory of how he had eluded me this morning when I chased him I gazed after his small white suited figure as he followed Anita from the salon And thinking of her I prayed that Carter and Halsey might be wrong Whatever plotting against the Grantline Expedition might be going on I hoped that George Prince was innocent of it Yet I knew in my heart it was a futile hope Prince had been that eavesdropper outside the helio room I could not really doubt it But that his sister must be ignorant of what he was doing I was sure My attention was brought suddenly back to the reality of our table I heard Ob Hahn s silky voice We passed quite close to the moon last night mister Dean Yes said Snap We did didn t we Always do it s a technical problem of the exigencies of interstellar navigation Explain it to them Gregg you re an expert I waved it away with a laugh There was a brief silence I could not help noticing Sir Arthur Coniston s queer look and I think I have never seen so keen a glance as Rance Rankin shot at me Were all these people aware of Grantline s treasure on the moon It suddenly seemed so I wished fervently at that instant that the ten days of this voyage were over and we were safely at Ferrok Shahn Captain Carter was absolutely right Coming back we would have a cordon of interplanetary police aboard Sir Arthur broke the awkward silence Magnificent sight the moon from so close a viewpoint though I was too much afraid of pressure sickness to be up to see it I had nearly finished my hasty meal when another incident shocked me The two other passengers at our table came in and took their seats A Martian girl and man The girl had the seat at my left with the man beside her All Martians are tall This girl was about my own height that is six feet two inches The man was seven feet or more Both wore the Martian outer robe The girl flung hers back Her limbs were encased in pseudo mail She looked as all Martians like to look a very warlike Amazon But she was a pretty girl She smiled at me with a keen eyed direct gaze mister Dean said at breakfast that you were big and handsome You are They were brother and sister these Martians Snap introduced them as Set Miko and Setta Moa five This Miko was from our Earth standards a tremendous brawny giant Not spindly like most Martians this fellow for all his seven feet of height was almost heavy set He wore a plaited leather jerkin beneath his robe and knee pants of leather out of which his lower legs showed as gray hairy pillars of strength He had come into the salon with a swagger his sword ornament clanking A pleasant voyage so far he said to me as he started his meal His voice had the heavy throaty rasp characteristic of the Martian He spoke perfect English both Martians and Venus people are by heritage extraordinary linguists Miko and his sister Moa had a touch of Martian accent worn almost away by living for some years in Great New York The shock to me came within a few minutes Miko absorbed in attacking his meal inadvertently pushed back his robe to bare his forearm An instant only then it dropped again to his wrist But in that instant I had seen upon the gray flesh a thin sear turned red A very recent burn as though a pencil ray of heat had caught his arm My mind flung back Only last night in the City Corridor Snap and I had been followed by a Martian I had shot at him with the heat ray I thought I had hit him on the arm Was this the mysterious Martian who had followed us from Halsey s office CHAPTER V Venza the Venus Girl It was shortly after that mid day meal when I encountered Venza sitting on the starlit deck I had been in the bow observatory taken my routine castings of our position and worked them out I was I think of the Planetara s officers the most expert handler of the mathematical mechanical calculators The locating of our position and charting the trajectory of our course was under ordinary circumstances about all I had to do And it took only a few minutes each twelve hours I had a moment with Carter in the isolation of his chart room This voyage Gregg I m getting like you too fanciful We ve a normal group of passengers apparently but I don t like the look of any of them That Ob Hahn at your table Snaky looking fellow I commented He and the Englishman are great on arguments Did you have Prince s cabin searched My breath hung on his answer Yes Nothing unusual among his things We searched both his room and his sister s I did not follow that up Instead I told him about the burn on Miko s thick gray arm He stared I wish to the Almighty we were at Ferrok Shahn Gregg to night when the passengers are asleep come here to me Snap will be here and doctor Frank We can trust him He knows about about the Grantline treasure Yes And so do Balch and Blackstone Balch and Blackstone were our first and second officers We ll all meet here Gregg say about the zero hour We must take some precautions He suddenly felt he should say no more now He dismissed me I found Venza seated alone in a secluded corner of the starlit deck A porthole with the black heavens and the blazing stars was before her There was an empty seat nearby Hola lo six Gregg Sit here with me I have been wondering when you would come after me I sat down beside her What are you doing going to Mars Venza I m glad to see you Many thanks But I am glad to see you Gregg So handsome a man Do you know from Venus to the earth and I have no doubt on all of Mars no man will please me more Glib tongue I laughed Born to flatter the male every girl of your world And I added seriously You don t answer my question What takes you to Mars Contract By the stars what else Of course a chance to make a voyage with you Don t be silly Venza I enjoyed her I gazed at her small slim figure gracefully reclining in the deck chair Her long gray robe parted by design I have no doubt to display her shapely satin sheathed legs Her black hair was coiled in a heavy knot at the back of her neck her carmined lips were parted with a mocking alluring smile The exotic perfume of her enveloped me She glanced at me sidewise from beneath her sweeping black lashes Be serious I added I am serious Sober Intoxicated by you but sober I said What sort of a contract A theater in Ferrok Shahn Good money Gregg I m to be there a year She sat up to face me There s a fellow here on the Planetara Rance Rankin he calls himself At our table a big good looking blond American He says he is a magician Ever hear of him That s what he told me No I never heard of him Nor did I And I thought I had heard of everyone of any importance He is listed for the same theater where I m going Nice sort of fellow She paused and added suddenly If he s a professional entertainer I m a motor oiler It startled me Why do you say that Instinctively my gaze swept the deck An Earth woman and child and a small Venus man were in sight but not within earshot Why do you look so furtive she retorted Gregg there s something strange about this voyage I m no fool nor you and you know it as well as I do Rance Rankin I prompted She leaned closer toward me He could fool you But not me I ve known too many real magicians She grinned I challenged him to trick me You should have seen him trying to evade Do you know Ob Hahn I interrupted She shook her head Never heard of him But he told me plenty at breakfast By Satan what a flow of words that devil driver can muster He and the Englishman don t mesh very well do they She stared at me I had not answered her grin my mind was too busy with queer fancies Halsey s words Things are not always what they seem Were these passengers masqueraders Put here by George Prince And then I thought of Miko the Martian and the burn upon his arm Come back Gregg Don t go wandering off like that She dropped her voice to a whisper I ll be serious I want to know what in the hell is going on aboard this ship I m a woman and I m curious You tell me What do you mean I parried I mean a lot of things What we ve just been talking about And what was the excitement you were in just before breakfast this morning Excitement Gregg you may trust me For the first time she was wholly serious Her gaze made sure no one was within hearing She put her hand on my arm I could barely hear her whisper I know they might have a ray upon us I ll be careful They Anyone Something s going on You know it you are in it I saw you this morning Gregg Wild eyed chasing a phantom You And I heard the phantom A man s footsteps A magnetic reflecting invisible cloak You couldn t fool an audience with that it s too commonplace If Rance Rankin tried I gripped her Don t ramble Venza You saw me Yes My stateroom door was open I was sitting with a cigarillo I saw the purser in the smoking room He was visible from Wait Venza that prowler went through the smoking room I know he did I could hear him Did the purser hear him Of course The purser looked up followed the sound with his gaze I thought that was queer He never made a move And then you came along and he acted innocent Why What s going on that s what I want to know I held my breath Venza where did the prowler run to Can you She whispered calmly Into A twenty I saw the door open and close I even think I could see the blurred outline of him Those magnetic cloaks She added Why should George Prince be sneaking around with you after him And the purser acting innocent And who is this George Prince anyway The huge Martian Miko with his sister Moa came strolling along the deck They nodded as they passed us I whispered I can t explain anything now But you re right Venza there is something going on Listen Whatever you learn anything you encounter which looks unusual will you tell me I well I do trust you really I do but the thing isn t mine to tell The somber pools of her eyes were shining You are very lovable Gregg I won t question you She was trembling with excitement Whatever it is I want to be in it Here s something I can tell you now We ve two high class gold leaf gamblers aboard Did you know that No Who are Shac and Dud Ardley Let me state every detective in Great New York knows them They had a wonderful game with that Englishman Sir Arthur Coniston this morning Stripped him of half a pound of eight inch leaves a neat little stack A crooked game of course Those fellows are more nimble fingered than Rance Rankin ever dared to be I sat staring at her She was a mine of information this girl And Gregg I tried my charms on Shac and Dud Nice men but dumb Whatever s going on they re not in it They wanted to know what kind of a ship this was Why Because Shac has a cute little eavesdropping microphone of his own He had it working in the night last night He overheard George Prince and that big giant Miko arguing about the moon I gasped Venza softer Against all propriety of this public deck she pretended to drape herself upon me Her hair smothered my face as her lips almost touched my ear Something about treasure on the moon Shac couldn t understand what And they mentioned you He didn t hear what they said because the purser joined them Her whispered words tumbled over one another A hundred pounds of gold leaf that s the purser s price He s with them whatever it is He promised to do something for them She stopped Well I prompted That s all Shac s current was interrupted Tell him to try it again Venza I ll talk with him No I d better let him alone Can you get him to keep his mouth shut I think he might do anything I told him He s a man Find out what you can She sat away from me suddenly There s Anita and George Prince They came to the corner of the deck but turned back Venza caught my look And understood it So you love Anita Prince so much as that Gregg Venza was smiling I wish you I wish some man handsome as you would gaze after me like that She turned solemn You may be interested to know that she loves you I could see it I knew it when I mentioned you to her this morning Me Why we ve hardly spoken Is it necessary I never heard that it was I could not see Venza s face she stood up suddenly And when I rose beside her she whispered We should not be seen talking so long I ll find out what I can I stared after her slight robed figure as she turned into the lounge archway and vanished CHAPTER VI A Traitor and a Passing Asteroid Captain Carter was grim So they ve bought him off have they Go bring him in here Gregg We ll have it out with him now Snap doctor Frank Balch our first officer and I were in the captain s chart room It was four P M our Earth starting time We were sixteen hours upon our voyage I found Johnson in his office in the lounge Captain wants to see you Close up He closed his window upon an American woman passenger who was demanding details of Martian currency and followed me forward What is it Gregg I don t know Captain Carter banged the slide upon us The chart room was insulated The hum of the current was obvious Johnson noticed it He started at the hostile faces of the surgeon and Balch And he tried to bluster What is this Something wrong Carter wasted no words We have information Johnson there s some under cover plot here aboard I want to know what it is Suppose you tell us frankly The purser looked blank What do you mean We ve gamblers aboard if that s To hell with that growled Balch You had a secret interview with that Martian Set Miko and with George Prince Johnson scowled from under his heavy brows and then raised them in surprise Did I You mean changing their money I don t like your tone Balch I m not your under officer But you re under me roared the captain By God I m master here Well I m not disputing that said the purser mildly This fellow Balch We re in no mood for argument doctor Frank cut in Clouding the issue I won t let it be clouded the captain exclaimed I had never seen Carter so choleric He was evidently under a tremendous strain He added Johnson you ve been acting suspiciously I don t give a damn whether I ve proof of it or not I say it Did you or did you not meet George Prince and that Martian last night No I did not And I don t mind telling you Captain Carter that your tone also is offensive Is it Carter suddenly seized him They were both big men Johnson s heavy face went purplish red Take your hands They were struggling Carter s hands were fumbling at the purser s pockets I leaped flung an arm around Johnson s neck pinning him Easy there We ve got you Johnson Snap tried to help me Go on bang him on the head Gregg Now s your chance We searched him A heat ray cylinder that was legitimate But we found a small battery and eavesdropping microphone similar to the one Venza had mentioned that Shac the gambler was carrying What are you doing with that the captain demanded None of your business Is it criminal Carter I ll have the Line officials dismiss you for this Take your hands off me all of you Look at this exclaimed doctor Frank From Johnson s breast pocket the surgeon drew a folded document It was the scale drawing of the Planetara s interior corridors the lower control rooms and mechanisms It was always kept in Johnson s safe And with it another document the ship s clearance papers the secret code pass words for this voyage to be used if we should be challenged by any interplanetary police ship Snap gasped My God that was in my helio room strong box I m the only one on this vessel except the captain who s entitled to know those pass words Out of the silence Balch demanded Well what about it Johnson The purser was still defiant I won t answer your questions Balch At the proper time I ll explain Gregg Haljan you re choking me I eased up But I shook him You d better talk He was exasperatingly silent Enough exploded Carter He can explain when we get to port Meanwhile I ll put him where he ll do no more damage Gregg lock him in the cage We ignored his violent protestations The cage in the old days of sea vessels on Earth they called it the brig was the ship s jail A steel lined windowless room located under the deck in the peak of the bow I dragged the struggling Johnson there with the amazed watcher looking down from the observatory window at our lunging starlit forms Shut up Johnson If you know what s good for you He was making a fearful commotion Behind us where the deck narrowed at the superstructure half a dozen passengers were gazing in surprise I ll have you thrown out of the Service Gregg Haljan I shut him up finally And flung him down the ladder into the cage and sealed the deck trap door upon him I was headed back for the chart room when from the observatory came the lookout s voice An asteroid Haljan Officer Blackstone wants you I hurried to the turret bridge An asteroid was in sight We had attained nearly our maximum speed now An asteroid was approaching so dangerously close that our trajectory would have to be altered I heard Blackstone s signals ringing in the control rooms and met Carter as he ran to the bridge with me That scoundrel We ll get more out of him Gregg By God I ll put the chemicals on him torture him illegal or not We had no time for further discussion The asteroid was rapidly approaching Already under the glass it was a magnificent sight I had never seen this tiny world before asteroids are not numerous between the Earth and Mars or in toward Venus I never expected to see this one again How little of the future can we humans fathom for all our science If I could only have looked into the future even for a few short hours How different then would have been the outcome of this tragic voyage The asteroid came rushing at us Its orbital velocity I later computed was some twenty two miles a second Our own at the present maximum was a fraction over seventy seven The asteroid had for some time been under observation by the lookout He gave his warning only when it seemed that our trajectory should be altered to avoid a dangerously close passing At the combined speeds of nearly a hundred miles a second the asteroid swept into view With the naked eye at first it was a tiny speck of star dust unnoticed in the gem strewn black velvet of Space A speck Then a gleaming dot silver white with the light of our Sun upon it Five minutes The dot grew to a disc Expanding A full moon silver white Brightest world in the firmament the light from it bathed the Planetara illumined the deck painting everything with silver I stood with Carter and Blackstone on the turret bridge It was obvious that unless we altered our course the asteroid would pass too close for safety Already we were feeling its attraction from the control rooms came the report that our trajectory was disturbed by this new mass so near Better make your calculations now Gregg Blackstone suggested I cast up the rough elements from the observational instruments in the turret It took me some ten or fifteen minutes When I had us upon our new course with the attractive and repulsive plates in the Planetara s hull set in their altered combinations I went out to the bridge again The asteroid hung over our bow quarter No more than twenty or thirty thousand miles away A giant ball now filling all that quadrant of the heavens The configurations of its mountains its land and water areas were plainly visible Its axial rotation was apparent Perfectly habitable Blackstone said But I ve searched all over this hemisphere with the glass No sign of human life certainly nothing civilized nothing in the fashion of cities A fair little world by the look of it A tiny globe Blackstone had figured it at some eight hundred miles in diameter There seemed a normal atmosphere We could see areas where the surface was obscured by clouds And oceans and land masses Polar icecaps Lush vegetation at its equator Blackstone had roughly cast its orbital elements A narrow ellipse No wonder we had never encountered this fair little world before It had come from the outer region beyond Neptune At perihelion it would reach inside Mercury round the Sun and head outward again We swept past the asteroid at a distance of some six thousand miles Close enough in very truth a minute of flight at our combined speeds totaling a hundred miles a second I had descended to the passenger deck where I stood alone at a window gazing The passengers were all gathered to view the passing little world I saw not far from me Anita standing with her brother and the giant figure of Miko with them Half an hour since first with the naked eye this wandering little world had shown itself it swam slowly past began to dwindle behind us A huge half moon A thinner smaller quadrant A tiny crescent like a silver bar pin to adorn some lady s breast And then it was a dot a point of light indistinguishable among the myriad others hovering in this great black void The incident of the passing of the asteroid was over I turned from the deck window My heart leaped The moment for which all day I had been subconsciously longing was at hand Anita was sitting in a deck chair momentarily alone Her gaze was on me as I looked her way and she smiled an invitation for me to join her CHAPTER VII Unspoken Love Unspoken love I think if I had yielded to the impulse of my heart I would have poured out all those protestations of a lover s ecstasy incongruous here upon this starlit public deck to a girl I hardly knew I think too she might have received them with a tender acquiescence The starlight was mirrored in her dark eyes Misty eyes with great reaches of unfathomable space in their depths Yet I felt their tenderness Unfathomable strangeness of love Who am I to write of it with all the poets of all the ages striving to express the unexpressible A bond strangely fashioned by nature between me and this little dark haired Earth beauty As though marked by the stars we were destined to be lovers Thus ran the romance of my unspoken thoughts But I was sitting quietly in the deck chair striving to regard her gentle beauty impersonally And saying But Miss Prince why are you and your brother going to Ferrok Shahn His business Even as I voiced it I hated myself for such a question So nimble is the human mind that mingled with my rhapsodies of love was my need for information of George Prince Oh she said this is pleasure not business for George It seemed to me that a shadow crossed her expressive face But it was gone in an instant and she smiled We have always wanted to travel We are alone in the world you know our parents died when we were children I filled in her pause You will like Mars so many interesting things to see She nodded Yes I understand so Our Earth is so much the same all over cast all in one mould But a hundred or two hundred years ago it was not Miss Prince I have read how the picturesque Orient differing from well Great New York or London for instance Transportation did that she interrupted eagerly Made everything the same the people all look alike dress alike We discussed it She had an alert eager mind childlike with its curiosity yet strangely matured And her manner was naively earnest Yet this was no clinging vine this little Anita Prince There was a firmness a hint of masculine strength in her chin and in her manner If I were a man what wonders I could achieve in this marvelous age Her sense of humor made her laugh at herself Easy for a girl to say that she added You have greater wonders to achieve Miss Prince I said impulsively Yes What are they She had a very frank and level gaze devoid of coquetry My heart was pounding The wonders of the next generation A little son cast in your own gentle image What madness this clumsy brash talk I choked it off But she took no offense The dark rose petals of her cheeks were mantled deeper red but she laughed That is true She turned abruptly serious I should not laugh The wonders of the next generation conquering humans marching on Her voice trailed away My hand went to her arm Strange tingling something which poets call love It burned and surged from my trembling fingers into the flesh of her forearm The starlight glowed in her eyes She seemed to be gazing not at the silver lit deck but away into distant reaches of the future And she murmured A little son cast in my own gentle image But with the strength of his father Our moment Just a breathless moment given us as we sat there with my hand burning her arm as though we both might be seeing ourselves joined in a new individual a little son cast in his mother s gentle image and with the strength of his father Our moment and then it was over A step sounded I sat back The giant gray figure of Miko came past his great cloak swaying with his clanking sword ornament beneath it His bullet head with its close clipped hair was hatless He gazed at us swaggered past and turned the deck corner Our moment was gone Anita said conventionally It has been pleasant to talk with you mister Haljan But we ll have many more I said Ten days You think we ll reach Ferrok Shahn on schedule Yes 
8088_284756_000045_000001	train-clean-100	I think so 
none	none	As I was saying Miss Prince you ll enjoy Mars A strange aggressively forward looking people An oppression seemed on her She stirred in her chair Yes they are she said vaguely My brother and I know many Martians in Great New York She checked herself abruptly Was she sorry she had said that It seemed so Miko was coming back He stopped this time before us Your brother would see you Anita He sent me to bring you to his room The glance he shot me had a touch of insolence I stood up and he towered a head over me Anita said Oh yes I ll come I bowed I will see you again Miss Prince I thank you for a pleasant half hour The Martian led her away Her little figure was like a child with a giant It seemed as they passed the length of the deck with me staring after them that he took her arm roughly And that she shrank from him in fear And they did not go inside As though to show me that he had merely taken her from me he stopped at a distant deck window and stood talking to her Once he picked her up as one would pick up a child to show it some distant object through the window A little son with the strength of his father Her words echoed in my mind Was Anita afraid of this Martian s wooing Yet held to him by some power he might have over her brother The vagrant thought struck me Was it that CHAPTER VIII A Scream in the Night We kept on the Planetara always the time and routine of our port of departure The rest of that afternoon and evening were a blank of confusion to me Anita s words the touch of my hand upon her arm that vast realm of what might be for us like a glimpse of a magic land of happiness which I had seen in her eyes and perhaps she had seen in mine all this surged within me I wandered about the vessel I was not hungry I did not go to the dining salon for dinner I carried Johnson food and water to his cage and sat with my heat cylinder upon him listening to his threats of what would happen when he could complain to the Line s higher officials But what was Johnson doing carrying a plan of the ship s control rooms in his pockets And worse How had he dared open Snap s box in the helio room and abstract the code pass words for this voyage Without them we would be an outlawed vessel subject to arrest if any patrol hailed us Had Johnson been planning to sell those pass words to Miko I thought so I tried to get the confession out of him but could not I had a brief consultation with Captain Carter He was genuinely apprehensive now The Planetara carried no long range guns and very few side arms A half dozen of the heat ray hand projectors a few old fashioned weapons of explosion rifles and automatic revolvers And hand projectors with the new Benson curve light We had models of this for curved vision so that one might see around a corner so to speak And with them we could project the heat ray in a curve as well The weapons were all in Carter s chart room save the few we officers always carried Carter was apprehensive but of what he could not say He had not thought that our plan to stop at the Moon for treasure could affect this outward voyage Any danger would be upon the way back when the Planetara would be adequately guarded with long range electronic guns and manned with police soldiers But now we were practically defenseless I had a moment with Venza but she had nothing new to communicate to me And for half an hour I chatted with George Prince He seemed a gay pleasant young man I could almost have fancied I liked him Or was it because he was Anita s brother He told me how he looked forward to traveling with her on Mars No he had never been there before he said He had a measure of Anita s earnest naive personality Or was he a very clever scoundrel with irony lurking in his soft voice and a chuckle that he could so befool me We ll talk again Haljan You interest me I ve enjoyed it He sauntered away from me joining the saturnine Ob Hahn with whom presently I heard him discussing religion The arrest of Johnson had caused considerable comment among the passengers A few had seen me drag him forward to the cage The incident had been the subject of passenger discussion all afternoon Captain Carter had posted a notice to the effect that Johnson s accounts had been found in serious error and that doctor Frank for this voyage would act in his stead It was near midnight when Snap and I closed and sealed the helio room and started for the chart room where we were to meet with Captain Carter and the other officers The passengers had nearly all retired A game was in progress in the smoking room but the deck was almost deserted Snap and I were passing along one of the interior corridors The stateroom doors with the illumined names of the passengers were all closed The metal grid of the floor echoed our footsteps Snap was in advance of me His body suddenly rose in the air He went like a balloon to the ceiling struck it gently and all in a heap came floating down and landed on the floor What in the infernal He was laughing as he picked himself up But it was a brief laugh We knew what had happened the artificial gravity controls in the base of the ship which by magnetic force gave us normality aboard were being tampered with For just this instant this particular small section of this corridor had been cut off The slight bulk of the Planetara floating in space had no appreciable gravity pull on Snap s body and the impulse of his step as he came to the unmagnetized area of the corridor had thrown him to the ceiling The area was normal now Snap and I tested it gingerly He gripped me That never went wrong by accident Gregg Someone down there We rushed to the nearest descending ladder In the deserted lower room the bank of dials stood neglected A score of dials and switches were here governing the magnetism of different areas of the ship There should have been a night operator but he was gone Then we saw him lying nearby sprawled face down on the floor In the silence and dim lurid glow of the fluorescent tubes we stood holding our breaths peering and listening No one here The guard was not dead He lay unconscious from a blow on the head A brawny fellow We had him revived in a few moments A broadcast flash of the call buzz brought doctor Frank in haste from the chart room What s the matter We pointed at the unconscious man Someone was here I said hastily Experimenting with the magnetic switches Evidently unfamiliar with them pulling one or another to test their workings and so see the reactions on the dials We told him what had happened to Snap in the upper corridor doctor Frank revived the guard in a moment He was no worse off for the episode save a lump on his head and a nasty headache But he had little to tell us He had heard a step Saw nothing and then had been struck on the head by some invisible assailant We left him nursing his head sitting belligerent at his post Armed now with my heat ray cylinder which I loaned him Strange doings this voyage he told us All the crew knows it all been talkin about it I stick it out now but when we get back home I m done with this star travelin I belong on the sea anyway A good old freighter is all right for me We hurried back to the upper level We would indeed have to plan something at this chart room conference This was the first tangible attack our adversaries had made We were on the passenger deck headed for the chart room when all three of us stopped short frozen with horror Through the silent passenger quarters a scream rang out A girl s shuddering gasping scream Terror in it Horror Or a scream of agony In the silence of the dully vibrating ship it was utterly horrible It lasted an instant a single long scream then was abruptly stilled And with blood pounding my temples and rushing like ice through my veins I recognized it Anita CHAPTER IX The Murder in A twenty two Good God what was that doctor Frank s face had gone white in the starlight Snap stood like a statue of horror The deck here was patched as always silver radiance from the deck ports The empty deck chairs stood about The scream was stilled but now we heard a commotion inside the rasp of opening cabin doors questions from frightened passengers the scurry of feet I found my voice Anita Anita Prince Come on shouted Snap Was it the Prince girl I thought so too In her stateroom A twenty two He was dashing for the lounge archway doctor Frank and I followed I realized that we passed the deck door and window of A twenty two But they were dark and evidently sealed on the inside The dim lounge was in a turmoil passengers standing at their cabin doors I heard Sir Arthur Coniston I say what was that Over there said another man Come back inside Martha He shoved his wife back mister Haljan He plucked at me as I went past I shouted Go back to your rooms We want order here keep back We came to the twin doors of A twenty two and A twenty Both were closed doctor Frank was in advance of Snap and me He paused at the sound of Captain Carter s voice behind us Was it from in there Wait a moment Carter dashed up he had a large heat ray projector in his hand He shoved us aside Let me in first Is the door sealed Gregg keep those passengers back The door was not sealed Carter burst into the room I heard him gasp Good God Snap and I shoved back three or four crowding passengers and in that instant doctor Frank had been in the room and out again There s been an accident Get back Gregg Snap help him keep the crowd away He shoved me forcibly From within Carter was shouting Keep them out Where are you Frank Come back here Send a flash for Balch I want Balch doctor Frank went back into the room and banged the cabin door upon Snap and me I was unarmed I had loaned my cylinder to the guard in the lower corridor Weapon in hand Snap forced the panic stricken passengers back to their rooms It s all right An accident Miss Prince is hurt Snap reassured them glibly but he knew no more about it than I Moa with a night robe drawn tight around her thin tall figure edged up to me What has happened Set Haljan I gazed around for her brother Miko but did not see him An accident I said shortly Go back to your room Captain s orders She eyed me and then retreated Snap was threatening everybody with his cylinder Balch dashed up What in the hell Where s Carter In there I pounded on A twenty two It opened cautiously I could see only Carter but I heard the murmuring voice of doctor Frank through the interior connecting door to A twenty The captain rasped Get out Haljan Oh is that you Balch Come in He admitted the older officer and slammed the door again upon me And immediately reopened it Gregg keep the passengers quiet Tell them everything s all right Miss Prince got frightened that s all Then go up to the turret Tell Blackstone what s happened But I don t know what s happened I protested miserably Carter was grim and white He whispered I think it may turn out to be murder Gregg No not dead yet doctor Frank is trying Don t stand there like an ass man Get to the turret Verify our trajectory no wait The captain was almost incoherent Wait a minute I don t mean that Tell Snap to watch his helio room Gregg you and Blackstone stay in the chart room Arm yourselves and guard our weapons By God this murderer whoever he is I stammered If if she dies will you flash us word He stared at me strangely I ll be there presently Gregg He slammed the door upon me I followed his orders but it was like a dream of horror The turmoil of the ship gradually quieted Snap went to the helio room Blackstone and I sat in the tiny steel chart room How much time passed I do not know I was confused Anita hurt She might die Murdered But why By whom Had George Prince been in his own room when the attack came I thought now I recalled hearing the low murmur of his voice in there with doctor Frank and Carter Where was Miko It stabbed at me I had not seen him among the passengers in the lounge Carter came into the chart room Gregg you get to bed you look like a ghost But She s not dead she may live doctor Frank and her brother are with her They re doing all they can He told us what had happened Anita and George Prince had both been asleep each in their respective rooms Someone unknown had opened Anita s corridor door Wasn t it sealed I demanded Yes But the intruder opened it Burst it I didn t think it was broken It wasn t broken The assailant opened it somehow and assaulted Miss Prince shot her in the chest with a heat ray Her left lung She is conscious Balch demanded Yes But she did not see who did it Nor did Prince Her scream awakened him but the intruder evidently fled out the corridor door of A twenty two the way he entered I stood weak and shaken at the chart room entrance A little son cast in the gentle image of his mother But with the strength of his father But Anita dying perhaps and all my dreams were fading into a memory of what might have been You go to bed Gregg we don t need you I was glad enough to get away I would lie down for an hour and then go to Anita s stateroom I d demand that doctor Frank let me see her if only for a moment I went to the stern deck space where my cubby was located My mind was confused but some instinct within me made me verify the seals of my door and window They were intact I entered cautiously switched on the dimmer of the tube lights and searched the room It had only a bunk my tiny desk a chair and clothes robe There was no evidence of any intruder here I set my door and window alarm Then I audiphoned to the helio room Snap Yes I told him about Anita Carter cut in on us from the chart room Stop that you fools We cut off Fully dressed I flung myself on my bed Anita might die I must have fallen into a tortured sleep I was awakened by the sound of my alarm buzzer Someone was tampering with my door Then the buzzer ceased the marauder outside must have found a way of silencing it But it had done its work awakened me I had switched off the light my cubby was Stygian dark A heat cylinder was in the bunk bracket over my head I searched for it pried it loose softly I was fully awake Alert I could hear a faint sizzling someone outside trying to unseal the door In the darkness cylinder in hand I crept from the bunk Crouched at the door This time I would capture or kill this night prowler The sizzling was faintly audible My door seal was breaking Upon impulse I reached for the door jerked it open No one there The starlit segment of deck was empty But I had leaped and I struck a solid body crouching in the doorway A giant man Miko His electronized metallic robe burned my hands I lunged against him I was almost as surprised as he I shot but the stab of heat evidently missed him The shock of my encounter close circuited his robe he materialized in the starlight A brief savage encounter He struck the weapon from my hand He had dropped his hydrogen torch and tried to grip me But I twisted away from his hold So it s you Be quiet Gregg Haljan I only want to talk Without warning a stab of radiance shot from a weapon in his hand It caught me Ran like ice through my veins Seized and numbed my limbs I fell helpless to the deck Nerves and muscles paralyzed My tongue was thick and inert I could not speak nor move But I could see Miko bending over me And hear him I don t want to kill you Haljan We need you He gathered me up like a bundle in his huge arms carried me swiftly across the deserted deck Snap s helio room in the network under the dome was diagonally overhead A white actinic light shot from it caught us bathed us Snap had been awake had heard the slight commotion of our encounter His voice rang shrilly Stop I ll shoot His warning siren rang out to arouse the ship His spotlight clung to us Miko ran with me a few steps Then he cursed and dropped me fled away I fell like a sack of carbide to the deck My senses faded into blackness He s all right now I was in the chart room with Captain Carter Snap and doctor Frank bending over me The surgeon said Can you speak now Gregg I tried it My tongue was thick but it would move Yes I was soon revived I sat up with doctor Frank vigorously rubbing me I m all right I told them what had happened Captain Carter said abruptly Yes we know that And it was Miko also who killed Anita Prince She told us before she died Died I leaped to my feet She died Yes Gregg An hour ago Miko got into her stateroom and tried to force his love on her She repulsed him he killed her It struck me blank And then with a rush came the thought He says Miko killed her I heard myself stammering Why why we must get him I gathered my wits a surge of hate swept me a wild desire for vengeance Why by God where is he Why don t you go get him I ll get him I ll kill him I tell you Easy Gregg doctor Frank gripped me The captain said gently We know how you feel Gregg She told us before she died I ll bring him in here to you But I ll kill him I tell you No you won t lad You re hysterical now We don t want him killed not attacked even Not yet We ll explain later They sat me down calming me Anita dead The door of the shining garden was closed A brief glimpse given to me and to her of what might have been And now she was dead CHAPTER X A Speck of Human Earth dust Falling Free I had not been able at first to understand why Captain Carter wanted Miko left at liberty Within me there was that cry of vengeance as though to strike Miko down would somehow lessen my own grief at Anita s loss Whatever Carter s purpose Snap had not known it But Balch and doctor Frank were in the captain s confidence all three of them working on some plan of action Snap and I argued it and thought we could fathom it and in spite of my desire to kill Miko the thing looked reasonable It was obvious that at least two of our passengers were plotting with Miko and George Prince trying during this voyage to learn what they could about Grantline s activities on the Moon scheming doubtless to seize the treasure when the Planetara stopped at the Moon on the return voyage I thought I could name those masquerading passengers Ob Hahn supposedly a Venus Mystic And Rance Rankin who called himself an American magician Those two Snap and I agreed seemed most suspicious And there was the purser With my hysteria still on me I sat for a time on the deck outside the chart room with Snap Then Carter summoned us back and we sat listening while he Balch and doctor Frank went on with their conference Listening to them I could not but agree that our best plan was to secure evidence which would incriminate all who were concerned in the plot Miko we were convinced had been the Martian who followed Snap and me from Halsey s office in Great New York George Prince had doubtless been the invisible eavesdropper outside the helio room He knew and had told the others that Grantline had found radium ore on the Moon that the Planetara would stop there on the way home But we could not incarcerate George Prince for being an eavesdropper Nor had we the faintest tangible evidence against Ob Hahn or Rance Rankin And even the purser would probably be released by the Interplanetary Court of Ferrok Shahn when it heard our evidence There was only Miko We could arrest him for the murder of Anita But the others would be put on their guard It was Carter s idea to let Miko remain at liberty for a time and see if we could not identify and incriminate his fellows The murder of Anita obviously had nothing to do with any plot against the Grantline Moon treasure Why exclaimed Balch there might be probably are huge Martian interests concerned in this thing These men here aboard are only emissaries making this voyage to learn what they can When they get to Ferrok Shahn they ll make their report and then we ll have a real danger on our hands Why an outlaw ship could be launched from Ferrok Shahn that would beat us back to the Moon and Grantline is entirely without warning of any danger It seemed obvious Unscrupulous moneyed criminals in Ferrok Shahn would be dangerous indeed once these details of Grantline were given them And so now it was decided that in the remaining nine days of our outward voyage we would attempt to secure enough evidence to arrest all these plotters I ll have them all in the cage when we land Carter declared grimly They ll make no report to their principals The thing will end be stamped out Ah the futile plans of men Yet we thought it practical We were all doubly armed now Explosive bullet projectors and the heat ray cylinders And we had several eavesdropping microphones which we planned to use whenever occasion offered It was now Earth Eastern Time A M Twenty eight hours only of this eventful voyage were passed The Planetara was some six million miles from the Earth it blazed behind us a tremendous giant The body of Anita was being made ready for burial George Prince was still in his stateroom Glutz effeminate little hairdresser who waxed rich acting as beauty doctor for the women passengers and who in his youth had been an undertaker had gone with doctor Frank to prepare the body Gruesome details I tried not to think of them I sat numbed in the chart room An astronomical burial there was little precedent for it I dragged myself to the stern deck space where at five A M the ceremony took place Most of the passengers were asleep unaware of all this which was why Carter hastened it We were a solemn little group gathered there in the checkered starlight with the great vault of the heavens around us A dismantled electronic projector necessary when a long range gun was mounted had been rigged up in one of the deck ports They brought out the body I stood apart gazing reluctantly at the small bundle wrapped like a mummy in a dark metallic screen cloth A patch of black silk rested over her face Four cabin stewards carried her And beside her walked George Prince A long black robe covered him but his head was bare And suddenly he reminded me of the ancient play character of Hamlet His black wavy hair his finely chiseled pallid face set now in a stern patrician cast And staring I realized that however much of a villain this man not yet thirty might be at this instant walking beside the body of his dead sister he was stricken with grief He loved that sister with whom he had lived since childhood and to see him now with his set white face no one could doubt it The little procession stopped in a patch of starlight by the port They rested the body on a bank of chairs The black robed Chaplain roused from his bed and still trembling from excitement of this sudden inexplicable death on board said a brief solemn little prayer An appeal That the Almighty Ruler of all these blazing worlds might guard the soul of this gentle girl whose mortal remains were now to be returned to Him Ah if ever God seemed hovering close it was now at this instant on this starlit deck floating in the black void of space Then Carter for just a moment removed the black shroud from her face I saw her brother gaze silently saw him stoop and implant a kiss and turn away I did not want to look but I found myself moving slowly forward She lay so beautiful Her face white and calm and peaceful in death My sight blurred Words seemed to echo A little son cast in the gentle image of his mother Easy Gregg Snap was whispering to me He had his arm around me Come on away They tied the shroud over her face I did not see them as they put her body in the tube sent it through the exhaust chamber and dropped it But a moment later I saw it a small black oblong bundle hovering beside us It was perhaps a hundred feet away circling us Held by the Planetara s bulk it had momentarily become our satellite It swung around us like a moon Gruesome satellite by nature s laws forever to follow us Then from another tube at the bow Blackstone operated a small Zed company ray projector Its dull light caught the floating bundle neutralizing its metallic wrappings It swung off at a tangent Speeding Falling free in the dome of the heavens A rotating black oblong But in a moment distance dwindled it to a speck A dull silver dot with the sunlight on it A speck of human Earth dust falling free It vanished Anita gone In my heart was an echo of the prayer that the Almighty might watch over her and guard her always CHAPTER XI The Electrical Eavesdropper I turned from the deck Miko was near me So he had dared to show himself here among us But I realized that he could not be aware we knew he was the murderer George Prince had been asleep had not seen Miko with Anita Miko with impulsive rage had shot the girl and escaped No doubt now he was cursing himself for having done it And he could very well assume that Anita had died without regaining consciousness to tell who had killed her He gazed at me now here on the deck I thought for an instant he was coming over to talk to me Though he probably considered he was not suspected of the murder of Anita he realized of course that his attack on me was known he must have wondered what action Captain Carter would take But he did not approach me he moved away and went inside Moa had been near him and as though by pre arrangement with him she now accosted me I want to speak to you Set Haljan Go ahead I felt an instinctive aversion for this Martian girl Yet she was not unattractive Over six feet tall straight and slim Sleek blond hair Rather a handsome face Not gray like the burly Miko but pink and white Stern lipped yet feminine too She was smiling gravely now Her blue eyes regarded me keenly She said gently A sad occurrence Gregg Haljan And mysterious I would not question you Is that all you have to say I demanded when she paused No You are a handsome man Gregg attractive to women to any Martian woman She said it impulsively Admiration for me was on her face in her eyes a man cannot miss it Thank you I mean I would be your friend My brother Miko is so sorry about what happened between you and him this morning He only wanted to talk to you and he came to your cubby door With a torch to break its seal I interjected She waved that away He was afraid you would not admit him He told you he would not hurt you And so he struck me with one of your cursed Martian paralyzing rays He is sorry She seemed gauging me trying no doubt to find out what reprisal would be taken against her brother I felt sure that Moa was as active as a man in any plan that was under way to capture the Grantline treasure Miko with his ungovernable temper was doing things that put their plans in jeopardy I demanded abruptly What did your brother want to talk to me about Me she said surprisingly I sent him A Martian girl goes after what she wants Did you know that She swung on her heel and left me I puzzled over it Was that why Miko had struck me down and was carrying me off Was my accursed masculine beauty so attractive to this Martian girl I did not think so I could not believe that all these incidents were so unrelated to what I knew was the main undercurrent They wanted me had tried to capture me For something else than because Moa liked my looks doctor Frank found me mooning alone Go to bed Gregg You look awful I don t want to go to bed Where s Snap I don t know He was here a while ago I had not seen him since the burial of Anita The captain wants him The surgeon left me Within an hour the morning siren would arouse the passengers I was seated in a secluded corner of the deck when George Prince came along He went past me a slight somber dark robed figure He had on high thick boots A hood was over his head but as he saw me he pushed it back and dropped down beside me But for a moment he did not speak His face showed pallid in the pallid star gleams She said you loved her His soft voice was throaty with emotion Yes I said it almost against my will There seemed a bond springing between this bereaved brother and me He added so softly I could barely hear him That makes you I think almost my friend And you thought you were my enemy I held my answer An incautious tongue running under emotion is a dangerous thing And I was sure of nothing He went on Almost my friend Because we both loved her and she loved us both He was hardly more than whispering And there is aboard one whom we both hate Miko It burst from me Yes But do not say it Another silence fell between us He brushed back the black curls from his forehead And his dark eyes searched mine Have you an eavesdropping microphone Haljan I hesitated Yes I was thinking He leaned closer toward me If in half an hour you could use it upon Miko s cabin I would rather tell you than the captain or anyone else The cabin will be insulated but I shall find a way of cutting off that insulation so that you may hear So George Prince had turned with us The shock of his sister s death himself allied to her murderer had been too much for him He was with us Yet his help must be given secretly Miko would kill him in an instant if it became known He had been watchful of the deck He stood up now I think that is all As he turned away I murmured But I do thank you The name Set Miko glowed upon the small metal door It was in a transverse corridor similar to A twenty two The corridor was forward of the lounge it opened off the small circular library The library was unoccupied and unlighted dim with only the reflected lights from the nearby passages I crouched behind a cylinder case The door of Miko s room was in sight being some thirty feet away from me I waited perhaps five minutes No one entered Then I realized that doubtless the conspirators were already there I set my tiny eavesdropper on the library floor beside me connected its little battery focused its projector Was Miko s room insulated I could not tell There was a small ventilating grid above the door Across its opening if the room were insulated a blue sheen of radiance would be showing And there would be a faint hum But from this distance I could not see or hear such details and I was afraid to approach closer Once in the transverse corridor I would have no place to hide no way of escape if anyone approached Miko s door I would be discovered I threw the current into my little apparatus I prayed if it met interference that the slight sound would pass unnoticed George Prince had said he would make opportunity to disconnect the room s insulation He had evidently done so I picked up the interior sounds at once my headphone vibrated with them And with trembling fingers on the little dial between my knees as I crouched in the darkness behind the cylinder case I synchronized Johnson is a fool It was Miko s voice We must have the pass words He got them from the helio room A man s voice I puzzled over it at first then recognized it Rance Rankin Miko said He is a fool Walking around this ship as though with letters blazoned on his forehead Watch me I need watching Hah No wonder they apprehended him Was George Prince in there Rankin s voice said He would have turned the papers over to us I would not blame him too much What harm Oh I ll release him Miko declared What harm That braying ass did us plenty of harm He has lost the pass words Better he had left them in the helio room Moa was in the room Her voice said We ve got to have them The Planetara upon such an important voyage as this may be watched How do we know It is no doubt Rankin said quietly We ought to have the pass words When we are in control of this ship It sent a shiver through me Were they planning to try and seize the Planetara Now It seemed so Johnson undoubtedly memorized them Moa was saying When we get him out Hahn is to do that at the signal Miko added George could do it better perhaps And then I heard George Prince for the first time He murmured I will try No need said Miko I praise where praise is deserved And I have little praise for you now George I could not see what happened A look perhaps which Prince could not avoid giving this man he had come to hate Miko doubtless saw it and the Martian s hot anger leaped Rankin said hurriedly Stop that And Moa Let him alone Sit down you fool I could hear the sound of a scuffle A blow a cry half suppressed from George Prince Then Miko I will not hurt him Craven coward Look at him Hating me frightened I could fancy George Prince sitting there with murder in his heart and Miko taunting him Hates me now because I shot his sister Moa Hush I will not Why should I not say it I will tell you something else George Prince It was not Anita I shot at but you I meant nothing for her but love If you had not interfered This was different from what we had figured George Prince had come in from his own room had tried to rescue his sister and in the scuffle Anita had taken the shot intended for George I did not even know I had hit her Miko was saying Not until I heard she was dead He added sardonically I hoped it was you I had hit George And I will tell you this You hate me no more than I hate you If it were not for your knowledge of radium ores Is this to be a personal wrangle Rankin interrupted I thought we were here to plan It is planned Miko said shortly I give orders I do not plan I am waiting now for the moment He checked himself Moa said Does Rankin understand that no harm is to come to Gregg Haljan Yes said Rankin And Dean We need them of course But you cannot make Dean send messages if he refuses nor make Haljan navigate I know enough to check on them Miko said grimly They will not fool me And they will obey me have no fear A little touch of sulphuric His laugh was gruesome It makes the most stubborn very willing I wish said Moa we had Haljan safely hidden If he is hurt killed So that was why Miko had tried to capture me To keep me safe so that I might navigate the ship It occurred to me that I should get Carter at once A plot to seize the Planetara But when I froze with startled horror The diaphragms at my ears rang with Miko s words I have set the time for now In two minutes It seemed to startle both Rankin and George Prince almost as much as I Both exclaimed No No Why not Everyone is at his post Prince repeated No And Rankin But can we trust them The stewards the crew Eight of them are our own men You didn t know that Rankin They ve been aboard the Planetara for several voyages Oh this is no quickly planned affair even though we let you in on it so recently You and Johnson By God I crouched tense There was a commotion in the stateroom Miko had discovered that his insulation was cut off He had evidently leaped to his feet I heard a chair overturn And the Martian s roar It s off Did you do that Prince By God if I thought My apparatus went suddenly dead as Miko flung on his insulation I lost my wits in the confusion I should have instantly taken off my vibrations There was interference it showed in the dark space of the ventilator grid over Miko s doorway a snapping in the air there a swirl of sparks I heard with my unaided ears Miko s roar over his insulation By God they re listening The scream of a hand siren sounded from his stateroom It rang over the ship His signal I heard it answered from some distant point And then a shot a commotion in the lower corridors The attack upon the Planetara had started I was on my feet The shouts of startled passengers sounded a turmoil beginning everywhere I stood momentarily transfixed The door of Miko s stateroom burst open He stood there with Moa Rankin and George Prince crowding behind him He saw me You Gregg Haljan He came leaping at me CHAPTER XII The Weightless Combat I was taken wholly by surprise There was an instant when I stood numbed fumbling for a weapon at my belt undecided whether to run or stand my ground Miko was no more than twenty feet from me He checked his forward rush The light from an overhead tube was on him I saw in his hand the cylinder projector of his paralyzing ray I plucked my heat cylinder from my belt and fired without taking aim My tiny heat beam flashed I must have grazed Miko s hand His roar of anger and pain rang out over the turmoil He dropped his weapon then stooped to pick it up But Moa forestalled him She leaped and seized it Careful Fool you promised not to hurt him A confusion of swift action Rankin had turned and darted away I saw George Prince stumbling half in front of the struggling Miko and Moa And I heard footsteps beside me a hand gripped me jerked at me Over the turmoil Prince s voice sounded Gregg Haljan I recall I had the impression that Prince was frightened he had half fallen in front of Miko And there was Miko s voice Let go of me And Moa Come It was Balch gripping me Gregg This way run Get out of here He ll kill you with that ray Miko s ray flashed but George Prince had knocked at his arm I did not dare fire again Prince was in the way Balch who was unarmed shoved me violently back Gregg the chart room I turned and ran with Balch after me Prince had fallen or been felled by Miko A flash followed me Miko s weapon but again it missed He did not pursue me he ran the other way through the port side door of the library Balch and I found ourselves in the lounge Shouting frightened passengers were everywhere The place was in wild confusion the whole ship ringing now with shouts To the chart room Gregg I called to the passengers Get back to your rooms I followed Balch We ran through the archway to the deck In the starlight I saw figures scurrying aft but none were near us The deck forward was dim with heavy shadows The oval window and door of the chart room were blue yellow from the tube lights inside No one seemed on the deck there and then as we approached I saw further forward in the bow the trap door to the cage standing open Johnson had been released From one of the chart room windows a heat ray sizzled It barely missed us Balch shouted Carter don t The captain called Oh you Balch and Haljan He came out on the deck as we rushed up His left arm was dangling limp God this He got no further From the turret overhead a tiny search beam came down and disclosed us Blackstone was supposed to be on duty up there with a course master at the controls But glancing up I saw illumined by the turret lights the figures of Ob Hahn in his purple white robe and Johnson the purser And on the turret balcony two fallen men Blackstone and the course master Johnson was training the spotlight on us And Hahn fired a Martian ray It struck Balch beside me He dropped Carter was shouting Inside Gregg get inside I stopped to raise up Balch Another beam came down A heat ray this time It caught the fallen Balch full in the chest piercing him through The smell of his burning flesh rose to sicken me He was dead I dropped his body Carter shoved me into the chart room In the small steel lined room Carter and I slid the door closed We were alone here The thing had come so quickly it had taken Captain Carter like us all wholly unawares We had anticipated spying eavesdroppers but not this open brigandage No more than a minute or two had passed since Miko s siren in his stateroom had given the signal for the attack Carter had been in the chart room Blackstone was in the turret At the outbreak of confusion Carter dashed out to see Hahn releasing Johnson from the cage From the forward chart room window now I could see where Hahn with a torch had broken the cage seal The torch lay on the deck There had been an exchange of shots Carter s arm was paralyzed Johnson and Hahn had escaped Carter was as confused as I There had simultaneously been an encounter up in the turret Blackstone and the course master were killed The lookout had been shot from his post in the forward observatory His body dangled now twisted half in and half out of his window We could see several of Miko s men erstwhile members of our crew and steward corps scurrying from the turret along the upper bridges toward the dark and silent helio room Snap was up there But was he The helio room glowed suddenly with dim light but there was no evidence of a fight there The fighting seemed mostly below the deck down in the hull corridors A blended horror of sounds came up to us Screams shouts and the hissing and snapping of ray weapons Our crew such of them as were loyal were making a stand down below But it was brief Within a minute it died away The passengers amidships in the superstructure were still shouting Then above them Miko s roar sounded Be quiet Go in your rooms you will not be harmed The brigands in these few minutes were in control of the ship All but this little chart room where with most of the ship s weapons Carter and I were intrenched God Gregg that this should come upon us Carter was fumbling with the chart room weapons Here Gregg help me What have you got Heat ray That s all I had ready It struck me then as I helped him make the connections that Carter in this crisis was at best an inefficient commander His red face had gone splotchy purple his hands were trembling Skilled as captain of a peaceful liner he was at a loss now Nor could I blame him It is easy to say we might have taken warning done this or that and come triumphant through this attack But only the fool looks backward and says I would have done better I tried to summon my wits The ship was lost to us unless Carter and I could do something Our futile weapons They were all here four or five heat ray hand projectors that could send a pencil ray a hundred feet or so I shot one diagonally up at the turret where Johnson was leering down at our rear window but he saw my gesture and dropped back out of sight The heat beam flashed harmlessly up and struck the turret roof Then across the turret window came a sheen of radiance an electro barrage And behind it Hahn s suave evil face appeared He shouted down We have orders to spare you Gregg Haljan or you would have been killed long ago My answering shot hit his barrage with a shower of sparks behind which he stood unmoved Carter handed me another weapon Gregg try this I levelled the old explosive bullet projector Carter crouched beside me But before I could press the trigger from somewhere down the starlit deck an electro beam hit me The little rifle exploded burst its breech I sank back to the floor tingling from the shock of the hostile current My hands were blackened from the exploding powder Carter seized me No use Hurt No The stars through the dome windows were swinging A long swing the shadows and starlit patches on the deck were all shifting The Planetara was turning The heavens revolved in a great round sweep of movement then settled as we took our new course Hahn at the turret controls had swung us The earth and the sun showed over our bow quarter The sunlight mingled red yellow with the brilliant starlight Hahn s signals were sounding I heard them answered from the mechanism rooms down below Brigands there in full control The gravity plates were being set to the new positions we were on our new course Headed a point or two off the Earth line Not headed for the moon I wondered Carter and I were planning nothing What was there to plan We were under observation A Martian paralyzing ray or electronic beam far more deadly than our own puny police weapons would have struck us the instant we tried to leave the chart room My swift running thoughts were interrupted by a shout from down the deck At a corner of the cabin superstructure some fifty feet from our windows the figure of Miko appeared A barrage radiance hung around him like a shimmering mantle His voice sounded Gregg Haljan do you yield Carter leaped up from where he and I were crouching Against all reason of safety he leaned from the low window waving his hamlike fist Yield No I am in command here you pirate Brigand murderer I pushed him back Careful He was spluttering and over it Miko s sardonic laugh sounded Very well but you will talk Shall we argue about it I stood up What do you want to say Miko Behind him the tall thin figure of his sister showed She was plucking at him He turned violently I won t hurt him Gregg Haljan is this a truce You will not shoot He was shielding Moa No I called For a moment no A truce What is it you want to say I could hear the babble of passengers who were herded in the cabin with brigands guarding them George Prince bareheaded but shrouded in his cloak showed in a patch of light behind Moa He looked my way and then retreated into the lounge archway Miko called You must yield We want you Haljan No doubt I jeered Alive It is easy to kill you I could not doubt that Carter and I were little more than rats in a trap here in the chart room But Miko wanted to take me alive that was not so simple He added persuasively We want you to help us navigate Will you No Will you help us Captain Carter Tell your cub this Haljan to yield You are fools We understand that Haljan has been handling the ship s mathematics Him we need most Carter roared Get back from there This is no truce I shoved aside his levelled bullet projector Wait a minute I called to Miko Navigate where Oh he retorted that is our business not yours When you lay down your weapons and come out of there I will give you the course Back to the earth I suggested I could fancy him grinning behind the sheen of his barrage at my question The earth Yes shall we go there Give me your orders Gregg Haljan Of course I will obey them His sardonic words were interrupted And I realized that all this parley was a ruse of Miko s to take me alive He had made a gesture Hahn watching from the turret window doubtless flashed a signal down to the hull corridors The magnetizer control under the chart room was altered our artificial gravity cut off I felt the sudden lightness I gripped the window casement and clung Carter was startled into incautious movement It flung him out into the center of the chart room his arms and legs grotesquely flailing And across the chart room in the opposite window I felt rather than saw the shape of something A figure almost invisible but not quite was trying to climb in I flung the empty rifle I was holding It hit something solid in the window in a flare of sparks a black hooded figure materialized A man climbing in His weapon spat There was a tiny electronic flash deadly silent The intruder had shot at Carter struck him Carter gave one queer scream He had floated to the floor his convulsive movement when he was hit hurled him to the ceiling His body struck twitched bounced back and sank inert on the floor grid almost at my feet I clung to the casement Across the space of the weightless room the hooded intruder was also clinging His hood fell back It was Johnson He leered at me Killed him the bully Well he deserved it Now for you mister Third Officer Haljan But he did not dare fire at me Miko had forbidden it I saw him reach under his robe doubtless for a low powered paralyzing ray such as Miko already had used on me But he never got it out I had no weapon within reach I leaned into the room still holding the casement and doubled my legs under me I kicked out from the window The force catapulted me across the space of the room like a volplane I struck the purser We gripped Our locked struggling bodies bounced out into the room We struck the floor surged up like balloons to the ceiling struck it with a flailing arm or a leg and floated back Grotesque abnormal combat Like fighting in weightless water Johnson clutched his weapon but I twisted his wrist held his arm outstretched so that he could not aim it I was aware of Miko s voice shouting on the deck outside Johnson s left hand was gouging at my face his fingers plucking at my eyes We lunged down to the floor then up again close to the ceiling I twisted his wrists He dropped the weapon and it sank away I tried to reach it but could not Then I had him by the throat I was stronger than he and more agile I tried choking him his thick bull neck within my fingers He kicked scrambled tore and gouged at me Tried to shout but it ended in a gurgle And then as he felt his breath stopped his hands came up in an effort to tear mine loose We sank again to the floor We were momentarily upright I felt my feet touch I bent my knees We sank further And then I kicked violently upward Our locked bodies shot to the ceiling Johnson s head was above me It struck the steel roof of the chart room A violent blow I felt him go suddenly limp I cast him off and doubling my body I kicked at the ceiling It sent me diagonally downward to the window where I clung and regained stability And I saw Miko standing on the deck with a weapon levelled at me CHAPTER XIII The Torture Haljan Yield or I ll fire Moa give me the smaller one This cursed He had in his hand too large a projector Its ray would kill me If he wanted to take me alive he would not fire I chanced it No I tried to draw myself beneath the window An automatic bullet projector was on the floor where Carter had dropped it I pulled myself down Miko did not fire I reached the revolver The dead bodies of the captain and purser had drifted together on the floor in the center of the room I hitched myself back to the window With upraised weapon I gazed cautiously out Miko had disappeared The deck within my line of vision was empty But was it Something told me to beware I clung to the casement ready upon the instant to shove myself down There was a movement in a shadow along the deck Then a figure rose up Don t fire Haljan The sharp command half appeal stopped the pressure of my finger on the trigger of the automatic It was the tall lanky Englishman Sir Arthur Coniston as he called himself So he too was one of Miko s band The light through a dome window fell full on him If you fire Haljan and kill me Miko will kill you then surely From where he had been crouching he could not command my window But now upon the heels of his placating words he abruptly shot The low powered ray had it struck would have felled me without killing But it went over my head as I dropped Its aura made my senses reel Coniston shouted Haljan I did not answer I wondered if he would dare approach to see if I had been hit A minute passed Then another I thought I heard Miko s voice on the deck outside But it was an aerial microscopic whisper close beside me We see you Haljan You must yield Their eavesdropping vibrations with audible projection were upon me I retorted aloud Come and get me You cannot take me alive I do protest if this action of mine in the chart room may seem bravado I had no wish to die There was within me a very healthy desire for life But I felt by holding out that some chance might come wherewith I might turn events against these brigands Yet reason told me it was hopeless Our loyal members of the crew were killed no doubt Captain Carter and Balch were killed The lookouts and Course masters also And Blackstone There remained only doctor Frank and Snap Their fate I did not yet know And there was George Prince He perhaps would help me if he could But at best he was a dubious ally You are very foolish Haljan murmured the projection of Miko s voice And then I heard Coniston See here why would not a hundred pounds of gold leaf tempt you The code words which were taken from Johnson I mean to say why not tell us where they are So that was one of the brigands new difficulties Snap had taken the code word sheet that time we sealed the purser in the cage I said You ll never find them And when a police ship sights us what will you do then The chances of a police ship were slim indeed but the brigands evidently did not know that I wondered again what had become of Snap Was he captured or still holding them off I was watching my windows for at any moment under cover of this talk I might be assailed Gravity came suddenly to the room Miko s voice said We mean well by you Haljan There is your normality Join us We need you to chart our course And a hundred pounds of gold leaf urged Coniston Or more Why this treasure I could hear an oath from Miko And then his ironic voice We will not bother you Haljan There is no hurry You will be hungry in good time And sleepy Then we will come and get you And a little acid will make you think differently about helping us His vibrations died away The pull of gravity in the room was normal I was alone in the dim silence with the bodies of Carter and Johnson lying huddled on the grid I bent to examine them Both were dead My isolation was no ruse this time The outlaws made no further attack Half an hour passed The deck outside what I could see of it was vacant Balch lay dead close outside the chart room door The bodies of Blackstone and the Course master had been removed from the turret window A forward lookout one of Miko s men was on duty in the nearby tower Hahn was at the turret controls The ship was under orderly handling heading back upon a new course For the Earth Or the Moon It did not seem so I found in the chart room a Benson curve light projector which poor Captain Carter had very nearly assembled I worked on it trained it through my rear window along the empty deck bent it into the lounge archway Upon my grid the image of the lounge interior presently focused The passengers in the lounge were huddled in a group Disheveled frightened with Moa standing watching them Stewards were serving them with a meal Upon a bench bodies were lying Some were dead I saw Rance Rankin Others were evidently only injured doctor Frank was moving among them attending them Venza was there unharmed And I saw the gamblers Shac and Dud sitting white faced whispering together And Glutz s little be ribboned be curled figure on a stool George Prince was there standing against the walls shrouded in his mourning cloak watching the scene with alert roving eyes And by the opposite doorway the huge towering figure of Miko stood on guard But Snap was missing A brief glimpse Miko saw my Benson light I could have equipped a heat ray and fired along the curved Benson light into that lounge But Miko gave me no time He slid the lounge door closed and Moa leaped to close the one on my side My light was cut off my grid showed only the blank deck and door Another interval I had made plans Futile plans I could get into the turret perhaps and kill Hahn I had the invisible cloak which Johnson was wearing I took it from his body Its mechanism could be repaired Why with it I could creep about the ship kill these brigands one by one perhaps George Prince would be with me The brigands who had been posing as the stewards and crew members were unable to navigate they would obey my orders There were only Miko Coniston and Hahn to kill Futile plans From my window I could gaze up to the helio room And now abruptly I heard Snap s voice No I tell you no And Miko Very well We will try this So Snap was captured but not killed Relief swept me He was in the helio room and Miko was with him But my relief was short lived After a brief interval there came a moan from Snap It floated down from the silence overhead It made me shudder My Benson beam shot into the helio window It showed me Snap lying there on the floor He was bound with wire His torso had been stripped His livid face was ghastly plain in my light Miko was bending over him Miko with a heat cylinder no longer than a finger Its needle beam played upon Snap s naked chest I could see the gruesome little trail of smoke rising and as Snap twisted and jerked there on his flesh was the red and blistered trail of the violet hot ray Now will you tell No Miko laughed No Then I shall write my name a little deeper A black scar now a trail etched in the quivering flesh Oh Snap s face went white as chalk as he pressed his lips together Or a little acid This fire writing does not really hurt Tell me what you did with those code words No In his absorption Miko did not notice my light Nor did I have the wit to try and fire along it I was trembling Snap under torture As the beam went deeper Snap suddenly screamed But he ended No I will send no message for you It had been only a moment In the chart room window beside me again a figure appeared No image A solid living person undisguised by any cloak of invisibility George Prince had chanced my fire and had crept up upon me Haljan Don t attack me I dropped my light connections As impulsively I stood up I saw through the window the figure of Coniston on the deck watching the result of Prince s venture Haljan yield Prince no more than whispered it He stood outside on the deck the low window casement touched his waist He leaned over it He s torturing Snap Call out that you will yield The thought had already been in my mind Another scream from Snap chilled me with horror I shouted Miko Stop I rushed to the window and Prince gripped me Louder I called louder Miko Stop My upflung voice mingled with Snap s agony of protest Then Miko heard me His head and shoulders showed up there at the helio room oval You Haljan Prince shouted I have made him yield He will obey you if you stop that torture I think that poor Snap must have fainted He was silent I called Stop I will do what you command Miko jeered That is good A bargain if you and Dean obey me Disarm him Prince and bring him out Miko moved back into the helio room On the deck Coniston was advancing but cautiously mistrustful of me Gregg George Prince flung a leg over the casement and leaped lightly into the dim chart room His small slender figure stood beside me clung to me Gregg A moment while we stood there together No ray was upon us Coniston could not see us nor could he hear our whispers Gregg A different voice its throaty husky quality gone A soft pleading Gregg Gregg don t you know me Gregg dear Why what was this Not George Prince A masquerader yet so like George Prince Gregg don t you know me Clinging to me A soft touch upon my arm Fingers clinging A surge of warm tingling current was flowing between us My sweep of instant thoughts A speck of human Earth dust falling free That was George Prince who had been killed George Prince s body disguised by the scheming Carter and doctor Frank buried in the guise of his sister And this black robed figure who was trying to help us Anita Dear God Anita darling Anita Gregg dear one Anita Dear God My arms went around her my lips pressed hers and felt her tremulous eager answer Gregg dear Anita you The form of Coniston showed at our window She cast me off She said with her throaty swagger of assumed masculinity I have him Sir Arthur He will obey us I sensed her warning glance She shoved me toward the window She said ironically Have no fear Haljan You will not be tortured you and Dean if you obey our commands Coniston gripped me You fool You caused us a lot of trouble didn t you Move along there He jerked me roughly through the window Marched me the length of the deck Out to the stern space opened the door of my cubby flung me in and sealed the door upon me Miko will come presently I stood in the darkness of my tiny room listening to his retreating footsteps But my mind was not on him All the Universe in that instant had changed for me Anita was alive To be continued FOOTNOTES one As early as nineteen ten it was discovered that an object

Many Other Stories by Your Favorite Authors The Soul Master By Will Smith and R J Robbins Desperately O Hara plunged into Prof Kell s mysterious mansion For his friend Skip was the victim of the eccentric scientist s de astralizing experiment and faced a fate more hideous than death Illustration A terrific force was emanating from that devilish globe above The train was slowing down for Keegan A whistle from the locomotive ahead had warned the two alert young men in the smoker to that effect and they arose to leave the train Both were neatly and quietly dressed One carried a medium sized camera with the necessary tripod and accessory satchel The other carried no impediments of any sort Both were smoking cigars evidently not of expensive variety judging by the unaromatic atmosphere thereabouts Can t see what Bland shipped us up to this one horse dump for grumbled Skip Handlon the one who carried the camera He was the slighter of the two and perhaps half a head shorter than the other Do you know anything about it Not much confessed the other as they alighted from the smoker All I can tell you is that Bland sent for me early this morning told me to get a story out of this Professor Kell and to drag you along After we get there you are to do as judgment dictates But I remember that the Chief was specific as regards one thing You are to get the proff s mug Don t forget The old fellow may growl and show fight but it s up to you to deliver the goods or in this case get them Don t depend on me for help I expect to have troubles of my own Thus gloomed Horace Perry star reporter for the Journal This Keegan place Handlon was using his eyes swiftly and comprehensively isn t worth much Can t see how it manages to even rate a name Some dump all right You said a couple mouthfuls How s the train service if any Rotten Two trains a day The other was anything but enthusiastic We ve a nice long wait for the next one you can bet Now just add to that a rough reception after we reach the old lion s lair and you get a nice idea of what Bland expects from his men Handlon made a wry face at this The bird who first applied the words Hard Boiled to the Chief s monniker knew something You don t know the half of it retorted Perry encouragingly Just wait and see what a beaut of a fit he can throw for your benefit if you fail to do your stuff and I don t mean maybe Old Man Bland owned the Journal hired and fired his crew and did his own editing with the help of as capable an office gang as could be gotten together It is quite possible that Hard Boiled Bland demanded more from his men than any other editor ever has before or since Nevertheless he got results and none of his experienced underlings ever kicked for the pay was right If a hapless scribe had the temerity to enter the editorial sanctum with a negative report the almost invariable reply had been a glare and a peremptory order Get the copy And get it they did If a person refused an interview these clever fellows generally succeeded in getting their information from the next most reliable source and it arrived in print just the same Of such a breed was Perry Handlon being a more recent acquisition to the staff was not yet especially aggressive in his work On this account the former took keen zest in scaring him into displaying a bit more sand The train had disappeared around a bend and the two reporters felt themselves marooned Keegan without question was a most forlorn looking spot A dismal shanty much the worse for weather stood beside the track In front a few rotting planks proclaimed that once upon a time the place had boasted a real freight platform Probably back in some long forgotten age a station agent had also held forth in the rickety shanty A sign hung on each end of the crumbling structure on which could still be deciphered the legend KEEGAN On the opposite side of the track was an old disused siding The only other feature of interest thereabouts was a well traveled country road which crossed the tracks near the shanty wound sinuously over a rock strewn hill and became lost in the mazes of an upland forest There being no signboard of any kind to indicate their destination the two after a moment s hesitation started off briskly in a chance direction The air was hot and sultry and in the open spaces the sun beat down mercilessly upon the two hapless ones As they proceeded into the depths of the forest they were shielded somewhat from the worst of the heat Gradually upon their city bred nostrils there stole the odor of conifers accompanied by a myriad of other forest odors Both sniffed the air appreciatively This is sure the life remarked Perry If I weren t so darn thirsty now He became lost in mournful thought A considerable time passed The newspaper men trudged wearily along until finally another bend brought them to the beginning of a steep descent The forest had thinned out to nothing Seems to me I smell smoke blurted out Handlon suddenly Must be that we are approaching the old party s lair Remember Bland said that he Uh huh the other grunted almost inaudibly Now that they seemed to be arriving at their destination something had occurred to him He had fished from his pocket a sheaf of clippings and was perusing them intently Bland said Get the copy he muttered irrelevantly and half to himself The clippings all related directly to Professor Kell or to happenings local to Keegan Some were of peculiar interest The first one was headlined thus MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF ROBERT MANION AND DAUGHTER STILL UNSOLVED The piece contained a description of the missing man a fairly prosperous banker who had been seen four days previously driving through Keegan in a small roadster and one of the girl who was in the car with him It told that the banker and his daughter were last seen by a farmer named Willetts who lived in a shack on the East Keegan road fleeing before a bad thunder storm He believed the pair were trying to make the Kell mansion ahead of the rain Nothing more of the Manions or their car had been seen and their personal effects remained at their hotel in a nearby village unclaimed The heavy rain had of course effectually obliterated all wheel tracks Another clipping was fairly lengthy but Perry glanced only at the headlines KELL STILL CARRYING ON HIS STRANGE EXPERIMENTS Has Long Been Known to Have Fantastic Theories Refuses to Divulge Exact Methods Employed or Nature of Results Still another appeared to be an excerpt from an article in an agricultural paper It read A prize bull belonging to Alton Shepard a Keegan cattle breeder has created considerable sensation by running amuck in a most peculiar manner While seemingly more intelligent than heretofore it has developed characteristics known to be utterly alien to this type of animal Perhaps the most noteworthy feature of the case is the refusal of the animal to eat its accustomed food Instead it now consumes enormous quantities of meat The terrific bellow of the animal s voice has also undergone a marked change now resembling nothing earthly although some have remarked that it could be likened to the bay of an enormous hound Some of its later actions have seemingly added further canine attributes which make the matter all the more mystifying Veterinaries are asking why this animal should chase automobiles and why it should carry bones in its mouth and try to bury them The last one read in part Professor Kell has been questioned by authorities at Keegan relative to the disappearance there last Tuesday of Robert Manion and his daughter Kell seemed unable to furnish clues of any value but officials are not entirely satisfied with the man s attitude toward the questions Somewhat bewildered by these apparently unrelated items the reporter remained lost in thought for quite a space the while he endeavored to map out his course of action when he should meet the redoubtable Professor That many of the weird occurrences could be traced in some way to the latter s door had evidently occurred to Bland Furthermore the Old Man relied implicitly upon Perry to get results It must be said that for once the star reporter was not overly enthusiastic with the assignment Certain rumors aside from the clippings in his hand had produced in his mind a feeling of uneasiness So far as his personal preference was concerned he would have been well satisfied if some cub reporter had been given the job Try as he would however he could offer no tangible reason for the sudden wariness He was aroused from his absorption by his companion Thought I smelled smoke a while back and I was right That s the house up in the edge of the pines Deep grounds in front and all gone to seed fits the description exactly Thank Heaven we struck off from the station in the right direction This stroll has been long enough Come out of it and let s get this job finished Suiting the action to the words Handlon started off at a brisk pace down the hill followed at a more moderate rate by Perry At length they came within full sight of the grounds Extending for a considerable distance before them and enclosing a large tract of land now well covered with lush grass was a formidable looking wall In former days a glorious mantle of ivy had covered the rough stones but now there was little left and what there was looked pitifully decrepit They continued their progress along this barrier finally coming upon a huge iron gate now much the worse for rust It stood wide open The road up to the house had long since become overgrown with rank grass and weeds Faintly traceable through the mass of green could be seen a rough footpath which the two followed carefully They met no one As they approached the night of black pines the mass of the old mansion began to loom up before them grim and forbidding Instinctively both shivered The silence of the place was complete and of an uncannily tangible quality Nervously they looked about them How do you like it Skip The words from Perry s previously silent lips broke upon the stillness like a thunderclap The other started I should hate to die in it Handlon answered solemnly I ll bet the old joint is haunted Nobody but a lunatic would ever live in it I get a good deal the same impression myself said Perry I don t wonder that Bland sent two of us to cover the job As he spoke he mounted a flight of steps to a tumbledown veranda There was no sign of a door bell on the weather beaten portal but an ancient knocker of bronze hanging forlornly before him seemed to suggest a means of attracting attention He raised it and rapped smartly No answer Possessing all the attributes of the conventional reporter and a few additional ones Perry did not allow himself to become disheartened but merely repeated his summons this time with more vim Well Horace grinned Handlon it does look as if we were not so very welcome here However seems to me if you were to pick up that piece of dead limb and do some real knocking with it The dear Professor may be deaf you know or maybe he s Skip my boy I don t know as we ought to go in right now after all Do you realize it will soon be dark To tell you the truth Horace I m not stuck on this assignment either And I feel that after dark I should like it even less somehow But gee the Old Man Oh I m not thinking of quitting on the job We don t do that on the Journal Perry smiled paternally at the photographer Could it be he had purposely raised the other s hopes in order to chaff him some more But I was thinking that it might be a good idea to look about the outbuildings a bit while we have a little daylight Eh Handlon looked disappointed but nodded gamely He delayed only long enough to deposit his camera and traps behind a grossly overgrown hydrangea by the steps then with a resigned air declared himself ready to follow wherever the other might lead Perry elected to explore the barn first This was a depressing old pile unpainted in years with what had once been stout doors now swinging and bumping in the light breeze As the two men drew nearer this breeze which seemed to sigh through the place at will brought foul odors that told them the place was at least not tenantless In some trepidation they stepped inside and stood blinking in the half darkness Pretty Polly Good God What was that Handlon whispered He knew it was no parrot s voice This was a far deeper sound than that a sound louder than anything a parrot s throat could produce It came from the direction of a ruinous stall over near a cobwebbed window As Perry started fearfully toward this there issued from it a curious scraping sound followed by a fall that shook the floor and a threshing as of hoofs Now the great voice could be heard again this time uttering what sounded strangely like oaths roared out in a foreign tongue Yet when the newspaper men reached the stall they found it occupied only by a large mule The animal was lying on its side its feet scraping feebly against the side of the stall The heaving foam flecked body was a mass of hideous bruises some of which were bleeding profusely The creature seemed to be in the last stage of exhaustion lying with lips drawn back and eyes closed Beneath it and scattered all over the stall floor was a thick layer of some whitish seeds That s why that s sunflower seed Horace Handlon almost whimpered And look Look in that crib It s full of the same stuff Where s the hay Horace Does this thing He was interrupted by a mighty movement of the beast a threshing that nearly blinded the men in the cloud of bloodstained seeds it raised With something between a curse and a sob the mule lunged at its crib as if attempting to get bodily into it But no it was only trying to perch on its edge Now it had succeeded The ungainly beast hung there a second two three From its uplifted throat issued that usually innocuous phrase a phrase now a thing of delirious horror Pretty Polly With a crash the tortured creature fell to the floor to lie there gasping and moaning Skip Handlon left that barn Perry retained just enough wit to do what he should have done the instant he first saw the animal He whipped out his automatic and fired one merciful shot Then he too started for the outside He arrived in the yard perhaps ten seconds behind Handlon Good Heavens Perry gibbered Handlon I m not going to stay around this place another minute Just let me find where I left that suffering camera that s all I ask Easy now Perry laid a hand on his companion s shoulder I guess we re up against something pretty fierce here but we re going to see it through and you know it So let s cut out the flight talk and go raise the Professor Handlon tried earnestly to don a look of determination If Perry was set on staying here the least he could do was stay with him However could Perry have foreseen the events which were to entangle them he probably would have led the race to the gate As it was he grasped a stick and marched bravely up toward the front door A sudden commotion behind him caused him to wheel sharply around Simultaneously a yell burst from Handlon Look out Horace What he saw almost froze the blood in his veins From a tumbledown coach house had issued an enormous wolf hound which was now almost upon then eyes flaming fangs gleaming horribly So unexpected was the attack that both men stood rooted in their tracks The next moment the charging brute was upon them and had bowled Handlon off his equilibrium as if he were a child The unfortunate photographer made a desperate attempt to prevent injury to his precious camera which he had but a moment earlier succeeded in retrieving and in doing so fell rather violently to the ground Every moment he expected to feel the powerful jaws crunch his throat and he made no effort to rise For several seconds he remained thus until he could endure the suspense no longer He glanced around only to see Perry staring open mouthed at the animal which had so frightened them Apparently it had forgotten the presence of the two men Handlon regained his feet rather awkwardly the while keeping a watchful eye on the beast of whose uncertain temper he was by now fully aware In an undertone he addressed his companion What do you make of it he wanted to know Did the critter bite you No That s the queer part of it Neither did he bite you if you were to think it over a minute Just put his nose down and rammed you head on The photographer was flabbergasted Involuntarily his gaze stole again in the direction of the offending brute What on earth he began Is he sharpening his teeth on a rock preparatory to another attack upon us Or What the deuce is he doing If you ask me came astonishingly from the watchful Perry he s eating grass which is my idea of something damn foolish for a perfectly normal hound genus lupo to be Look out The animal as if suddenly remembering the presence of the men suddenly charged at them again head down eyes blazing As before it made no effort to bite Though both men were somewhat disconcerted by the great brute they held their ground and when it presented the opportunity the older reporter planted a terrific kick to the flank which sent the animal whimpering back to its shed behind Score one breathed Handlon If we At a sudden grating sound overhead he stopped Both turned to face the threatening muzzle of an ancient blunderbuss Behind it was an irate countenance nearly covered by an unclipped beard of a dirty gray color In the eyes now glaring at them malevolently through heavily concaved spectacles they read hate unutterable The barrel of the blunderbuss swung slightly as it covered alternately one and the other Both sensed that the finger even now tightening on the trigger would not hesitate unduly Being more or less hardened to rebuffs of all kinds in the pursuance of their calling the reporters did not hesitate in stating their purpose What yelled the old man You dare to invade my grounds and disturb me at my labors for such a reason Reporters My scientific research work is not for publicity sirs and futhermore I want it understood that I am not to be dragged from my laboratory again for the purpose of entertaining you or any others of your ilk Get away Without further ado the window was slammed down a shutter closed on the inside and once more the silence of the dead descended upon the spot The two men grinned ruefully at each other Handlon finally breaking the stillness My idea of the world s original one sided conversation We simply didn t talk and yet we re supposed to be reporters You ve got to hand it to the Proff Horace for the beautiful rock crusher he just handed us You didn t think we had anything easy did you said Perry irritably He ll change his tune presently when Handlon s jaw dropped You don t mean you re going to take any more chances Would you rouse him again after the way he treated us with that gun Besides the train Perry bent a scathing glance at his companion What on earth has the train to do with our getting the Professor s confession of crime or whatever he has to offer You evidently don t know Bland much I deduce that a lot of my sweetness has been wasted on the desert air Once more let me assure you that if you propose to go back without the Proff s mug on one of those plates you might as well mail your resignation from here Get me The other wilted I wonder Perry ruminated as he stared in the direction of the shed wherein the canine monstrosity had disappeared Do you suppose that you can get a snap of the old boy s mug if I can get him to the window again If you can do that just leave the rest to me I ve handled these crusty birds before What say Go as far as you like The photographer was once more grinning as he unslung his camera and carefully adjusted a plate in place Everything at last to his satisfaction he gripped flash pan and bulb I m going to make some racket now announced Perry grimly If Kell shows up work fast He may shoot at you but don t get excited It s almost dark so his aim might be poor At this suggestion his companion showed signs of panic but the other affected not to notice this There came a deafening hullaballoo as Perry beat a terrific tattoo on the ancient door Followed a deep silence while Perry leaped back to stand in front of Skip and his camera After perhaps a full minute s wait he once more opened up his bombardment to jump quickly back to the camera as before This time he had better success The window was again opened and the muzzle of the blunderbuss put in its appearance Handlon stood close behind Perry as he silently swung the camera into a more favorable position for action The face at the window was purple with wrath You damned pests Leave my grounds at once or I shall call my hound and set him upon you And when Crack Flash Click Perry had made a sudden sidewise movement as Handlon went into action Much obliged Professor said Perry politely Your pose with that old cannon is going to be very effective from the front page The write up will doubtless be interesting too Probably the story won t be quite so accurate as it would be had you told it to us yourself but we shall get as many of the details from the natives hereabouts as we can Good day to you sir Motioning to the other he turned on his heel and started down the driveway It was an old trick and for a long moment of suspense he almost feared that it would fail Another moment Wait The quavering voice of the irascible old villain had lost some of its malice Come back here a minute With simulated reluctance the two slowly retraced their steps Is there something else sir Perhaps The old man hesitated as if pondering upon his words Perhaps if you care to step in I can be of assistance to you after all It occurs to me that possibly I have been too abrupt with you I am very glad that you have decided to cooperate with us Professor Kell answered the reporter heartily as they ascended the steps The old man s head disappeared from the window and shortly the sound of footsteps inside told of his approach Finally the oaken door swung open and they were silently ushered into the musty smelling hallway Though outwardly accepting the Professor s suddenly pacific attitude Perry made up his mind to be on his guard As they entered what had evidently been the parlor in bygone days an oppressive heavy odor smote their nostrils telling of age old carpets and of draperies allowed to decay unnoticed On the walls hung several antique prints a poorly executed crayon portrait of a person doubtless an ancestor of the present Kell and one or two paintings done in oil now badly cracked and stained Everything gave the impression of an era long since departed and the two men felt vaguely out of place Their host led them to a pair of dilapidated chairs which they accepted gratefully The ride to Keegan after a hard day s work had not tended to improve their spirits Now to business Perry went straight to the point desiring to get the interview over as soon as possible We have heard indirectly of various happenings in this vicinity which many think have some connection with your scientific experiments Any statement you may care to make to us in regard to these happenings will be greatly appreciated by my paper Inasmuch as what little has already been printed is probably of an erroneous nature we believe it will be in your own best interest to give us as complete data as possible Here he became slightly histrionic Of course we do not allow ourselves to take the stories told by the local inhabitants too literally as such persons are too liable to exaggerate but we must assume that some of these stories have partial basis in fact Any information relative to your scientific work incidentally will make good copy for us also Perry gazed steadily at the patriarch as he spoke For a moment a crafty expression passed over the old man s face but as suddenly it disappeared Evidently he had arrived at a decision Come with me he wheezed The two newspaper men exchanged swift glances the same thought in the mind of each Were they about to be led into a trap If the old man s shady reputation was at all deserved they would do well to be wary Perry thought swiftly of the clippings he had read and of what gossip he had heard then glanced once more in the direction of Handlon That worthy was smiling meaningly and had already arisen to follow the Professor Reluctantly Perry got to his feet and the three proceeded to climb a rickety stairway to the third floor The guide turned at the head of the stairs and entered a long dark corridor Here the floor was covered with a thick carpet which as they trod upon it gave forth not the slightest sound The hall gave upon several rooms all dark and gloomy and giving the same dismal impression of long disuse How could the savant endure such a depressing abode The accumulation of dust and cobwebs in these long forgotten chambers the general evidence of decay all told of possible horrors ahead They became wary But they were not wary enough The uncouth figure ahead of them had stopped and was fumbling with the lock of an ancient door Instinctively Perry noted that it was of great thickness and of heavy oak Now the Professor had it open and was motioning for them to enter Handlon started forward eagerly but hurriedly drew back as he felt the grip of the other reporter s hand on his arm Get back you fool The words were hissed into the ear of the incautious one Then to the Professor Perry observed If you have no objection we would prefer that you precede us A look of insane fury leaped to the face of the old man lingered but an instant and was gone Though the expression was but momentary both men had seen and seeing had realized their danger They followed him into the chamber which was soon illumined fitfully by a smoky kerosene lamp Both took a rapid survey of the place Conceivably it might have been the scene of scientific experiments but its aspect surely belied such a supposition The average imagination would instantly pronounce it the abode of a maniac or the lair of an alchemist Again that it might be the laboratory of an extremely slovenly veterinary was suggested by the several filthy cages to be seen resting against the wall All of these were unoccupied except one in a dark corner from which issued a sound of contented purring evidently telling of some well satisfied cat The air was close and foul being heavy with the odor of musty decaying drugs In every possible niche and cranny the omnipresent dust had settled in a uniform sheen of gray which showed but few signs of recent disturbance Here gentlemen their host was saying is where I carry on my work It is rather gloomy here after dark but then I do not spend much time here during the night I have decided to acquaint you with some of the details of one or two of my experiments Doubtless you will find them interesting While speaking he had mechanically it seemed reached for a glass humidor in which were perhaps a dozen cigars Silently he selected one and extended the rest to the two visitors After all three had puffed for a moment at the weeds the old man began to talk rapidly it seemed to them Perry from time to time took notes as the old man proceeded an expression of utter amazement gradually overspreading his face Handlon pulled away contentedly at his cigar and on his features there grew an almost ludicrous expression of well being Was the simple photographer so completely at ease that he had at length forsaken all thought of possible danger As Professor Kell talked on he seemed to warm to his subject At the end of five minutes he began uncovering a peculiar apparatus which had rested beneath the massive old table before which they were sitting The two men caught the flash of light on glass and a jumble of coiled wires became visible Was the air in the laboratory getting unbearably close Or was the queer leaden feeling that had taken possession of Perry s lungs but an indication of his overpowering weariness He felt a steadily increasing irritation as if for some strange reason he suddenly resented the words of their host which seemed to be pouring out in an endless stream The cigar had paradoxically an oddly soothing quality and he puffed away in silence Why had the room suddenly taken on so hazy an aspect Why did Handlon grin in that idiotic manner And the Professor he was getting farther and farther away that perfecto or was it an El Cabbajo What was the old archfiend doing to him anyhow Why was he laughing and leering at them so horribly Confound it all that cigar where was it Just one more puff Blindly he groped for the missing weed becoming aware of a cackle of amusement nearby Professor Kell was standing near the spot where he had fallen and now began prodding him contemptuously with his toe Fools he was saying You thought to interfere with my program But you are in my power and you have no hope of escape I am unexpectedly provided with more subjects for my experiments You will His words became hazy and unintelligible for the hapless reporter was drifting off into a numb oblivion He had long since lost the power to move a muscle Out of the corner of an eye just before he lost consciousness altogether he perceived Handlon lying upon the floor still puffing at the fateful drugged cigar Eons passed To the reporter came a vision of a throbbing glaring inferno wherein he was shaken and tossed by terrific forces His very vital essence seemed to respond to a mighty vibration Now he was but a part of some terrific chaos Dimly he became aware of another being with whom he must contend Now he was in a death struggle and to his horror he found himself being slowly but surely overpowered A demoniac grin played upon the features of the other as he forced the reporter to his knees It was Handlon Once more he was sinking into soft oblivion the while a horrid miasma assailed his nostrils He was nothing Slowly and with infinite effort Perry felt himself returning to consciousness though he had no clear conception of his surroundings His brain was as yet but a whirling vortex of confused sounds colors and yes odors A temporary rift came in the mental cloud which fettered his faculties and things began to take definite shape He became aware that he was lying upon his back at some elevation from the floor Again the cloudy incubus closed in and he knew no more When he finally recovered the use of his faculties it was to discover himself the possessor of a violent headache The pain came in such fearsome throbs that it was well nigh unendurable The lamp still sputtered dimly where the professor had left it At the moment it was on the point of going out altogether The reporter noticed this and over him stole a sense of panic What if the light should fail altogether leaving him lying in the dark in this frightful place Still dizzy and sick he managed to rise upon his elbows enough to complete a survey of the room He was still in the laboratory of Professor Kell but that worthy had disappeared Of Handlon there was no sign The mysterious apparatus of which he now had but a vague remembrance also had vanished His thoughts became confused again and wearily he passed a hand over his brow in the effort to collect all of his faculties The lamp began to sputter arousing him to action Desperately he fought against the benumbing sensation that was even again stealing over him Gradually he gained the ascendancy He struggled dizzily to his feet and took a few tentative steps Where was Handlon He decided his friend had probably recovered from the drug first and was gone possibly to get a doctor for him Perry However he must make some search to determine if Skip had really left the premises As he walked through the open door the lamp in his hand gave a last despairing flicker and went out From there he was forced to grope his way down the dark hall to the stairs Just how he reached the lower floor he was never able to remember for as yet all the effect of the powerful drug had not worn off He had a dim recollection of being thankful to the ancestor of Kell who had provided such thick carpets in these halls Thanks to them his footsteps had been noiseless at any rate What was Kell s real object in giving them those drugged cigars he wondered How long had they been under the influence of the lethal stuff Surely several hours Upon glancing through a hall window he found that outside was the blackness of midnight Cautiously he explored the desolate chambers on the ground floor the kitchen where it could be plainly seen that cooking of a sort had been done the barn and woodshed Not a living thing could he find not even the huge wolf hound which had attacked them in so strange a manner that afternoon By now he was quite frankly worried on Handlon s account At that moment could he have known the actual fate that had overtaken his companion it is quite probable he would have gone mad He stumbled back and into the dark front hall shouting his friend s name The response was a hollow echo and once or twice he thought he heard the ghost of a mocking chuckle At length he gave up the search and started for the door intent now only upon flight from the accursed place He would report the whole thing to the office and let Bland do what he pleased about it Doubtless Handlon had already left Then he stumbled over Handlon s camera Evidently the Professor had neglected to take possession of it That must be rescued at all costs He picked it up and felt the exposed plate still inside He started again for the door What little light there was faded out and he felt stealing over him a horrid sensation of weakness Again came a period of agony during which he felt the grip of unseen forces Once more it seemed that he was engaged in mortal strife with Skip Handlon Malevolently Handlon glared at him as he endeavored with all his strength to overcome Perry This time however the latter seemed to have more strength and resisted the attack for what must have been hours Finally the other drew away baffled At this the mental incubus surrounding Perry s faculties broke Dimly he became aware of a grinding noise nearby and a constant lurching of his body At length his vision cleared sufficiently to enable him to discover the cause of the peculiar sensations He was in a railroad coach He took a rapid glance around and noted a drummer sitting in the seat across the aisle staring curiously at him With an effort Perry assumed an inscrutable expression and determined to stare the other out of countenance Reluctantly the man glanced away and after a moment under Perry s stony gaze he suddenly arose and chose a new seat in front of the car Perry took to the solace of a cigarette and stared out at the flying telegraph poles From time to time he noted familiar landmarks The train had evidently left Keegan far behind and was already nearly into the home town For the balance of the ride the reporter experienced pure nightmare The peculiar sensations of dizziness accompanied by frightful periods of insensibility kept recurring now however not lasting more than ten or fifteen minutes at a time At such times as he was conscious he found opportunity to wonder in an abstracted sort of way how he had ever managed to get on the train and pay his fare which must have been a cash one without arousing the conductor s suspicions Discovery of a rebate in his pocket proved that he must have done so however The business of leaving the train and getting to the office has always been an unknown chapter in Perry s life He came out of one of his mental fogs to find himself seated in the private editorial sanctum of the Journal Evidently he had just arrived Bland a thick set man with the jaw of a bulldog was eyeing him intently Well Any report to make The question was crisp The reporter passed a hand across his perspiring forehead Yes I guess so I er that is you see Where s Handlon What happened to you You act as if you were drunk Bland was not in an amiable mood Search me Perry managed to respond If Skip isn t here old man Kell must have done for him I came back alone You wha a t the irate editor fairly roared half rising from his chair Tell me exactly what happened and get ready to go back there on the next train Or no on second thoughts you d better go to bed You look all used up Handlon may be dead or dying at this minute That Kell could do anything He pressed the button on his desk Johnny he said to the office boy get O Hara in here on the double quick and tell him to bring along his hat and coat He turned again to Perry who was gazing nervously at the door Now tell me everything that happened and make it fast he ordered The reporter complied omitting nothing except the little matter of his mental lapses at the house of Professor Kell and later on the train The incident of the drugged cigars seemed to interest the Old Man hugely and Perry did not forget to play up Handlon s exploits in getting the picture of the Professor All through the recital he was in a sweat for fear that he might have a recurrence of one of his brain spells and that Bland would become cognizant of it When would the Chief finish and let him escape from the office Desperately he fought to prevent the numbing sensation from overcoming him All that kept him from finally fleeing the place in panic was the entrance of Jimmie O Hara Slight wiry and efficient looking this individual was a specimen of the perfect Journal reporter This is saying a good deal for the news crew and editorial force of the paper were a carefully selected body of men indeed Bland never hired a man unless experience had endowed him with some unusual qualification Most of them could write up a story with realistic exactitude being able in most cases to supply details gleaned from actual experience in one walk of life or another Of this redoubtable crew probably the queerest was Jimmie O Hara Jimmie had just finished a sentence in the pen for safe cracking at the time he landed the job with the Journal Theoretically all men should have shunned him on account of his jailbird taint Not so Bland The Chief was independent in his ideas on the eternal fitness of things and allowed none of the ordinary conventions of humanity to influence his decisions So Jimmie became one of the staff and worked hard to justify Bland in hiring him His former profession gave him valuable sidelights upon crime stories of all kinds and he was almost invariably picked as the man to write these up for the columns Jimmie said the Chief we have need of an experienced strong arm man and all around second story worker You are the only man on the force who fills the bill for this job Perry here has just returned from Keegan where I sent him to interview Professor Kell Skip Handlon went with him but failed to return We want to know what happened to Skip That is your job Get Handlon If he is dead let me know by long distance phone and I ll have a couple of headquarters men down there in a hurry Get a good fast car and don t waste any time That s all O Hara stopped long enough to get the location of Professor Kell s place fixed in his mind then abruptly departed Bland gazed after him musingly The Professor will have some job to put anything over on that bird he said grimly Personally I m sorry for the old soul After leaving the Journal office Jimmie proceeded directly to a certain stable where he kept his private car It was a long low speedster with a powerful engine and capable of eating up distance It was the work of a minute to touch the starter and back out of the yard For the next hour he held the wheel grimly while the car roared over the seventy odd miles to Keegan Would he be in time At last a sign post told him that he was within five miles of the railroad crossing at Keegan Now the headlights were picking out the black outlines of the freight shed and the next moment he had swept over the tracks The luminous dial on his wrist watch notified him that he had been on the road but little over an hour but his spirits somehow refused to revive with the knowledge About a mile beyond the station he drove the car into a dark wood road and parked it turning off all lights The rest of the way to the Professor s mansion he did on foot Rather than approach from the front of the grounds he nimbly climbed a stone wall and crossing a field or two entered the stretch of woods which extended just behind the mansion His pocket flashlight here came into use and once or twice he gave a reassuring pat to a rear pocket where bulged a heavy Colt automatic What was that He had approached very close to the rear of the house now No lights were visible as yet but unless he was greatly mistaken he had heard a muffled scream He stopped in his tracks and listened intently Again it came this time with a blood curdling cadence ending in what he would have sworn was a choking sob The little job of getting the old fashioned rear window open was a mere nothing to the experienced O Hara and in a moment he was inside the house His feet struck soft carpet Catlike he stepped to one side in order to prevent any hidden eyes from perceiving his form silhouetted in the dim light of the open window He dared not use his flashlight for fear that the circle of light would betray his position thus making him an excellent target for possible bullets Following the wall closely he managed to circle the room without mishap His searching fingers finally came in contact with a door frame and he breathed a sigh of relief Here there was nothing to bar his progress except some moth eaten portieres These he brushed aside The room which he now entered was probably the same into which the Professor had ushered Handlon and Perry the day before There being still no sign of life about the reporter decided to throw caution to the winds He brought his flash into play Quickly casting the powerful beam around the chamber he examined the place with an all searching glance Nothing With a stifled oath he turned his attention to the other rooms in the immediate vicinity The brilliant light revealed not the slightest trace of a person living or dead The sound must have come from the second story or from the cellar He decided on the upper floor Feverish with impatience because of the valuable time he had already lost he bounded up the heavily carpeted stairs two at a time Now to his keen ears came certain faint sounds which told him that he was on the right track Before him extended a long dusty hall terminating in a single heavy door Several other doors opened at intervals along the corridor One or two of these were open and he threw the beam from his flash hastily into one after another of them He saw only dusty and mildewed chamber furnishings of an ancient massive style Suddenly he pricked up his ears The door ahead of him was creaking slowly open Instantly he extinguished his torch and leaped into the nearest room Whoever was opening that end door was carrying a lamp What if the Professor had accomplices who might discover him and overpower him by force of numbers O Hara drew the automatic from his pocket deriving a comforting assurance from the feel of the cold steel Here was something no man could resist could he but get it into action The light was now nearly abreast of his door and for a sickening instant he thought the prowler was coming into the room He held his breath Now the lamp was at the open door and now it was quickly withdrawn After a breathless second he tip toed forward and peered cautiously down the hallway About here it was that James O Hara began to realize that this was going to be a horrible night indeed He had wondered why the progress of the light had been so deathly slow Now he knew why by reason of what he saw and what he saw made him feel rather sick The man with the lantern was quite plainly Professor Kell bent nearly double with the weight of a grotesquely big thing on his back a thing that flung a dim contorted shadow on the ceiling And that thing was a dead man A corpse it was the attitude proved that With a numb relief O Hara realized it was not the body of Skip Handlon This had been a much larger man than Skip and the clothing was different from anything Handlon had worn The light was now disappearing down the stairway For a moment O Hara felt undecided as to his next move Should he follow Kell and his burden or should he not take advantage of this fine opportunity to continue his search of the upper story That scream still rang in his ears there had been a very evident feminine quality in it and the remembrance of that fact reproached him Had he been guilty of mincing daintily about in this old house while a woman was being done to death under his nose when a little bolder action on his part might have saved her Stepping once more into the hall he advanced to the door just closed behind the Professor and tried it only to find it locked Out of a pocket came several articles best known to the profession a piece of stiff wire a skeleton key and other paraphernalia calculated to reduce the obstinate mechanism to submission For a minute two three he worked at the ancient lock then without a creak the door swung open A touch of oil to the hinges had insured their silence Jimmie O Hara believed in being artistic in his work especially when it came to fine points and he was He found himself in the same room where the drugged cigars had been proved the undoing of Handlon and Perry In order not to alarm the Professor unduly by chance noises and perhaps invite a surprise attack upon himself O Hara closed the laboratory door behind him and let the lock spring again Hastily he made search of the place No trace of the missing reporter could he find except two half consumed cigars in a corner whence the Professor had impatiently kicked them On the big table in the center of the room however was an object which excited his interest It was apparently nothing more or less than a giant Crookes tube connected in some way with a complicated mechanism contained in a wooden cabinet under the table Probably this apparatus was concerned in the Professor s weird experiments which had so aroused the countryside He studied it curiously his eyes for the moment closed in thought until a slight sound somewhere near at hand caused him to open them wide Was the Kell returning Quickly he extinguished the lamp and glided to a nearby door thinking to secrete himself here and take Kell by surprise To his consternation the door swung inward at a touch He prepared instinctively for battle against any foe who might present himself For a moment he held himself taut then nothing of an alarming nature having happened he drew a swift breath of relief and flashed on his light He gave vent to a low exclamation The swiftly darting shaft from the torch had revealed the figure of a girl bound and gagged The girl lay trembling on a wretched bed in a corner of the dilapidated old chamber O Hara crossed the room and bent over her Still wary of a trap he glanced back in the direction of the laboratory door all safe there Jimmie made haste to remove the cruel gag from her mouth Courage he whispered Half a minute and you will be free He produced a knife with a suspiciously long blade and cut her bonds He then assisted her to her feet where she reeled dizzily Realizing the need for fast action he made her sit down while he massaged the bruised arms and ankles which were badly swollen from the tight ropes The girl had apparently been in the grip of such terrible fright that she had temporarily lost her power of speech Mentally he chalked up another score against the Professor as the girl made several ineffectual attempts to speak Easy kid Jimmie whispered Just sit tight and when you feel able you can tell me all about it I m going to get him good for this you can bank on that She thanked him with a faint smile and of a sudden she found her voice Who are you Where is father Oh tell me please I am afraid that horrible man has murdered him Are you a servant here Oh I don t know whom to trust My name is Jimmie O Hara replied the reporter briefly and I hope you won t worry about me I am gunning for the Proff myself Tell me as quickly as you can what you know about him He still kept an eye on the door of the adjoining laboratory Any moment he expected to hear the sound of the old man s approach The room would make an ideal place to ambush the maniac he had swiftly decided I am Norma Manion Please don t delay but see if you can locate father The girl s voice was agonized I heard him groan a half hour ago and a little later came a terrific crash Oh I m afraid he s dead Reluctantly Jimmie gave up the idea of ambushing the Professor Wait here he commanded curtly If you hear a shot join me as soon as you can I want to take him alive if I can but With this parting hint he disappeared through the door into the laboratory Down the carpeted hall he crept to the stairway Here he stopped and listened but to his sensitive ears came no sound from below Must have gone down the cellar with the body he muttered Here goes for a general exploration With more boldness than the occasion perhaps really justified he descended the stairs and proceeded to examine the ground floor rooms minutely The first was the room through which he had made entrance to the house It proved to be but a storeroom containing nothing of interest and he soon decided to waste no more time on it The adjoining chamber however yielded some surprising finds He had pushed back a dusty portiere to find himself in what could be nothing less than the Professor s sleeping chamber At present the bed was unoccupied though it showed signs of recent use The electric torch played swiftly over every possible corner which could constitute a hiding place for an assassin revealing nothing Now the ever searching ray fell upon an old fashioned dresser on which was piled a miscellaneous array of articles Here were combs brushes a wig a huge magnifying glass and a gold watch With a barely suppressed exclamation Jimmie pounced upon the gold timepiece Handlon s So well did he know the particular design of his watch that he could have recognized it in the dark by sense of touch alone So the old man was not averse to robbery among his other activities The former two story man thought fast Handlon had probably been done in and the body had been disposed of in some weird manner The only thing that remained to be done since the unlucky photographer was evidently past human help was to cut short the Professor s list of murders With the intention of missing no essential detail O Hara swept the ray of the searchlight around the chamber once more but discovered no more of importance Deciding that the sleeping chamber could yield no further clue he shut off the tell tale ray and stepped noiselessly back into the next room Here he groped his way around until he encountered a door which stood open A moment s cautious exploration with an outstretched foot revealed the top step of a descending staircase No faintest glimmer of light was visible but muffled sounds proceeding from the depths told him that someone was below With infinite care feeling his way gingerly over the rickety old steps and fearful that an unexpected creak from one of the ancient boards would at any moment prove his undoing he commenced the descent Once a board did groan softly causing him to stop in his tracks and stand with bated breath He listened for sign of a movement below while his heart loudly told off a dozen strokes Stealthily he continued his progress until finally soft earth under his feet told him he had reached the cellar bottom Now his straining eyes perceived a tiny bit of light and simultaneously he became conscious of a deathly stench The damp earth padding his footsteps he advanced swiftly toward the source of light which now seemed to lie in stripes across his line of vision He soon saw that the stairs gave upon a small boarded off section of the cellar proper and light was seeping between the boards Ah and here was a rickety door fortuitously equipped with a large knot hole O Hara applied an eye to this and what he saw nearly ruined even his cast iron nerve The Professor was working beside a heavy wooden cask from which issued the horrible stench From time to time a sodden thud told that he was hacking something to pieces with an ax Now and then he would strain mightily at a dark and bulky thing which lay on the floor a thing that required considerable strength to lift It seemed to be getting lighter after each spasm of frenzied chopping For a second Kell s shadow wavered away from the thing and the enervated newspaper man saw it plainly His senses almost left him as he realized that he was witnessing the dismemberment of a human body As he hacked the fragments of tissue from the torso the fiend carefully deposited each in the huge cask At such times a faint boiling sound was heard and there arose an effluvium that bade fair to overcome even the monster engaged in the foul work At last the limbs and head had been entirely removed The Professor evidently decided that the trunk should be left whole and he put his entire strength into the job of getting it into the cask It was almost more than he could negotiate but finally a dull splash told that he had succeeded At this moment Jimmie O Hara came out of his trance The horrible proceeding had left him faint and shaken and he wished heartily that he could leave the disgusting place as fast as his legs could carry him But there was still work to be done and he resolved to get it over The lantern First he must put that out of commission The maniac would then be at his mercy Slowly steadily he stole through the doorway his eyes glued to the Professor s back Now he was within a yard of the lantern and he drew back his foot for the kick Next moment Jimmie found himself gazing into the glaring eyes of his intended victim Instinctively he struck out with the clubbed automatic but the blow must have fallen short or else the Professor had developed an uncanny agility Now to his horror he saw the flashing blade of the bloodstained ax raised on high He had no time to dodge the blow He pressed the trigger of the Colt from the position in which he held it The bullet grazed the upraised arm The ax fell toward O Hara from fingers lacking strength to retain it and he grasped it by the handle in midair The next moment the assassin collected his wits and sprang at him Silently the breath of both coming in gasps the two men strove each clawing desperately at the other s throat The reporter fought with the knowledge that should he lose he would never again see the light of day the other with the fear of the justice that would deal with him The maniac hugged his arms tightly about Jimmie pinioning him so tightly that the reporter could not use his gun At length their convulsive movements brought the men close to the lantern and the next instant the cellar was plunged in darkness A second later the Professor tripped over some hidden obstruction and fell dragging his opponent with him to the earthen floor To Jimmie s surprise there was no further movement from the body beneath him Could the old villain be playing possum He cautiously shifted his hold and grasped the hidden throat He pressed the Professor s windpipe for a moment but there was no answering struggle Slowly the truth dawned upon him The heavy fall to the floor had rendered the older man insensible He must work fast Reaching into his pocket he brought out the ever handy electric torch and flashed it over the features of his prisoner Kell was breathing heavily With dexterous hands O Hara swiftly went through the old man s pockets removing all which might tend to make that worthy dangerous an ugly looking pistol of large caliber a blackjack similar to his own and a small bottle The latter item Jimmie examined curiously finally uncorking it and inhaling the contents He inhaled not wisely but too well The fumes from the vial were nigh overpowering and he reeled back nauseated The cork he hastily replaced Just what the nature of the powerful stuff was he never attempted to discover One acquaintance was enough He staggered to his feet and got the lantern lighted then sat gun in hand waiting for his prisoner s return to his senses This was becoming increasingly imminent judging by certain changes in the Professor s respiration Finally there came a series of shuddering movements as the man attempted to raise his battered body Get up you damned butcher ordered Jimmie and march upstairs And just remember that I ve got you covered don t make any false moves He prodded the prostrate form of the by now glaring fiend before him The stench of the place was nearly overcoming him and again he felt an overwhelming desire to dash madly from that den of evil and once more breathe God s fresh air Under the stimulus of several shoves the Professor finally won to his feet and stumbled up the stairs Jimmie was taking no chances and kept the automatic sharply digging into the ribs of his prisoner The fight however seemed temporarily to have been all taken out of the old man and he made no resistance as the reporter drove him on up to the laboratory The room he found exactly as he left it At a word from him Norma Manion came from her hiding place in the horrible room where she had been kept prisoner With an hysterical scream she fell limply to the floor The sight of her father s murderer had proved too much for her Forgetting his prisoner for the moment Jimmie sprang to the girl s side Kell chose this moment to make a dash for freedom His footsteps however were not as noiseless as he had intended and O Hara whirled just in time to see his quarry about to throw open the hall door Jimmie dove for his gun only to encounter the Professor s mysterious vial which though forgotten still lay in his pocket With no time to think he acted purely upon instinct His arm drew back and the bottle flew straight for the Professor s head By a miracle the missile missed its mark Came a shivering crash as the bottle struck a stud in the massive door Of a sudden recalling the terrific potency of the contents of that particular bottle Jimmie gasped in dismay Norma Manion s safety drove every other thought from his mind At any cost he must remove her from the proximity of those lethal fumes Hastily and without a backward glance he gathered the girl into his arms and dashed into the room where he had first found her Ascertaining that she had but swooned he placed her gently on the bed In some perplexity as to his next move he stared at the beautiful face now so wan and white Queer that he hadn t noticed the fact before she was beautiful He even took a second look then noting a continued absence of all sound from the laboratory decided to investigate Gingerly he pushed open the door sniffing the air cautiously as he advanced To his nostrils gradually came a slight scent which though almost imperceptible made his senses reel As he approached the hall door he found the atmosphere heavy with the soporific vapors from the broken vial and he staggered drunkenly He gave a start of surprise On the floor lying in a grotesque huddle which suggested a most unpleasant possibility was the inert body of Professor Kell Jimmie bent over the body and put an experienced ear to the heart Yes there as a faint beat very faint Even as he listened he perceived a slight increase in the respiration Now the breath began coming in great choking gasps only to die suddenly to next to nothing At last with a rueful sigh Jimmie reached to his hip and produced the private O Hara flagon He stooped over the Professor s form once more and by dint of much prying at clenched jaws managed to force a sizeable charge of fiery liquid down the old man s throat Jimmie had just begun to entertain a strong hope that this latter effort would bring the Professor to life when his keen ear detected signs of a commotion below He sprang from his position over the slowly reviving Kell and leaped to a vantage point beside the door A blackjack miraculously appeared from some hidden part of his anatomy and the ever dependable Colt also became in evidence Now came the banging of a door muffled voices a crash as of a chair overturned in the dark Up rolled a horrible oath and the same was rendered in a voice to Jimmie sweetly familiar Came the sound of footsteps on the stairway and several persons coming along the hall Where in hell is Jimmie roared a wicked voice If he s met with any monkey business in this hell hole I ll see that the damned place burns to the ground before I leave it Delightedly Jimmie jerked open the door Still alive Chief he chirped as the Old Man strode into the laboratory Bland was followed by Perry who seemed to be in a sort of daze Bringing up the rear were a pair of plainclothesmen whom Jimmie knew very well almost too well One of these gentlemen bore a lantern which reminded Jimmie strongly of some he had seen that night guarding an open ditch in the public highway The Professor had fully regained consciousness and was struggling to his feet As for Norma Manion she had suddenly appeared leaning weakly against the door casing and was surveying the group in great alarm After being assured by O Hara that they were her friends she smiled wanly To Bland and the others she was of course an unexpected factor in the weird night s doings and for several moments they regarded her curiously At length Jimmie sensing the question in the Old Man s eyes elected to offer a few words of explanation Miss Manion has just been through a terrible experience he said She and her father have been for some time at the mercy of this monster indicating Kell and her nerves are completely shattered We d better get her out of this as quickly as we can Mike Hard Boiled Bland glared at one of the officers Don t stand there with your teeth in your gums like that Take this girl out to my car and let her lie down She needs a stimulant too If you search my car and find any red liquor in the left back door pocket I don t know a thing about it And stay with her so she won t be afraid to go to sleep She smiled in silent gratitude and allowed the plainclothesman to lead her away from that chamber of horror The reporter lost no time in telling Bland of his failure to find Skip Handlon He went on to acquaint his Chief with the facts of all that had occured while he had been at the Professor s house The fiery old fellow listened grimly When Jimmie came to the story of the corpse and the cask the editor breathed one word Manion Jimmie nodded sadly All eyes turned to the dejected huddle on the floor that was Professor Kell Finally Bland could wait no longer but fixed a terrible eye on the murderer and demanded harshly Where s Handlon Now the Professor burst into a fit of insane laughter laughter that curdled the blood of the listeners You ask me that It s almost too good Hee hee You sent your two precious reporters out to my house to pry into my secrets and thought to display my name all over your yellow sheet but you forgot that you were dealing with Professor Anton Kell didn t you The last he fairly shrieked A lot of people have tried to intrude upon me before but none ever escaped me We know that cut in Jimmie for he was getting impatient and the old man s boastings seemed out of place You are slated for the rope anyway after what I discovered down cellar He jerked his eyes in the direction of the door significantly Now we propose to find Handlon and the better it will be for you if you tell us what you have done with him Otherwise You can go to hell screamed the maniac If you are so clever find out for yourselves He isn t so far away that you couldn t touch him by reaching out your hand In fact he s been with you quite a while Hee hee hee Well if you must know there he is With an insane chuckle he pointed at Horace Perry And Perry did a strange thing Yes you fiend here I am Whose voice was that Was it Perry speaking or was it Skip Handlon Most assuredly Perry stood before them but the voice in a subtle manner reminded the group strongly of poor old Skip As he spoke Perry had launched himself at the Professor s throat and had to be restrained by the others Savagely he fought them but slowly and surely they overcame his struggles and placed him writhing in a chair Of a sudden Bland leaned forward and scrutinized Perry s face sharply Had the reporter gone insane too The pupils of the eyes had taken on a sort of queer contraction a fixed quality that was almost ludicrous He looked like a man under hypnosis He had gone limp in their grasp but now suddenly he stiffened The eyes underwent another startling change this time glowing undoubtedly with the look of reason Bland was mystified and waited for Perry to explain his queer conduct The latter seemed finally to come to Simultaneously he realized that his peculiar lapse from consciousness had been observed by the others Guess I may as well admit it he said with a wry smile Ever since I came back from my assignment with Kell I have had a hell of a time Half the time I have been in a daze and have not had the least idea what I was doing Funny part of it is that I have seemed to keep right on doing things even while I was out of my head He told briefly of the visions he had had in which he had seemed to contend with his brother reporter the horrid sensations as he felt himself overcome the black oblivion in which he then found himself and the mysterious manner in which he had left Keegan on that ill fated assignment What have you done to Handlon Jimmie s voice cut in He was standing over the form of the maniac rigid and menacing You have exactly two minutes to go Find out for yourself snarled the bruised and battered fiend I will was the answer and on the instant a horrible shriek rent the air Jimmie had quickly grasped both of the Professor s arms at the wrists and was slowly twisting them in a grip of iron Kell s face went white the lips writhed back over toothless gums the eyes closed in the supreme effort to withstand the excruciating pain Then Enough enough he screamed O Hara eased the pressure slightly but retained his hold upon the clawlike hands Talk fast he ordered The old man struggled futilely in the grasp of the powerful reporter finally glancing in the direction of the others Would they show signs of pity Surely not Hard Boiled Bland The Chief was watching the struggles of the victim through a cloud of tobacco smoke which he was slowly exhaling through his nose The plainclothesman displayed no sign of interest at all The game was up Very well he said sullenly Handlon and Perry are both occupying the same body Wh a a t roared Bland Jimmie I guess you ll have to put the screws to him some more He s trying to make fools of us at the last minute No no screamed the Professor What I say is true I have been working for years on my system of de astralization This last year I at length perfected my electric de astralizer which amplifies and exerts the fifth influence of de cohesion The whole party began to look uneasy and gazed apprehensively at the huge Crookes tube which still stood in its supporting frame on the table I have been forced to experiment on animals for the most part the Professor continued I succeeded in de astralizing a dog and a bull and caused them to exchange bodies The bodies continued to function I was enthusiastic Other experiments took place of which I will not tell you Finally I began to long for a human subject on which to try my fifth influence Just get down to cases if you don t mind Kell The Chief wanted action Suppose you tell us just what you did to Handlon and where we can find him I may as well mention that your life depends upon it If we find that you have done for him something worse than death may happen to you The tone was menacing Although Handlon was a comparatively late acquisition to the old Chief s staff still he had been loyal to the paper When your two damned reporters entered my driveway Kell resumed I saw them coming through a powerful glass which I always have on hand I had no desire to see them but they forced themselves upon me At last I determined that they should furnish material for my experiments If your men had looked into the grove behind the barn they would have found the automobile which furnished two more subjects I was keeping on hand in a room upstairs Old Manion and his daughter gave me quite a bit of trouble but I kept them drugged most of the time He broke out of the room to night though and I had to kill him It was self defense he added slyly Anyway I found it was possible to make two astrals exchange bodies But I also wanted to see if it were possible to cause two astrals to occupy the same body at the same time and if so what the result would be I found out It was rare sport to watch your star reporter leave my house He was damned glad to leave I believe Again came the insane cackle Guess we have to believe him whether we want to or not The detective came to life How about making him release Handlon s what d ye call it astral from Perry s body Just a moment The voice now was unmistakably Handlon s though it was issuing from the throat of Perry In the minute I have in consciousness let me suggest that before you do any more de astralizing you locate my body Until then if I am released from this one I am a dead man The words struck the group dumb Where was Handlon s body Could the Professor produce it That worthy looked rather haunted at that moment and they began to see the fear of death coming upon him Mercy mercy he begged as the four men started to advance upon him As soon as I had de astralized Handlon I destroyed his body in my pickling barrel down cellar But there is another way He paused uncertain as to how his next words would be received Go out and get the Manion girl She can be de astralized and friend Handlon can have her body At this suggestion advanced so naively the four men recoiled in horror It was entirely too much even for Hard Boiled Bland and he could hardly restrain himself from applying the editorial fist to the leering face before him Undoubtedly Professor Kell was hopelessly insane and for that reason he held himself in leash Kell you are slated to pull off one more stunt Jimmie addressed the cringing heap You know what it is Get busy And just remember that I am standing over here he indicated a corner well separated from the rest with this cannon aimed in your direction If things aren t just according to Hoyle you get plugged Get me What about it men Bland spoke up Is it going to be treating Handlon right to de astralize him now It will be his last chance to have a body on this earth Unfortunately that body never belonged to Handlon said O Hara Hence I fail to see why Perry should be discommoded for the balance of his life with a companion astral Perry is clearly entitled to his own body free and unhampered Friend Skip is out of luck unless Well I don t mind telling you Kell that you just gave me an idea Snap into it now The Professor dragged himself to his feet and under the menace of the automatic fumbled under the table until he had located the intricate apparatus before mentioned Now if mister Perry or Handlon will kindly recline at full length on this table he said with an obscene leer the experiment will begin Just remember Kell this is no experiment advised Bland fixing the Professor with an ugly eye You do as you re told The other made no reply but threw a hidden switch Perry lying flat on his back on the ancient table suddenly found himself being bathed by what seemed to be a ray of light and yet was not a ray of light What was it It was surely not visible yet it was tangible A terrific force was emanating from that devilish globe above him drawing him out of himself or no was he expanding Again his ears became filled with confused horrible sounds the outlines of the room faded from sight he felt a strange sense of inflation of lightness Oblivion From where the others sat a gasp of wonder went up At the first contact of the switch there had been a momentary flash of greenish light within the bulb and then a swift transition to a beautiful orange It had then faded altogether leaving the glass apparently inert and inactive But it was not so The form lying beneath the bulb was evidently being racked with untold tortures The face became a thing of horror Now it had twisted into a grotesque semblance of Handlon s now it again resembled Perry s The Professor quietly increased the pressure of the current From the bulb emanated a steel gray exhalation of what must be termed light and yet so real it was seemingly material Assuredly it was not a ray of light as we understand light It came in great beating throbs in which the actual vibrations were entirely visible Under each impact the body of Perry seemed to change slowly at first then with increasing speed The body was now swelled to enormous size Bland reached forward to touch it This de cohering influence the Professor was murmuring almost raptly causes the atoms that go to make a living body repel one another When the body is sufficiently nebulized the soul Back Back you fool he suddenly shrieked grasping Bland by the arm Do you want to kill him Bland hurriedly retreated convinced perforce that Kell s alarm was genuine The editorial fingers had penetrated the subject s garments without resistance and sank into the body as easily as if it were so much soft soap The body continued to expand until at length even the hard headed plainclothesman realized that it had been reduced to a mere vapor Within this horrid vaporized body which nearly filled the room and which had now lost all semblance to a man could be discerned two faint shapes Swiftly the Professor extinguished the lantern The shapes vague though they were could be recognized as those of Horace Perry and Skip Handlon And they were at strife All eyes were now focused on Professor Kell who was evidently waiting for something to happen The two apparitions within the body cloud were at death grips One had been overcome and was temporarily helpless It was that of Handlon And then again the astral of Perry forcibly ousted that of Handlon from the cloud cyst And at that instant Professor Kell shut off the influence tube At once a terrific metamorphosis took place There came a sharp sound almost like a clap of thunder with the slight exception that this was occasioned by exactly the reverse effect Instead of being an ex plosion it might more properly be termed an in plosion for the mist cloud suddenly vanished The de cohering influence having been removed the cloud had condensed into the form of Perry Apparently none the worse he was even now beginning to recover consciousness The astral of Handlon was no longer visible though hovering in the vicinity Perry s body was again his own At this time Jimmie O Hara elected to start something new by hitting the Professor a workmanlike blow on the back of the head with the butt of his automatic The next thing Bland or anyone else present knew the unconscious body of the Professor was on the table and Jimmie was groping for the concealed switch At length he found it and the green flash of light appeared in the bulb followed by the brilliant orange manifestation What in hell are you doing gasped Bland De astralizing the Professor replied O Hara cheerfully Don t you get the idea yet Watch Fascinated the four men saw the terrific emanation take its baleful effect As before the body commenced to expand and gradually took on a misty outline Larger and larger it grew until finally it had become a vast cloud of intangible nothingness which filled the room like some evil nebula A cry of consternation from the detective aroused Jimmie Skip Handlon s astral had appeared within the field of the nebula to fight for possession There ensued what was perhaps the weirdest encounter ever witnessed Though he was in poor physical shape the Professor seemed to have an extremely powerful astral and for some time the spectators despaired of Handlon s victory Once the latter evidently realizing that the powerful influence tube had rendered him visible glanced sharply in Jimmie s direction O Hara was considerably puzzled at this but watched the progress of the struggle tensely At length the moment seemed to arrive which the reporter s astral had been awaiting It turned tail and fled away from the astral of the Professor disappearing beyond the outer confines of the nebula Jimmie suddenly divined the other s purpose and dived for the hidden switch As he had anticipated Handlon had finally given up the attempt to overcome the astral of Kell by force and had made up his mind to accomplish his end by strategy Almost on the instant that Jimmie s hand closed on the switch the reporter s astral again leaped into the field of the nebula Fiercely it signalled to the former second story man to shut off the current but the admonition was unnecessary for Jimmie had already done so Swiftly the cloud cyst faded Even as the group caught a fleeting sight of Skip Handlon the last that mortal eyes would ever see of him as he actually was there came a violent disturbance at the edge of the shrinking nebula Would the speed of condensation of the atoms which comprised the body of Professor Kell serve to shut out the pursuing astral of Kell Even Bland held his breath The cloud lost its luminous quality the action of condensation increasing in speed It was barely visible in the enshrouding gloom An astral had long since been enveloped within the rapidly accumulating substance Came a sudden clap of sound as before and the final act of resolution had been accomplished Whether the Professor had succeeded in regaining a position within the cloud cyst before the crucial second none could say Jimmie relighted the lantern Apparently the effect of the love tap administered by his automatic was more or less of a lasting character and the men were put to some ado to restore the body of Kell to consciousness At length their efforts began to bear fruit however and it became expedient to remove the patient to the softer couch in the sitting room below As they moved forward to lay hold of the limp body a figure appeared in the doorway to the hall It was the plainclothesman Riley How about getting under way for town he wanted to know Is the old party croaked yet Miss Manion has had a fierce time and says she won t stay near this house another minute I don t like this place myself either Do you know I just got kicked by a poll parrot Let s get away from here Hold on Riley what are you talking about growled Bland Kicked by a poll parrot You re That s all right Chief broke in the now thoroughly cheerful Perry That jackass I shot could probably have told us all about it I positively know the beast could talk Humph snorted Bland Well if a donkey can talk and a bull can bite and a hound can hook why shouldn t a parrot Judas Priest I m getting as crazy as the rest of you Hurry up and get Kell downstairs so we can see who he is There I go again Oh go lie down Riley But look Bland look Riley was pointing a demoralized finger at a cage in the corner He tugged frantically at Bland s coat sleeve See what s in there won t you I well I did find some liquor in your car and Miss Manion made me take some I I didn t know it would do this to me Look in there please mister Bland Bland gave Riley a dark look but nevertheless he reached for O Hara s flashlight In the cage two yellow eyes blinked sleepily out at him Perry began to laugh Why there s nothing in there but a cat Skip and I heard it purring when we first came in here this afternoon Guess Riley Great God Jimmie give me your gun Hard Boiled Bland for the moment failed to merit his sobriquet The torch in his hand threw a trembling beam full into the cage It s a snake And there It s doing it again A snake it was indubitably a huge black specimen with bright yellow stripes Bland s frenzied yell seemed not to have excited it at all for now the sleek fellow had arched its body neatly and was calmly licking its sides with a long forked tongue After a moment it halted the operation long enough to rub its jaw against a bar of its cage and gave vent to a sociable mew Even this could not dash the spirits of Horace Perry He laughed delightedly again as he laid Bland by the arm That creature is perfectly harmless Chief he told the editor Somewhere I suppose there s a mighty dangerous kitty cat at large but there s no sense in taking it out on this poor reptile Let s live and let live With a show of reluctance Bland returned Jimmie s automatic then strode over to where lay the form of Kell Perry and O Hara lingered by the cage long enough to arrange a plan to let the snake out doors as soon as opportunity offered after which they joined their Chief Riley went out to resume his vigil in Bland s car while his fellow sleuth prepared to light the way downstairs Under his guidance the sick man was carried below without mishap Downstairs the now conscious form of the venerable Professor was laid out on the ancient sofa until his senses could clear a bit Presently the eyelids fluttered open and a feeble voice asked Where the deuce am I and how did all you guys get here A joyous gasp went up That voice Although uttered in somewhat the same vocal quality as Kell s the intonation and accents had strangely altered O Hara leaned eagerly over the figure on the couch The question he asked was startling in its incongruity How are you feeling Skip Rotten was the reply from the lips of Kell What hit me such a crack on the dome I feel as if I had been dragged through a knot hole Lemme up Stay still commanded O Hara kindly but firmly You aren t fit to move yet You are going on a long ride and will need your strength Don t talk either A half hour later they left the house In the front yard the editor called a hasty conclave which included the entire party Hard Boiled Bland has never been known to talk so much at a stretch before or since Before we start back he began we had better come to an understanding In the first place Skip come over here a minute Norma Manion uttered an involuntary cry of fear as the aged form of Kell passed by her Skip s instant response to his name had of course been perfectly natural to him But it had an odd effect on the others Miss Manion and gentlemen Bland went on with a bow of mock ceremony I want you to meet Mister er Mister oh hell call him Saunders This is mister Kenneth Saunders ladies and gentlemen When he gets a shave and has his new face patched up I believe you will like his appearance much more than you do now Seriously though folks I hope that with a little fixing up the gentleman will hardly resemble Professor Anton Kell Kell is dead Obviously however this gentleman can hardly continue his existence as Skip Handlon Hence well hence mister Saunders And don t forget the name Now another little matter This house has proven a curse to humanity What has transpired here need never be known Would it not be the wiser to eliminate all traces of to night s happenings There is a way He looked significantly at the others You mean began Perry That we destroy all traces of Professor Kell s villainy Although he is no more still someone might notice that his body actively remains And no one wants to do any explaining It s the only way we can protect Handlon one of the sleuths ruminated half to himself No judge would ever believe a word about this de astralization business The chances are we would all go to the booby hatch and Handlon would go to prison for Kell s crimes There were four of us that witnessed the fact of the the soul transfusion though Perry objected Wouldn t that be enough to clear Skip Besides wouldn t it be possible for us to lead a jury out here and duplicate the experiment Too much undesirable publicity growled Bland who for once in his life had found reason to keep something good out of the headlines What do you say people I move we move from the detective who had had the uncomfortable job of attending to Norma Manion Gentleman I believe we understand each other said Jimmie quietly Now I am going into the barn significantly to see if everything s all right While I am there something might happen You understand The others nodded silent assent In the snug seat of Jimmie s speedster Norma Manion shivered as she followed the direction indicated by her companion s finger It was that darkest hour which comes just before the dawn To the westward could be perceived a dull red glow which even as they watched with fascinated eyes developed into an intense glare Gradually the fading stars became eclipsed in the greater glory Three cars motors throbbing as if eager to be gone stood a space apart on the main road The car behind O Hara s was the Manion machine now occupied by Bland and Riley The remaining one was a touring car and contained the balance of the party Perry was at the wheel and beside him sat the Handlon Kell Saunders combination Thus passes a den of horror whispered Jimmie to his companion It is the funeral pyre of my father the girl answered simply She had long since recovered from her initial outburst of grief at her loss and now watched the progress of the conflagration dry eyed At length Jimmie slipped an arm protectingly about the trembling shoulders You have seen enough he said

8088_284756_000022_000002	train-clean-100	Usually his clean cut olive tinted face was a polite mask that seldom showed even the slightest trace of emotion 
8088_284756_000022_000003	train-clean-100	His eyes dark and large smiled easily and shone with interest but his almost beautiful mouth beneath the long slim mustache always closely cropped seldom smiled with his eyes 
8088_284756_000023_000000	train-clean-100	But it was his present excited speech that amazed me most 
8088_284756_000023_000001	train-clean-100	Mercer during all the years I had known him had never been moved before to such tempestuous outbursts of enthusiasm 
8088_284756_000023_000002	train-clean-100	It was his habit to speak slowly and thoughtfully in his low musical voice even in the midst of our hottest arguments and we had had many of them his voice had never lost its calm unhurried gentleness 
none	none	To my surprise instead of leading the way to the really comfortable although rather gaudy living room Mercer turned to the left towards what had been the billiard room and was now his laboratory 
8088_284756_000025_000000	train-clean-100	The laboratory brilliantly illuminated was littered as usual with apparatus of every description 
8088_284756_000025_000001	train-clean-100	Along one wall were the retorts scales racks hoods and elaborate set ups like the articulated glass and rubber bones of some weird prehistoric monster that demonstrated Mercer s taste for this branch of science 
none	none	On the other side of the room a corresponding workbench was littered with a tangle of coils transformers meters tools and instruments and at the end of the room behind high black control panels with gleaming bus bars and staring gaping meters a pair of generators hummed softly 
8088_284756_000025_000003	train-clean-100	The other end of the room was nearly all glass and opened onto the patio and the swimming pool 
none	none	Mercer paused a moment with his hand on the knob of the door a strange light in his dark eyes
8088_284756_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Now you ll see why I called you here he said tensely 
8088_284756_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 You can judge for yourself whether the trip was worth while 
8088_284756_000027_000002	train-clean-100	Here she is 
8088_284756_000028_000000	train-clean-100	With a gesture he flung open the door and I stared following his glance down at the great tiled swimming pool 
8088_284756_000029_000000	train-clean-100	It is difficult for me to describe the scene 
8088_284756_000029_000001	train-clean-100	The patio was not large but it was beautifully done 
none	none	Flowers and shrubs even a few small palms grew in profusion in the enclosure while above through the movable glass roof made in sections to disappear in fine weather was the empty blackness of the sky None of the lights provided for the illumination of the covered patio was turned on but all the windows surrounding the patio were aglow and I could see the pool quite clearly 
8088_284756_000031_000000	train-clean-100	The pool and its occupant 
8088_284756_000032_000000	train-clean-100	We were standing at one side of the pool near the center 
8088_284756_000032_000001	train-clean-100	Directly opposite us seated on the bottom of the pool was a human figure nude save for a great mass of tawny hair that fell about her like a silken mantle 
none	none	The strangely graceful figure of a girl one leg stretched out straight before her the other drawn up and clasped by the interlocked fingers of her hands Even in the soft light I could see her perfectly through the clear water her pale body outlined sharply against the jade green tiles 
8088_284756_000033_000000	train-clean-100	I tore myself away from the staring curious eyes of the figure 
8088_284756_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 In God s name Mercer what is it 
8088_284756_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Porcelain 
8088_284756_000034_000001	train-clean-100	Porcelain I asked hoarsely 
8088_284756_000034_000002	train-clean-100	The thing had an indescribably eery effect 
8088_284756_000035_000000	train-clean-100	He laughed wildly 
none	none	Porcelain Watch look My eyes followed his pointing finger 
8088_284756_000037_000001	train-clean-100	The figure was moving 
none	none	Gracefully it arose to its full height 
8088_284756_000037_000003	train-clean-100	The great cloud of corn colored hair floated down about it falling below the knees 
none	none	Slowly with a grace of movement comparable only with the slow soaring of a gull she came toward me walking on the bottom of the pool through the clear water as though she floated in air 
8088_284756_000038_000000	train-clean-100	Fascinated I watched her 
8088_284756_000038_000001	train-clean-100	Her eyes startlingly large and dark in the strangely white face were fixed on mine 
8088_284756_000038_000002	train-clean-100	There was nothing sinister in the gaze yet I felt my body shaking as though in the grip of a terrible fear 
8088_284756_000038_000003	train-clean-100	I tried to look away and found myself unable to move 
8088_284756_000038_000004	train-clean-100	I felt Mercer s tense sudden grip upon my arm but I did not could not look at him 
none	none	She she s smiling I heard him exclaim 
8088_284756_000039_000001	train-clean-100	He laughed an excited high pitched laugh that irritated me in some subtle way 
8088_284756_000040_000000	train-clean-100	She was smiling and looking up into my eyes 
8088_284756_000040_000001	train-clean-100	She was very close now within a few feet of us 
8088_284756_000040_000002	train-clean-100	She came still closer until she was at my very feet as I stood on the raised ledge that ran around the edge of the pool her head thrown back staring straight up at me through the water 
none	none	I could see her teeth very white between her coral pink lips and her bosom rising and falling beneath the veil of pale gold hair She was breathing water 
8088_284756_000042_000000	train-clean-100	Mercer literally jerked me away from the edge of the pool 
8088_284756_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 What do you think of her Taylor he asked his dark eyes dancing with excitement 
8088_284756_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Tell me about it I said shaking my head dazedly 
none	none	She is not human I don t know I think so 
8088_284756_000045_000002	train-clean-100	As human as you or I I ll tell you all I know and then you can judge for yourself 
none	none	I think we ll know in a few minutes if my plans work out 
8088_284756_000045_000004	train-clean-100	But first slip on a bathing suit 
8088_284756_000046_000000	train-clean-100	I didn t argue the matter 
none	none	I let Mercer lead me away without a word And while I was changing he told me all he knew of the strange creature in the pool
8088_284756_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Late this afternoon I decided to go for a little walk along the beach Mercer began 
none	none	I had been working like the devil since early in the morning running some tests on what you call my thought telegraph I felt the need of some fresh sea air I walked along briskly for perhaps five minutes keeping just out of reach of the rollers and the spray The shore was littered with all sorts of flotsam and jetsam washed up by the big storm and I was just thinking that I would have to have a man with a truck come and clean up the shore in front of the place when in a little sandy pool I saw her
8088_284756_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 She was laying face down in the water motionless her head towards the sea one arm stretched out before her and her long hair wrapped around her like a half transparent cloak 
8088_284756_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 I ran up and lifted her from the water 
8088_284756_000050_000001	train-clean-100	Her body was cold and deathly white although her lips were faintly pink and her heart was beating faintly but steadily 
8088_284756_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 Like most people in an emergency 
none	none	I forgot all I ever knew about first aid All I could think of was to give her a drink and of course I didn t have a flask on my person 
8088_284756_000051_000003	train-clean-100	So I picked her up in my arms and brought her to the house as quickly as I could 
8088_284756_000051_000004	train-clean-100	She seemed to be reviving for she was struggling and gasping when I got here with her 
8088_284756_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 I placed her on the bed in the guest room and poured her a stiff drink of Scotch half a tumblerful I believe 
8088_284756_000052_000001	train-clean-100	Lifting up her head I placed the glass to her lips 
none	none	She looked up me blinking and took the liquor in a single draught 
8088_284756_000052_000003	train-clean-100	She did not seem to drink it but sucked it out of the glass in a single amazing gulp that s the only word for it 
8088_284756_000052_000004	train-clean-100	The next instant she was off the bed her face a perfect mask of hate and agony 
none	none	She came at me hands clutching and clawing making odd murmuring or mewing sounds in her throat It was then that I noticed for the first time that her hands were webbed
8088_284756_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 Webbed I asked startled 
8088_284756_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Webbed nodded Mercer solemnly 
8088_284756_000055_000001	train-clean-100	 As are her feet 
8088_284756_000055_000002	train-clean-100	But listen Taylor I was amazed and not a little rattled when she came for me 
none	none	I ran through the French windows out into the patio 
8088_284756_000055_000004	train-clean-100	For a moment she ran after me rather awkwardly and heavily but swiftly nevertheless 
8088_284756_000055_000005	train-clean-100	Then she saw the pool 
8088_284756_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 Apparently forgetting that I existed she leaped into the water and as I approached a moment later I could see her breathing deeply and gratefully a smile of relief upon her features as she lay upon the bottom of the pool 
8088_284756_000056_000001	train-clean-100	Breathing Taylor on the bottom of the pool 
8088_284756_000056_000002	train-clean-100	Under eight feet of water 
8088_284756_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 And then what Mercer I reminded him as he paused apparently lost in thought 
none	none	I tried to find out more about her 
8088_284756_000058_000001	train-clean-100	I put on my bathing suit and dived into the pool 
8088_284756_000058_000002	train-clean-100	Well she came at me like a shark quick as a flash her teeth showing her hands tearing like claws through the water 
8088_284756_000058_000003	train-clean-100	I turned but not quickly enough to entirely escape 
none	none	See Mercer threw back the dressing robe and I saw a ragged tear in his bathing suit on his left side near the waist 
8088_284756_000058_000005	train-clean-100	Through the rent three deep jagged scratches were clearly visible 
8088_284756_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 She managed to claw me just once Mercer resumed wrapping the robe about him again 
8088_284756_000059_000001	train-clean-100	 Then I got out and called on Carson for help 
8088_284756_000059_000002	train-clean-100	I put him into a bathing suit and we both endeavored to corner her 
none	none	Carson got two bad scratches and one rather serious bite that I have bandaged I have a number of lacerations but I didn t fare so badly as Carson because I am faster in the water than he is
8088_284756_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 The harder we tried the more determined I became 
8088_284756_000060_000001	train-clean-100	She would sit there calm and placid until one of us entered the water 
8088_284756_000060_000002	train-clean-100	Then she became a veritable fury 
8088_284756_000060_000003	train-clean-100	It was maddening 
8088_284756_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 At last I thought of you 
8088_284756_000061_000001	train-clean-100	I phoned and here we are 
8088_284756_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 But Mercer it s a nightmare I protested 
none	none	We moved out of the room Nothing human can live under water and breathe water as she does 
8088_284756_000063_000000	train-clean-100	Mercer paused a moment staring at me oddly 
8088_284756_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 The human race he said gravely came up out of sea 
8088_284756_000064_000001	train-clean-100	The human race as we know it 
none	none	Some may have gone back He turned and walked away again and I hurried after him What do you mean Mercer
8088_284756_000065_000002	train-clean-100	 Some may have gone back I don t get it 
8088_284756_000066_000000	train-clean-100	Mercer shook his head but made no other reply until we stood again on the edge of the pool 
8088_284756_000067_000000	train-clean-100	The girl was standing where we had left her and as she looked up into my face she smiled again and made a quick gesture with one hand 
8088_284756_000067_000001	train-clean-100	It seemed to me that she invited me to join her 
8088_284756_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 I believe she likes you Taylor said Mercer thoughtfully 
8088_284756_000068_000001	train-clean-100	 You re light light skin light hair 
8088_284756_000068_000002	train-clean-100	Carson and I are both very dark almost swarthy 
8088_284756_000068_000003	train-clean-100	And in that white bathing suit yes I believe she s taken a fancy to you 
8088_284756_000069_000000	train-clean-100	Mercer s eyes were dancing 
8088_284756_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 If she has he went on it ll make our work very easy 
8088_284756_000071_000000	train-clean-100	 What work I asked suspiciously 
8088_284756_000071_000001	train-clean-100	Mercer always an indefatigable experimenter was never above using his friends in the benefit of science 
8088_284756_000071_000002	train-clean-100	And some of his experiments in the past had been rather trying not to say exciting 
8088_284756_000072_000000	train-clean-100	 I think I have what you call my thought telegraph perfected experimentally he explained rapidly 
8088_284756_000072_000001	train-clean-100	 I fell asleep working on it at three o clock or thereabouts this morning and some tests with Carson seem to indicate that it is a success 
8088_284756_000072_000002	train-clean-100	I should have called you to morrow for further test 
none	none	Nearly five years of damned hard work to a successful conclusion Taylor and then this mermaid comes along and makes my experiment appear about as important as one of those breakers rolling in out there
8088_284756_000073_000000	train-clean-100	 And what do you plan to do now I asked eagerly glancing down at the beautiful pale face that glimmered up at me through the clear water of the pool 
8088_284756_000074_000000	train-clean-100	 Why try it on her exclaimed Mercer with mounting enthusiasm 
8088_284756_000074_000001	train-clean-100	 Don t you see Taylor 
8088_284756_000074_000002	train-clean-100	If it will work on her and we can direct her thoughts we can find out her history the history of her people 
8088_284756_000074_000003	train-clean-100	We ll add a page to scientific history a whole big chapter that will make us famous Man this is so big it s swept me off my feet 
8088_284756_000074_000004	train-clean-100	Look And he held out a thin aristocratic brown hand before my eyes a hand that shook with nervous excitement 
8088_284756_000075_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t blame you I said quickly 
none	none	I m no savant and still I see what an amazing thing this is 
8088_284756_000075_000002	train-clean-100	Let s get busy 
8088_284756_000075_000003	train-clean-100	What can I do 
8088_284756_000076_000000	train-clean-100	Mercer reached around the door into the laboratory and pressed a button 
8088_284756_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 For Carson he explained 
8088_284756_000077_000001	train-clean-100	 We ll need his help 
8088_284756_000077_000002	train-clean-100	In the meantime we ll look over the set up 
8088_284756_000077_000003	train-clean-100	The apparatus is strewn all over the place 
8088_284756_000078_000000	train-clean-100	He had not exaggerated 
8088_284756_000078_000001	train-clean-100	The set up consisted of a whole bank of tubes each one in its own shielding copper box 
none	none	On a much drilled horizontal panel propped up on insulators were half a score of delicate meters of one kind and another with thin black fingers that pulsed and trembled Behind the panel was a tall cylinder wound with shining copper wire and beside it another panel upright fairly bristling with knobs contact points potentiometers rheostats and switches 
8088_284756_000078_000003	train-clean-100	On the end of the table nearest the door was still another panel the smallest of the lot bearing only a series of jacks along one side and in the center a switch with four contact points 
8088_284756_000078_000004	train-clean-100	A heavy snaky cable led from this panel to the maze of apparatus further on 
8088_284756_000079_000000	train-clean-100	 This is the control panel explained Mercer 
8088_284756_000079_000001	train-clean-100	 The whole affair you understand is in laboratory form 
none	none	Nothing assembled 
8088_284756_000079_000003	train-clean-100	Put the different antennae plug into these jacks 
none	none	Like this 
8088_284756_000080_000000	train-clean-100	He picked up a weird hastily built contrivance composed of two semi circular pieces of spring brass crossed at right angles 
8088_284756_000080_000001	train-clean-100	On all four ends were bright silvery electrodes three of them circular in shape one of them elongated and slightly curved 
8088_284756_000080_000002	train-clean-100	With a quick nervous gesture Mercer fitted the thing to his head so that the elongated electrode pressed against the back of his neck extending a few inches down his spine 
8088_284756_000080_000003	train-clean-100	The other three circular electrodes rested on his forehead and either side of his head 
none	none	From the center of the contrivance ran a heavy insulated cord some ten feet in length ending in a simple switchboard plug which Mercer fitted into the uppermost of the three jacks
8088_284756_000081_000000	train-clean-100	 Now he directed you put on this one he adjusted a second contrivance upon my head smiling as I shrank from the contact of the cold metal on my skin and think 
8088_284756_000082_000000	train-clean-100	He moved the switch from the position marked Off to the second contact point watching me intently his dark eyes gleaming 
none	none	Carson entered and Mercer gestured to him to wait 
8088_284756_000083_000001	train-clean-100	Very nice old chap Carson impressive even in his bathing suit 
8088_284756_000083_000002	train-clean-100	Mercer was mighty lucky to have a man like Carson 
8088_284756_000084_000000	train-clean-100	Something seemed to tick suddenly somewhere deep in my consciousness 
8088_284756_000085_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes that s very true Carson is a most decent sort of chap The words were not spoken 
none	none	I did not hear them I knew them 
8088_284756_000085_000002	train-clean-100	What I glanced at Mercer and he laughed aloud with pleasure and excitement 
8088_284756_000086_000000	train-clean-100	 It worked he cried 
8088_284756_000086_000001	train-clean-100	 I received your thought regarding Carson and then turned the switch so that you received my thought 
8088_284756_000086_000002	train-clean-100	And you did 
8088_284756_000087_000000	train-clean-100	Rather gingerly I removed the thing from my head and laid it on the table 
8088_284756_000088_000000	train-clean-100	 It s wizardry Mercer 
none	none	If it will work as well on her
8088_284756_000089_000000	train-clean-100	 It will I know it will if we can get her to wear one of these replied Mercer confidently 
8088_284756_000089_000001	train-clean-100	 I have only three of them I had planned some three cornered experiments with you Carson and myself 
8088_284756_000089_000002	train-clean-100	We ll leave Carson out of to night s experiment however for we ll need him to operate this switch 
8088_284756_000089_000003	train-clean-100	You see as it is now wired only one person transmits thoughts at a time 
8088_284756_000089_000004	train-clean-100	The other two receive 
none	none	When the switch is on the first contact Number One sends and Numbers Two and Three receive When the switch is on Number Two then he sends thoughts and Numbers One and Three receive them 
8088_284756_000089_000007	train-clean-100	And so on 
8088_284756_000089_000008	train-clean-100	I ll lengthen these leads so that we can run them out into the pool and then we ll be ready Somehow we must induce her to wear one of these things even if we have to use force 
8088_284756_000089_000009	train-clean-100	I m sure the three of us can handle her 
8088_284756_000090_000000	train-clean-100	 We should be able to I smiled 
8088_284756_000090_000001	train-clean-100	She was such a slim graceful almost delicate little thing the thought that three strong men might not be able to control her seemed almost amusing 
none	none	You haven t seen her in action yet said Mercer grimly glancing up from his work of lengthening the cords that led from the antennae to the control panel
8088_284756_000091_000001	train-clean-100	 And what s more I hope you don t 
8088_284756_000092_000000	train-clean-100	I watched him in silence as he spliced and securely taped the last connection 
8088_284756_000093_000000	train-clean-100	 All set he nodded 
8088_284756_000093_000001	train-clean-100	 Carson will you operate the switch for us 
8088_284756_000093_000002	train-clean-100	I believe everything is functioning properly He surveyed the panel of instruments hastily assuring himself that every reading was correct Then with all three of the devices he called antennae in his hand their leads plugged into the control panel he led the way to the side of the pool 
none	none	The girl was strolling around the edge of the pool feeling the smooth tile sides with her hands as we came into view but as soon as she saw us she shot through the water to where we were standing It was the first time I had seen her move in this fashion 
8088_284756_000095_000001	train-clean-100	She seemed to propel herself with a sudden mighty thrust of her feet against the bottom she darted through the water with the speed of an arrow yet stopped as gently as though she had merely floated there 
8088_284756_000096_000000	train-clean-100	As she looked up her eyes unmistakably sought mine and her smile seemed warm and inviting 
8088_284756_000096_000001	train-clean-100	She made again that strange little gesture of invitation 
8088_284756_000097_000000	train-clean-100	With an effort I glanced at Mercer 
8088_284756_000097_000001	train-clean-100	There was something devilishly fascinating about the girl s great dark searching eyes 
8088_284756_000098_000000	train-clean-100	 I m going in I said hoarsely 
none	none	Hand me one of your head set things when I reach for it Before he could protest I dived into the pool 
8088_284756_000099_000000	train-clean-100	I headed directly towards the heavy bronze ladder that led to the bottom of the pool 
8088_284756_000099_000001	train-clean-100	I had two reasons in mind 
8088_284756_000099_000002	train-clean-100	I would need something to keep me under water with my lungs full of air and I could get out quickly if it were necessary 
none	none	I had not forgotten the livid jagged furrows in Mercer s side 
8088_284756_000100_000000	train-clean-100	Quickly as I shot to the ladder she was there before me a dim wavering white shape waiting 
none	none	I paused holding to a rung of the ladder with one hand 
8088_284756_000101_000001	train-clean-100	She came closer walking with the airy grace I had noted before and my heart pounded against my ribs as she raised one long slim arm towards me 
none	none	The hand dropped gently on my shoulder pressed it as though in token of friendship 
8088_284756_000102_000001	train-clean-100	Perhaps I thought quickly this was with her a sign of greeting 
none	none	I lifted my own arm and returned the salutation if salutation it were aware of a strange rising and falling sound as of a distant humming in my ears The sound ceased suddenly on a rising note as though of inquiry and it dawned on me that I had heard the speech of this strange creature Before I could think of a course of action my aching lungs reminded me of the need of air and I released my hold on the ladder and let my body rise to the surface As my head broke the water a hand cold and strong as steel closed around my ankle 
8088_284756_000104_000001	train-clean-100	I looked down 
8088_284756_000104_000002	train-clean-100	The girl was watching me and there was no smile on her face now 
none	none	All right I shouted across the pool to Mercer who was watching anxiously 
8088_284756_000105_000001	train-clean-100	Then filling my lungs with air again I pulled myself by means of the ladder to the bottom of the pool 
none	none	The restraining hand was removed instantly 
8088_284756_000106_000000	train-clean-100	The strange creature thrust her face close to mine as my feet touched bottom and for the first time I saw her features distinctly 
none	none	She was beautiful but in a weird unearthly sort of way 
8088_284756_000107_000001	train-clean-100	As I had already noticed her eyes were of unusual size and I saw now that they were an intense shade of blue with a pupil of extraordinary proportion Her nose was well shaped but the nostrils were slightly flattened and the orifices were rather more elongated than I had ever seen before 
8088_284756_000107_000002	train-clean-100	The mouth was utterly fascinating and her teeth revealed by her engaging smile were as perfect as it would be possible to imagine 
8088_284756_000108_000000	train-clean-100	The great mane of hair which enveloped her was as I have said tawny in hue and almost translucent like the stems of some seaweeds I have seen 
none	none	And as she raised one slim white hand to brush back some wisps that floated by her face I saw distinctly the webs between her fingers 
8088_284756_000108_000002	train-clean-100	They were barely noticeable for they were as transparent as the fins of a fish but they were there extending nearly to the last joint of each finger 
8088_284756_000109_000000	train-clean-100	As her face came close to my own I became aware of the humming crooning sound I had heard before louder this time 
none	none	I could see from the movement of her throat that I had been correct in assuming that she was attempting to speak with me 
8088_284756_000126_000004	train-clean-100	I smiled back at her and shook my head 
8088_284756_000109_000002	train-clean-100	I smiled back at her and shook my head She seemed to understand for the sound ceased and she studied me with a little thoughtful frown as though trying to figure out some other method of communication 
8088_284756_000110_000000	train-clean-100	I pointed upward for I was feeling the need for fresh air again and slowly mounted the ladder 
8088_284756_000110_000001	train-clean-100	This time she did not grasp me but watched me intently as though understanding what I did and the reasons for it 
8088_284756_000111_000000	train-clean-100	 Bring one of your gadgets over here Mercer I called across the pool I think I m making progress 
none	none	Good boy he cried and came running with two of the antennae the long insulated cords trailing behind him 
8088_284756_000112_000001	train-clean-100	Through the water the girl watched him evident dislike in her eyes 
none	none	She glanced at me with sudden suspicion as Mercer handed me the two instruments but made no hostile move
8088_284756_000113_000000	train-clean-100	 You won t be able to stay in the water with her explained Mercer rapidly 
8088_284756_000113_000001	train-clean-100	 The salt water would short the antennae you see 
8088_284756_000113_000002	train-clean-100	Try to get her to wear one and then you get your head out of water and don yours And remember she won t be able to communicate with us by words we ll have to get her to convey her thoughts by means of mental pictures 
8088_284756_000113_000003	train-clean-100	I ll try to impress that on her 
none	none	Understand 
8088_284756_000114_000000	train-clean-100	I nodded and picked up one of the instruments 
8088_284756_000114_000001	train-clean-100	 Fire when ready Gridley I commented and sank again to the bottom of the pool 
none	none	I touched the girl s head with one finger and then pointed to my own head trying to convey to her that she could get her thoughts to me Then I held up the antennae and placed it on my own head to show that it could not harm her My next move was to offer her the instrument moving slowly and smiling reassuringly no mean feat under water She hesitated a moment and then her eyes fixed on mine she slowly fixed the instrument over her own head as she had seen me adjust it upon my own I smiled and nodded and pressed her shoulder in token of friendly greeting 
8088_284756_000118_000001	train-clean-100	Then gesturing toward my own head again and pointing upward I climbed the ladder 
none	none	All right Mercer I shouted Start at once before she grows restless I ve already started he called back and I hurriedly donned my own instrument Bearing in mind what Mercer had said I descended the ladder but a few rungs so that my head remained out of water and smiled down at the girl touching the instrument on my head and then pointing to hers 
8088_284756_000122_000000	train-clean-100	I could sense Mercer s thoughts now 
8088_284756_000122_000001	train-clean-100	He was picturing himself walking long the shore with the stormy ocean in the background 
none	none	Ahead of him I saw the white body lying face downward in the pool 
8088_284756_000122_000003	train-clean-100	I saw him run up to the pool and lift the slim pale figure in his arms 
none	none	Let me make it clear at this point that when I say that I saw these things I mean only that mental images of them penetrated my consciousness I visualized them just as I could close my eyes and visualize for example the fireplace in the living room of my own home 
8088_284756_000124_000000	train-clean-100	I looked down at the girl 
8088_284756_000124_000001	train-clean-100	She was frowning and her eyes were very wide 
none	none	Her head was a little on one side in the attitude of one who listens intently Slowly and carefully Mercer thought out the whole story of his experiences with the girl until she had plunged into the pool 
8088_284756_000125_000001	train-clean-100	Then I saw again the beach with the girl s figure in the pool 
8088_284756_000125_000002	train-clean-100	The picture grew hazy I realized Mercer was trying to picture the bottom of the sea 
8088_284756_000125_000003	train-clean-100	Then he pictured again the girl lying in the pool and once again the sea 
8088_284756_000125_000004	train-clean-100	I was aware of the soft little tick in the center of my brain that announced that the switch had been moved to another contact point 
8088_284756_000126_000000	train-clean-100	I glanced down at her 
8088_284756_000126_000001	train-clean-100	She was staring up at me with her great curious eyes and I sensed through the medium of the instrument I wore that she was thinking of me 
none	none	I saw my own features idealized glowing with a strange beauty that was certainly none of my own 
8088_284756_000126_000003	train-clean-100	I realized that I saw myself in short as she saw me 
none	none	I smiled back at her and shook my head 
8088_284756_000127_000000	train-clean-100	A strange dim whirl of pictures swept through my consciousness 
8088_284756_000127_000001	train-clean-100	I was on the bottom of the ocean 
none	none	Shadowy shapes swept by silently and from above a dim bluish light filtered down on a scene such as mortal eyes have never seen 
8088_284756_000128_000000	train-clean-100	All around were strange structures of jagged coral roughly circular as to base and rounded on top resembling very much the igloos of the Eskimos 
none	none	The structures varied greatly in size and seemed to be arranged in some sort of regular order like houses along a narrow street 
8088_284756_000128_000002	train-clean-100	Around many of them grew clusters of strange and colorful seaweeds that waved their banners gently as though some imperceptible current dallied with them in passing 
8088_284756_000129_000000	train-clean-100	Here and there figures moved slim white figures that strolled along the narrow street or at times shot overhead like veritable torpedoes 
none	none	There were both men and women moving there The men were broader of shoulder and their hair which they wore to their knees was somewhat darker in color than that of the women 
8088_284756_000130_000002	train-clean-100	Both sexes were slim and there was a remarkable uniformity of size and appearance 
none	none	None of the strange beings wore garments of any kind nor were they necessary The clinging tresses were cinctured at the waist with a sort of cord of twisted orange colored material and some of the younger women wore bands of the same material around their brows Nearest of all the figures was the girl who was visualizing all this for us 
8088_284756_000132_000001	train-clean-100	She was walking slowly away from the cluster of coral structures Once or twice she paused and seemed to hold conversation with others of the strange people but each time she moved on 
8088_284756_000133_000000	train-clean-100	The coral structures grew smaller and poorer 
none	none	Finally the girl trod alone on the floor of the ocean between great growths of kelp and seaweeds with dim looming masses of faintly tinted coral everywhere Once she passed close to a tilted ragged hulk of some ancient vessel its naked ribs packed with drifted sand 
8088_284756_000134_000000	train-clean-100	Sauntering dreamily she moved away from the ancient derelict 
8088_284756_000134_000001	train-clean-100	Suddenly a dim shadow swept across the sand at her feet and she arrowed from the spot like a white slim meteor 
8088_284756_000134_000002	train-clean-100	But behind her darted a black and swifter shadow a shark 
8088_284756_000135_000000	train-clean-100	Like a flash she turned and faced the monster 
8088_284756_000135_000001	train-clean-100	Something she had drawn from her girdle shone palely in her hand 
8088_284756_000135_000002	train-clean-100	It was a knife of whetted stone or bone 
8088_284756_000136_000000	train-clean-100	Darting swiftly downward her feet spurned the yellow sand and she shot at her enemy with amazing speed 
8088_284756_000136_000001	train-clean-100	The long blade swept in an arc ripped the pale belly of the monster just as he turned to dart away 
8088_284756_000137_000000	train-clean-100	A great cloud of blood dyed the water 
8088_284756_000137_000001	train-clean-100	The white figure of the girl shot onward through the scarlet flood 
8088_284756_000138_000000	train-clean-100	Blinded she did not see that the jutting ribs of the ancient ship were in her path 
8088_284756_000138_000001	train-clean-100	I seemed to see her crash head on into one of the massive timbers and I cried out involuntarily and glanced down at the girl in the water at my feet 
8088_284756_000139_000000	train-clean-100	Her eyes were glowing 
none	none	She knew that I had understood Hazily then I seemed to visualize her body floating limply in the water It was all very vague and indistinct and I understood that this was not what she had seen but what she thought had happened 
8088_284756_000140_000002	train-clean-100	The impressions grew wilder swirled grew gray and indistinct 
8088_284756_000140_000003	train-clean-100	Then I had a view of Mercer s face so terribly distorted it was barely recognizable Then a kaleidoscopic maze of inchoate scenes shot through with flashes of vivid agonizing colors 
8088_284756_000140_000004	train-clean-100	The girl was thinking of her suffering taken out of her native element 
8088_284756_000140_000005	train-clean-100	In trying to save her Mercer had almost killed her 
8088_284756_000140_000006	train-clean-100	That no doubt was why she hated him 
none	none	My own face appeared next almost godlike in its kindliness and its imagined beauty and I noticed now that she was thinking of me with my yellow hair grown long my nostrils elongated like her own adjusted to her own ideas of what a man should be I flung the instrument from my head and dropped to the bottom of the pool I gripped both her shoulders gently to express my thanks and friendship My heart was pounding There was a strange fascination about this girl from the depths of the sea a subtle appeal that was answered from some deep subterranean cavern of my being 
8088_284756_000143_000002	train-clean-100	I forgot for the moment who and what I was 
8088_284756_000143_000003	train-clean-100	I remembered only that a note had been sounded that awoke an echo of a long forgotten instinct 
8088_284756_000144_000000	train-clean-100	I think I kissed her 
none	none	I know her arms were about me and that I pressed her close so that our faces almost met 
8088_284756_000144_000002	train-clean-100	Her great weirdly blue eyes seemed to bore into my brain 
none	none	I could feel them throbbing there 
8088_284756_000145_000000	train-clean-100	I forgot time and space 
8088_284756_000145_000001	train-clean-100	I saw only that pale smiling face and those great dark eyes 
8088_284756_000145_000002	train-clean-100	Then strangling I tore myself from her embrace and shot to the surface 
none	none	Coughing I cleared my lungs of the water I had inhaled 
8088_284756_000146_000001	train-clean-100	I was weak and shaking when I finished but my head was clear 
none	none	The grip of the strange fantasy that had gripped me was shaken off 
8088_284756_000147_000000	train-clean-100	Mercer was bending over me speaking softly 
8088_284756_000148_000000	train-clean-100	 I was watching old man he said gently 
8088_284756_000148_000001	train-clean-100	 I can imagine what happened A momentary psychic fusing of an ancient long since broken link 
8088_284756_000148_000002	train-clean-100	You together with all mankind came up out of the sea 
8088_284756_000148_000003	train-clean-100	But there is no retracing the way 
8088_284756_000149_000000	train-clean-100	I nodded my head bowed on my streaming chest 
8088_284756_000150_000000	train-clean-100	 Sorry Mercer I muttered 
8088_284756_000150_000001	train-clean-100	 Something got into me 
none	none	Those big eyes of hers seemed to tug at threads of memory buried 
8088_284756_000150_000003	train-clean-100	I can t describe it 
none	none	He slapped me on my naked shoulder a blow that stung as he had intended it to 
8088_284756_000151_000001	train-clean-100	It helped jerk me back to the normal 
8088_284756_000152_000000	train-clean-100	 You ve got your feet on the ground again Taylor he commented soothingly 
none	none	I think there s no danger of you losing your grip on terra firma again 
8088_284756_000152_000002	train-clean-100	Shall we carry on 
8088_284756_000153_000000	train-clean-100	 There s more you d like to learn 
8088_284756_000153_000001	train-clean-100	That you think she can give us I asked hesitantly 
8088_284756_000154_000000	train-clean-100	 I believe replied Mercer that she can give us the history of her people if we can only make her understand what we wish 
none	none	God 
8088_284756_000154_000002	train-clean-100	If we only could 
none	none	The name of the Deity was a prayer as Mercer uttered it
8088_284756_000155_000000	train-clean-100	 We can try old timer I said a bit shakenly 
8088_284756_000156_000000	train-clean-100	Mercer hurried back to the other side of the pool and I adjusted my head set again smiling down at the girl 
none	none	If only Mercer could make her understand and if only she knew what we wanted to learn 
8088_284756_000157_000000	train-clean-100	I was conscious of the little click that told me the switch had been moved 
8088_284756_000157_000001	train-clean-100	Mercer was ready to get his message to her 
8088_284756_000158_000000	train-clean-100	Fixing my eyes on the girl pleadingly I settled myself by the edge of the pool to await the second and more momentous part of our experiment 
8088_284756_000159_000000	train-clean-100	The vision was vague for Mercer was picturing his thoughts with difficulty 
8088_284756_000159_000001	train-clean-100	But I seemed to see again the floor of the ocean with the vague light filtering down from above and soft monstrous growths waving their branches lazily in the flood 
8088_284756_000160_000000	train-clean-100	From the left came a band of men and women looking around as though in search of some particular spot 
none	none	They stopped and one of the older men pointed the others gathering around him as though in council 
8088_284756_000161_000000	train-clean-100	Then the band set to work 
8088_284756_000161_000001	train-clean-100	Coral growth were dragged to the spot 
8088_284756_000161_000002	train-clean-100	The foundation for one of the semi circular houses was laid 
8088_284756_000161_000003	train-clean-100	The scene swirled and cleared again 
8088_284756_000161_000004	train-clean-100	The house was completed 
none	none	Several other houses were in process of building Slowly and deliberately the scene moved 
8088_284756_000162_000001	train-clean-100	The houses were left behind Before my consciousness now was only a vague and shadowy expanse of ocean floor and in the sand dim imprints that marked where the strange people had trod the vague footprints disappearing in the gloom in the direction from which the little weary band had come 
8088_284756_000162_000002	train-clean-100	To me at least it was quite clear that Mercer was asking whence they came 
8088_284756_000162_000003	train-clean-100	Would it be as clear to the girl 
none	none	The switch clicked and for a moment I was sure Mercer had not been able to make his question clear to her The scene was the interior of one of the coral houses 
8088_284756_000163_000001	train-clean-100	There were persons there seated on stone or coral chairs padded with marine growths 
8088_284756_000163_000002	train-clean-100	One of the occupants of the room was a very old man his face was wrinkled and his hair was silvery 
8088_284756_000163_000003	train-clean-100	With him were a man and a woman and a little girl 
8088_284756_000163_000004	train-clean-100	Somehow I seemed to recognize the child as the girl in the pool 
none	none	The three of them were watching the old man While his lips did not move I could see his throat muscles twitching as the girl s had done when she made the murmuring sound I had guessed was her form of speech 
8088_284756_000165_000000	train-clean-100	The scene faded 
none	none	For perhaps thirty seconds I was aware of nothing more than a dim gray mist that seemed to swirl in stately circles 
8088_284756_000165_000002	train-clean-100	Then gradually it cleared somewhat 
8088_284756_000165_000003	train-clean-100	I sensed the fact that what I saw now was what the old man was telling and that the majestic swirling mist was the turning back of time 
8088_284756_000166_000000	train-clean-100	Here was no ocean bottom but land rich tropical jungle 
8088_284756_000166_000001	train-clean-100	Strange exotic trees and dense growths of rank undergrowth choked the earth 
8088_284756_000166_000002	train-clean-100	The trees were oddly like undersea growths which puzzled me for an instant 
none	none	Then I recalled that the girl could interpret the old man s words only in terms of that which she had seen and understood This was the way she visualized the scene 
8088_284756_000167_000000	train-clean-100	There was a gray haze of mist everywhere 
8088_284756_000167_000001	train-clean-100	The leaves were glistening with condensed moisture swift drops fell incessantly to the soaking ground below 
8088_284756_000168_000000	train-clean-100	Into the scene roamed a pitiful band of people 
none	none	Men with massive frames sunken in with starvation women tottering with weakness The men carried great clubs some tipped with rudely shaped stone heads and both men and women clothed only in short kittles of skin 
8088_284756_000169_000000	train-clean-100	They searched ceaselessly for something and I guessed that something was food 
none	none	Now and then one or the other of the little band tore up a root and bit at it and those that did so soon doubled into a twitching knot of suffering and dropped behind 
8088_284756_000170_000000	train-clean-100	At last they came to the edge of the sea 
none	none	A few yards away the water was lost in the dense steaming miasma that hemmed them in on all sides With glad expressions on their faces the party ran down to the edge of the water and gathered up great masses of clams and crabs 
8088_284756_000170_000002	train-clean-100	At first they ate the food raw tearing the flesh from the shells 
8088_284756_000170_000003	train-clean-100	Then they made what I understood was a fire although the girl was able to visualize it only as a bright red spot that flickered 
none	none	The scene faded and there was only the slowly swirling mist that I understood indicated the passing of centuries 
8088_284756_000171_000001	train-clean-100	Then the scene cleared again 
8088_284756_000172_000000	train-clean-100	I saw that same shore line but the people had vanished 
none	none	There was only the thick steamy mist the tropic jungle crowding down to the shore and the waves rolling in monotonously from the waste of gray ocean beyond the curtain of fog Suddenly from out of the sea appeared a series of human heads and then a band of men and women that waded ashore and seated themselves upon the beach gazing restlessly out across the sea 
8088_284756_000174_000000	train-clean-100	This was not the same band I had seen at first 
8088_284756_000174_000001	train-clean-100	These were a slimmer race and whereas the first band had been exceedingly swarthy these were very fair 
none	none	They did not stay long on shore for they were restless and ill at ease It seemed to me they came there only from force of habit as though they obeyed some inner urge they did not understand 
8088_284756_000175_000001	train-clean-100	In a few seconds they rose and ran into the water plunged into it as though they welcomed its embrace and disappeared 
8088_284756_000175_000002	train-clean-100	Then again the vision was swallowed up by the swirling mists of time 
8088_284756_000176_000000	train-clean-100	When the scene cleared again it showed the bottom of the sea 
none	none	A group of perhaps a hundred pale creatures moved along the dim floor of the ocean Ahead I could see the dim outlines of one of their strange cities 
8088_284756_000176_000003	train-clean-100	The band approached seemed to talk with those there and moved on 
8088_284756_000177_000000	train-clean-100	I saw them capture and kill fish for food saw them carve the thick spongy hearts from certain giant growths and eat them 
none	none	I saw a pair of killer sharks swoop down on the band and the quick deadly accuracy with which both men and woman met the attack One man older than the rest was injured before the sharks were vanquished and when their efforts to staunch his wounds proved unavailing they left him there and moved on And as they left I saw a dim crawling shape move closer throw out a long whiplike tentacle and wrap the body in a hungry embrace They came to and passed other communities of beings like themselves and a city of their own in much the way that Mercer had visualized it Fading the scene changed to the interior of the coral house again The old man finished his story and moved off into a cubicle in the rear of the place 
8088_284756_000179_000002	train-clean-100	Dimly I could see there a low couch piled high with soft marine growths 
none	none	Then the scene shifted once more A man and a woman hurried up and down the narrow streets of the strange city the girl had pictured when she showed us how she had met with the shark and struck her head so that for a long period she lost consciousness and was washed ashore 
8088_284756_000181_000000	train-clean-100	Others after a time joined them in their search which spread out to the floor of the ocean away from the dwellings 
8088_284756_000181_000001	train-clean-100	One party came to the gaunt skeleton of the ancient wreck and found the scattered fresh picked bones of the shark the girl had killed 
8088_284756_000181_000002	train-clean-100	The man and the woman came up and I looked closely into their faces 
8088_284756_000181_000003	train-clean-100	The woman s features were torn with grief the man s lips were set tight with suffering 
none	none	Here it was easy to guess were the mother and the father of the girl 
8088_284756_000182_000000	train-clean-100	A milling mass of white forms shot through the water in every direction searching 
8088_284756_000182_000001	train-clean-100	It seemed that they were about to give up the search when suddenly from out of the watery gloom there shot a slim white figure the girl 
8088_284756_000183_000000	train-clean-100	Straight to the mother and father she came gripping the shoulder of each with frantic joy 
8088_284756_000183_000001	train-clean-100	They returned the caress the crowd gathered around them listening to her story as they moved slowly happily towards the distant city 
8088_284756_000184_000000	train-clean-100	Instead of a picture I was conscious then of a sound like a single pleading word repeated softly as though someone said Please 
8088_284756_000184_000001	train-clean-100	Please Please over and over again 
8088_284756_000184_000002	train-clean-100	The sound was not at all like the English word 
8088_284756_000184_000003	train-clean-100	It was a soft musical beat like the distant stroke of a mellow gong but it had all the pleading quality of the word it seemed to bring to mind 
8088_284756_000185_000000	train-clean-100	I looked down into the pool 
none	none	The girl had mounted the ladder until her face was just below the surface of the water 
8088_284756_000185_000002	train-clean-100	Her eyes met mine and I knew that I had not misunderstood 
8088_284756_000186_000000	train-clean-100	I threw off the instrument on my head and dropped down beside her 
8088_284756_000186_000001	train-clean-100	With both hands I grasped her shoulders and smiling I nodded my head vigorously 
8088_284756_000187_000000	train-clean-100	She understood I know she did 
8088_284756_000187_000001	train-clean-100	I read it in her face 
8088_284756_000187_000002	train-clean-100	When I climbed the ladder again she looked after me smiling confidently 
8088_284756_000188_000000	train-clean-100	Although I had not spoken to her she had read and accepted the promise 
8088_284756_000189_000000	train-clean-100	Mercer stared at me silently grimly as I told him what I wished Whatever eloquence I may have I used on him and I saw his cold scientific mind waver before the warmth of my appeal 
8088_284756_000190_000000	train-clean-100	 We have no right to keep her from her people I concluded 
8088_284756_000190_000001	train-clean-100	 You saw her mother and father saw their suffering and the joy her return would bring 
8088_284756_000190_000002	train-clean-100	You will Mercer you will return her to the sea 
none	none	For a long time Mercer did not reply 
8088_284756_000191_000001	train-clean-100	Then he lifted his dark eyes to mine and smiled rather wearily 
8088_284756_000192_000000	train-clean-100	 It is the only thing we can do Taylor he said quietly 
none	none	She is not a scientific specimen she is in her way as human as you or I She would probably die away from her own kind living under conditions foreign to her 
8088_284756_000192_000002	train-clean-100	And you promised her Taylor whether you spoke your promise or not His smile deepened a bit 
none	none	We cannot let her receive too bad an opinion of her cousins who live above the surface of the sea 
8088_284756_000193_000000	train-clean-100	And so just as the dawn was breaking we took her to the shore 
8088_284756_000193_000001	train-clean-100	I carried her unresisting trustful in my arms while Mercer bore a huge basin of water in which her head was submerged so that she might not suffer 
8088_284756_000194_000000	train-clean-100	Still in our bathing suits we waded out into the ocean until the waves splashed against our faces 
8088_284756_000194_000001	train-clean-100	Then I lowered her into the sea 
8088_284756_000194_000002	train-clean-100	Crouching there so that the water was just above the tawny glory of her hair she gazed up at us 
8088_284756_000194_000003	train-clean-100	Two slim white hands reached towards us and with one accord Mercer and I bent towards her 
8088_284756_000194_000004	train-clean-100	She gripped both our shoulders with a gentle pressure smiling at us 
none	none	Then she did a strange thing She pointed under the water out towards the depths and with a broad sweeping motion of her arm indicated the shore as though to say that she intended to return 
8088_284756_000195_000002	train-clean-100	With a last swift smiling glance up into my face she turned 
none	none	There was a flash of white through the water 
8088_284756_000195_000004	train-clean-100	She was gone 
none	none	Silently through the silence and beauty of the dawn we made our way back to the house As we passed through the laboratory Mercer glanced out at the empty pool
8088_284756_000198_000000	train-clean-100	 Man came up from the sea he said slowly and some men went back to it 
8088_284756_000198_000001	train-clean-100	They were forced back to the teeming source from whence they came for lack of food 
8088_284756_000198_000002	train-clean-100	You saw that Taylor saw her forebears become amphibians like the now extinct Dipneusta and Ganoideii or the still existing Neoceratodus Polypterus and Amia 
8088_284756_000198_000003	train-clean-100	Then their lungs became in effect gills and they lost their power of breathing atmospheric air and could use only air dissolved in water 
8088_284756_000199_000000	train-clean-100	 A whole people there beneath the waves that land man never dreamed of except perhaps the sailors of olden days with their tales of mermaids which we are accustomed to laugh at in our wisdom 
none	none	But why were no bodies ever washed ashore I asked
8088_284756_000200_000001	train-clean-100	 I would think 
8088_284756_000201_000000	train-clean-100	 You saw why interrupted Mercer grimly 
none	none	The ocean teems with hungry life 
8088_284756_000201_000002	train-clean-100	Death is the signal for a feast 
none	none	It was little more than a miracle that her body came ashore a miracle due perhaps to the storm which sent the hungry monsters to the greater depths And even had a body come ashore it would have been buried as that of some unknown unfortunate human 
8088_284756_000201_000005	train-clean-100	The differences between these people and ourselves would not be noticeable to a casual observer 
8088_284756_000202_000000	train-clean-100	 No Taylor we have been party to what was close to a miracle 
none	none	And we are the only witnesses to it you and Carson and myself And he sighed deeply it is over 
8088_284756_000203_000000	train-clean-100	I did not reply 
none	none	I was thinking of the girl s odd gesture at parting and I wondered if it were indeed a finished chapter Vandals of the Stars By A T Locke A livid flame flares across Space and over Manhattan hovers Teuxical vassal of Malfero Lord of the Universe who comes with ten thousand warriors to ravage and subjugate one more planet for his master Illustration Many planes and Zeppelins were circling around the mysterious visitant It came suddenly without warning and it brought consternation to the people of the world A filament of flame darted down the dark skies one moonless night and those who saw it believed at first that it was a meteor Instead of streaking away into oblivion however it became larger and larger until it seemed as though some vagrant blazing star was about to plunge into the earth and annihilate the planet and every vestige of life upon it But then it drew slowly to a stop high up in the atmosphere where it remained motionless glowing white and incandescent against the Stygian background of the overcast skies In shape it resembled a Zeppelin but its dimensions very apparently exceeded by far those of any flying craft that ever had been fabricated by the hand of man As it hung poised high up in the air it gradually lost its dazzling glow and became scarlet instead of white Then as it continued to cool the color swiftly drained from it and in a few minutes it shone only with the dull and ugly crimson of an expiring ember In a half hour after it first had appeared its effulgence had vanished completely and it was barely visible to the millions who were staring up toward it from the earth It seemed to be suspended directly above Manhattan and the inhabitants of New York were thrown into a feverish excitement by the strange and unprecedented phenomenon For it scarcely had come to a stop and certainly it had not been poised aloft for more than a few minutes when most of those who had not actually witnessed its sensational appearance were apprised of the inexplicable occurrence by the radiovision which were scattered throughout the vast metropolis In theaters and restaurants and other gathering places as well as in millions of homes a voice from the Worldwide Broadcasting Tower announced the weird visitant And its image as it glowed in the night was everywhere transmitted to the public Only a short time after it first had been observed people were thronging roof tops terraces and streets and gazing with awe and wonder at the great luminous object that was floating high above them There were those who thought that the world was coming to an end and they either were dumb with fright or strident with hysteria People with more judgment and a smattering of scientific knowledge dismissed the thing as some harmless meteorological manifestation that while interesting was not necessarily dangerous And there were many inclined to incredulity and skepticism who believed that they were witnessing a hoax or an advertising scheme of some new sort But as the moments went by the world commenced to become stirred and alarmed by the reports which came over the radiovisors For powerful planes and metal shelled Zeppelins had climbed swiftly aloft to investigate the incomprehensible Thing that was poised high above Manhattan and almost unbelievable reports were being sent earthward Dirk Vanderpool had been sitting alone on the broad terrace of his apartment that occupied the upper stories of the great Gotham Gardens Building when he saw that streak of fire slip down against the darkness of the night For a moment he too had believed that he was watching a meteor but when he saw it come to a slow stop and hang stationary in the heavens he rose to his feet with an exclamation of surprise For a while he gazed upward with an expression of astonishment on his face and then he turned as he heard someone walking softly in his direction It was Barstowe his valet and the eyes of the man were alive with fear What is that thing mister Vanderpool he asked in a voice that trembled with alarm Barstowe was a man of middle age diminutive in size and he had the appearance of being nearly petrified with terror They are saying over the televisor that What are they saying about it asked Dirk somewhat impatiently That no one can explain what it is continued Barstowe It must be something terrible mister Vanderpool Wheel out the luciscope ordered Dirk Barstowe disappeared into the apartment and returned with a cabinet that was mounted on small rubber tired wheels The top of it was formed of a metallic frame in which a heavy circular concave glass was fitted The frame was hinged in front so that it could be raised from the rear and adjusted to any angle necessary to catch the light rays from any distant object Within the cabinet the rays passed through an electrical device that amplified them millions of times thus giving a clear telescopic vision of the object on which the luciscope was focused This instrument years before had supplanted entirely the old fashioned telescopes which not only had been immense and unwieldly but which also had a very limited range of vision Dirk adjusted the light converger so that it caught the rays that were being emanated by the weird and shimmering mass that was suspended almost directly above the lofty terrace on which he was standing Then he switched on the current and glanced into the eye piece of the apparatus For several moments he remained silent studying the image that was etched so vividly on the ground glass within the luciscope It is a queer thing there is no doubt about that he confessed when finally he raised his head It resembles a gigantic Zeppelin in shape but it does not seem to have any undercarriage or as far as I can see any indication of propellers or portholes I would say though Barstowe that it might be a ship from some other planet if it wasn t for the fact that it seems to be in an almost molten state Dirk again looked into the luciscope and then he made a few adjustments with a thumb screw that projected from the side of the apparatus It is up about forty thousand feet he told Barstowe and it must be more than a half mile in length Probably he added it is a planetary fragment of some odd composition that is less responsive to gravitation than the materials with which we are familiar You will find Barstowe that there is nothing about it that science will not be able to explain That will be all now he concluded Barstowe walked over the terrace and disappeared into the apartment Dirk left alone wheeled the luciscope over by the chair in which he had been sitting and near which a radiovisor was standing He switched on the latter and listened to the low but very distinct voice of the news dispatcher and planes and Zeppelins now are starting up to investigate the strange phenomenon Again Dirk placed an eye to the lens of the luciscope and once more the Thing leaped into his vision The powerful machine brought it so close to him that he could see the heat waves quiver up from it The light that it radiated illuminated the night for thousands of feet and Dirk could see by means of that crimson glare that many planes and Zeppelins were circling around the mysterious visitant None of them however approached the alien freak the heat apparently being too intense to permit close inspection Dirk himself was tempted for a moment to jump into a plane and go up and take a look at the fiery mass But after a moment s consideration he decided that it would be far more interesting and comfortable to remain right where he was and listen to the reports which were being sent down from above thus far there seems to be no cause for alarm and people are advised to remain calm careful observations of the luminous monster are being made and further reports concerning it will be broadcast Dirk Vanderpool rose to his feet walked to the coping of the terrace and peered into the magnascope that was set into the wall He saw that the street far below him was jammed with struggling people and the device through which he was looking brought their faces before him in strong relief Dirk was deeply interested and at the same time gravely concerned as he studied the upturned countenances in the mob Fear despair reckless abandon mirth doubt religious ecstasy and all the other nuances in the gamut of human emotions and passions were reflected in those distorted visages which were gazing skyward The silvery humming of a bell diverted his attention from the scene of congestion below him and turning away he walked across the terrace and into the great living room of his luxurious abode Stepping to the televisor he turned a tiny switch and the face of a girl appeared in the glass panel that was framed above the sound box He smiled as he lifted the receiver and placed it to his ear What is the matter Inga he asked You look as if you were expecting well almost anything disastrous Oh Dirk what is that thing the girl asked I really am frightened He could see by the expression in her blue eyes that she too was becoming a victim of the hysteria that was taking possession of many people I wouldn t be alarmed Inga he replied reassuringly I don t know what it is and no one else seems to be able to explain it But it is frightful and uncanny Dirk the girl insisted and I am sure that something terrible is going to happen I wish she pleaded that you would come over and stay with me for a little while I am all alone and All right Inga he told her I will be with you in a few minutes He hung up the receiver of the televisor and clicked off the switch The image of the golden haired girl to whom he had been speaking slowly faded from the glass Attiring himself for a short sixty mile hop down Long Island Dirk passed out to the landing stage and stepping into the cabin of his plane he threw in the helicopter lever The machine rose straight into the air for a couple of hundred feet and then Dirk headed it westward to where the nearest ascension beam sent its red light towering toward the stars It marked a vertical air lane that led upward to the horizontal lanes of flight Northbound ships flew between two and four thousand feet southbound planes between five and seven thousand feet those eastbound confined themselves to the level between nine and eleven thousand feet while the westbound flyers monopolized the air between twelve and fourteen thousand feet All planes flying parallel to the earth were careful to avoid those red beacons which marked ascension routes and the shafts of green light down which descending planes dropped to the earth or into lower levels of travel When Dirk s altimeter indicated seventy five hundred feet he turned the nose of his ship eastward and adjusted his rheostat until his motors fed by wireless current were revolving at top speed The great canyons of Manhattan linked by arches and highways which joined and passed through various levels of the stupendous structures of steelite and quartzite passed swiftly beneath him and after passing for a few minutes over the deserted surface of Long Island he completed his sixty mile flight and brought his ship to a rest on a landing stage that was far up on the side of a vast pile that rose up close to the shore of the Sound As soon as he stepped from the door of the cabin he was joined by a girl who apparently had been lingering there awaiting his arrival She was perhaps twenty years old and she had the golden hair the light complexion and the blue eyes which still were characteristic of the women of northern Europe The slender lines of her exquisite figure and the supple grace which she displayed when she moved toward Dirk were evidence however of the Latin blood which was in her veins For Inga Fragoni the daughter and heiress of Orlando Fragoni seemed to be a culmination of all of the desirable qualities of the women of the south and those of the north The terrace on which Dirk had landed was illuminated by lights which simulated sunshine and their soft bright glow revealed the violet hue of her eyes and the shimmering gloss of her silken hair She wore a sleeveless light blue tunic which was gathered around her waist with a bejeweled girdle On her tiny feet she wore sandals which were spun of webby filaments of gold and platinum Dirk I am so glad that you are here she exclaimed I felt so much alone when I called you up Dad is locked in the observatory with Professor Nachbaren and three or four other men and the servants well they all are so terrified that it simply alarms me to have them around But that is Stanton s plane there isn t it asked Dirk indicating a powerful looking machine that stood on the terrace Yes Dirk the girl replied He arrived here three or four minutes before you did I thought at first that it was you coming And Dirk she continued with a note of excitement in her voice he flew up to look at that thing and I know that he is as frightened about it as I am Dirk grunted but he gave no expression of the dislike and distrust that Stanton aroused in him The latter he knew was very much inclined to look with favor on Inga and his presumption annoyed Dirk because while he and the girl had not declared their intention of living together they were very much in love with each other You will want to hear him tell about it I know Dirk the girl said I left Stanton up on the garden terrace when I saw you coming down Come we will go and join him Dirk and Inga strolled slowly along paths which were lined with exotic shrubbery and plants Here and there a fountain tossed its glittering spray high into the air while birds invisible in the feathery foliage warbled and thrilled entrancingly Soft music transmitted from the auditoriums below blended so harmoniously with the atmosphere of the terraces that it seemed to mingle with and be a part of the drifting subtle scents of the abundant flowers which bloomed on every side For these upper terraces of Fragoni s palace were enclosed during inclement weather with great glass plates which at the touch of a button automatically appeared or disappeared Winding their way easily upward Dirk and Inga came finally to a secluded terrace which overlooked the Sound Here they saw Stanton who was unaware of their approach looking skyward at the dim and sinister shape which was outlined against the sky Stanton s brow was contracted and his expression was filled with apprehension He started suddenly when he became conscious of the presence of Dirk and the lovely daughter of Fragoni He rose to his feet a short man in his forties stocky in build and somewhat swarthy in complexion He contrasted very unfavorably with Dirk who was tall and well built and who had abundant blond hair and steady steel blue eyes What do you make of that thing Vanderpool he asked almost ignoring the presence of Inga I don t know enough about it yet to be able to express an opinion Dirk replied We will find out about it soon enough he added so why worry about it in the meantime It is well enough to affect such an attitude said Stanton with a touch of sarcasm in his voice but let me tell you Vanderpool that there is good reason to worry about it Dirk frowned at the statement as he saw a shadow pass over the fair face of Inga That thing up there continued Stanton with conviction in his voice is not a natural phenomenon I flew fairly close to it in my plane and I know what I am speaking about That thing is some sort of a monster Vanderpool that is made of metal or of some composition that is an unearthly equivalent of metal It is a diabolical creation of some sort that has come from out of the fathomless depths of the universe He shuddered at the fantasy that his feverish imagination was creating It is metal I tell you he continued but it is metal that is endowed with some sort of intelligence I was up there he breathed swiftly and I saw it hanging there in the sky quivering with heat and life You are nervous Stanton said Vanderpool coolly Get a grip on yourself man and look at the thing reasonably If that thing has intelligence he added we will find some way to slay it Slay it exclaimed Stanton How can you expect to slay a mad creation that can leap through space from world to world like a wasp goes darting from flower to flower How can you kill a thing which not only defies absolute zero but also the immeasurable heat which its friction with the atmosphere generated when it plunged toward the earth How can you kill a thing that seems to have brains and nerves and bones and flesh of some strange substance that is harder and tougher than any earthly compound we have discovered He stopped speaking for a moment They listened to the voice that was broadcasting from the Worldwide Tower our planes have approached to within a few thousand feet of it and are playing their searchlights over the surface of the leviathan It is not a meteorite of any kind that scientists have heretofore examined its surface is smooth and unpitted and shows no apparent effect of the tremendous heat to which it was subjected during its drop through the atmosphere It seems to be immune to gravity its weight must be tremendous and it is fully three quarters of a mile long and between seven and eight hundred feet in diameter at its widest part but it lies motionless motionless at about forty thousand feet It doesn t appear now as if it would prove very dangerous remarked Dirk and people are warned again to maintain their composure and to go to their homes and remain there for their own protection and the protection of others Riots and serious disturbances are reported from cities in all parts of the world mobs are swarming the streets of Manhattan and the other boroughs of New York and the police are finding it difficult to restrain the frenzied populations in other centers There was a pause then of some moments and then the voice of the broadcaster vibrant with excitement was heard again a plane has made a landing on the surface of the monstrosity which it seems has not only lost its heat but is becoming decidedly cold A servant appeared from among the shrubbery and paused before Dirk There is a call for you mister Vanderpool he said respectfully Dirk excused himself and entering the sumptuous apartment that opened from the terrace went to the televisor He saw the face of Sears the chief secretary of Fragoni in the glass panel There will be a meeting of the council at nine o clock in the morning mister Vanderpool came the voice over the wire Thank you Sears replied Dirk It happens that Stanton is here at the present time Shall I notify him of the conclave If you will please Sears responded By the way mister Vanderpool is there anything wrong at your apartment I tried to call you there before I located you here and I failed to get any response I guess that all of my servants have run out from under cover because of their fear of that thing in the sky Dirk responded Do you know anything about it Sears he asked It will be discussed at the meeting to morrow morning replied Sears shortly Good night mister Vanderpool Dirk upon returning to the terrace saw that both Stanton and Inga were silently and fearfully looking up into the night A meeting of the council at nine o clock in the morning Stanton Dirk said abruptly I told Sears I would notify you I thought that we would be called together very soon said Stanton It s concerning that damn thing up there Perhaps agreed Dirk carelessly Well he added I believe that I will hop home and get some sleep Sleep exclaimed Stanton Sleep On a night like this Oh Dirk pleaded Inga stay here with me won t you I am not going to bed because I just know that I wouldn t be able to close my eyes Let him go Inga if he wants to sleep urged Stanton I will stay here and keep watch with you and if order is not restored in the streets of Manhattan within the course of a short time the authorities will resort to morphite gas to quell the turbulence and rioting The streets must be frightfully congested said Inga It is the first occasion in a long time that the police have had to threaten the use of morphite we do not want to alarm people unnecessarily but we have to report came the hurried voice of the broadcaster that the monstrous mass that has been hanging above the city just made a sudden drop of five thousand feet and again came to a stop It is now a little more than six miles over Manhattan and again it has dropped This time it fell like a plummet for twelve thousand feet It is now about twenty thousand feet some four miles above Manhattan and A cry of alarm came from the lips of Inga as she gazed upward and saw that gigantic ominous appearing object loom dim and vast in the darkness above them She went to Dirk and threw her arms around him as if she were clinging to him for protection Don t leave me Dirk she whispered I can just feel that something terrible is going to happen and I want you with me I ll stay with you of course whispered Dirk Something of that feeling of dread and apprehension which so fully possessed his two companions entered into his mind Don t tremble so Inga he pleaded It is a strange thing but we will know more about it in the morning Be calm until then my dear if you can He looked over the shoulder of the girl whose face was buried against his breast and he saw a hundred great red and green shafts of light shooting up into the air Fleeting shadows seemed to pass swiftly up and down them and he knew that thousands of planes were abroad some of them seeking the heights and others dropping down The great towers of Long Island were all aglow and it was apparent that few people were sleeping that night The scarlet sky over Manhattan indicated that the center of the metropolis too was alive to the menace of the weird visitant that now was so plainly visible All night long they remained on the terrace Dirk and Inga seated close together and Stanton at a distance brooding alone over the disaster which he felt was impending The illuminated dial of the great clock that was a part of the beacon tower on the Metropole Landing Field told of the slow passing of the hours All night long they listened to the reports that came through the radiovisor and watched that immobile threatening monster of metal But it remained static during the rest of the night And with the coming of a gray and sunless dawn it still hung there motionless silent and sinister The next morning the President of the United States of the World from the capitol at The Hague issued a proclamation of martial law to become effective at once in all parts of the world The edict forbade people to leave their homes and it was vigorously executed wherever the police themselves were not in a state of demoralization At about the same time a special meeting of the Supreme Congress was called the body to remain in session until some solution of the mystery had been arrived at At the same time that martial law was declared however and the special assemblage of lawmakers convened a statement was issued in which an attempt was made to eliminate from the minds of the people the idea that the undefinable object above the metropolis was at all dangerous It was indeed suggested that it very probably was some sort of new device which had been constructed on the earth and which was being introduced to the people of the world in a somewhat sensational manner by the person or persons who were responsible for it The fears of the populace were to some extent allayed by this means and some degree of order restored At nine o clock Dirk Vanderpool was shown into the council chamber in the palace of Orlando Fragoni and he was closely followed by Stanton Fragoni was already there and he greeted the two men with a countenance that was serene but that nevertheless revealed indications of concern He was a man past middle age tall and strikingly handsome in appearance His eyes were dark and penetrating and his forehead high and wide was crowned by an abundance of snow white hair His voice while pleasing to the ear was vibrant with life and energy and he spoke with the incisive directness of one accustomed to command For Orlando Fragoni as nearly as any one man might be was the ruler of the world It was in the early part of the twentieth century that wealth had commenced to concentrate into a relatively few hands This was followed by a period in which vast mergers and consolidations had been effected as a result of the financial power and genius for organization which a few men possessed A confederation of the countries of the world was brought about by industrial kings who had learned in one devastating war that militarism while it might bring riches to a few was in the final analysis destructive and wasteful Mankind the world over relieved of the menace of war made more progress in a decade than they had made in any previous century but all the time the invisible concentration of power and money continued And in nineteen seventy five the affairs of the world were controlled by five men of whom Orlando Fragoni was the most powerful and most important His grandfather had been a small banker and out of his obscure transactions the great House of Fragoni had arisen The money power of the world was now controlled by Orlando Fragoni Dirk Vanderpool partly as a result of a vast inheritance and partly through his own ability and untiring industry dominated the transportation facilities of the world Planes and Zeppelins railroad equipment and ships were built in his plants and operated by the many organizations which he controlled Stanton had inherited the agricultural activities of the world and in addition to this he was the sovereign of distribution He owned immense acreages in all of the continents he not only cultivated every known variety of produce but also handled the sale of his products through his own great chains of stores His father had been one of the great geniuses of the preceding generation but Stanton while inheriting the commercial empire which he had ruled had not inherited much of the ability which had gone into the establishment of it There were two other members of that invisible council of Five the very existence of which was not even suspected by the general populace of the world Sigmund Lazarre was the world s mightiest builder and millions of great structures which were built of material from his own mines were under his control It was Lazarre too who owned the theaters and other amusement centers in which millions upon millions of people sought relaxation every day The creation and application of electrical power made up the domain of Wilhelm Steinholt who also owned the factories that made the machinery of the world Absolute control of all of the necessities and luxuries of life in fact were in the hands of the five men who used their vast power wisely and beneficently Ostensibly the peoples of the world ruled themselves by means of a democratic form of government In reality their lives were directed by a few men whose power and wealth were entirely unsuspected by any but those who were close to them The council room in which Fragoni had received Dirk and Stanton was lofty and sumptuously appointed The rugs which covered the floor were soft to the tread and the walls and ceiling were adorned with a series of murals which represented the various heavenly constellations At the far end of the chamber there was a staircase and Dirk was among those who knew that it led up to the great observatory in which Fragoni and certain of his scientific associates spent so much of their time at night For men had commenced to talk about the conquest of the stars and it was generally believed that it would not be many years more before a way would be found to traverse the interplanetary spaces We are rather fortunate my friends Fragoni said to his two associates to have been the witnesses of the event that transpired last night Fortunate exclaimed Stanton Then you know that the thing is harmless A little smile lit the benign and scholarly countenance of Fragoni as he calmly regarded Stanton We know very little about it he replied after a brief pause and if our surmises are correct it may be very far from harmless It is intensely interesting nevertheless he continued because that thing as you term it unquestionably is directed by intelligence Without the slightest doubt the people of the earth are about to behold a form of life from some far away planet What that form will be he added with an almost imperceptible shrug of his shoulders it is impossible to forecast But it was so hot commenced Stanton that True agreed Fragoni but it also is large and it may be that only the outer shell of it was affected by friction with the atmosphere that surrounds the earth Nachbaren he continued is certain that there is intelligent life within it and Nachbaren he added dryly is usually right While Fragoni had been speaking two more men had quietly joined them Good morning Lazarre Fragoni said addressing a short swarthy man who very apparently was of Jewish extraction Good morning the other replied in a soft and mellifluous voice It seems he continued with a twinkle in his eyes as if some of my pretty buildings may be toppled over soon Maybe agreed Fragoni And maybe he added more seriously much more than your buildings will be toppled over Lazarre That thing then is questioned the heavy set slow speaking blue eyed Teuton who had come into the room with Lazarre We do not know Steinholt admitted Fragoni but our knowledge undoubtedly will be increased considerably within the next few hours And now he said we will consider the problem at hand the object which has created such unrest is slowly rising It is now some twenty five thousand feet above Manhattan It is The voice from the radiovisor attracted the attention of the five men and with one accord they rushed to the terrace and looked toward Manhattan They saw the great leviathan high in the air for a moment and then suddenly it seemed to vanish from sight It s gone exclaimed Stanton with a sigh of relief It must have been some odd atmospheric freak that s all They searched the skies through the luciscope that was on the terrace but failed to detect any trace of the monster That seems to simplify matters remarked Fragoni as they again walked back into the great conference room But here once more they heard the voice from the Worldwide Tower we are advised by Chicago that the thing dull red with heat is hovering only a couple of thousand feet over the city Thousands in the streets are being killed by the heat it is radiating panic reigns despite a rigorous enforcement of martial law The strange object just rose suddenly to a high altitude and disappeared It s another one of those damned things asserted Stanton That couldn t go a thousand miles a minute It can go faster than that if I am not mistaken said Fragoni And it presently appeared that he was right for in a couple of minutes the radiovisor transmitted the news that it was over San Francisco where it remained for only a few seconds It was not more than a minute later that word came from Shanghai that it had passed slowly over that city Then again it was poised high over Manhattan crimson with heat Is there any possible defense against it Steinholt Fragoni asked The Teuton shook his head with an air of finality None he said as far as I can determine now We can create and direct artificial lightning that would reduce this building to a mass of powdered stone and fused metal in a fraction of a second But I am certain that it wouldn t leave as much as a scratch on that monster up there We might try the Z Rays on it but an intelligence that could devise such a craft would undoubtedly have the wisdom to protect it against such an elementary menace as rays Even the mightiest explosives that we have wouldn t send a tremor through that mighty mass Why not await developments asked Dirk We do not even know the nature of the thing we are trying to combat It s solid metal insisted Stanton tenaciously It s a metal body with a metal brain Don t be ridiculous said Steinholt It seems quite apparent that the craft has come from another planet and if I am not greatly mistaken there are intelligent creatures inside it In any event said Dirk it seems impractical to make any plans until we know more about it I suggest that we empower Fragoni to act for the rest of us in this matter That is very agreeable to me said Steinholt A crisis very possibly may arise in which the quick judgment of one man may be necessary to avert the danger that always is inherent in delay You hold my proxy Lazarre said to Fragoni and I assume that Stanton is agreeable to this procedure the thing is moving very slowly eastward in the direction of Long Island Sound It is at the same time losing altitude Its movements are being carefully watched As yet we see no cause for immediate alarm people are advised to remain calm Yes I am agreeable said Stanton nervously and hastily If there are things in it with which we can compromise I would suggest that we do not offend them I am then empowered to act for all of you said Fragoni ignoring the suggestion of Stanton He rose from his chair and walked out on the terrace The others followed after him Looking westward they saw the mammoth craft descending slowly in their direction Its vast dimensions became more and more apparent as spellbound they watched it approach closer and closer to them The thing in the sky was now not more than three thousand feet above them and only a few miles to the westward The observers on the terrace regarded it for a moment in silence as it drifted forward and downward It s colossal Steinholt then exclaimed lost in scientific admiration of the mammoth craft Magnificent Superb But it s coming right toward us cried Stanton What makes it move I wonder asked Dirk And how in the world is it controlled It surely is not of this world said Fragoni quietly That gigantic thing has come to us from somewhere out of the infinite and terrible depths of space Another minute elapsed while they watched it speechless with wonder Do you know Lazarre then said calmly I believe that it is going to land in the waters of the Sound It appears so to me anyway It was nearly opposite them by this time and not more than a thousand feet above the water A few planes which very apparently were being flown by intrepid and fearless flyers were hovering close around it Then finally it came to rest as Lazarre had predicted in the water some two miles off shore and it was obscured by a great cloud of vapor for several minutes Steam asserted Steinholt That trip around the world which it made in a few minutes generated considerable frictional heat in the shell Come said Fragoni we ll fly out and look the thing over Around the corner of the building on the level of the terrace there was a landing stage which was occupied by a number of planes of various sizes Dirk entered the door of a small twenty passenger speedster and the others filed in after him Ready he asked after he had seated himself at the controls Ready replied Fragoni The plane rose straight up into the air and then darted gracefully out over the Sound Dirk swooped straight down at the leviathan which lay so quietly on the surface of the Sound and then slowly circled around it No sign of an aperture of any sort could be seen in the craft Then he dropped the plane lightly on the water close to the metallic monster which towered fully four hundred feet above them despite the fact that more than half of it was submerged It must be hollow remarked Steinholt or it wouldn t be so far out of the water In fact it most certainly would sink if it was solid At the touch of a lever which lay under one of Dirk s hands the plane rose straight out of the water and he maneuvered it directly over the top of the strange enigma Then he touched a button and the pontoons were drawn up into the undercarriage of the craft Shall I make a landing on it he asked turning his head and addressing Fragoni The latter nodded his head and Dirk dropped the ship gently onto the smooth surface of the monster the pneumatic gearing completely absorbing the shock of the landing Dirk relinquished the controls and opening the door of the cabin he stepped out onto the rough and pitted substance of which the leviathan was compounded He stood there while the others came out after him A large area on the top of the monster was perfectly flat and within a very few moments Dirk discovered that it was decidedly warm He had brought the plane down close to the middle of the length of the strange craft in the belief that there if anywhere some indication of an entrance might be found The voice of Steinholt tense with suppressed excitement appraised him that his surmise had been correct There is a manhole of some sort the electrical wizard exclaimed And look it is turning They saw not far ahead of them a circular twelve foot section of the deck slowly revolving and even as they watched it commenced to rise slowly upward as the threads with which it was provided turned gradually around Almost involuntarily they retreated a few feet and stood there spellbound as they stared at the massive revolving section of the deck It continued to turn until fully ten feet of the mobile cylinder had been exposed Then the bottom of it appeared Even then it continued to revolve and rise on a comparatively small shaft which supported it and at the same time thrust it upward Dirk and his companions kept their eyes on the rim of the well which had been exposed and awaited the appearance of something they knew not what When the top of the great cylinder was fully twelve feet above the deck of the craft it slowly ceased to revolve Moment succeeded moment as the members of the little group rigidly and almost breathlessly awaited developments Then Dirk with an impatient ejaculation stepped forward toward the yawning hole and cautiously peered over the edge of it He stood there for a moment as if transfixed and then with an exclamation of horror retreated swiftly to where his friends were standing What is it gasped Steinholt What did you see when But the words died on his lips for swarming swiftly over every side of the well there poured an array of erect piercing eyed beings who had all the characteristics of humans They were clad in tight fitting attire of thin and pliant metal which with the exception of their faces shielded them from head to foot On their heads they wore close fitting helmets apparently equipped with visors which could be drawn down to cover their unprepossessing features Each one of them carried a tube which bore a striking resemblance to a portable electric flashlight Swiftly they advanced in ranks of eight toward Dirk and his companions who gripped with amazement held their positions The first line came to a halt not more than four feet from the little group on the deck The other lines halted too and formed a great platoon Then a shrill whistle sounded and the formation parted in the middle leaving an open path that led backward to the entrance to the well A moment later the watchers saw the regal figure of a man emerge from the orifice and after a moment s pause advance slowly in their direction with a stately stride He was tall and muscular and blond and his attire golden in texture glittered with sparkling gems As he approached them he raised his right hand and inasmuch as his countenance was calm and benign his gesture appeared to be one of peace and good will Following close behind him there was a younger man who very apparently was of the same lineage His expression however was petulant and haughty and it contained more than a suggestion of rapacity and evil Behind him there were others of the same fair type all of them sumptuously and ornately attired Fragoni stepped forward himself a dignified and striking figure as the leader of the strange adventurers came forth from the lane that had been formed by his immobile guard of warriors The two men confronted each other one whose power and wealth gave him a dominate position on earth and the other a personage from some domain that was remote in the abyss of space Fragoni bowed and spoke a few friendly words of welcome and the stranger to the utter amazement of the banker and his associates responded in an English that was rather peculiar in accent but that they could understand without any difficulty From what part of the world do you come asked the astounded Fragoni that you speak our language We come from no part of this world replied the stranger The empire of my ruler is infinitely far away But language my friend is not a thing of accident Life grows out of the substance of the universe and language comes out of life The speech of mankind in your state of development varies but little throughout all space and I have heard your English as you call it spoken among those who dwell in many many worlds And your world asked Steinholt with avid curiosity Tell us of the planet from which you come But Fragoni smiling at the eagerness of Steinholt interposed with a kindly but arresting gesture My name is Fragoni he said to the stranger and I would have you partake of my hospitality and refresh yourself after your long journey These he added are my friends Steinholt Vanderpool and Lazarre I am Teuxical vassal of his Supreme Highness Malfero of Lodore the other replied This is my son Zitlan he continued indicating the young man behind him and the others are my high captains Anteucan Orzitza and Huazibar More of my officers are below together with ten thousand armed and armored men such as you see before you If the last part of the statement was intended as a threat or a warning the expression on Fragoni s face gave no indication that he was aware of it You carry a large crew sir Fragoni replied but we gladly will make provisions for all of your men As for yourself your son and your captains if you will come with me He nodded in the direction of the plane which rested on the great interplanetary vessel and started to walk slowly in the direction of it The leader of the skymen walked by his side and the other men from Lodore followed close after them Dirk Steinholt and Lazarre brought up the rear while the soldiers remained motionless in their serried array Innumerable planes were circling overhead and hundreds of them had landed on the water in the vicinity Dirk saw that the wanderers from the stars regarded them curiously as if they never before had seen aircraft of that particular type When the cabin door of the plane was thrown open Teuxical turned to one of his captains Remain here Anteucan with the soldiers he commanded and await our return Teuxical then entered the plane with his men and Fragoni Steinholt and Lazarre followed after them Then Dirk took his seat at the controls These are strange craft you use he heard Teuxical say I have seen them in only one of the multitude of other worlds on which I have set my feet worlds which all pay tribute to Malfero of Lodore It is safer and swifter to ride the magnetic currents than it is to ride the unstable currents of the air Dirk caught the significance of the reference to tribute and he admired the clever diplomacy of Teuxical while at the same time he wondered if the earth and all of those who dwelt upon it were doomed to fall under the sway of some remote and unseen despot He also realized that the Lodorians had in some way devised a craft that rode the great magnetic streams which flowed through the universe in much the same way that men in ships navigated the streams of the earth He threw on the helicopter switch and the plane rose swiftly into the air the myriad other flying craft which were circling nearby keeping at a safe distance from it Land on the grand terrace Fragoni directed The flight was short and rapid and it was only a matter of seconds before Dirk brought the plane down on the landing stage which they had left only a scant half hour before He opened the cabin door and stepped out of the plane and the others filed out after him Fragoni led the way along the stage walking and chatting with Teuxical and Dirk following after the others was the last to turn a corner that brought him a sweeping view of the magnificent terrace that fronted the private apartments of the banker and his daughter And when he did he saw that Inga was standing there superbly beautiful with Stanton a few paces behind her Her lovely eyes were alive with awe and wonder and her slender white hands were crossed over her heart And Dirk saw too that Zitlan son of Teuxical had paused and was standing quite still with his unwavering and insolent eyes fixed on the girl Resentment and a touch of apprehension agitated Dirk when he saw the expression on the face of the young Lodorian There was admiration in that disagreeable countenance but it was blended with arrogance haughtiness and ill concealed desire Dirk went quickly to Inga standing between the girl and the one from Lodore who was staring at her so brazenly What does it all mean Dirk she asked in a low voice Those strange people where are they from Stanton had come quickly forward and had joined Inga and Dirk They are from some far off world Inga he explained that we know nothing about as yet But what do they want she persisted What do they intend to do I saw those horrible creatures through the magnascope when they came swarming out of the inside of that thing on the water and I thought at first that they were going to kill you all No they seem to come in peace Dirk replied Teuxical their leader seems to be gracious and kindly We are all doomed asserted Stanton unless something happens They can crumble our cities with heat and bury us under the ruins of them Keep your silence breathed Dirk quietly but tensely We will find a way to destroy those creatures if it becomes necessary That man who keeps staring at me who is he asked Inga in a voice that betrayed her nervousness Dirk turned and saw that Zitlan was still standing where he had paused and that he still was looking with searching eyes in the direction of the girl He returned the insolent gaze of the young Lodorian with an impatient and threatening stare and the countenance of Zitlan at once became stern and menacing He came striding in the direction of Inga Dirk and Stanton and paused within a few feet of them his rapacious eyes still fixed on the girl My lady he said your beauty pleases me I have walked on many worlds but never before have I seen one as lovely as yourself Of the spoils of this world all that I crave possession of is you When we return to Lodore he added with an air of finality I will take you with me and place you with my other women in the Seraglio of the Stars Dirk swiftly stepped close to Zitlan and the latter quickly clasped a tube that hung at his side a tube of the sort that the soldiers had carried Your words and your manner are insolent asserted Dirk angrily and I warn you now to cease making yourself offensive Dog exclaimed Zitlan fiercely leveling the metal tube I ll But the left fist of Dirk cut short his threat as it made a sudden impact with his chin and the Lodorian went crashing backward into some exotic shrubbery with a look of surprise on his countenance Then Dirk heard an odd hissing and crackling sound and he felt himself becoming dizzy and weak Darkness seemed to sweep in upon him he felt that he was dropping swiftly through space and then he lost consciousness A vague and shadowy figure was standing close by his side and peering down into his face After a while he realized that it was Steinholt Steinholt he gasped Why why am I here in Fragoni s I must have had a dream and yet He furrowed his brow in thought and gradually he commenced to remember what had happened It was no dream said the scientist softly Do you remember the trouble that you had with Zitlan Yes replied Dirk I remember that he was insolent to Inga and that I lost my temper and struck him But what happened to me I don t recall that anybody hit me I did hear sort of a peculiar sound just before I started to pass out but Teuxical took a shot at you said Steinholt and you have been unconscious for over thirty six hours Took a shot at me exclaimed Dirk What did he shoot me with That is what we all would like to know said Steinholt He leveled one of those damn tubes at you and pressed a button on it There was a hissing sound a flash of light and you got groggy and went out He potted Zitlan too continued Steinholt and he apologized for the trouble that his son was responsible for Do you know he added I sort of like the old man Lazarre with a sympathetic smile on his face entered the room at that moment and overheard the conversation Old man is right he remarked with a little note of awe in his voice Teuxical admits that he is three thousand years old and that he has at least two thousand more ahead of him That Lodore must be a queer world he commented shaking his grizzly head It is not so queer when you take everything into consideration said Steinholt It seems quite natural when Teuxical explains it Lodore it seems is something like a hundred thousand times as big as this miniature world we live on It took Lodore infinitely longer to solidify from a gaseous state than it took this world and its entire evolution has been relatively slower than ours Therefore according to Teuxical the people up there live longer and incidentally know infinitely more than we do What time is it now asked Dirk after a moment of thought It is just about twelve o clock at night Steinholt informed him Have these Lodorians made any demands yet Dirk asked Does anybody know what they are going to do or what they want They are liable to do almost anything said Lazarre and it looks as though they will be able to get anything that they want Teuxical as I understand it just gave you a slight shock with his death ray device If he had pulled the trigger all the way you would have become just a little pile of dust that the first breeze would have blown away Our own death rays are somewhat similar said Steinholt but they are not a hundredth as powerful And they won t work on the Lodorians either he added because those metal sheaths that they wear make them immune to all kinds of destructive rays It appears remarked Lazarre morosely as if this little world of ours is going to be taken for a ride And it s too bad considering that it s the only world we ve got There has been no formal presentation of demands yet but it seems to be sort of understood that the earth is going to become a tributary of Lodore It is a good thing he added that Teuxical and not Zitlan is the boss of that outfit I don t like the looks of that young fellow He s only twelve hundred years old and he is sort of hot blooded I guess I was talking with Anteucan said Steinholt and he told me that the Lodorians usually make heavy levies on worlds which they discover and dominate As soon as Teuxical returns to Lodore and announces a new discovery a fleet of those damned monsters is sent out to mop up the new planet That Malfero who is the emperor of Lodore is considerable of a monarch and it seems that he has a passion for piling up wealth Gold and platinum are as precious on Lodore as they are here and he also likes pretty stones And what is worse added Steinholt is his practice of enslaving entire populations and making toilers or warriors out of them Those soldiers on the ship are not Lodorians Millions of them were seized on some planet and converted into troops It was a strange conversion too said Steinholt with a shudder Their brains were operated on and most of their faculties removed They have no sense of fear no consciences no power of reasoning They respond only to certain signals on a whistle and their only definite and active impulse is that of murder and destruction There is nothing to do said Dirk positively but to kill all of these interlopers if we hope to save our world from being desolated The three men looked at each other in silence for a moment and then Dirk somewhat weakly rose into a sitting position in the bed which he had been occupying But how asked Steinholt can we kill them We might of course get rid of a few of them but that simply would lead to our destruction by those who were left There must be some way asserted Dirk and it is up to us to think of it without delay If we let those Lodorians get a foothold on the world all will be lost The old man seems to be reasonable enough said Lazarre He doesn t seem inclined to be destructive We must not trust him or any of the others said Dirk imperatively We must rid the earth of every one of them And the sooner we strike the better It had best be soon if it is to be at all said Steinholt Fragoni has arranged to have Teuxical appear before the Congress and the meeting has been called for to night when I imagine certain specific demands will be made upon us We all will go to The Hague together on the ship of the Lodorians And we leave questioned Dirk The meeting is set for ten P M New York time said Lazarre We will start east at about four o clock in the morning I guess because it will only take a minute or so to arrive at our destination Is Fragoni going asked Dirk Naturally replied Lazarre And Inga I believe so Lazarre told him Fragoni was both afraid to take her and to leave her behind but finally he decided that he wanted her with him in case of trouble And are they the Lodorians still here queried Dirk Yes responded Lazarre Teuxical returned to his ship last night with Zitlan and his other followers but they came back late this afternoon and they are still here Zitlan seemed to be all right this afternoon too They must have used some means of bringing him out of the daze that he was in We did everything we could to revive you but none of our measures were effective I m all right now asserted Dirk as he finished attiring himself I want to see Fragoni at once We ll go out on the terrace then said Steinholt They are all out there Dirk with his two companions strolled out through the maze of rooms and corridors that led to the garden which hung so high above the city and the Sound below it The first thing that Dirk saw when he passed out onto the terrace was the white tunic of Inga who was leaning against a coping and talking with Zitlan The latter was pointing skyward and very apparently he was telling her of worlds which circled high among the stars As if she were suddenly aware of his presence Inga turned and saw Dirk and he realized by the expression on her face that she was distraught and nervous She came toward him quickly after a few words to Zitlan and the face of the latter darkened There was hatred in his expression as he stared malevolently at Dirk Steinholt and Lazarre passed along and joined Fragoni and Teuxical who were the center of a group that had formed in another part of the terrace Oh Dirk said Inga I am so afraid of that frightful Zitlan He has been telling me again that he is going to take me back to his own world with him and it makes me shudder to think of it He is so strange and queer and his eyes are so terrible He can t be as young as he looks because he speaks of years like we speak of minutes I will die if I ever find myself in that monster s power He has been telling me of all the creatures he has slain on the worlds on which he has landed and I tell you Dirk that he is cruel and ruthless and horrible He will never have you swore Dirk And if I hear of any more of his insolence I will throw him headlong from this terrace Please Dirk she begged don t do anything not yet He is utterly unscrupulous Dirk He told me that even now he is plotting against some Malfero who rules Lodore like a god and that he is planning to seize the throne of the planet He wants to make me the queen of that fearful world when he becomes king He boasted that if I were on the throne millions of people from other worlds would be sacrificed in my honor in the temples of Lodore Her voice trembled and her eyes were terror stricken as she continued They tear out the hearts of living victims she whispered and burn them on their high and mammoth pyramids Rage took possession of Dirk and casting a glance at Zitlan he saw that the Lodorian was smiling insolently at him I ll kill that beast if it s the last thing that I do he exclaimed to Inga Dirk Dirk she implored don t even look at him He is proud and impetuous and he will kill you in defiance of his own father We will find some way to rid the world of the scourge that has descended upon it asserted Dirk confidently and he will die with the rest of that monstrous crew I am going in Dirk Inga said Please she begged don t do anything rash If something should happen to you I would lose all the hope that I have and I would I think kill myself Don t lose hope my dear said Dirk reassuringly I believe that I know of a way to destroy the plague that menaces us He pressed her hand and after she left him he walked over and joined the other men on the terrace Zitlan coming from the terrace wall stretched out in a chair not far from Dirk Teuxical regarded the latter with a countenance that was calm and amicable I am sorry my young friend he apologized that I had to intervene between you and my son He paused a moment and sat in silence a thoughtful expression on his face Ah he then said what disasters have arisen out of the desire of men for women In my wanderings over the starlit worlds I have seen He ceased speaking brooded for a moment and then shook his head slowly But you cannot say that I was not just he continued addressing Dirk I punished Zitlan for his presumption Fragoni tells me that the woman has pledged herself to you Let her pledge be kept he exclaimed sternly looking straight at Zitlan We are the conquerors asserted the latter boldly and to us should belong the spoils of our daring Silence thundered Teuxical My own son above all others shall be obedient to my commands Or like others have done he shall die because of insubordination Zitlan a defiant expression on his face ceased to speak but Dirk could see that he was livid with suppressed rage As I was saying Teuxical remarked turning to Fragoni I am getting old and long have I been weary of conquest I have seen your world and it pleases me It is a tiny and peaceful place far removed from the strife and turbulence of the restless centers of the universe So it is my will to leave you unscathed and return to Lodore for a brief time to ask of the mighty Malfero the grant of this little provincial land And then with his permission I will return here and rule it with wisdom and benevolence I will bring to you much knowledge and peace will be to the people of this earth and peace will be to me It is well replied Fragoni No world I am certain could hope for a wiser and more just ruler than yourself and our Congress surely will receive you with acclaim Teuxical bowed in recognition of the compliment and his countenance indicated that he was gratified We will go now back to our vessel he said addressing the other Lodorians We will return for you at the appointed hour and conduct you to our ship he added speaking to Fragoni We will be ready Fragoni replied Zitlan had arisen with the rest of them and Dirk with a look of contempt and amusement in his eyes regarded him casually May I have the honor of conducting our guests back to their ship in a plane Stanton requested of Fragoni The latter nodded and Stanton walked across the terrace in the direction of the landing stage Zitlan as he followed after the others passed close to Dirk and pausing for a moment fixed his hateful eyes on him You dog he whispered malignantly remember what I tell you The time will come when I will cast you to the carnaphlocti in the dark and icy caverns of sunless Tiganda You will die he swore the death of a million agonies For a moment Dirk felt an almost irresistible impulse to hurl himself on the Lodorian and slay him He managed to maintain his control however and only regarded Zitlan with disdain as the latter turned and went on his way In another moment the plane containing Stanton and the Lodorians was high up in the darkness Dirk glanced at the great clock that gleamed atop of the beacon tower on the Metropole Landing Field The hour was close to twelve thirty A M A moment of silence on the terrace followed the departure of the plane that bore the Lodorians back to their craft For an hour the clouds had been gathering in the sky and now a fine cold rain commenced to fall A peal of thunder echoed above them after a sharp flash of lightning had streaked across the black night above them A servant appeared from the entrance to the apartment and pressed a button close to the door Protective plates of glass noiselessly enveloped the terrace sheltering those upon it from the inclement weather It is well remarked Fragoni breaking the silence that we were found by a leader like Teuxical Our tribute will not be unbearable and he will bestow many benefits upon us But surely protested Dirk you do not intend to surrender without a struggle Nothing but disaster he asserted earnestly will come upon the earth if you do Teuxical may be honest and just but after all he neither is immortal nor all powerful and something may happen to him at any moment And there are those like Zitlan who would turn the world over to ravage and rape and then convert it into a blazing pyre if they had their way These vandals he insisted must be slain one and all or mark my words our world will be laid waste Dirk spoke with such a sense of conviction that his words held his listeners spellbound Who is Teuxical he asked but the vassal of a monarch whose corsairs very apparently are carrying on a war of conquest in the universe It will be disastrous I say to place any dependence in the good will of this one Lodorian If he or any of his men return to that far off planet where they dwell word will be carried there of the existence of our world But who can say that Teuxical ever will return here again It may be the whim of his ruler to refuse his request or any one of a thousand other events might arise to thwart his desire to live among us No concluded Dirk passionately it never will do to let that great engine of destruction rise into the skies again He is right asserted Steinholt positively It will be far better to annihilate these raiders if such a thing can be accomplished Lazarre was rather inclined to take sides with Fragoni But how he demanded can such destruction be brought about We know nothing of the capabilities of that monster that is lying down there in the Sound It is undoubtedly equipped with the deadliest of devices and they all will be turned upon us if we fail in an effort to destroy the thing and those who have come from space upon it If there was a way to smite them suddenly to bring death to the Lodorians and to those swarming mindless murderous minions who act in obedience to them I would favor doing it But as it is he concluded it seems like inviting disaster even to think of such an attempt much less to try it It can be done though asserted Dirk or there is at least a fighting chance of accomplishing it The electrosceotan He paused and looked questioningly at Steinholt The top of that monster is open and The Teuton furrowed his brow and considered the proposition for a moment Yes he said nodding his head it might be done Again he silently gave the subject his thought It is well worth trying he asserted with an air of decision But we will have to make haste he warned if the thing is to be done before the flight to The Hague So be it said Fragoni We will apply ourselves to the task at hand I too he confessed had rather see these vandals destroyed like so much vermin rather than have them carry the news of the existence of this earth back into those strange worlds in the depth of space I will only regret the passing of Teuxical who could have taught us much wisdom And now he continued briskly I will place myself under your orders Dirk You are the one who suggested this plan and upon you will fall the responsibility of executing it And if it succeeds he added the glory will be yours I care little for the glory replied Dirk but I gladly accept the duties and the responsibilities These he said to Fragoni are my instructions to you Inasmuch as Teuxical and his captains will return here at about four o clock in the morning to convey us back to their craft it will be necessary to have this building emptied of its inhabitants by that time Let all of those who dwell here depart from it a few at a time so as not to excite suspicion Inga above all others must leave and retreat to a place of safety Then as the hour approaches for the arrival of the Lodorians we will escape by plane from one of the rear terraces They will land in search of us and well then they will feel the force of our power I will follow your orders explicitly promised Fragoni I wonder he added where Stanton is He should be advised of what we are going to attempt He will return in due time replied Dirk And if not it will be the worse for him Lazarre will remain here with you he then told Fragoni and Steinholt and I will now go about our part of the task at hand Dirk followed by Steinholt hurried across the terrace and leaving the shelter of its quartzite plates sought the landing stage The rain still was falling and the heavens were congested with dark and heavy clouds Dirk selecting one of the smaller planes entered the cabin and Steinholt following after him closed the door and threw on the lights Swiftly they shot straight up into the air Dirk ignoring all of the rules of flight in his haste to be under way Once in the westbound lane he headed his plane toward Manhattan and threw his rheostat wide open In a few minutes they were skimming over the great city and past the three thousand foot steel tower of the Worldwide Broadcasting Station For fifteen minutes more he kept the plane on a straight course and then bringing it to a quick stop he let it drop like a plummet toward the earth It landed among many other planes on the transparent quartzite roof of a vast building and looking down into the interior they could see several rows of great dynamos Some of them were turning and the humming that they made could be heard plainly Dirk and Steinholt ran rapidly across the roof until they came to a superstructure which they entered There was a shaft inside Dirk pressed a button and an elevator shot up and stopped at the door which automatically flashed open He closed it after he and his companion had entered the cage and dropping rapidly downward they came to a stop in a lighted chamber that was far below the surface of the ground A stoop shouldered old man greeted them an expression of surprise on his face Gentlemen he exclaimed What is Power Gaeble commanded Steinholt tensely Power Let every dynamo run its swiftest To night we have to use for the electrosceotan But I thought it was peace that those from the stars desired said the old electrician Through my radiovisor I heard That was sent out explained Steinholt to relieve the fears of the people and to keep them in order Swiftly the distorted figure of the old man sped to a great switchboard where he pressed button after button The very ground commenced to vibrate around them and the massive structure seemed to be alive with straining power Then Steinholt going to a corner of the intricate board adjusted a few levers while his gnomelike companion watched him carefully And now Gaeble the scientist said impressively these are your orders At precisely the hour of four o clock in the morning make one connection with this switch He indicated with a stubby finger the lever to be operated Keep the circuit closed for just four seconds he added slowly and then break it Do you understand Gaeble he demanded I do replied the old man Then continued Steinholt after you break that connection you quickly will close this next circuit Keep it closed for four seconds and then after opening it for one second close it again for four seconds Repeat the procedure twice more Gaeble after that and then await my further instructions Is everything clear he asked It is sir the old man replied I will follow your orders implicitly There is one thing more Steinholt said Get the Worldwide Tower on the televisor and warn them of what is to happen I will do that immediately Gaeble replied Dirk and Steinholt shot up to the roof again and the building over which they walked seemed to be quivering with life They could see that all of the mammoth dynamos beneath them were revolving and the humming which they had heard before had changed into an ugly vibrant roar Again they took flight and reaching Manhattan they continued north and east to the shore of Long Island Sound Long before the old East River had been filled in and the space which it had occupied reclaimed for building purposes All indications of its former bed had been obliterated by mammoth terraced structures When they reached their destination on the shore of the Sound a small submarine which Dirk had ordered by radio was awaiting them Submerge and proceed up the Sound Dirk ordered the officer and take us directly under the craft of the Lodorians In a few minutes they were skimming over the surface of the water and when a sufficient depth had been gained the tiny boat disappeared beneath the rain rippled sea Dirk sat at a port and watched the aquatic life as it was illuminated by the powerful aquamarine searchlights Progress under the water was comparatively slow as mankind had made but little progress in underwater navigation Air liners long before had almost superseded travel by land and sea and the abolition of warfare had swept all of the old navies from the ocean It was more than an hour before the officer in charge of the boat announced that the mammoth hull of the monster that was lying on the Sound was visible directly above them Both Dirk and Steinholt donned diving apparatus and the former carefully adjusted the mechanism that was contained in a metallic box about two feet square Then they stepped up into a chamber in the conning tower of the boat and after a door slipped shut beneath them water slowly commenced to pour into the compartment When it was full a sliding door that was in front of them slowly opened and they passed out onto the deck of the underwater craft Steinholt had been provided with some welding apparatus and in a few minutes the box which Dirk had carried was attached securely to the bottom of the craft of the Lodorians They then reentered the submarine by reversing the process which had attended their exit Very soon they were in the cabin of the boat again If everything goes well said Dirk those damned Lodorians will never know what struck them I only hope said Steinholt that we don t destroy that leviathan altogether We might solve the secret of it and then we too could ride out into the heart of the universe It is impossible to imagine what will happen Dirk replied until after we launch our attack Both of the men were silent during the return trip of the small undersea craft which emerged at its dock a little before three thirty in the morning We ll have to hurry urged Dirk nervously because we will need a little time to make preparations after we get back to Fragoni s They entered their plane and Dirk shot it swiftly up into the night following the red shaft of light that rose almost directly from the point at which they had made their landing Then having reached the eastbound level he headed straight in the direction of the palace of Fragoni Dirk cast a glance at the great city that lay far beneath him High up into the heavens it tossed the fulgurant fires that betokened its wealth and power And down among those myriad lights millions and millions of people were restless under the danger that menaced them It was only a matter of moments now before their fate and the fate of their great metropolis would be decided By dawn they would be free forever from the threat of subjugation and slavery or else they and all that they had toiled and striven for would be the veriest dust of dying embers And whatever befell them likewise would befall the rest of the world and every living thing that moved upon it Dirk was high above Fragoni s when he stopped the forward flight of the plane and dropping it rapidly through the misty night brought up easily on the landing stage The other planes which had been there when he and Steinholt had taken their departure were gone and Dirk felt a sense of relief when he observed this Inga then must have departed with the other occupants of the colossal structure Things were going according to the plan that he had conceived He stepped out of the cabin followed by Steinholt and proceeded hastily along the terrace and turned the corner into the garden Then he came to an abrupt halt because there before him was Zitlan with one of the deadly ray tubes of the Lodorians in his hand Dirk knew immediately that something unexpected had happened and that he was in the power of one who not only hated him but who had an unholy desire for Inga He realized too that any show of resistance would be nothing short of suicide for he was well aware of the deadliness of the strange weapon with which he and Steinholt were being menaced by the gloating Lodorian One false move and you die warned Zitlan Come forward now and join those two others over whom Anteucan and Huazibar are watching Dirk and Steinholt promptly obeyed the command of Zitlan and walked over to where Fragoni and Lazarre were being guarded by two of the conquerors The rain had ceased to fall but the skies were dark and overcast with heavy clouds There was an occasional flash of lightning and thunder rolled and echoed through the night The terrace however was brightly illuminated and every detail of the scene around him was visible to Dirk He saw Stanton on another part of the terrace standing among some Lodorians he had not seen before Stanton apparently was not being treated as a prisoner and Dirk wondered rather vaguely why this was What happened Dirk asked Fragoni quietly According to what I have heard the latter replied Zitlan murdered his father in a fit of rage and has taken over the command of the ship Many of the Lodorians are his adherents and even those who do not favor him are so terrified that they will be obedient to his wishes And Inga questioned Dirk She is inside the apartment said Fragoni a note of desperation in his voice Zitlan surprised us completely and he and his men had us covered before we realized that Teuxical was not among them Zitlan in the meantime had entered the suite of Fragoni and he now came out Inga walking before him She was silent and proudly erect but there was a pallor in her face that indicated her realization of the danger that she was threatened with When Dirk saw her she gave him a brave smile which he answered with a glance of reassurance He could see the great clock in the Metropole Tower and he noticed with a feeling of grave apprehension that it was twenty minutes to four o clock There were only a few minutes more in which to make a desperate and apparently a hopeless effort to save Inga his friends and himself from a catastrophe which he had been instrumental in contriving Then Zitlan stood before him haughty and arrogant his lowering countenance ugly with hatred So dog he said you who dared to defy Zitlan now stand before him a captive Neither Dirk nor any one of the three others who were guarded with him replied to the utterance You and that woman of yours continued the Lodorian insolently both are my prisoners to do with as I please Your fate he continued I already have planned for you and I assure you that it will not be as pleasurable as the one to which she is destined You will find that Tigana on which you and those with you will be cast is a world of terror such as you never could dream of Even the monsters which crawl through the deliriums of the mind are not as horrible as those which infest the mad and haunted world of which I speak He paused a moment a cruel smile on his face as if he wished the full import of his words to sear themselves into the minds of the doomed men But the woman he added will return to Lodore with me and be the queen of all women And soon he said savagely she may be queen of all Lodore of the worlds which pay tribute to Lodore and of other worlds which I will conquer and ravage My father stood in my way and he died at my own hands So will others perish who thwart my ambition and I will become supreme in the universe A feeling of reckless fury possessed Dirk as he listened to the words of Zitlan and he felt an almost irresistible desire to drive a fist square between the mad glittering eyes of the Lodorian He glanced at the great clock however and he saw that the time to act had not yet come At the last moment he would make one desperate attempt to frustrate the evil designs of Zitlan If it failed well all would be lost But it was a far better thing to die resisting the despicable Zitlan and his minions than it would be to live and to know that without a struggle he had abandoned to degradation the girl he loved This world of yours will be my world he heard Zitlan boast and the spoils from it will add to my riches This one here he continued indicating Stanton has offered to show me where all of the treasures of the earth may be found And as a reward he will return to Lodore with me and there be elevated to a high position That then was why Stanton was not under guard like the rest of them Our good friend Stanton said Lazarre seems to have become something of a Judas And let his name be forever cursed like the name of Judas said Dirk Silence thundered the Lodorian I Zitlan am speaking He paused a moment When I garner up the treasures of this world in the way of precious stones and metals I also shall gather more priceless loot in the way of women And then having taken all that I desire I will lay waste to this earth so that those who survive will fear the name of Zitlan and will grovel before him like a god when once again he appears to them While Zitlan had been speaking Dirk had been studying the opponents with whom he soon had to clash The two Lodorians who were standing guard over himself and his companions were close to his left side Zitlan was directly in front of him and there were seven of his minions clustered behind him Again Dirk glanced at the great dial of the clock and he saw that it was seven minutes of four The moment had come to act if action was to prove of any avail I will But the words of Zitlan were interrupted by Dirk who suddenly made a mighty sweep with his left arm and knocked the deadly tubes from the hands of Anteucan and Huazibar Startled by the assault they went reeling backward At almost the same instant Dirk leaped forward and seizing Zitlan hurled him among those Lodorians who had been massed behind him Then he threw himself violently into the tangled mass his fists driving in and out with deadly strength Out of the corner of one eye he saw Inga pass the melee and dart swiftly to the corner of the terrace Instead of passing around to the landing stage however she lingered there and watched the combat Dirk as he fought became conscious that Steinholt and Fragoni were at his side battling with him against his enemies He saw too that Stanton had retired to the far end of the terrace and that he was watching the struggle with frightened eyes We must reach the plane and get away gasped Dirk In another three minutes He felled a Lodorian who having lost his tube was about to grapple with him He saw Steinholt send another one of their opponents reeling backward Fragoni he exclaimed The plane Get in with Inga We will come Even as he spoke his fists were flailing back and forth between each one of his staccato commands He saw beneath him a hand reaching toward a tube and he kicked the instrument of death It hurtled over in the direction of Stanton and landed close to his feet Stanton might have picked it up and been in possession of the means of aiding his old friends or his new allies But he shrunk away panic stricken from the thing that lay so close to his reach A Lodorian leaped upon Dirk s back in an effort to bring him to the ground but he stooped swiftly forward and his assailant was catapulted over his head into those who were in front of him He caught a flash of the contorted face of Zitlan flying through the air and saw him land with a crash on the terrace and lie there writhing in pain Steinholt Lazarre he said convulsively We ve got to strike once more And then run He plunged into their enemies with every bit of energy that he had left and saw two of them toppling down Then like a flash he turned to Lazarre who was trying to fight off three of the Lodorians Seizing one of them by the waist Dirk hurled him backward and he disposed of another one in the same manner His sheer desperation seemed to have given him unbounded strength and power Lazarre sent his third opponent down with a blow under the chin and then with Dirk at his side they turned to the assistance of Steinholt With one mad rush they crashed into a group of Lodorians and sent them reeling away like so many nine pins Now To the plane exclaimed Dirk taking to his heels across the terrace Steinholt and Lazarre followed after him and turning the corner they saw that the ship was in place and that Fragoni was anxiously waiting by the door of the cabin Inga Dirk knew already was inside and safe He stood aside while Steinholt and Lazarre leaped in During the momentary wait he caught a glimpse of the great clock It was one minute to four Dirk jumping into the plane and switched on the helicopter without even waiting to close the cabin door The ship shot skyward like a rocket When it reached an altitude of thirty five hundred feet he turned it north and raced at top speed in that direction It was miles away from the palace of Fragoni in less than thirty seconds Dirk then stopped the plane and held it poised in the air with the helicopter The skies were turgid and black and the massed clouds reflecting the lights of the great city below them were permeated with an ugly feverish red glow From where they were hanging in midair the occupants of the plane could plainly see the sparkling palace of Fragoni towering high up into the darkness of the night The lights of the magnificent mansion were reflected far out into the Sound where looming in the golden ripples lay the sinister monster from the terrible depths of unfathomable space Dirk took a watch from his pocket and after glancing at it he hastily replaced it Two seconds more he said and A sharp and dazzling bolt of greenish fire came hurling suddenly out of the west and with a thunderous concussion seemed to fasten itself on the crest of Fragoni s palace It trembled and quivered as if endowed with some uncanny life and power as it remained there against the darkness throwing a weird green tinge over the water and up into the skies Blue waves of light could be seen pulsing and racing along the terrible beam and there where it had fastened itself they seemed to disappear in the vast and crumbling structure For four seconds that destructive streak of light one end of which was lost back in the mists that concealed Manhattan tore at the proud pile And as the stone crumbled and the steelite fused under the mighty assault an ominous roar swept through the night The air was so violently agitated that the plane miles away tossed up and down like a tiny boat on a stormy sea Then suddenly the bolt was gone but its livid image still burned in the eyes of those who had been watching it Once more it came hurling out of the west and like the fang of some great and deadly serpent darted into the monster that lay in the waters of the Sound Dirk and his companions could see plainly by the light of the bolt itself that it had crashed into the well from which the Lodorians first had appeared and that it was beating and hammering its way into the very vitals of the craft Dazzling blinding fire seemed to pour from the aperture through which the bolt had passed The clamor that arose was deafening Then again the streak of fires was withdrawn leaving the night intensely black until in a moment more it came thundering out of the west again and with an impact that made the land and the sea and the very heavens tremble hurled its way into the depths of the doomed leviathan Twice again it fell a fiery scimitar out of the darkness and twice again it careened at the vitals of the stricken monster Then after the assault was over the ship still floated on the surface of the Sound and its shell as far as Dirk and the others could judge still was unscathed We will soon know our fate remarked Steinholt calmly If that didn t kill those beasts we might as well give up our ghosts I ll drop the plane a little lower and a little nearer to the ship said Dirk I don t believe that any life is surviving in that thing My beautiful palace is nothing but dust sighed Fragoni mournfully And all my beautiful treasures too And that beautiful Zitlan Lazarre reminded him and his beautiful boy friends they are all dust too thank God It was a queer fate that Stanton met suggested Dirk He thought that he would save his life by going over to our enemies and instead of that he lost it Poor Stanton said Steinholt He was born that way I suppose and I for one am ready to forgive and forget him And now continued the Teuton I hope that we didn t do too much damage to that little boat of the Lodorians If we could get just a little peep at the inside of it we might learn the secret of its contrivance And then my friends we could do a little journeying ourselves Have you any theory regarding it asked Fragoni Teuxical intimated that it rode the magnetic currents which of course flow through all the suns and planets in the universe replied Steinholt We have been working along that line ourselves of course and it probably won t be very long anyway before we have the solution of interplanetary travel Those Lodorians would have solved it for us if it hadn t been for that artificial lightning said Lazarre That s powerful stuff Steinholt Yes with that three thousand foot Worldwide Tower to hurl it from agreed Steinholt we can get fair range with it If the Lodorians hadn t left the well of their ship open though the lightning wouldn t have done us much good I was afraid too for a time that we might have trouble in welding that automatic wireless circuit box to the bottom of the ship Dirk in the meantime had brought the plane down to within a half mile of the leviathan and he was holding it poised there It seems to me he said after scrutinizing the monster for a couple of minutes that it is moving in the water It is he exclaimed Steinholt Look Only a comparatively short time had elapsed since the last bolt of lightning had vanished back into the darkness It is still rocking with the force of the shock that we gave it asserted Steinholt You would be rocking too if you had been tickled by a bolt like that one It is rising I tell you said Dirk The front end of it is slowly getting higher in the water You re right Dirk said Fragoni excitement straining his voice Look It just dropped back into the water Then as they watched the movements of the leviathan became more and more agitated until it was churning up the waves around it like a wounded and agonized monster of the sea Suddenly the front end tilted upward and the monster rose clear of the water It shot straight up into the air at a speed so terrific that they could scarcely follow it It s gone gasped Fragoni Those brainless mindless automatons must have survived No remarked Steinholt thoughtfully I don t believe that there is any life left on that thing No one had closed the well when it rose and it would mean death to go out into space with the ship in that condition Then what made it go up demanded Lazarre Can the damn thing run itself Steinholt I imagine recalled the Teuton that our bolts killed every living thing that was on the craft but that at the same time they set the mechanism of the monster into action Ah he moaned but that is too bad We could have learned much by an examination of the interior of that liner of the air A cry from Inga startled them and they saw that she was looking skyward with terror in her eyes They followed her gaze and there streaking through the black clouds they saw a long trail of white fire It s that thing exclaimed Fragoni I tell you that those upon it still live and that they are about to wreak vengeance upon us No said Steinholt positively You are wrong Fragoni What is happening may be almost as disastrous though he admitted That leviathan is in its death agonies it is a metal monster gone mad and none can say what will happen before it expires The place for us asserted Dirk hurriedly is in the Worldwide Tower There we can keep track of what is transpiring and try to decide what to do The others agreed with him and seeking the westward level of flight he sped the plane in the direction of the mammoth pyramid from which the news of the world was broadcast They reached the vast structure in a few minutes and after dropping the plane on a landing stage they went into the operating room Here they learned quickly that the craft of the Lodorians was doing incalculable damage and that it was throwing the population of the world into an unprecedented panic It was apparently following an erratic uncertain orbit that took it far out into space and then back quite close to the surface of the earth again It had passed through the very heart of Chicago within a few yards of the ground and it had cut and burned a swath more than a mile wide through the buildings of that metropolis Other cities in America had felt the devastating effects of its irresistible and molten heat and within a short time thousands of people had been slain by it Time and again from the terrace of the great tower Dirk and his companions saw the skies above them light up as that terrible blazing projectile which uncontrolled went hurtling on its way through the night For three hours it careened on its mad course and hysteria reigned throughout the cities of the whole civilized world But then a report came from a rocket liner that had left Berlin en route for San Francisco Either a great meteor or that leviathan of the Lodorians just swept down past us in mid Atlantic and plunged into the sea Apparently it has exploded for it has thrown a great column of water for miles up into the air We are stopping and standing by although the heat is intense and clouds of steam are rising from the sea As the minutes passed by after the report from the rocket ship had been received the disappearance from the sky of the flaming craft from space seemed to confirm the belief that it had been swallowed by the ocean This was accepted as a certainty by eight o clock in the morning Ah sighed Steinholt if only it had crashed on land somewhere If there only was enough of it left for us to Enough of any damn contraption of that kind swore Lazarre fervently is altogether too much I hope for one that its fragments are scattered so far that we never can put them together again Dirk and Inga leaned against one of the parapets that evening on a gardened terrace of his own great mansion in Manhattan Their little party had gone there after leaving the Worldwide Tower in the morning After resting during the day Lazarre and Fragoni were somewhere together discussing the plans for a new palace to take the place of the one that was destroyed so that Zitlan and his minions might die in its ruins Steinholt elsewhere was delving into oceanography and submarine engineering in an attempt to learn whether or not it would be feasible to fish for the remains of the lost ship of Lodore It seems like a dream doesn t it Dirk the girl remarked It is difficult to believe that we actually have seen and talked with people from some far away world Together they looked up into the crystalline skies where mazes of shining stars gave testimony to the countless worlds which were wheeling around them And just to think Dirk Inga continued proudly that it was you who saved this world and all of its people from that horrible Zitlan and his horde I saved you he told her gravely and tenderly and that somehow means more to me than saving all of this world and all of the other worlds which are rolling through the uncharted ways of time and space COMING Murder Madness An Extraordinary Novel By MURRAY LEINSTER Transcriber Notes Typographical inconsistencies have been changed and are listed below
