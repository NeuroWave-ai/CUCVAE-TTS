none	none	to it that they don t Your adjutant does see to it sir I m willing to bet a month s pay fewer errors have been found in the papers of Fort Frayne than any post in the Department of the Platte General Williams told you as much when you were in Omaha The major fairly wriggled in his cane bottomed whirligig What young Field said was true and the major knew it He knew moreover there wasn t a more painstaking post adjutant from the Missouri to the mountains He knew their monthly reports returns as the regulations call them were referred to by a model adjutant general as model papers He knew it was due to young Field s care and attention and he knew he thought all the world of that young gentleman It was just because he thought so much of him he was beginning to feel that it was high time to put a stop to something that was going on But it was a delicate matter a woman was the matter and he hadn t the moral courage to go at it the straightforward way He whip sawed again Thrumming on the desk with his lean bony fingers he began If I let my adjutant out so much what s to prevent other youngsters asking similar indulgence The answer came like the crack of a whip Nothing sir and far better would it be for everybody concerned if they spent more hours in the saddle and fewer at the store This was too much for the one listener in the room With something like the sound of a suppressed sneeze a tall long legged captain of cavalry started up from his chair an outspread newspaper still full stretched between him and the desk of the commander and thus hidden as to his face sidled sniggering off to the nearest window Young Field had fearlessly if not almost impudently hit the nail on the head and metaphorically rapped the thrumming fingers of his superior officer Some commanders would have raged and sent the daring youngster right about in arrest Major Webb knew just what Field referred to knew that the fascinations of pool pitch and poker held just about half his commissioned force at all off duty hours of the day or night hanging about the officers club room at the post trader s knew moreover that while the adjutant never wasted a moment over cards or billiards he the post commander had many a time taken a hand or a cue and wagered his dollars against those of his devoted associates They all loved him There wasn t a mean streak in his whole system said every soldier at Fort Frayne He had a capital record as a volunteer a colonel and later brigade commander in the great war He had the brevet of brigadier general of volunteers but repudiated any title beyond that of his actual rank in the regulars He was that rara avis a bachelor field officer and a bird to be brought down if feminine witchery could do it He was truthful generous high minded brave a man who preferred to be of and with his subordinates rather than above them to rule through affection and regard rather than the stern standard of command He was gentle and courteous alike to officers and the rank and file though he feared no man on the face of the globe He was awkward bungling and overwhelmingly lavishly kind and thoughtful in his dealings with the womenfolk of the garrison for he stood in awe of the entire sisterhood He could ride like a centaur he couldn t dance worth a cent He could snuff a candle with his Colt at twenty paces and couldn t hit a croquet ball to save his soul His deep set gray eyes under their tangled thatch of brown gazed straight into the face of every man on the Platte soldier cowboy Indian or halfbreed but fell abashed if a laundress looked at him Billy Ray captain of the sorrel troop and the best light rider in Wyoming was the only man he ever allowed to straddle a beautiful thoroughbred mare he had bought in Kentucky but bad hands or good there wasn t a riding woman at Frayne who hadn t backed Lorna time and again because to a woman the major simply couldn t say no And though his favorite comrades at the post were captains like Blake and Billy Ray married men both whose wives he worshipped the major s rugged heart went out especially to Beverly Field his boy adjutant a lad who came to them from West Point only three years before the autumn this story opens a young fellow full of high health pluck and principle a tip top soldier said everybody from the start until as Gregg and other growlers began to declaim the major completely spoiled him Here three years only out of military leadingstrings he was a young cock of the walk too dam independent for a second lieutenant said the officers club element of the command men like Gregg Wilkins Crane and a few of their following The keenest young trooper in the regiment said Blake and Ray who were among its keenest captains and never a cloud had sailed across the serene sky of their friendship and esteem until this glorious September of one hundred eighty eight when Nanette Flower a brilliant beautiful brunette came a visitor to old Fort Frayne And it was on her account the major would could he have seen the way said no to the adjutant s request to be absent again On her account and that of one other for that request meant another long morning in saddle with Miss Flower another long morning in which the sweetest girl in the garrison so said they all would go about her daily duties with an aching heart There was no woman at Fort Frayne who did not know that Esther Dade thought all the world of Beverly Field There was only one man who apparently had no inkling of it Beverly Field himself She was the only daughter of a veteran officer a captain of infantry who at the age of fifty after having held a high command in the volunteers during the civil war was still meekly doing duty as a company officer of regulars nearly two decades after She had been carefully reared by a most loving and thoughtful mother even in the crude old days of the army when its fighting force was scattered in small detachments all over the wide frontier and men and women too lived on soldier rations eked out with game and dwelt in tents or ramshackle one storied huts built by the labor of troops At twelve she had been placed at school in the far East while her father enjoyed a two years tour on recruiting service and there under the care of a noble woman who taught her girls to be women indeed not vapid votaries of pleasure and fashion Esther spent five useful years coming back to her fond father s soldier roof a winsome picture of girlish health and grace and comeliness a girl who could ride walk and run if need be who could bake and cook mend and sew cut fashion and make her own simple wardrobe who knew algebra geometry and trig quite as well as and history geography and grammar far better than most of the young West Pointers a girl who spoke her own tongue with accuracy and was not badly versed in French a girl who performed fairly well on the piano and guitar but who sang full throated rejoiceful exulting like the lark the soulful music that brought delight to her ageing father half crippled by the wounds of the war days and to the mother who so devotedly loved and carefully planned for her Within a month from her graduation at Madame Piatt s she had become the darling of Fort Frayne the pet of many a household the treasure of her own With other young gallants of the garrison Beverly Field had been prompt to call prompt to be her escort when dance or drive ride or picnic was planned in her honor especially the ride for mister Adjutant Field loved the saddle the open prairie or the bold undulating bluffs But Field was the busiest man at the post Other youngsters troop or company subalterns had far more time at their disposal and begged for rides and dances strolls and sports which the post adjutant was generally far too busy to claim It was Esther who brought lawn tennis to Frayne and found eager pupils of both sexes but Field had been the first to meet and welcome her had been for a brief time at the start her most constant cavalier Then as others began to feel the charm of her frank cordial joyous manner and learned to read the beauty that beamed in her clear truthful eyes and winsome yet not beautiful face they became assiduous in turn two of them almost distressingly so and she could not wound them by refusals Then came a fortnight in which her father sat as a member of a court martial down at old Fort Laramie where were the band headquarters and four troops of the th and Captain and missus Freeman who were there stationed begged that missus Dade and Esther should come and visit them during the session of the court There would be all manner of army gaieties and a crowd of outside officers and as luck would have it mister Field was ordered thither as a witness in two important cases The captain and his good wife went by stage Esther and Beverly rode every inch of the way in saddle camping over night with their joyous little party at La Bonte Then came a lovely week at Laramie during which mister Field had little to do but devote himself to and dance with Esther and when his final testimony was given and he returned to his station and not until then Esther Dade discovered that life had little interest or joy without him but Field rode back unknowing and met at Frayne before Esther Dade s return a girl who had come almost unheralded making the journey over the Medicine Bow from Rock Springs on the Union Pacific in the comfortable carriage of old Bill Hay the post trader escorted by that redoubtable woman missus Bill Hay and within the week of her arrival Nanette Flower was the toast of the bachelors mess the talk of every household at Fort Frayne And well she might be Dark and lustrous were her eyes black luxuriant and lustrous was her hair dark rich and lustrous her radiant beauty In contour her face was well nigh faultless It might have been called beautiful indeed but for the lips or something about the mouth that in repose had not a soft or winsome line but then it was never apparently in repose Smiles sunshine animation rippling laughter flashing even white teeth these were what one noted when in talk with Miss Flower There was something actually radiant almost dazzling about her face Her figure though petite was exquisite and women marked with keen appreciation if not envy the style and finish of her varied and various gowns Six trunks said Bill Hay s boss teamster had been trundled over the range from Rawlins not to mention a box containing her little ladyship s beautiful English side saddle Melton bridle and other equine impedimenta Did Miss Flower like to ride She adored it and Bill Hay had a bay half thoroughbred that could discount the major s mare cross country All Frayne was out to see her start for her first ride with Beverly Field and all Frayne reluctantly agreed that sweet Essie Dade could never sit a horse over ditch or hurdle with the superb grace and unconcern displayed by the daring dashing girl who had so suddenly become the centre of garrison interest For the first time in her life missus Bill Hay knew what it was to hold the undivided attention of army society for every woman at Fort Frayne was wild to know all about the beautiful newcomer and only one could tell Hay the trader had prospered in his long years on the frontier first as trader among the Sioux later as sutler and finally when Congress abolished that title substituting therefore the euphemism without material clog upon the perquisites as post trader at Fort Frayne No one knew how much he was worth for while apparently a most open hearted whole souled fellow Hay was reticence itself when his fortunes or his family were matters of question or comment He had long been married and missus Hay when at the post was a social sphinx kind hearted charitable lavish to the soldiers wives and children and devotion itself to the families of the officers when sickness and trouble came as come in the old days they too often did It was she who took poor Ned Robinson s young widow and infant all the way to Cheyenne when the Sioux butchered the luckless little hunting party down by Laramie Peak It was she who nursed Captain Forrest s wife and daughter through ten weeks of typhoid and with her own means sent them to the seashore while the husband and father was far up on the Yellowstone cut off from all communication in the big campaign of seventy six It was she who built the little chapel and decked and dressed it for Easter and Christmas despite the fact that she herself had been baptized in the Roman Catholic faith It was she who went at once to every woman in the garrison whose husband was ordered out on scout or campaign proffering aid and comfort despite the fact long whispered in the garrisons of the Platte country that in the old old days she had far more friends among the red men than the white That could well be because in those days white men were few and far between Every one had heard the story that it was through her the news of the massacre at Fort Phil Kearny was made known to the post commander for she could speak the dialects of both the Arapahoe and the Sioux and had the sign language of the Plains veritably at her fingers ends There were not lacking those who declared that Indian blood ran in her veins that her mother was an Ogalalla squaw and her father a French Canadian fur trapper a story to which her raven black hair and brows her deep dark eyes and somewhat swarthy complexion gave no little color But long years before Bill Hay had taken her East where he had relatives and where she studied under excellent masters returning to him summer after summer with more and more of refinement in manner and so much of style and fashion in dress that her annual advent had come to be looked upon as quite the event of the season even by women of the social position of missus Ray and missus Blake the recognized leaders among the young matrons of the th Cavalry and by gentle missus Dade to whom every one looked up in respect almost in reverence Despite the mystery about her antecedents there was every reason why missus Hay should be held in esteem and affection Bill Hay himself was a diamond in the rough square sturdy uncompromising generous and hospitable his great pride and glory was his wife his one great sorrow that their only child had died almost in infancy His solecisms in syntax and society were many He was given at times to profanity and at others when madame was away to draw poker but officers and men alike proclaimed him a man of mettle and never hesitated to go to him when in financial straits sure of unusurious aid But even had this not been the case the popularity of his betterhalf would have carried him through for there was hardly a woman at Frayne to speak of her except in terms of genuine respect missus Hay was truth telling sympathetic a peacemaker a resolute opponent of gossip and scandal of every kind a woman who minded her own business and was only mildly insistent that others should do likewise She declined all overtures leading to confidences as to her past and demanded recognition only upon the standard of the present which was unimpeachable All the same it came something like a shock to society at Frayne that when she appeared at the post this beautiful autumn of one hundred eighty eight nearly three months later than the usual time she should be accompanied by this brilliant and beautiful girl of whom no one of their number had previously heard and whom she smilingly confidently presented as My niece Miss Flower Illustration THE MAJOR SOUGHT TO BLOCK THAT MORNING S RIDE IN VAIN There was a dance the night the Dades got home from Laramie Nearly all day long had they driven in the open buckboard over the rough winding road along the Platte and missus Dade was far too tired to think of going but Esther was so eager that her father put aside his precious paper tucked her under his arm and trudged cheerily away across the parade toward the bright lights of the hop room They had a fairly good string orchestra at Frayne that year and one of Strauss s most witching waltzes Sounds from the Vienna Woods had just been begun as father and daughter entered A dozen people men and women both saw them and noted what followed With bright almost dilated eyes and a sweet warm color mantling her smiling face Esther stood gazing about the room nodding blithely as she caught the glance of many a friend yet obviously searching for still another Then of a sudden they saw the bonny face light up with joy uncontrollable for mister Field came bounding in at the side door opening from the veranda of the adjutant s office He saw her smiled joyous greeting as he came swiftly toward her then stopped short as a girl in black grenadine dropped the arm of her cavalier the officer with whom she was promenading and without a moment s hesitation placed her left hand fan bearing close to the shoulder knot on his stalwart right arm her black gloved right in his white kidded left and instantly they went gliding away together he nodding half in whimsical apology half in merriment over the black spangled shoulder and the roseate light died slowly from the sweet smiling face the smile itself seemed slowly freezing as the still dilated eyes followed the graceful movements of the couple slowly harmoniously winding and reversing about the waxen floor Even at the Point she had never seen more beautiful dancing Even when her stanchest friend missus Blake pounced upon her with fond anxious welcoming words and missus Ray seeing it all broke from her partner s encircling arm and sped to add her greeting the child could hardly regain self control and one loving hearted woman cried herself to sleep that night for the woe that had come into the soft and tender eyes which had first beamed with joy at sight of Beverly Field then filled with sudden dread immeasurable But the major sought to block that morning ride in vain The impetuous will of the younger soldier prevailed as he might have known it would and from the rear gallery of his quarters with his strong fieldglass Major Webb watched the pair fording the Platte far up beyond Pyramid Butte Going over to that damned Sioux village again he swore between his set teeth That makes the third time she s headed him there this week and with strange annoyance at heart he turned away to seek comfort in council with his stanch henchman Captain Ray when the orderly came bounding up the steps with a telegraphic despatch which the major opened read turned a shade grayer and whistled low My compliments to Captains Blake and Ray said he to the silent young soldier standing attention at the doorstep and say I should be glad to see them here at once That night the sentries had just called off half past one when there was some commotion at the guard house A courier had ridden in post haste from the outlying station of Fort Beecher far up under the lee of the Big Horn range The corporal of the guard took charge of his reeking horse while the sergeant led the messenger to the commander s quarters The major was already awake and half dressed Call the adjutant was all he said on reading the despatch and the sergeant sped away In less than five minutes he was back I could get no answer to my knock or ring sir so I searched the house The adjutant isn t there CHAPTER II ABSENT FROM DUTY For a moment the major stood in silence then briefly saying Call Captain Ray turned again to the dimly lighted hallway of his commodious quarters the women thought it such a shame there should be no lady of the house for the largest and finest of the long line known as Officers Row while the sergeant of the guard scurried away to the soldier home of the senior cavalry captain on duty at the post When the major again came forth his field glasses were in his hand and he had hurried down the steps and out into the broad sheen of the moonlight when he caught sight of the courier seated on the horseblock at the gate wearily leaning his head upon his gauntleted hand Webb stopped short Come right in here my lad he cried I want to speak with you and followed slowly by the soldier he entered his parlor and whirled an easy chair in front of the open fireplace Sit right down there now and I ll be with you in a minute he added bustled into the rear room and presently reappeared with a decanter and glass poured out a stiff tot of Monongahela A little water he asked as the trooper s eye brightened gratefully A little water was added and off came the right hand gauntlet I drink the major s health and long life to him said the soldier gulping down the fluid without so much as a wink Then true to his training set down the glass and stood strictly at attention You ve had nothing to eat since yesterday morning I ll be bound said Webb Now I ve got to see some of my officers at once You make yourself at home here You ll find cold beef bread cheese pickles milk if you care for it and pie right there in the pantry Take the lamp in with you and help yourself If you want another nip there s the decanter You ve made splendid time Did you meet no Indians Not one sir but I saw smokes at sunset out toward Eagle Butte Your name I see you belong to Captain Truscott s troop Kennedy sir and I thank the major Then I ll leave you in charge until you ve had your fill said the commander Then go over to F Troop s quarters and get a bed Tell anybody who comes I ve gone to the flagstaff With that the major stalked from the room followed by the Irishman s adoring eyes A moment later he stood by the tall white staff at the edge of the northward bluff at whose feet the river swept by in musical murmurings There he quickly focussed his glass and gazed away westward up the Platte to where but the evening before a score of Indian lodges dotted the other bank perhaps two miles away The September moon was at its full and in that rare cloudless atmosphere flooding the valley with its soft silvery light so that close at hand within the limits of the garrison every object could be almost as distinctly seen as in broad day light but farther away over the lowlands and the river bottom and the rolling prairie stretching to the northern horizon the cottonwoods along the stream or in the distant swales made only black blotches against the vague colorless surface and the bold bluffs beyond the reservation limits south of the flashing waters the sharp sawlike edge of the distant mountain range that barred the way to the west even the cleancut outlines of Eagle Butte the landmark of the northward prairie visible for fifty miles by day were now all veiled in some intangible filament that screened them from the soldier s searching gaze Later in the season on such a night their crests would gleam with radiance almost intolerable the glistening sheen of their spotless crown of snow All over this broad expanse of upland prairie and wooded river bed and boldly undulating bluff line not so much as a spark of fire peeped through the wing of night to tell the presence of human wayfarer white halfbreed or Indian even where the Sioux had swarmed perhaps two hundred strong at sunset of the day gone by Close at hand northernmost of the brown line was the double set of quarters occupied by Captains Blake and Ray the latter as senior having chosen the half nearest the bluff because of the encircling veranda and the fine far extending view A bright light gleamed now behind the blinds of the corner room of the second floor telling that the captain was up and dressing in answer to the commander s summons but all the rest of the dozen houses were black save where at the middle of the row a faint glow came from the open doorway at the commanding officer s Across the broad level of the parade were the long low barracks of the troops six in number gable ending east and west Closing the quadrangle on the south were the headquarters buildings and the assembly room the offices of the adjutant and quartermaster the commissary and quartermaster s storehouses et cetera At the southwest angle stood the guard house where oil lamps backed by their reflectors of polished tin sent brilliant beams of light athwart the roadway Beyond these low buildings the black bulk of the Medicine Bow Mountains only a dozen miles away tumbled confusedly against the sparkling sky All spoke of peace security repose for even in the flats under the westward bluff where lay the wide extended corrals hay and wood yards and the stables not one of the myriad dogs that hung about the post was lifting up his voice to bay the autumn moon Even those easily started night trumpeters the big Missouri mules sprawled about their roomy sand floored stables and drowsed in placid comfort wearied with their musical efforts of the earlier hours of the night and gathering impetus for the sonorous braying with which they should presently salute the dawn Beyond the guard house at the edge of the plateau overlooking the westward flats but invisible from the flagstaff bluff stood the big wooden edifice known as the store with its card and billiard room for the officers on the southern side another for the enlisted men upon the northern the bar and general merchandise establishment compressed between them Southward farther still surrounded by crude greenhouses abounding in potted plants and beds of vine and vegetables was the big and somewhat pretentious house of the post trader himself his own stables and corral being half way down the slope and well away from those of the garrison Out of sight muttered Webb but by no means out of mind for it was safe to say the thoughts of more than half the men and women making up the social element of Fort Frayne had been centering within the last few days beneath the roof that gave shelter to that brilliant fascinating beauty Nanette Flower Ten days a denizen of the fort it seemed as though she had been there as many weeks so completely had she accepted the situation and possessed herself of the ins and outs of garrison life The women had called of course and gone away filled with unwilling admiration for the girl s gowns and graces were undeniable The married men as was the army way had called with their wives on the occasion of the first visit The bachelors from Webb down to the junior subaltern had called in little squads at first afterwards except the major they sought to see Miss Flower when other fellows were not present Even Hartley and Donovan the two whose devotions to Esther Dade had been carried to the verge of oppression and who were on terms of distant civility only when compelled to appear together in the presence of women or their other superiors had been moved to more than one visit at the Hays but Hartley speedily returned to his undesired siege at the quarters of Captain Dade while Donovan joined forces with two other youngsters Bruce and Putney because it gave them comfort to bother Field who being the adjutant and a very busy man could visit only at certain hours of the day or evening Now it had become apparent to the boys that despite her general attitude of cordiality their attentions were not what missus Hay so much desired as those of the major commanding Twice had he been invited to dine within the week of Nanette s coming Once he accepted The second time he begged off on plea of a previous engagement subsequently made to go shooting with Blake It was the bachelor heart and home of Major Webb to which missus Hay would have laid vicarious siege small blame to her for that indomitable cross examiner missus Wilkins wife and manager of the veteran ranker now serving as post quartermaster had wormed out of missus Hay the admission that Nanette had no fortune She was the only daughter of a half brother very dear to missus Hay whom she had lost she said long years before To do her justice it was quite apparent that Miss Flower was no party to the plan for though she beamed on Webb as she did on all she frankly showed her preference for the younger officers who could dance as well as ride and either dancing or riding was her glory She danced like a sylph she seemed to float about the room as though on air she rode superbly and shirked no leap that even Ray and Field took with lowered hands and close gripping knees She was joyous laughing radiant with all the officers and fairly glowed with cordiality for all the women But it speedily developed that she would rather dance with Field than any of the others probably because he was by far the best waltzer and to ride with him because Ray excepted there was none to excel him in the saddle Ten days had she been at Frayne and within that time had become as thoroughly at ease and home as though it had been her abiding place since babyhood It was plain to see that big Bill Hay almost worshipped this lovely protegee of the wife he more than worshipped It was plain to see that Webb uneasily held aloof as though fearful of singeing his shrivelling wings It was plain to see that the hitherto indomitable missus Wilkins was puzzled It was not so plain to see that there were two women at the post on whom Miss Flower s charms made slight impression Mesdames Blake and Ray two wise young matrons who were known to have few secrets from each other and no intimacies or rather no confidences with any other woman at Fort Frayne missus Dade possibly excepted But what they thought their liege lords stood ready to swear to and it was to them Webb turned in his perplexity when it became apparent that his young adjutant was ensnared It was to Ray he promptly opened his heart as that veteran of a dozen Indian campaigns then drawing his fourth fogy came hastening out to join the commander Here s confirmation of the telegram Read that Ray said Webb handing him the despatch from Fort Beecher Then come with me to Field s He s missing Missing cried Ray in consternation as he hurriedly opened the page In God s name what do you mean I mean he isn t in quarters and hasn t been in bed to night Now I need him and it s two o clock Even as he spoke the voice of the sentry at the guard house rang out the watch call through the still and sparkling night It was taken up by Number Two back of the storehouses and his All s well was still echoing among the foothills prolonged and powerful when Number Three down at the quartermaster s corral began his soldier song and so alert cheery reassuring the sentries sent their deep voiced assurance on its unbroken round to the waking guardian at the southwest angle and as his final A a a ll s W e ell went rolling away over bluff and stream and prairie Ray lifted a grave and anxious face from the fateful paper Lame Wolf out That s bad in itself He s old Red Cloud s nephew and a brute at best Stabber s people there yet he suddenly asked whirling on his heel and gazing westward Can t make out even with my glasses All dark as pitch among the cottonwoods but Kennedy who made the ride says he saw smokes back of Eagle Butte just before sunset Then you can bet they won t be there at dawn the warriors at least Of course the women the kids and old men will stay if only for a blind He had forty fighting men and Wolf s got at least two hundred What started the row The arrest of those two young bucks on charge of killing Finn the sheep herder on the Piney last week I don t believe the Sioux began it There s a bad lot among those damned rustlers said Webb snapping the glass into its well worn case But no matter who starts we have to finish it Old Plodder is worried and wants help Reckon I ll have to send you Ray Ready whenever you say sir was the prompt and soldierly reply Even marriage had not taken the edge from Ray s keen zest for campaigning Shall I have out my sergeant and cooks at once We ll need to take rations

none	none	but wait with me till I wire the chief at Laramie Come to the office So saying the post commander turned and strode away The captain glanced at the upper window where the light now dimly burned but blind and window were open and a woman s form appeared It s all right Maidie called the captain softly May have to start out on scout at daybreak That s all Home soon and with a reassuring wave of the hand turned again to his stanch friend and commander I hate to send you again said Webb You were out in June and the others have had only short scouts since Don t bother What s a cavalryman for Shall we I can t believe it some how and Ray stopped glanced inquiringly at the major and then nodded toward the doorway of the third house on the row The ground floor was occupied by Field as his quarters the up stair rooms by Putney and Ross Come in said the major briefly and pushing through the gate they softly entered the dark hallway and struck a light in the front room A wood fire was smouldering on the andirons in the wide brick chimney place An open book face downward was on the centre table Two embroidered slippers lay as though hurriedly kicked off one under the sofa beyond the mantelpiece the other half way across the worn carpet Striking another match at the doorway Ray passed on to the little inner room the bed chamber On the bed carelessly thrown were the young officer s best and newest forage cap undress uniform coat and trousers He had used them during the evening when calling at the Hays On the floor were the enamelled leather buttoned boots he wore on such occasions The bed was otherwise untouched Other boots and shoes in orderly row stood against the wall beside the plain unpainted wardrobe The spurred riding boots and the knee tight breeches were gone Turning back to the front room Ray found the major his face gray and disturbed holding forth to him an open envelope Ray took it and glanced at the superscription Lieutenant Beverly Field Fort Frayne and returned it without a word Both knew the strange angular slashing hand writing at a glance for both had seen and remarked it before It was Nanette Flower s Dropping the envelope on the table he had found it on the floor Webb led the way to the open air There was then no time to compare views There stood the sergeant Sir said he with a snap of the gloved left hand at the brown tube nestling in the hollow of the shoulder Number Five reports that he has heard galloping hoofbeats up the bench twice in the last half hour and thought he saw distant horsemen three couldn t say whether they were Indians or cowboys Very good sergeant was the major s brief answer Send for the telegraph operator and my orderly The sergeant turned One moment called Ray your pardon Major My first sergeant too and sergeant have any sentries reported horses taken out from the stables to night Not one sir and stanch and sturdy the commander of the guard stood ready to vouch for his men That s all A quick salute a face to the right about and the sergeant was gone Webb turned and looked inquiringly at Ray I asked sir was that officer s brief explanation because wherever Field has gone he wore riding dress CHAPTER III A NIGHT ENCOUNTER Comforted by abundant food refreshed and stimulated by more than two or three enthusiastic toasts to the health of the major the men so loved Trooper Kennedy like a born dragoon and son of the ould sod bethought him of the gallant bay that had borne him bravely and with hardly a halt all the long way from Beecher to Frayne The field telegraph had indeed been stretched but it afforded more fun for the Sioux than aid to the outlying posts on the Powder and Little Horn for it was down ten days out of twelve Plodder lieutenant colonel of infantry commanding at Beecher had been badly worried by the ugly demonstrations of the Indians for ten days past He was forever seeing in mind s eye the hideous details of the massacre at Fort Phil Kearny a few miles further on around the shoulder of the mountains planned and carried out by Red Cloud with such dreadful success in sixty seven Plodder had strong men at his back whom even hordes of painted Sioux could never stampede but they were few in number and there were those ever present helpless dependent women and children His call for aid was natural enough and his choice of Kennedy daring dashing lad who had learned to ride in Galway was the best that could be made No peril could daunt the light hearted fellow already proud wearer of the medal of honor but duty done it was Kennedy s creed that the soldier merited reward and relaxation If he went to bed at F Troop s barracks there would be no more cakes and ale no more of the major s good grub and rye If he went down to look after the gallant steed he loved saw to it that Kilmaine was rubbed down bedded given abundant hay and later water sure then with clear conscience he could accept the major s bid and call again on his bedward way and toast the major to his Irish heart s and stomach s content Full of pluck and fight and enthusiasm and only quarter full he would insist of rye was Kennedy as he strode whistling down the well remembered road to the flats for he with Captain Truscott s famous troop had served some months at Frayne before launching forth to Indian story land in the shadows of the Big Horn range Kennedy in fact essayed to sing when once out of earshot of the guard house and singing he strolled on past the fork of the winding road where he should have turned to his right and in the fulness of his heart went striding southward down the slope past the once familiar haunt the store now dark and deserted past the big house of the post trader past the trader s roomy stables and corral and so wended his moonlit way along the Rawlins trail never noting until he had chanted over half a mile and most of the songs he knew that Frayne was well behind him and the rise to the Medicine Bow in front Then Kennedy began to laugh and call himself names and then as he turned about to retrace his steps by a short cut over the bottom he was presently surprised but in no wise disconcerted to find himself face to face with a painted Sioux There by the path side cropping the dewy grass was the trained pony Here lounging by the trail the thick black braids of his hair interlaced with beads the quill gorget heaving at his massive throat the heavy blanket slung negligently gracefully about his stalwart form his nether limbs and feet in embroidered buckskin his long lashed quirt in hand here stood almost confronting him as fine a specimen of the warrior of the Plains as it had ever been Trooper Kennedy s lot to see and see them he had many a time and oft In that incomparable tale My Lord the Elephant the great Mulvaney comes opportunely upon a bottle of whiskey and a goblet of water The first and second dhrink I didn t taste said he bein dhry but the fourth and fifth took hould an I began to think scornful of elephants At no time stood Kennedy in awe of a Sioux At this time he held him only in contempt How John said he with an Irishman s easy insolence Lookin for a chance to steal somethin is it And then Kennedy was both amazed and enraptured at the prompt reply in the fervent English of the far frontier Go to hell you pock marked son of a scut Where d you steal your whiskey For five seconds Kennedy thought he was dreaming Then convinced that he was awake an Irishman scorned and insulted he dashed in to the attack Both fists shot out from the brawny shoulders both missed the agile dodger then off went the blanket and with two lean red sinewy arms the Sioux had locked his foeman round and the two were straining and swaying in a magnificent grapple At arms length Pat could easily have had the best of it for the Indian never boxes but in a bear hug and a wrestle all chances favored the Sioux Cursing and straining honors even on both for a while Connaught and wild Wyoming strove for the mastery Whiskey is a wonderful starter but a mighty poor stayer of a fight Kennedy loosed his grip from time to time to batter wildly with his clinched fists at such sections of Sioux anatomy as he could reach but at range so close his blows lacked both swing and steam and fell harmless on sinewy back and lean muscular flanks Then he tried a Galway hitch and trip but his lithe antagonist knew a trick worth ten of that Kennedy tried many a time next day to satisfactorily account for it but never with success He found himself speedily on the broad of his back gasping for breath with which to keep up his vocal defiance staring up into the glaring vengeful black eyes of his furious and triumphant foeman And then in one sudden awful moment he realized that the Indian was reaching for his knife Another instant it gleamed aloft in the moonlight and the poor lad shut his eyes against the swift and deadly blow Curses changed to one wordless prayer to heaven for pity and help He never saw the glittering blade go spinning through the air Vaguely faintly he heard a stern young voice ordering Hold there then another a silvery voice crying something in a strange tongue and was conscious that an unseen power had loosed the fearful grip on his throat next that obedient to that same power one he dare not question the Indian was struggling slowly to his feet and then for a few seconds Kennedy soared away into cloudland knowing naught of what was going on about him When he came to again he heard a confused murmur of talk about him and grew dimly aware that his late antagonist was standing over him panting still and slightly swaying and that an officer a young athlete was saying rebukeful words Well he knew him as what trooper of the th did not Lieutenant Beverly Field but seeing the reopened eyes it was the Indian again who sought to speak With uplifted hand he turned from the rescuer to the rescued You re saved this time you cur of a Mick were expurgated of unprintable blasphemy the exact words of the semi savage lord of the frontier but by the God that made us both I ll get you before another moon dash dash you and when I do I ll cut out your blackguard heart and eat it Then bounding on his pony away he sped at mad gallop westward For a moment no further word was spoken The officer presently helped the soldier to his feet and stayed him for the latter s legs seemed wobbly Field let his salvage get its breath before asking questions Yet he was puzzled for the man s face was strange to him Who are you he asked at length and what on earth are you doing out here this time of night Kennedy sir Captain Truscott s troop at Fort Beecher I got in with despatches an hour ago What cried Field Despatches What did you do Gave em to the major sir Beg pardon they was lookin for the adjutant sir an Sergeant Hogan said he wasn t home Even in the moonlight the Irishman saw the color fade from the young officer s face The hand that stayed him dropped nerveless With utter consternation in his big blue eyes Field stood for a moment stunned and silent Then the need of instant action spurred him I must go at once he said You are all right now You can get back You ve been drinking haven t you The major s health sir just a sup or two I ve no time now to listen to how you came to be out here I ll see you by and by But still the young officer hesitated One hand grasped the rein of his horse He half turned to mount then turned again Kennedy he faltered you d have been a dead man if we if I hadn t reached you at that moment I know it sir burst in Pat impetuously I ll never forget it Hush Kennedy you must forget forget that you saw spoke with me forget that you saw or heard any other soul on earth out here to night Can you promise I ll cut my tongue out before I ever spake the word that ll harm the lieutenant or the the or any one he says sir But never will I forget It ain t in me sir Let it go at that then Here shake hands Kennedy Now good night Another instant and Field was in saddle and speeding away toward the post where lights were now dancing about the quartermaster s corral and firefly lamps were flitting down the slope toward the stables on the flats Ray s men were already up and doing Slowly stiffly following Pat Kennedy rubbed his aching head with a hand that shook as never did his resolution His bewildered brain was puzzling over a weighty problem The lieutenant s safe all right he muttered but what s gone wid the squaw that was shoutin Sioux at that murdherin buck Meantime all Fort Frayne had seemed to wake to life No call had sounded on the trumpet No voice had been raised save the invariable call of the sentries passing from post to post the half hours of the night but the stir at the guard house the bustle over at the barracks the swift footsteps of sergeants or orderlies on the plank walk or resounding wooden galleries speedily roused first one sleeper then another and blinds began to fly open along the second floor fronts and white robed forms to appear at the windows and inquiring voices male and female hailed the passerby with What s the matter sergeant and the answer was all sufficient to rouse the entire garrison Captain Ray s troop ordered out sir or ma am as the case might be No need to add the well worn cause of such night excursions Indians The office was brightly lighted and there sleepy eyed and silent were gathered many of the officers about their alert commander Ray was down at his stables passing judgment on the mounts Only fifty were to go the best half hundred in the sorrel troop for it was to be a forced march Neither horse nor man could be taken unless in prime condition for a break down on part of either on the way meant delay to the entire command or death by torture to the hapless trooper left behind Small hope was there of a march made unobserved for Stabber s band of Ogalallas had been for weeks encamped within plain view Less hope was there of Stabber s holding aloof now that his brethren at the Big Horn had declared for war He was a recalcitrant of the first magnitude a sub chief who had never missed the warpath when the Sioux were afield or the consolation trip to Washington between times Where Stabber went his young men followed unquestioning It was a marvel that Kennedy had succeeded in getting through It meant that the Indian runners or the Indian smokes and signals had not at once so covered the country with scouts that couriers could by no possibility slip between them But now the signal fire was gleaming at Eagle Butte and an answering blaze had flared from Stabber s camp Invisible from Fort Frayne they had both been seen by shrewd non commissioned officers sent scouting up the Platte by Major Webb within half an hour of the coming of the alarm Ray will push ahead at once said Webb to his silent subordinates You see Colonel Plodder has only two troops up there and he will need all his infantry to defend the post I ve wired to Laramie and to Department Headquarters and further orders will come before noon Let all the cavalry be ready Then if we push out Dade we leave Fort Frayne to you They ll hardly venture south of the Platte this time Is mister Field going with Captain Ray presently ventured young Ross who knew Ray had but one subaltern for duty at the moment and whose soul was burning with eagerness to accompany the first troop to take the field No said the major shortly Captain Ray needs no more I only asked because Field isn t here and I thought maybe stumbled Ross ingloriously but the mischief was done mister Field is busy answered the major still more shortly then reddened to his bushy brows for at the doorway in riding dress and with a face the color of parchment stood the officer in question It was a moment that threatened panic but Webb met the crisis with marked aplomb Oh Field he cried there s another matter I want two good men to slip out at once and see how many of Stabber s people start or have started It may be daybreak before they can tell Sergeant Schreiber would be a tiptop man for one and little Duffy You tend to it And so mercifully he sent the lad away until the crowd should have dispersed Only Blake and Ray were with him when after awhile mister Field returned and stood silently before them Well he knew that the post commander could hardly overlook the absence of his adjutant at such a time Have you anything to tell me Field was the major s only query his tone full of gentle yet grave reproach I was restless I could not sleep sir I went out purposely You know no horse can be taken from the stables at night except in presence of the sergeant or corporal of the guard I took none sir was the answer and now both faces were white I rode one of mister Hay s For one moment there was no sound but the loud ticking of the big office clock Then came the question Who rode the others Field The sentries say they heard three There was another moment of silence Ray stepped on tiptoe to the door as though he wanted not to hear Blake looked blankly out of the window Then the young soldier spoke I cannot tell you sir For full ten seconds the post commander sat with grave pallid face looking straight into the eyes of his young staff officer White as his senior but with eyes as unflinching Field returned the gaze At last the major s voice was heard again sad and constrained Field Captain Ray starts on a forced march at once for Fort Beecher I wish you to go with him CHAPTER IV THE SIGN OF THE BAR SHOE Many a time has it happened in the old days of the old army that the post adjutant has begged to be allowed to go with some detachment sent after Indians Rarely has it happened however that without any request from the detachment commander or of his own has the post adjutant been ordered to go No one could say of Beverly Field that he had not abundantly availed himself of every opportunity for active service in the past During his first two years with the regiment he had spent more than half the time in saddle and afield scouting the trails of war parties or marauding bands or watching over a peaceable tribe when on the annual hunt Twice he had been out with Ray which meant a liberal education in plainscraft and frontier duty Twice twenty times probably had he said he would welcome a chance to go again with Captain Ray and now the chance had come so had the spoken order and so far from receiving it with rejoicing it was more than apparent that he heard it with something like dismay But Webb was not the man to either explain or defend an order even to a junior for whom he cherished such regard Field felt instinctively that it was not because of a wish expressed in the past he was so suddenly bidden to take the field Ray s senior subaltern as has been said was absent being on duty at West Point but his junior was on hand and Ray really did not need and probably had not applied for the services of mister Field It was all the major s doing and all reasoned he because the major deemed it best that for the time being his young adjutant should be sent away from the post Impulse prompted Field to ask wherein he had offended or failed Reflection taught him however that he would be wise to ask no questions It might well be that Webb knew more of what had happened during the night than he Beverly Field would care to have mentioned You can be ready can you not asked the major I am ready now sir was the brief firm reply but the tone told unerringly that the lad resented and in heart rebelled at the detail To whom shall I turn over the post fund sir I do not care to have you transfer funds or anything Field This is but a temporary affair one that will take you away perhaps a fortnight I prefer that it should be permanent sir was the young officer s sudden interruption and though his eyes were blazing he spoke with effort his face still white with mingled sense of indignity and indignation Gently mister Field said Webb with unruffled calm even while uplifting a hand in quiet warning We will consider that if need be on your return Meantime if you desire I will receipt to you for the post fund or any other public money That is the trouble sir The best I can do is give you an order for it Post treasurers as a rule have not had to turn over their funds at four o clock in the morning which statement was true enough however injudicious it might be to bruit it Mild mannered commanding officers sometimes amaze their subordinates by most unlooked for and unwelcome eruptiveness of speech when they feel that an unwarrantable liberty has been taken Webb did not take fire He turned icy The quartermaster s safe can be opened at any moment mister Field said he the blue gray eyes glittering dangerously I presume your funds are there It was because the quartermaster would not open it at any moment that I took them out and placed them elsewhere hotly answered Field and not until then did Webb remember that there had been quite a fiery talk followed by hyperborean estrangement between his two staff officers and now as the only government safe at the post was in the office of the quartermaster and the only other one was Bill Hay s big Phoenix at the store it dawned upon the major that it was there mister Field had stowed his packages of currency a violation of orders pure and simple and that was why he could not produce the money on the spot Webb reflected If he let Ray start at dawn and held Field back until the trader was astir it might be eight o clock before the youngster could set forth By that time Ray would be perhaps a dozen miles to the northward and with keen eyed Indian scouts noting the march of the troop and keeping vigilant watch for possible stragglers it might be sending the lad to certain death for Plodder had said in so many words the Sioux about him had declared for war had butchered three ranchmen on the Dry Fork had fired on and driven in his herd guards and wood choppers and what started with Lane Wolf s big band would spread to Stabber s little one in less than no time and what spread to Stabber s would soon reach a host of the Sioux Moreover there was another reason It would give Field opportunity for further conference with inmates of the trader s household and the major had his own grave reasons for seeking to prevent that Your written order will be sufficient mister Field said he Send me memorandum of the amounts and I will receipt at once so that you can go without further thought of them And now with a glance at the clock you have hardly half an hour in which to get ready Raising his hand in mechanical salute Field faced about cast one look at Blake standing uncomfortably at the window and then strode angering away to his quarters smarting under a sense of unmerited rebuke yet realizing that as matters looked no one was more to blame than himself Just as the first faint flush of coming day was mantling the pallid eastern sky and while the stars still sparkled aloft and the big bright moon was sinking to the snow tipped peaks far away to the occident in shadowy column a troop of fifty horse filed slowly from The Sorrels big corral and headed straight for the Platte Swift and unfordable in front of Frayne in the earlier summer the river now went murmuring sleepily over its stony bed and Ray led boldly down the bank and plunged girth deep into the foaming waters Five minutes more and every man had lined up safely on the northward bank In low tone the order was given starting as Ray ever did in solid column of fours In dead silence the little command moved slowly away followed by the eyes of half the garrison on the bluff Many of these were women and children who gazed through a mist of tears Ray turned in saddle as the last of his men went by looked long at the dim light in the upper window of his home where clasping her children to her heart his devoted wife knelt watching them her fond lips moving in ceaseless prayer Dimly she could see the tried leader her soldier husband sitting in saddle at the bank Bravely she answered the flutter of his handkerchief in farewell Then all was swallowed up in the shadows of the distant prairie and from the nursery adjoining her room there rose a querulous wail that told that her baby daughter was waking indifferent to the need that sent the soldier father to the aid of distant comrades threatened by a merciless foe and conscious only of her infantile demands and expectations Not yet ten years wed that brave devoted wife and mother had known but two summers that had not torn her husband from her side on just such quest and duty for these were the days of the building up of the West resisted to the bitter end by the red wards of the nation The sun was just peering over the rough jagged outline of the eastward buttes when a quick yet muffled step was heard on the major s veranda and a picturesque figure stood waiting at the door Scout of course a stranger would have said at a glance for from head to foot the man was clad in beaded buckskin without sign of soldier garb of any kind Soldier too would have been the expert testimony the instant the door opened and the commanding officer appeared Erect as a Norway pine the strange figure stood to attention heels and knees together shoulders squared head and eyes straight to the front the left hand fingers extended after the precise teachings of the ante bellum days the right hand raised and held at the salute Strange figure indeed yet soldierly to the last degree despite the oddity of the entire make up The fur trimmed cap of embroidered buckskin sat jauntily on black and glossy curls that hung about the brawny neck and shoulders The buckskin coat heavily fringed as to the short cape and the shorter skirt was thickly covered with Indian embroidery of bead and porcupine quill so too were the fringed trousers and leggings so too the moccasins soled with thick yet pliant hide Keen black eyes shone from beneath heavy black brows just sprinkled as were the thick moustache and imperial with gray The lean jowls were closely shaved The nose was straight and fine the chin square and resolute The face and hands were tanned by sun and wind well nigh as dark as many a Sioux but in that strange garb there stood revealed one of the famous sergeants of a famous regiment the veteran of a quarter century of service with the standard wounded time and again bearing the scars of Stuart s sabre and of Southern lead of Indian arrow and bullet both proud possessor of the medal of honor that many a senior sought in vain proud as the Lucifer from whom he took his Christian name brave cool resolute and ever reliable Schreiber First Sergeant of old K Troop for many a year faced his post commander with brief and characteristic report Sir Chief Stabber with over thirty warriors left camp about three o clock heading for Eagle Butte Well done sergeant I knew I could count on you answered Webb in hearty commendation Now one thing more Go to F Troop s quarters and see how Kennedy is faring He came in with despatches from Fort Beecher and later drank more I fancy than was good for him for which I assume all responsibility Keep him out of mischief this morning I will sir said the sergeant and saluting turned away while Webb went back to set a dismantled pantry in partial order against the appearance of his long suffering house keeper whose comments he dreaded as he did those of no inspector general in the army For fifteen years and whithersoever Webb was ordered his bachelor menage had been presided over by Mistress Margaret McGann wife of a former trooper who had served as Webb s striker for so many a year in the earlier days that when discharged for disability due to wounds rheumatism and advancing years and pensioned as only Uncle Sam rewards his veterans McGann had begged the major to retain him and his buxom better half at their respective duties and Webb had meekly weakly yielded to the end that in the fulness of time Dame Margaret had achieved an ascendancy over the distinguished cavalry officer little short of that she had exercised over honest Michael since the very day she consented to become Mistress McGann A sound sleeper was she however and not until morning police call was she wont to leave her bed Then her brief toilet completed she would descend to the kitchen and set the major s coffee on the fire started by her dutiful spouse an hour earlier Then she proceeded to lay the table and put the rooms in order against the major s coming and woe betide him if cigar stubs littered the bachelor sittingroom or unrinsed glasses and half empty decanters told of even moderate symposium over night Returning that eventful morning from his office at first call for reveille after seeing the last of Ray s gallant troop as it moved away across the dim vista of the northward prairie Webb had been concerned to find his decanter of Monongahela half empty on the pantry table and the debris of a hurried feast on every side Kennedy who had begun in moderation must have felt the need of further creature comfort after his bout with the stalwart Sioux and had availed himself to the limit of his capacity of the major s invitation Webb s first thought was to partially remove the traces of that single handed spree then refilling the decanter from the big five gallon demijohn kept under lock and key in the cupboard for Michael too had at long intervals weaknesses of his own he was thinking how best to protect Kennedy from the consequences of his Webb s rash invitation when Schreiber s knock was heard Ten minutes more and the sergeant was back again Sir I have to report that Trooper Kennedy has not been seen about the quarters said he Then try the stables sergeant answered the veteran campaigner and thither would Schreiber next have gone even had he not been sent And sure enough there was Kennedy with rueful face and a maudlin romaunt about a moonlit meeting with a swarm of painted Sioux over which the stable guard were making merry and stirring the trooper s soul to wrath ungovernable I can prove ut he howled to the accompaniment of clinching fists and bellicose lunges at the laughing tormentors nearest him I can whip the hide off n the scut that says I didn t Ask Lootn t Field bejabers He saw it Ask Oh Mother of God what s this I m sayin And there with stern rebuking gaze stood the man they knew and feared every soul of them as they did no commissioned soldier in the th Sergeant Schreiber the redoubtable and Schreiber had heard the insane and damaging boast Come with me Kennedy was all he said and Kennedy snatched his battered felt headgear down over his eyes and tacked woefully after his swift striding master without ever another word But it was to his own room Schreiber took the unhappy Irishman not to the quarters of Company F He had heard words that coupled with others that fell through the darkness on his keenly listening ears some two hours earlier had given him cause for painful thought Lie down here Kennedy Pull off your boots said he and if you open your fool head to any living soul until I give you leave py Gott I ll gill you It was Schreiber s way like Marryatt s famous Boatswain to begin his admonitions in exact English and then as wrath overcame him to lapse into dialect It was but a few minutes after seven when Major Webb having previously despatched a messenger to the post trader s to say he had need to see mister Hay as soon as possible mounted his horse and followed by Sergeant Schreiber and an orderly rode quietly past the guard house touching his hat to the shouted Turn out the guard commanding officer of the sentry on Number One mister Hay was dressing hurriedly said the servant so Webb bade Schreiber and the orderly ride slowly down to the flats and await him at the forks of the road It was but five minutes before Hay appeared pulling on his coat as he shot from the door but even before he came the major had been carefully cautiously scanning the blinds of the second story even while feigning deep interest in the doings of a little squad of garrison prisoners the inevitable inmates of the guard house in the days before we had our safeguard in shape of the soldier s club the post exchange and now again in the days that follow its ill judged extinction The paymaster had been at Frayne but five days earlier The prison room was full of aching heads and Hay s coffers of hard earned ill spent dollars Webb sighed at sight of the crowded ranks of this whimsically named Company Q but in no wise relaxed his vigilance for the slats of the blind of the corner window had partially opened He had had a glimpse of feminine fingers and purposely he called Hay well out into the road then bent down over him All your horses in and all right this morning Hay None have been out said Hay stoutly unless they ve gone within the hour I never let them have the keys you know over night Pete brought them to me at eight last evening and got em at six this morning the usual time Where does he get them without waking you asked Webb They hang behind the door in my sleeping room Pete gets them when he takes my boots to black at six o clock Come over to the stables said the commanding officer and wondering Hay followed They found the two hostlers busily at work grooming In his box stall bright as a button was Harney Hay s famous runner his coat smooth as satin Hay went rapidly from stall to stall Of the six saddlers owned by him not one gave the faintest sign of having been used over night but Webb riding through the gangway noted that Crapaud the French halfbreed grooming in the third stall never lifted his head Whatever evidence of night riding that might earlier have existed had been deftly groomed away The trader had seen suspicion in the soldier s eye and so stood forth triumphant No Major Webb said he in loud confident oracular tone no horse of mine ever gets out without my knowing it and never at night unless you or I so order it No queried the major placidly Then how do you account for this Among the fresh hoof prints in the yielding sand with which the police party had been filling the ruts of the outer roadway was one never made by government horse or mule In half a dozen places within a dozen rods plain as a pikestaff was the print of a bar shoe worn on the off fore foot of just one quadruped at the post Hay s swift running General Harney CHAPTER V A GRAVE DISCOVERY Only an hour was the major away from his post He came back in time for guard mounting and the reports of the officers of the day He had reason to be on the parade at the assembly of the details not so much to watch the work of the post adjutant pro tempore as the effect of the sudden and unlooked for change on certain of the customary spectators He had swiftly ridden to the camp of the recreant Stabber and purposely demanded speech with that influential chieftain There had been the usual attempt on part of the old men left in charge to hoodwink and to temporize but when sharply told that Stabber with his warriors had been seen riding away toward Eagle Butte at three in the morning the sages calmly confessed judgment but declared they had no other purpose than a hunt for a drove of elk reported seen about the famous Indian race course in the lower hills of the Big Horn Circling the camp however Webb had quickly counted the pony tracks across the still dewy bunchgrass of the bench and found Schreiber s estimate substantially correct Then stopping at the lodge of Stabbers s uncle old Spotted Horse where that superannuated but still sagacious chief was squatted on his blanket and ostentatiously puffing a long Indian pipe Webb demanded to know what young men remained in the village Over a hundred strong old men squaws and children they thronged about him silent big eyed and attentive Schreiber interpreting as best he could resorting to the well known sign language when the crafty Sioux professed ignorance of the meaning of his words No young men All gone was the positive declaration of the venerable head of the bailiwick when compelled at last to answer But Schreiber had studied the pony herd and knew better Moreover not more than six of their ponies had been led along with the war party that set forth in the early hours of the moonlit morning Others both men and mounts unavoidably left behind would surely be sent forward at the first possible opportunity and much as Webb might wish to turn back to capture the party well as he might know that other bands were in revolt and Stabber gone to help them he was powerless under his orders to interfere until by some openly hostile act these laggards of the little band invited his reprisal The rule of the road as prescribed by the civil authorities to which the soldier had sworn obedience being practically Don t defend until you are hit Don t shoot until you are shot Webb came cantering back assured that these frowsy malodorous lodges concealed perhaps half a score of fighting men who were a menace to the neighborhood and who could be counted on to make it more than interesting for any couriers that might have to be sent between the fort and the forces at the front Calling Schreiber to his side as with long easy stride their trained mounts went loping swiftly homeward he gave instructions the veteran heard with kindling eyes Then parting from him at the corrals the commander rode on and dismounted at his quarters just as the trumpeters were forming on the broad grassy level of the parade Even without a band young Field had managed to make his guard mount a pretty and attractive ceremony Frayne was a big post and needed a daily guard of twenty four men with the usual quota of non commissioned officers Cowboys herders miners prospectors rustlers those pirates of the plains and occasional bands of Indians Sioux or Arapahoe were forever hovering about its borders in search of supplies solid or fluid and rarely averse to the conversion of public property to personal use Like many a good citizen of well ordered municipalities within the confines of civilization they held that what belonged to the government belonged to them and the fact that some officer would have to pay for whatsoever they stole from a horse to a hammer cut no figure in their deliberations Frayne had long been a favorite place for fitting out depleted stock animal vegetable or mineral and there had been times when Webb found as many as forty men almost too small a guard and so gave it to be understood that sentries whose carbines were unlawfully discharged at night without the formality of preliminary challenge or other intimation of business intentions would be held blameless provided they had something to show for their shot A remarkable feature of the winter s depredation had been that Hay s corral was never molested although unguarded by the garrison and quite as much exposed as the most remote of the government shops shanties or stables Field mounted his guard except in cold or stormy weather in full uniform and the daily march past in review brought many of the garrison ladies most of the children and all of the dogs to the scene Some of the households breakfasted just before some just after guard mounting but as a rule no one sat at table when almost everybody else was gathered along the westward edge of the broad parade It was there the plans for the social day were discussed and determined Rides drives hunts or picnics away from the post dances dinners croquet or tennis within the garrison limits It was the hour when all the girls were out looking fair and fresh as daisies and while the mothers sedately gossiped along the row of broad verandas their daughters blithely chatted in little groups or as might often be paced slowly with downcast eyes and mantling cheeks at the side of some young gallant who had no thought for other duty than that of the thrilling moment And here they were well nigh a dozen of them of all ages from twelve to twenty as the major sent his mount to the stables and made quick survey of the scene and a moment s glance was sufficient to show that among them all there was stir and excitement beyond that which would be caused by so common an incident as the sending forth of a troop on scout It was the fact that Field had gone and that young Ross was acting in his place that set them all to speculating on the cause One of their number promenading with Lieutenant Hartley glanced up at Major Webb as they passed him by with such a world of mingled question and reproach in her soft blue eyes that his heart for the moment smote him He had never seen Esther Dade looking so languid or so wan yet more of her and for her had he been thinking during the week gone by than of any other girl in or out of the army To day however there was another he eagerly sought to see and with something akin to keen disappointment noted that she was not among the strollers along the board walk or the chatting groups about the steps and gateways Not once during her brief visit had she as yet missed guard mounting Now her absence was significant In the very eyes of the little party hastening toward him three young girls and a brace of subalterns he read question and cross question and was thankful to see Hay the trader trudging up the walk to join him So seldom did the old frontiersman enter the quadrangle that people remarked upon his coming remarked still more when Webb hurried down to meet him You re right about the horses major said Hay mopping a moist and troubled face with a big bandana My racer and my best single footer Dan were out last night Dan s saddle cloth was wet and so was Harney s Some one outside has got false keys I ll put new padlocks on at once but for the life of me I can t think who would play me such a trick To steal the horses run em off to Rawlins or up the Sweetwater or off to the Hills I could understand that but to borrow them for an hour or two why it beats me hollow And Hay in deep perplexity leaned against the low fence and almost imploringly gazed into the major s face They all leaned on Webb Any idea who they were asked the commander Not the skin of a shadow cept that one man rode shorter stirrups n I do They forgot to set em back They had my California saddle on Dan and that light Whitman of mine on Harney Sure it was two men queried Webb looking straight into the trader s eyes What else could it be demanded Hay in no little excitement Well I thought possibly Miss Flower might have been moved to take a moonlight ride No reason why she shouldn t you know and not wishing to disturb you Then she would have used her own side saddle What s she doing with a man s Besides she d have told me Oh You ve seen her then this morning I thought perhaps she wasn t up hazarded Webb Up Why hang it she was up at daybreak up hours ago my wife says Haven t you seen her She s over here somewhere No Webb had not seen her and together the two started in search first to the flagstaff and there at the point of bluff beyond the Rays there she stood gazing up the Platte toward the Indian village through a pair of signal glasses that weighed heavily in her daintily gloved hands Captain Tracy a bachelor assistant surgeon stood faithfully by her side listening to her lively chatter with ears that absorbed and eyes that worshipped Come away said Webb I have an order on you for Field s currency in your safe When are you going to try to get your cash to bank And Webb keenly eyed his man as he asked the question To morrow or next day sure even if I have to go part way with the stage myself When do you want this money said Hay tapping the envelope Webb had given him Well now if agreeable to you I prefer to keep such funds at the quartermaster s Oh Good morning missus Ray he cheerily called lifting his cap at sight of a young matron at an upper window Can you see them still he added for the elder of the two boys was peering through a long telescope perched on its brass tripod upon a little shelf projecting from the sill Many a time had the Rays spyglass been the last to discern some departing troop as it crossed the low divide ten miles away to the north Many a time had the first announcement of courier coming reached headquarters through Master Sandy the first born of their olive branches There were unshed tears in the gentle voice that answered There was wordless anxiety in the sweet pallid face that smiled so bravely through its sorrow The troop passed out of sight quarter of an hour ago major said missus Ray But Sandy could see the flankers on their left until within the last five minutes Way out on their left major interposed that young gentleman big with importance If old Stabber tries any of his tricks with that troop he ll he ll get his belly full and Master Sandy plainly intimated both in tone and manner not to mention the vernacular of the soldier that Stabber might take liberties with any other troop or company at the post but would best beware of Daddy s And yet not three months agone he had stoutly taken up the cudgels for the Frayne garrison as a whole against the field the wordy battle with the son and heir of the colonel commanding at Laramie culminating in a combat only terminated by the joint efforts of the stable sergeant and sentry for both youngsters were game as their sires What Sandy Ray was now praying to see was an attack by Stabber s band upon the isolated troop but Stabber it may be said knew a trick worth ten of that There was no sense in pitching into the sorrel troop on even terms when by waiting another day perhaps and the answer of Lame Wolf to the appeal of his speedy messenger he might outnumber and overwhelm them with five to one We should be hearing from Omaha and Laramie by ten o clock missus Ray said the major reassuringly and I will send you word at once And of course Corporal Ray he continued and now with martial formality addressing the lad at the telescope I can rely upon you to report at once in case you see anything suspicious toward the Big Horn Yes sir answered the boy straightening up to attention Then scrupulously exchanging salutes the old soldier and the young parted company and the major returned to receive the reports of the old and new officers of the day These gentlemen were still with him Captain Chew of the Infantry and the senior first lieutenant for duty with the th when Hay came hurrying up the board walk from the direction of the store For reasons of his own Webb had sent his orderly to the guard house to say to the officers in question that he would await them at his quarters instead of the little building known as the adjutant s office in which were the offices of the commander the record room in which were placed the desks of the sergeant major and his three clerks and the sleeping rooms of the special duty soldiers It had happened more than once in the past that garrison stories of matters not supposed to be known outside the office had been traced back to that desk room and now Webb s questions of his old officer of the day and his instructions to the new were not things he cared to have bruited about the post He was listening intently to the captain s report of the sentries observations during the night gone by when Hay reached the gate and stopped not wishing to intrude at such a moment Come in mister Hay said the commander cordially This all will interest you and thus bidden the trader joined the soldiers three on the veranda and some of the young people of the garrison setting up their croquet arches on the parade looked curiously toward the group and wondered what should keep the old officer of the day so long Sauntering down the walk smiling radiantly upon the occupants of the various verandas that she passed then beaming between times into the face of her smitten escort her black eyes and white teeth flashing in the rare sunshine Nanette Flower was gradually nearing the major s quarters She was barely twenty yards away when in obedience to some word of the major mister Hay held forth two white packages that even at the distance could be recognized so far as the outer covering was concerned as official envelopes She was too far away perhaps to hear what was said It seems began Webb to his officers as he mechanically opened the first packet that Field took fire at Wilkins s growls about the bother of keeping his funds so the youngster stowed his money with Hay He insisted on turning over everything before he left so I receipted to him Let s see he continued glancing at the memorandum in his hand Three hundred and seventy two dollars and eighty five cents post fund and four hundred belonging to various enlisted men I may as well count it in your presence By this time the long lean fingers had ripped open the package marked four hundred and were extracting the contents a sheet of official paper with figures and memoranda and then a flat package apparently of currency Topmost was a five dollar treasury note bottom most another of the same denomination Between them deftly cut trimmed and sized were blank slips of paper to the number of perhaps thirty and the value of not one cent With paling faces the officers watched the trembling fingers slash open the second its flap as was that of the first envelope securely gummed not sealed A nickel or two and a few dimes slid out before the packet came It was of like consistency with the first and of about the same value Webb lifted up his eyes and looked straight into the amazed almost livid face of the trader My God Major Webb cried Hay aghast and bewildered Don t look at me like that No man on earth has ever accused me of a crime This means that not only my stable but my safe has been robbed and there is a traitor within my gates doctor Tracy absorbed in contemplation of Miss Flower s radiant face and in the effort to make his own words eloquent had no ears for those of others He never heeded the trader s excited outburst He only saw her suddenly flinch suddenly pale then sway His ready arm was round her in a twinkling In a twinkling she twisted free from the undesired clasp Just my foot turned a pebble she gasped But when all assiduity Tracy would have seated her on the horseblock and examined the delicate ankle she refused straightway and with almost savage emphasis and with rigid lips from which all loveliness had fled bade him lead on home where despite protest and appeal personal and professional she dismissed him curtly CHAPTER VI FIRST SIGHT OF THE FOE Ray s gallant half hundred as has been said took the route for the north at break of day Before them spread the open prairie apparently level and unbroken for full five miles to the front and either flank the distant slopes and ridges bounding the level expanse growing more distinct with every moment and presently lighting up in exulting radiance in response to the rosy blushes of the eastward sky Scorning the dusty stage road the troop commander pointed to a distant height just visible against the northward horizon bade the leading guide march straight on that then gave the order Right by Twos that he might the more readily note the gait and condition of every horse and the bearing and equipment of his rider There was still time to weed out weaklings of either class should any such there be Riding slowly along the left flank one after another he carefully scanned every man and mount in his little detachment then at quicker pace passed around to the eastward side of the column and as critically carefully studied them from that point of view A light of quiet satisfaction shone in his fine dark eyes as he finished for next to his wife and children that troop was Ray s supreme delight The preliminary look over by lantern light had been all sufficient This later inspection on the move revealed not a steed amiss not an item of equipment either misplaced or lacking Steady as planets barring the irrepressible tendency of some young high spirited horse to dance a bit until quieted by the monotony of the succeeding miles at quick light hoofed walk the sorrels tripped easily along in precise yet companionable couples One yard from head to croup said the drill book of the day and but for that the riders might have dropped their reins upon the pommel as practically unnecessary But for the first hour or so at least the tendency toward the rear of column was ever to crowd upon the file leaders a proceeding resented not infrequently in less disciplined commands than Ray s by well delivered kicks or at least such signs of equine disapprobation as switching tail or set back ears But Ray s troop horses moved like so many machines so constant and systematic had been their drill and Ray s men rode in the perfection of uniform so far as armament and equipment were concerned Each greatcoat precisely rolled was strapped with its encircling poncho at the pommel Each blanket as snugly packed with the sidelines festooned upon the top was strapped at the cantle Lariat and picket pin coiled and secured hung from the near side of the pommel The canteen suspended from its snap hook hung at the off side Saddle bags with extra horse shoes nails socks underwear brushes and comb extra packages of carbine and revolver cartridges and minor impedimenta equally distributed as to weight swung from the cantle and underneath the blanket roll From the broad black leather carbine sling over each trooper s left shoulder the hard shooting brown barrelled little Springfield hung suspended its muzzle thrust as was the fashion of the day into the crude socket imposed so long upon our frontier fighters by officials who had never seen the West save as did a certain writer of renown from a car window thereby limiting their horizon Ray despised that socket as he did the Shoemaker bit but believed with President Grant that the best means to end obnoxious laws was their rigorous enforcement Each man s revolver a trusty brown Colt hung in its holster at the right hip Each man was girt with ammunition belt of webbing the device of an old time Yankee cavalryman that has been copied round the world the dull hued copper cartridges bristling from every loop Each man wore as was prescribed the heavy cumbrous cavalry boot of the day and generation but had stowed in his saddle bags light moccasins and leggings with which to replace them when farther afield their clear headed commander should give the word Each man too wore the gauntlets of Indian tanned buckskin a special pattern that Ray had been permitted to use experimentally Each man was clad in dark blue flannel shirt and blouse the latter soon probably to be stored with the big weighty boots in Truscott s saddle room at Beecher with probably too many of the light blue riding breeches saddle pieced with canvas the uniform at the start destined in the case of veteran troopers at least to be shed in favor of brown duck hunting trousers or even among certain extremists fringed beaded and embroidered buckskin than which the present chronicler knows no more uncomfortable garb when soaked by pelting rains or immersion in some icy mountain stream Even the brown campaign hats uniformly creased as the fifty left the ford would soon be knocked out of all semblance to the prescribed shape and made at once comfortable and serviceable Add to these items the well filled haversack and battered tin quart cup for on a forced march of two or three days Captain Ray would have no pack mules and the personal equipment of his men was complete As for the mounts each sorrel tripped easily along under the sextuple folds of the saddle blanket and the black skinned McClellan saddle tree with its broad horsehair cincha and hooded wooden stirrups minus the useless skirts and sweat leathers Neither breast strap crupper nor martingale hampered the free movements of the sturdy stocky little weight carriers The black single reined curb bridle fastened as to the throat latch by a light buckle was slipped on over the headstall of the so called watering bridle whose toggled and detachable snaffle bit was generally toted from start to finish of a field scout in the saddle bags a twist of the flexible lariat Indian fashion between the complaisant jaws of his pet being the troop s ready substitute Add to this that full free and unmutilated in glossy waves the beautiful manes and tails tossed in the upland breeze for the heresies of Anglomania never took root in the American cavalry and you have Ray s famous troop as it looked fresh started from old Fort Frayne this glorious autumn morning of one hundred eighty eight and with a nod of approbation and It couldn t be better sergeant to his devoted right hand man the veteran senior non commissioned officer of the troop Ray rang out the command At ease and placed himself beside the silent young lieutenant at the head of column Illustration RAY S TROOP As has been said Ray s senior subaltern was on detached service His junior mister Clayton had joined but the year before and this threw mister Field in command of the leading platoon and to the side of the leading guide Now as the senior officer took the head of column and mister Clayton fell back to the rear the silence of the first mile of march was broken and though sitting erect in saddle and forbidden to lounge or slouch the troop began its morning interchange of chaff and comment Every mother s son of them rejoiced to be once more afield with a chance of stirring work ahead It s time to throw out our advance Field said Ray in kindly cordial tone as he scanned the low divide still some miles ahead and reined in beside the stern faced young soldier Send Sergeant Scott forward with three men and the same number on each flank corporals in charge He had more than liked Webb s adjutant He had been his stanchest friend and supporter among the troop and company commanders and was eager to befriend him now He had expressed no wish to have him sent on the hurried move but well he knew the post commander s reasons and approved his course Still now that Field was being removed for the time at least from the possibility of an entangling alliance that might prove disastrous in every way in his power Ray meant to show the mortified indeed sorely angered officer that his personal regard for him had suffered no change whatever If he could succeed in winning Field s confidence it might well be that he could bring him to see that there were good and sufficient grounds for the post commander s action that for Field s own good in fact it was a most desirable move The soul of loyalty and square dealing himself Ray had never for a moment dreamed that anything other than a foolish escapade had occurred a ride by moonlight perhaps demanded of her devotee by a thoughtless thoroughbred coquette whose influence over the young fellow was beginning to mar his usefulness if not indeed his future prospects Just what to think of Nanette Flower Ray really did not know Marion his beloved better half was his unquestioned authority in all such matters and it was an uncommon tenet of that young matron never to condemn until she had cause Instinctively she shrank from what she had seen of Miss Flower even though her woman s eye rejoiced in the elegance of Miss Flower s abundant toilets and conscious of her intuitive aversion she would utter no word that might later prove unjust Oddly enough that instinctive aversion was shared by her closest friend and neighbor missus Blake but as yet the extent of their condemnation had found vent only in the half whimsical half petulant expression on part of the younger lady Blake s beautiful wife I wish her name weren t so near like mine for Nan had been her pet name almost from babyhood Vaguely conscious were they both these lords of creation Messrs Blake and Ray that the ladies of their love did not approve of Miss Flower but Ray had ridden forth without ever asking or knowing why and so unknowing was ill prepared to grapple with the problem set before him It is easier to stem a torrent with a shingle than convince a lover that his idol is a shrew Without a word of reply Field reined out of column glanced along the double file of his platoon nodded a signal Fall out to Sergeant Scott and the men nearest him at the front merely said Advance guard and then proceeded to choose his corporals and men for flankers No need to tell Scott what to do He had been leading scouts in Arizona long ere Field had even dreamed of West Point In five minutes riding at easy lope carbines advanced three little parties of four troopers each were spreading far out to the front and flank guarding the little column against the possibility of sudden assault from hidden foe Here upon the level prairie one would think such precaution needless but every acre of the surface was seamed and gullied by twisting little water courses dry as a chip at the moment and some of them so deep as to afford cover even for the biggest pony of the wild warriors of the plains Then to the front the barrier ridges streaked with deep winding ravines were now billowing against the northward sky and once among those tangled land waves no chances could be taken now that it was known that the Sioux had declared for war and that Stabber s band was out to join their red brethren in the oft recurring outbreak Until their lands were criss crossed by the railways and their mountain haunts re echoed to the scream of the iron horse next to nothing would start an Indian war it took so long to reach the scene with troops in sufficient numbers to command their respect And at this moment the situation was grave in the extreme There had been bad blood and frequent collision between the cattlemen herders hustlers especially hustlers and the hunting parties of the Sioux and the Northern Cheyenne who clung to the Big Horn Range and the superb surrounding country with almost passionate love and with jealous tenacity There had been aggression on both sides then bloodshed then attempts on part of frontier sheriffs to arrest accused or suspected red men and equally determined and banded effort to prevent arrest of accused and identified whites By due process of law as administered in the days whereof we write the Indian was pretty sure to get the worst of every difference and therefore preferred not unnaturally his own time honored methods of settlement In accordance therewith had they scalped the sheriff s posse that had shot two of their young braves who had availed themselves of a purposely given chance to escape and then in their undiscriminating zeal the Sioux had opened fire from ambush on Plodder s hunting parties and the choppers at the wood camp who defended themselves as best they could to the end that more men red and white were killed The Indians rallied in force and closed in about Fort Beecher driving the survivors to shelter within its guarded lines and then when Plodder needed every man of his force to keep the foe at respectful distance so that his bullets could not reach the quarters occupied by the women and children at the post there reached him by night a runner from the stage station far over to the southeast on a dry fork of the Powder saying that the north and south bound stages had taken refuge there with only ten men all told to stand off some fifty warriors and therefore imploring assistance Not daring to send a troop Plodder called for volunteers to bear despatches to Major Webb at Frayne and Pat Kennedy with half a dozen brave lads had promptly stepped forward Kennedy had managed to slip through the encircling Sioux by night and to reach Fort Frayne after a daring and almost desperate ride Then Ray was ordered forth first to raise the siege at the stage station then either to hold that important relay ranch or go on to reinforce Plodder as his judgment and the situation might dictate He knew enough of the stout adobe walls of the corral on the Dry Fork and of the grit of the few defenders to feel reasonably sure that with ammunition provisions and water in plenty they could easily hold out a week if need be against the Sioux so long as they fought on the defensive and the Indians were not strongly reinforced He reasoned that Stabber and his people were probably gone to strengthen the attack and that having an hour s start at least and riding faster they would get there somewhat ahead of him But one of his own old sergeants a veteran of twenty years in the cavalry was now stationmaster on the Dry Fork and all the Sioux from the Platte to Paradise couldn t stampede old Jim Kelly Many a forced march had Ray made in the past and well he knew that the surest way to bring his horses into action strong and sound at the finish was to move slow and steady at the start to move at the walk until the horses were calm and quiet was his rule Then on this bright September day would come the alternating trot and lope with brief halts to reset saddles then later still the call upon his willing men and mounts for sustained effort and by sunset he and they could count on riding in triumphant to the rescue even though Stabber himself should seek to bar the way And that Stabber meant to watch the road if not to block it became evident before the head of column began the gradual ascent of Moccasin Ridge from whose sharp crest the little band could take their last look for the time at least at the distant walls of Frayne Somewhere toward seven thirty Corporal Connors foremost man far out on the left flank riding suddenly over a low divide caught sight of a bonneted warrior bending flat over his excited pony and lashing that nimble fleet footed creature to mad gallop in the effort to reach the cover of the projecting point of bluff across the shallow ravine that cut in toward the foothills Stone the trooper lifted his campaign hat on high once and then lowered his arm to the horizontal hat in hand pointing in the direction the darting savage was seen and thus without a syllable having been spoken at the front word was passed in to Ray that one Indian had been sighted far out to the northwest They may try to hold us among the breaks of the Mini Pusa said he to his still unreconciled second in command Field had been civil respectful but utterly uncommunicative in his replies to the captain s repeated cordialities Any attempt to even remotely refer to the causes that led to his being ordered out with the detachment had been met with chilling silence Now however the foe had been seen and could be counted on to resist if his rallied force much exceeded that of the troop or to annoy it by long range fire if too weak to risk other encounter The command halted one moment at the crest to take one long lingering look at the now far distant post beyond the Platte then swinging again into saddle moved briskly down into the long wide hollow between them and the next divide well nigh three miles across and as they reached the low ground and traversed its little draining gully a muttered exclamation Look there from the lips of the first sergeant called their attention again to the far left front Stone the trooper who had reported the first Indian had turned his horse over to the second man as had the corporal on that flank and together they were crouching up along the eastward face of a billowing hillock while straight to the front Sergeant Scott obedient to a signal from his left hand man was speeding diagonally along the rise to the north for all three advance troopers had halted and two were cautiously dismounting Ray watched one moment with kindling eyes then turned to his young chief of platoons Take your men Field and be ready to support There s something behind that second ridge CHAPTER VII BLOOD WILL TELL As Webb had predicted even before nine o clock came prompt spirited response from Laramie where the colonel had ordered the four troops to prepare for instant march and had bidden the infantry to be ready for any duty the general might order 
2397_162238_000005_000001	train-clean-360	From Omaha department headquarters almost on the heels of the Laramie wire came cheery word from their gallant chief Coming to join you noon train to day Cheyenne one thirty to morrow 
none	none	Your action in sending Ray s troop approved Hold others in readiness to move at a moment s notice Wire further news North Platte Sidney or Cheyenne to meet me So the note of preparation was joyous throughout the barracks on the eastward side and mournful among the married quarters elsewhere But even through the blinding tears with which so many loving women wrought packing the field and mess kits of soldier husbands whose duties kept them with their men at barracks or stables there were some at least who were quick to see that matters of unusual moment called certain of the major s stanchest henchmen to the office and that grave and earnest consultation was being held from which men came with sombre faces and close sealed lips First to note these indications was the indomitable helpmate of old Wilkins the post quartermaster She had no dread on his account for rheumatism and routine duties as the official in charge of Uncle Sam s huge stack of stores and supplies exempted her liege from duty in the field and even while lending a helping hand where some young wife and mother seemed dazed and broken by the sudden call to arms she kept eyes and ears alert as ever and was speedily confiding to first one household then another her conviction that there was a big sensation bundled up in the bosom of the post commander and his cronies and she knew she said it was something about Field Everybody of course was aware by eight o clock that Field had gone with Ray and while no officer presumed to ask if it was because Ray or Field had applied for the detail no woman would have been restrained therefrom by any fear of Webb Well he realized this fact and dodging the first that sought to waylay him on the walk he had later intrenched himself as it were in his office where Dade Blake and the old post surgeon had sat with him in solemn conclave while Bill Hay brought his clerk bar keeper store keeper Pete the general utility man and even Crapaud the halfbreed to swear in succession they had no idea who could have tampered with either the safe or the stables Closely had they been cross examined and going away in turn they told of the nature of the cross examination yet to no one of their number had been made known what had occurred to cause such close questioning Hay had been forbidden to speak of it even to his household The officers of the day were sworn to secrecy Neither Wilkins nor the acting adjutant was closeted with the council and neither therefore could do more than guess at the facts Yet that somebody knew in part at least the trend of suspicion was at once apparent to Webb and his councilors when about nine o clock he took Blake and Dade to see those significant bar shoe hoof prints Every one of them had disappeared By Jove said Webb I know now I should have set a sentry with orders to let no man walk or ride about here See He s used his foot to smear this and this and here again There in a dozen places were signs old Indian trailers read as they would read an open book Places where pivoting on the heel a heavy foot had crushed right and left into the yielding soil of the roadway making concentric circular grooves and ridges of sandy earth where earlier in the morning Dan s and Harney s dainty hoof prints were the only new impressions For nearly fifty yards had this obliterating process been carried on and in a dozen spots until the road dipped over the rounding edge and hard and firm now went winding down to the flats Here Webb with Dade and Hay returned while Blake meandered on musing over what he had been told It s a government heel not a cowboy s had Hay said hopefully of the print of that pivoting lump of leather That gives no clue to the wearer answered Blake Our men often sell their new boots or give their old ones to these hangers on about the post So far as I m concerned the care with which the print has been erased is proof to me that the major saw just what he said Somebody about Hay s place was mighty anxious to cover his tracks But a dozen somebodies besides the stablemen hung there at all hours of the day infesting the broad veranda the barroom and stores striving to barter the skin of coyote skunk or beaver or when they had nothing to sell pleading for an unearned drink Half a dozen of these furtive beetle browed swarthy sons of the prairie lounged there now as the elder officers and the trader returned while Blake went on his way exploring With downcast eyes he followed the road to and across a sandy watercourse in the low ground and there in two or three places found the fresh imprint of that same bar shoe just as described by Webb Then with long swift strides he came stalking up the hill again passing the watchful eyes about the corral without a stop and only checking speed as he neared the homestead of the Hays where once again he became engrossed in studying the road and the hard pathways at the side Something that he saw or fancied that he saw perhaps a dozen yards from the trader s gate induced him to stop scrutinize turn and with searching eyes to cross diagonally the road in the direction of the stables then again to retrace his steps and return to the eastward side Just as he concluded his search and once more went briskly on his way a blithe voice hailed him from an upper window and the radiant face and gleaming white teeth of Nanette Flower appeared between the opening blinds One might have said he expected both the sight and question
2397_162238_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Lost anything Captain Blake 
none	none	Nothing but a little time Miss Flower was the prompt reply as without a pause the tall captain raising his forage cap pushed swiftly on
2397_162238_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 But I ve found something muttered he to himself between his set teeth and within five minutes more was again closeted with the post commander 
none	none	You saw it asked Webb Yes Three or four places down in the arroyo More than that Where s Hay he broke off suddenly for voices were sounding in the adjoining room Here with Dade and the doctor Then But Blake got no further Breathless and eager little Sandy Ray came bounding through the hallway into the presence of the officers He could hardly gasp his news
2397_162238_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Major you told me to keep watch and let you know 
2397_162238_000017_000001	train-clean-360	There s a courier coming hard 
2397_162238_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Mother saw him too through the spyglass 
none	none	She says they see him too at Stabber s and she s afraid
2397_162238_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Right cried Webb 
none	none	Quick Blake rush out half a dozen men to meet him 
2397_162238_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Those devils may indeed cut him off 
none	none	Thank you my little man he added bending down and patting the dark curly head as Blake went bounding away Thank you Sandy I ll come at once to the bluff We ll save him Never you fear In less than no time one might say all Fort Frayne seemed hurrying to the northward bluff The sight of tall Captain Blake bounding like a greyhound toward his troop barracks and shouting for his first sergeant of Major Webb almost running across the parade toward the flagstaff of Sandy rushing back to his post at the telescope of the adjutant and officer of the day tearing away toward the stables where many of the men were now at work were signs that told unerringly of something stirring probably across the Platte As luck would have it in anticipation of orders to move the troop horses had not been sent out to graze and were still in the sunshiny corrals and long before the news was fully voiced through officers row Blake and six of his men were in saddle and darting away for the ford carbines advanced the instant they struck the opposite bank From the bluff Webb had shouted his instructions We could see him a moment ago for half a dozen field glasses were already brought to bear six miles out far east of the road Feel well out to your left to head off any of Stabber s people Three of them have been seen galloping out already Aye aye sir came the answering shout as Blake whirled and tore away after his men There had been a time in his distant past when the navy not the army was his ambition and he still retained some of the ways of the sea Just as Webb feared some few of Stabber s young warriors had been left behind and their eagle eyed lookout had sighted the far distant courier almost as soon as Sandy s famous telescope Now they were hastening to head him off But he seemed to have totally vanished Level as appeared the northward prairie from the commanding height on which stood the throng of eager watchers it was in reality a low rolling surface like some lazily heaving sea that had become suddenly solidified Long broad shallow dips or basins lay between broad wide far extending yet slight upheavals Through the shallows turned and twisted dozens of dry arroyos all gradually trending toward the Platte the drainage system of the frontier Five miles out began the ascent to the taller divides and ridges that gradually and with many an intervening dip rose to the watershed between the Platte and the score of tiny tributaries that united to form the South Cheyenne It was over Moccasin or Ten Mile Ridge as it was often called and close to the now abandoned stage road Ray s daring little command had disappeared from view toward eight o clock It was at least two possibly three miles east of the stage road that the solitary courier had first been sighted and when later seen by the major and certain others of the swift gathering spectators he was heading for Frayne though still far east of the highroad And now missus Ray on the north piazza with Webb by her side and Nannie Blake missus Dade and Esther in close attendance was briefly telling the major what she had seen up stream One glance through Sandy s glass had told her the little fellow had not watched in vain Then with the ready binocular she had turned to the Indian encampment up the Platte and almost instantly saw signs of commotion squaws and children running about ponies running away and Indian boys pursuing Then one after another three Indians warriors presumably had lashed away northward and she had sent Sandy on the run to tell the major even while keeping watch on this threatening three until they shot behind a long low ridge that stretched southward from the foothills Beyond doubt they were off in hopes of bagging that solitary horseman speeding with warning of some kind for the shelter of Fort Frayne By this time there must have been nearly two hundred men women and children lining the crest of the bluff and speaking in low tense voices when they spoke at all and straining their eyes for the next sight of the coming courier or the swift dash of the intercepting Sioux Well out now and riding at the gallop Blake and his half dozen widely separating so as to cover much of the ground were still in view and Dade and his officers breathed more freely See what a distance those beggars of Stabber s will have to ride said the veteran captain to the little group about him They dare not cross that ridge short of three miles out It s my belief they ll see Blake and never cross at all Then up rose a sudden shout There he is There he comes See See and fifty hands pointed eagerly northeastward where a little black dot had suddenly popped into view out of some friendly winding watercourse four miles still away at least count and far to the right and front of Blake s easternmost trooper Every glass was instantly brought to bear upon the swiftly coming rider Sandy s shrill young voice ringing out from the upper window It isn t one of papa s men His horse is a gray Who then could it be and what could it mean this coming of a strange courier from a direction so far to the east of the travelled road Another moment and up rose another shout Look There they are Sioux for certain And from behind a little knob or knoll on the meridian ridge three other black dots had swept into view and were shooting eastward down the gradual slope Another moment and they were swallowed up behind still another low divide but in that moment they had seen and been seen by the westernmost of Blake s men and now one after another as the signals swept from the left the seven swerved Their line of direction had been west of north Now riding like mad they veered to the northeast and a grand race was on between the hidden three and the would be rescuers all heading for that part of the low rolling prairie where the lone courier might next be expected to come into view friends and foes alike unconscious of the fact that following one of those crooked arroyos with its stiff and precipitous banks he had been turned from his true course full three quarters of a mile and now with a longer run but a clear field ahead was steering straight for Frayne Thus the interest of the on lookers at the bluff became divided Women with straining eyes gazed at the lonely courier and then fearfully scanned the ridge line between him and the northward sky praying with white lips for his safety dreading with sinking hearts that at any moment those savage riders should come darting over the divide and swooping down upon their helpless prey Men with eyes that snapped and fists that clinched or fingers that seemed twitching with mad desire to clasp pistol butt or sabre hilt or loud barking carbine ran in sheer nervous frenzy up and down the bluffs staring only at Blake s far distant riders swinging their hats and waving them on praying only for another sight of the Sioux in front of the envied seven and craving with all their soldier hearts to share in the fight almost sure to follow On the Rays piazza with pallid face and quivering lips Esther Dade clung to her mother s side missus Ray had encircled with her arm the slender waist of Nannie Blake whose eyes never for an instant quit their gaze after the swift speeding dots across the distant prairie All her world was there in one tall vehement horseman Other troopers mounting at the stables had spurred away under Captain Gregg and were splashing through the ford Other denizens of Fort Frayne hearing of the excitement came hurrying to the bluff hangers on from the trader s store and corral the shopman himself even the bar keeper in his white jacket and apron two or three panting low muttering halfbreeds their eyes aflame their teeth gleaming in their excitement then Hay himself and with him her dark face almost livid her hair disordered and lips rigid and almost purple with deep lines at the corners of her mouth Nanette Flower Who that saw could ever forget her as she forced her way through the crowd and stood at the very brink saying never a word but swiftly focussing her ready glasses Hardly had she reached the spot when wild sudden exultant a cheer burst fiercely from the lips of the throng Look Look By God they ve got em yelled man after man in mad excitement Three black dots had suddenly swept into view well to the right of Blake s men and came whirling down grade straight for the lone courier on the gray Theirs had been the short side ours the long diagonal of the race 
2397_162238_000027_000013	train-clean-360	Theirs was the race perhaps but not the prize for he had turned up far from the expected point 
none	none	Still they had him if only if only those infernal troopers failed to see them There was their hope Plainly in view of the high bluff at the fort they were yet hidden by a wave of the prairie from sight of the interceptors still heading for the ridge the warriors had just left behind 
2397_162238_000027_000017	train-clean-360	Only for a second or two however 
none	none	A yell of fierce rejoicing went up from the crowd on the bluff as the easternmost of Blake s black specks was seen suddenly to check then to launch out again no longer to the north but straight to his right followed almost immediately by every one of the seven Then too swerved the would be slayers in long graceful circles away from the wrath to come And while the unconscious courier still rode steadily loping toward the desired refuge away for the breaks and ravines of the Sleeping Bear lashed the thwarted Sioux away in hopeless stern chase spurred the pursuers and while women sobbed and laughed and screamed and men danced and shouted and swore with delight one dark face livid fearsome turned back from the bluff and doctor Tracy hastening to the side of his enchantress caught in amaze these words almost hissed between set and grinding teeth Seven to three Shame CHAPTER VIII MORE STRANGE DISCOVERIES But Frayne was far from done with excitement for the day For a while all eyes seemed centred on the chase now scattered miles toward the east and save for two of the number left behind blown spent and hopelessly out of the race soon lost to view among the distant swales and ravines Then everyone turned to welcome the coming harbinger to congratulate him on his escape to demand the reason for his daring essay Gregg and his men were first to reach him and while one of them was seen through the levelled glasses to dismount and give the courier his fresh horse thereby showing that the gray was well nigh exhausted the whole party turned slowly toward the post Then one of their number suddenly darted forth from the group and came spurring at top speed straight for the ford
2397_162239_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 That means news of importance said Webb at the instant 
none	none	And Gregg and all of his squad are coming in not following Blake That means he and they are more needed elsewhere Come on mister Ross We ll go down and meet that fellow Orderly have my horse sent to the ford So followed by three or four of the younger officers the married men being restrained as a rule by protesting voices close at hand the commanding officer went slipping and sliding down a narrow winding pathway a mere goat track many of the soldiers following at respectful distance while all the rest of the gathered throng remained at the crest eagerly almost breathlessly awaiting the result They saw the trooper come speeding in across the flats from the northeast saw as he reached the bench that he was spurring hard heard even at the distance the swift batter of hoofs upon the resounding sod could almost hear the fierce panting of the racing steed saw horse and rider come plunging down the bank and into the stream and shoving breast deep through the foaming waters then issue dripping on the hither shore where turning loose his horse the soldier leaped from saddle and saluted his commander But only those about the major heard the stirring message Captain Gregg s compliments sir It s Rudge from the Dry Fork Sergeant Kelly feared that Kennedy hadn t got through for most of Lame Wolf s people pulled away from the Fork yesterday morning coming this way and the sergeant thought it was to unite with Stabber to surround any small command that might be sent ahead from here Rudge was ordered to make a wide sweep to the east so as to get around them and that s what took him so long He left not two hours after Kennedy Illustration THE SOLDIER LEAPED FROM HIS SADDLE In spite of his years of frontier service and training in self control Webb felt and others saw that his face was paling Ray with only fifty men at his back was now out of sight out of reach of the post and probably face to face with if not already surrounded by the combined forces of the Sioux Not a second did he hesitate Among the swarm that had followed him was a young trumpeter of K Troop reckless of the fact that he should be at barracks packing his kit As luck would have it there at his back hung the brazen clarion held by its yellow braid and cord Boots and Saddles Kerry Quick ordered the major and as the ringing notes re echoed from bluff and building wall and came laughing back from the distant crags at the south the little throng at the bank and the crowd at the point of the bluff had scattered like startled coveys the men full run for the barracks and stables never stopping to reason why Nearly half an hour later gray haired Captain Dade stood at the point of bluff near the flagstaff Esther pale and tearful by his side waving adieu and Godspeed to Webb who had halted in saddle on reaching the opposite bank and was watching his little column through the ford three stanch troops each about sixty strong reinforced by half a dozen of Ray s men left behind in the forward rush at dawn but scorning disqualification of any kind now that danger menaced their beloved captain and their comrades of the sorrel troop In all the regiment no man was loved by the rank and file as was Billy Ray Brilliant soldiers gifted officers sterling men were many of his comrades but ever since he first joined the th on the heels of the civil war more than any one of its commissioned list Ray had been identified with every stirring scout and campaign fight or incident in the regimental history Truscott Blake Hunter and Gregg among the junior captains had all had their tours of detached duty instructing at West Point recruiting in the big Eastern cities serving as aide de camp to some general officer but of Ray it could be said he had hardly been east of the Missouri from the day he joined until his wedding day and only rarely and briefly since that time More than any officer had he been prominent in scout after scout Arizona Mexico Texas the Indian Territory Kansas Colorado Nebraska Wyoming the Dakotas Montana even parts of Idaho and Utah he knew as he used to know the roads and runways of the blue grass region of his native state From the British line to the Gulfs of Mexico and California he had studied the West The regiment was his home his intense pride and its men had been his comrades and brothers The veterans trusted and swore by the younger troopers looked up to and well nigh worshipped him and now as the story that the Sioux had probably surrounded the sorrel troop went like wild fire through the garrison even the sick in hospital begged to be allowed to go and one poor lad frantic through fever and enforced confinement broke from the hold of the half hearted attendant tore over to K Troop barracks demanding his kit of Sergeant Schreiber and finding the quarters deserted the men all gone to stables dared to burst into that magnate s own room in search of his arms and clothing and thereby roused a heavily sleeping soldier who damned him savagely until through wild raving he gathered that some grave danger menaced Captain Ray Even his befuddled senses could fathom that And while guards and nurses bore the patient shrieking and struggling back to hospital Kennedy soused his hot head in the cooling waters of their frontier lavatory and was off like a shot to the stables It was long before he found his horse for the guard had taken Kilmaine to F Troop s stables and Kennedy had been housed by K It was longer still before he could persuade the guard that he had a right as he put it to ride after the major Not until Captain Dade had been consulted would they let him go Not indeed until in person Kennedy had pleaded his cause with that cool headed commander Dade noted the flushed and swollen face but reasoned that nothing would more speedily shake the whiskey from his system than a long gallop in that glorious air and sunshine Major Webb is following the trail of Captain Ray said he You follow the major s You can t miss him and there are no more Indians now to interpose You should catch him by noon then give him this This was a copy of a late despatch just in from Laramie saying that the revolt had reached the Sioux at the agencies and reservations on the White Earth and would demand the attention of every man at the post No reinforcement therefore could be looked for from that quarter until the general came 
2397_162239_000010_000002	train-clean-360	It was no surprise to Dade 
none	none	It could be none to Webb for old Red Cloud had ever been an enemy even when bribed and petted and fed and coddled in his village on the Wakpa Schicha His nephew led the bolt afield No wonder the old war chief backed him with abundant food ammunition and eager warriors sent from home But it was after eleven when Kennedy drove his still wearied horse through the Platte and far to the north saw the dun dust cloud that told where Webb s little column was trotting hard to the support of the sorrels His head was aching and he missed the morning draught of soldier coffee He had eaten nothing since his cold lunch at the major s and would have been wise had he gone to Mistress McGann and begged a cup of the fragrant Java with which she had stimulated her docile master ere he rode forth but the one idea uppermost in Kennedy s muddled brain was that the sorrels were trapped by the Sioux and every trooper was needed to save them At three in the morning he felt equal to fighting the whole Sioux nation with all its dozen tribes and dialects At three thirty he had been whipped to a stand by just one of their number and Mother av Moses one that spoke English as well or as ill as any man in the th Sore in soul and body was Kennedy and sore and stiff was his gallant bay Kilmaine when these comrades of over three years service shook the spray of the Platte from their legs and started doggedly northward on the trail Northward they went for full three miles Kilmaine sulky and protesting The dust cloud was only partially visible now hidden by the ridge a few miles ahead when over that very ridge probably four miles away to the right front Kennedy saw coming at speed a single rider and reined to the northeast to meet him Blake and his men had gone far in that direction Two of their number with horses too slow for a chase after nimble ponies had as we have seen drifted back and joined unprepared though they were for the field the rear of Webb s column But now came another not aiming for Webb but heading for Frayne It meant news from the chase that might be important It would take him but little from the direct line to the north why not meet him and hear Kennedy reined to the right riding slowly now and seeking the higher level from which he could command the better view At last they neared each other the little Irish veteran sore headed and in evil mood and a big wild eyed scare faced trooper new to the frontier spurring homeward with panic in every feature but rejoicing at sight of a comrade soldier Git back git back he began to shout as soon as he got within hailing distance There s a million Indians just over the ridge They ve got the captain What captain yelled Kennedy all ablaze at the instant Spake up ye shiverin loon Blake He got way ahead of us Then it s to him you should be runnin not home ye cur Turn about now Turn about or I ll And in a fury Pat had seized the other s rein and spurring savagely at Kilmaine both horses instantly waking as though responsive to the wrath and fervor of their little master he fairly whirled the big trooper around and despite fearsome protests bore him onward toward the ridge swift questioning as they rode How came they to send a raw rookie on such a quest Why the rookie gasped in explanation that he was on stable guard and the captain took the first six men in sight How happened it that the captain got so far ahead of him There was no keepin up with the captain He was on his big raw boned race horse chasin three Indians that was firin and had hit Meisner but there was still three of the troop to follow him and the captain ordered come ahead until all of a sudden as they filed round a little knoll the three Indians they d been chasin turned about and let em have it and down went another horse and Corporal Feeney was killed sure and he the poor young rookie saw Indians in every direction comin straight at em and what else could he do but gallop for home and help All this told with much gasping on his part and heard with much blasphemy by Kennedy brought the strangely assorted pair at swift gallop over the springy turf back along the line of that panicky yet most natural retreat Twice would the big fellow have broken away and again spurred for home but the little game cock held him savagely to his work and so together at last they neared the curtaining ridge Now damn you howled Kennedy whip out your carbine and play you re a man till we see what s in front an if ye play false the first shot from this barker with a slap at the butt of his Springfield goes through your heart And this was what they saw as together they rounded the hillock and came in view of the low ground beyond Half way down the long gradual slope in a shallow little dip possibly an old buffalo wallow two or three horses were sprawled and a tiny tongue of flame and blue smoke spitting from over the broad brown backs told that someone at least was on the alert and defensive Out on the prairie three hundred yards beyond a spotted Indian pony heels up was rolling on the turf evidently sorely wounded Behind this rolling parapet crouched a feathered warrior and farther still away sweeping and circling on their mettlesome steeds three more savage braves were darting at speed Already they had sighted the coming reinforcements and while two seemed frantically signalling toward the northwest the third whirled his horse and sped madly away in that direction
2397_162239_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Millions be damned yelled Kennedy 
none	none	There s only three 
2397_162239_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Come on ye scut And down they went full tilt at the Sioux yet heading to cover and reach the beleaguered party in the hollow 
none	none	Someone of the besieged waved a hat on high Two more carbines barked their defiance at the feathered foe and then came a pretty exhibit of savage daring and devotion Disdainful of the coming troopers and of the swift fire now blazing at them from the pit the two mounted warriors lashed their ponies to mad gallop and bore down straight for their imperilled brother crouching behind the stricken pinto Never swerving never halting hardly checking speed but bending low over and behind their chargers necks the two young braves swept onward and with wild whoop of triumph challenge and hatred gathered up and slung behind the rider of the heavier pony the agile and bedizened form on the turf then circled away defiant taunting gleeful yes and even more With raging eyes Kennedy sprang from saddle and kneeling drove shot after shot at the scurrying pair Two of the three troopers at the hollow followed suit Even the big blubbering lad so lately crazed with fear unslung his weapon and fired thrice into empty space and a shout of wrath and renewed challenge to come back and fight it out rang out after the Sioux for to the amaze of the lately besieged to the impotent fury of the Irishman in unmistakable yet mostly unquotable English the crippled warrior was yelling mingled threat and imprecation Who was it Kennedy and where did you ever see him before a moment later demanded Captain Blake almost before he could grasp the Irishman s hands and shower his thanks and even while stanching the flow of blood from a furrow along his sun burnt cheek What s that he said about eating your heart And Kennedy his head cleared now through the rapture of battle minded him of his promise to Field and lied like a hero Sure how should I know him sorr They re all of the same spit But he called you by name 
2397_162239_000023_000001	train-clean-360	I heard him plainly 
none	none	So did Meisner here protested Blake Hello what have you there corporal he added as young Feeney the surely killed came running back bearing in his hand a gaily ornamented pouch of buckskin with long fringes and heavy crusting of brilliant beads
2397_162239_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Picked it up by that pony yonder sir answered the corporal with a salute 
none	none	Beg pardon sir but will the captain take my horse His is hit too bad to carry him 
2397_162239_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Two indeed of Blake s horses were crippled and it was high time to be going 
none	none	Mechanically he took the pouch and tied it to his waist belt Thank God no man is hurt he said But now back to Frayne Watch those ridges and be ready if a feather shows and spread out a little Don t ride in a bunch But there was bigger game miles to the west demanding all the attention of the gathered Sioux There were none to spare to send so far and though three warriors one of them raging and clamoring for further attempt despite his wounds hovered about the retiring party Blake and his fellows within another hour were in sight of the sheltering walls of Frayne and after a last long range swapping of shots with Blake and Meisner footing it most of the way led their crippled mounts in safety toward that Rubicon of the West the swift flowing Platte They were still three miles out when Blake found leisure to examine the contents of that beaded pouch and the first thing drawn from its depths was about the last a Christian would think to find in the wallet of a Sioux a dainty little billet scented with wood violet an envelope of delicate texture containing a missive on paper to match and the envelope was addressed in a strange angular characteristic hand that Blake recognized at once to a man of whom by that name at least he had never heard before mister RALPH MOREAU En Ville CHAPTER IX BAD NEWS FROM THE FRONT It might well be imagined that a man returning from such a morning s work as had been Blake s could be excused from duty the rest of the day He and his little party had had a spirited running fight of several hours with an evasive and most exasperating trio of warriors better mounted for swift work than were the troopers He had managed eventually to bring down one of the Indians who lingered a little too long within short range of the carbines but it was the pony not the rider that they killed Meanwhile other Indians had appeared on distant divides and one feathered brave had galloped down to meet his comrades and fire a few shots at the pursuing pale faces But at no time until near their supports and far from the fort had the Sioux halted for a hand to hand fight and Blake s long experience on the frontier had stood him in good stead He saw they were playing for one of two results either to lure him and his fellows in the heat of pursuit far round to the northwest where were the united hundreds of Lame Wolf and Stabber stalking that bigger game or else to tempt Blake himself so far ahead of his fellows as to enable them to suddenly whirl about cut him off and three on one finish him then and there then speed away in frenzied delight possessors of a long coveted scalp They well knew Blake almost as well as they did Ray Many a year he had fought them through the summer and fed them through the winter They their squaws and pappooses had fattened on his bounty when the snows were deep and deer were gone and their abundant rations had been feasted or gambled away Many of their number liked him well but now they were at the war game again and business is business with the aborigines Blake was a big chief and he who could wear at his belt the scalp of so prominent a pale face leader would be envied among his people Long Legs as they called him however was no fool Brave and zealous as he was Blake was not rash He well knew that unless he and his few men kept together they would simply play into the hands of the Indians It would have been easy for him with his big racer to outstrip his little party and close with the Sioux Only one of the troopers had a horse that could keep pace with Pyramus but nothing he could gain by such a proceeding would warrant the desperate risk Matchless as we have reason to believe our men we cannot so believe our mounts Unmatched would better describe them Meisner s horse might have run with the captain s until crippled by the bullets of the Sioux but Bent s and Flannigan s were heavy and slow and so it resulted that the pursuit though determined was not so dangerous to the enemy but that they were able to keenly enjoy it until the swift coming of Kennedy and his captive comrade turned the odds against them for then two of Blake s horses had given out through wounds and weakness and they had the pursuers indeed in a hole That relief came none too soon Blake and his fellows had been brought to a stand but now the Sioux sped away out of range the crippled party limped slowly back to the shelter of Frayne reaching the post long hours after their spirited start only to find the women and children at least in an agony of dread and excitement and even Dade and his devoted men looking grave and disturbed Unless all indications failed Ray and his people must have been having the fight of their lives Two couriers had galloped back from Moccasin Ridge to say that Major Webb s scouts could faintly hear the sound of rapid firing far ahead and that through the glass at least a dozen dead horses or ponies could be seen scattered over the long slope to the Elk Tooth range miles further on Webb had pushed forward to Ray s support and Blake calling for fresh horses for himself and two of his men bade the latter get food and field kits and be ready to follow him Then he hastened to join his devoted young wife waiting with missus Ray upon the piazza Dade who had met him at the ford had still much to tell and even more to hear but at sight of those two pale anxious faces lifted his cap and called out cheerily I hand him over to you missus Blake and will see him later then turned and went to his own doorway and took Esther s slender form in his strong arms and kissed the white brow and strove to think of something reassuring to say and never thought to ask Blake what he had in that fine Indian tobacco pouch swinging there at his belt for which neglect the tall captain was more than grateful It was a woman s letter as we know and that he argued should be dealt with only in a woman s way Sorely puzzled as Blake had been by the discovery he had been able on the long homeward march walking until in sight of Frayne and safety then galloping ahead on the corporal s horse to think it out as he said in several ways Miss Flower had frequently ridden up the valley and visited the Indian village across the Platte Miss Flower might easily have dropped that note and some squaw picking it up had surrendered it to the first red man who demanded it such being the domestic discipline of the savage The Indian kept it as he would any other treasure trove for which he had no use in hopes of reward for its return said Blake It was queer of course that the Indian in whose pouch it was found should have been so fluent a speaker of English yet many a Sioux knew enough of our tongue to swear volubly and talk ten words of vengeance to come There were several ways as Blake reasoned by which that letter might have got into the hands of the enemy But at any rate with everything said it was a woman s letter He had no right to read it He would first confide in his wife and if she said so in missus Ray Then what they decided should decide him But now came a new problem Despite the long morning of peril and chase and excitement there was still much more ahead His men were in saddle his troop was afield the foe was in force on the road to the north the battle mayhap was on at the very moment and Frayne and home was no place for him when duty called at the distant front Only there was Nan silent tremulous to be sure and with such a world of piteous dread and pleading in her beautiful eyes It was hard to have to tell her he must go again and at once hard to have to bid her help him in his hurried preparations when she longed to throw herself in his arms and be comforted He tried to smile as he entered the gate and thereby cracked the brittle sun dried court plaster with which a sergeant had patched his cheek at the stables The would be glad some grin started the blood again and it trickled down and splashed on his breast where poor Nan longed to pillow her bonny head and the sight of it despite her years of frontier training made her sick and faint He caught her in his left arm laughing gayly and drew her to the other side Got the mate to that scoop of Billy s he cried holding forth his other hand to missus Ray Tisn t so deep perhaps but twill serve twill do and I ll crow over him to night Come in with us missus Ray I I ve something to show you One minute said that wise young matron Let me tell the children where to find me Sandy and Billy are on post at the telescope They wouldn t leave it even for luncheon With that she vanished and husband and wife were alone You must go Gerald she sobbed I know it but isn t there some way Won t Captain Dade send more men with you If he did Nan they d only hamper me with horses that drag behind Be brave little woman Webb has swept the way clear by this time Come I need your help And the door closed on the soldier and his young wife They never saw that Nanette Flower in saddle was riding swiftly up the row and for the first time since her coming to Frayne without an escort Dade reappeared upon his front gallery in time to greet her but Esther after one quick glance had darted again within Dade saw unerringly that Miss Flower was in no placid frame of mind Her cheeks were pale her mouth had that livid look that robbed her face of all beauty but her eyes were full and flashing with excitement What news captain she hailed and the joyous silvery ring had gone from her voice They tell me Captain Blake is back two horses crippled two men hit including himself His own share is a scratch he wouldn t think of mentioning outside the family Miss Flower answered Dade with grim civility He had his reasons for disapproving of the young woman yet they were not such as warranted him in showing her the least discourtesy He walked to his gate and met her at the curb beyond and stood stroking the arching neck of her spirited horse Harney again Did they were there any Indians killed she asked with anxiety scarcely veiled Oh they downed one of them answered the captain eying her closely the while and speaking with much precision a fellow who cursed them freely in fluent English Yes she was surely turning paler A bold bad customer from all accounts Blake thought he must be of Lame Wolf s fellows because he seemed to know Kennedy so well and to hate him Kennedy has only just come down from Fort Beecher where Wolf s people have been at mischief But what became of him What did they do with him interrupted the girl her lips quivering in spite of herself Oh left him I suppose answered the veteran with deliberate design What else could they do There was no time for ceremony His fellow savages you know can attend to that For a moment she sat there rigid her black eyes staring straight into the imperturbable face of the old soldier No one had ever accused Dade of cruelty or unkindness to man or woman especially to woman yet here he stood before this suffering girl and with obvious intent pictured to her mind s eye a warrior stricken and left unburied or uncared for on the field Whatever his reasons he stabbed and meant to stab and for just one moment she seemed almost to droop and reel in saddle then with splendid rally straightened up again her eyes flashing her lip curling in scorn and with one brief emphatic phrase ended the interview and whirling Harney about smote him sharply with her whip and darted away True said she Civilized warfare If that girl isn t more than half savage said Dade to himself as Harney tore away out of the garrison on the road to the ford I am more than half Sioux Oh for news of Ray Ray indeed It was now nearly four o clock Telegrams had been coming and going over the Laramie wire The Chief as they called their general with only one of his staff in attendance had reached Cheyenne on time and quitting the train declining dinner at the hotel and having but a word or two with the Platform Club the little bevy of officers from Fort Russell whose custom it was to see the westbound train through almost every day had started straightway for Laramie behind the swiftest team owned by the quartermaster s department while another in relay awaited him at the Chugwater nearly fifty miles out Driving steadily through the starlit night he should reach the old frontier fort by dawn at the latest and what news would Dade have to send him there Not a word had he uttered to either the officers who respectfully greeted or reporters who eagerly importuned him as to the situation at Frayne but men who had served with him in Arizona and on the Yellowstone many a year before knew well that grave tidings had reached him Dade had in fact supplemented Webb s parting despatch with another saying that Blake s little party returning had just been sighted through the telescope nine miles out with two men afoot But not until the general reached Lodge Pole Creek did the message meet him saying that Webb s advance guard could hear the distant attack on Ray Not until he reached the Chugwater in the early night could he hope to hear the result It was nightfall when the awful suspense of the garrison at Frayne was even measurably lifted Blake with three troopers at his back had then been gone an hour and was lost in the gloaming before doctor Tracy s orderly with a face that plainly told the nervous tension of his two hours ride left his reeking heaving horse at the stables and climbed the steep path to the flagstaff the shortest way to the quarters of the commanding officer Despite the gathering darkness he had been seen by a dozen eager watchers and was deluged with questions by trembling tearful women and by grave anxious men There s been a fight that s all I know he said I was with the pack mules and the ambulances and didn t get to see it All I saw was dead ponies way out beyond Ten Mile Ridge Where s the major I mean the captain No the orderly didn t know who was killed or wounded or that anybody was killed and wounded All he knew was that doctor Tracy came galloping back and ordered the ambulances to scoot for the front and him to spur every bit of the way back to Frayne with the note for Captain Dade All this was told as he eagerly pushed his way along the board walk soldiers wives hanging on his words and almost on him officers wives and daughters calling from the galleries or running to the gates and Dade heard the hubbub almost as quickly as did Esther who hurried to the door By the light of the hall lamp the commander read the pencilled superscription of the gummed envelope and the word Immediate at the corner The same light fell on a dozen anxious pleading faces beyond the steps His hand shook in spite of himself and he knew he could not open and read it in their presence One moment he said his heart going out to them in sympathy as well as dread You shall hear in one moment and turned aside into the little army parlor But he could not turn from his wife and child They followed and stood studying his pale face as he read the fateful words that told so little yet so much Reached Ray just in time Sharp affair doctor Waller will have to come at once as Tracy goes on with us to rescue stage people at Dry Fork Better send infantry escort and all hospital attendants that can be possibly spared also chaplain Sergeants Burroughs and Wing Corporal Foot and Troopers Denny Flood Kerrigan and Preusser killed Many wounded Lieutenant Field seriously WEBB CHAPTER X I LL NEVER GO BACK A sharp affair indeed was that of this September day a fight long talked of on the frontier if soon forgotten in the States Obedient to his orders to push to the relief of the imperilled party on the Dry Fork Ray had made good time to Moccasin Ridge even though saving horses and men for the test of the later hours Well he knew his march would be watched by some of Stabber s band but little did he dream at starting that Indian strategy would take the unusual form of dropping what promised to be a sure thing leaving the people at the stage station to the guardianship of less than a dozen braves and launching out with a big band to aid a little one in attack on one lone detachment that might not come at all But Lame Wolf reasoned that the people penned at the stage station were in no condition to attempt escape They were safe whenever he chose to return to them and Lame Wolf knew this of Stabber that he had long been a hanger on about the military reservations that he had made a study of the methods of the white chiefs that he was able to almost accurately predict what their course would be in such event as this and that Stabber had recently received accessions whose boast it was that they had information at first hand of the white chief s plans and intentions Stabber had sent swift runners to Lame Wolf urging him to bring his warriors to aid him in surrounding the first troops sent forth from Frayne Stabber had noted year after year that it was the almost invariable policy of our leaders to order a small force at the start and then when that was crushed to follow it with the big one that should have been sent in the first place Kennedy s successful coming was known to Stabber quite as soon as it was to Webb It may well be that Stabber let him through feeling confident what the result would be and then despite a certain jealousy not confined entirely to savage rival leaders Lame Wolf had confidence in Stabber s judgment Ray had expected long range flank fire and possibly occasional resistance in front but assured of Stabber s paucity in numbers and believing Lame Wolf too busy to send Stabber substantial aid he thought a sharp lesson or two would clear his front of such Indians as sought to check him and so rode serenely forward rejoicing in his mission and in his game and devoted little command Something beyond that second ridge he had said to Field in sending him forward with the bulk of the platoon and Field who had been silent and brooding woke at the summons and all animation at the scent of danger spurred swiftly ahead to join the advance and see for himself what manner of hindrance awaited them leaving the baker s dozen of his platoon to trot steadily on under lead of its sergeant while Ray with his trumpeter followed mid way between his advance and Clayton s platoon intact moving quietly at the walk and held in reserve Ordinarily Ray would himself have ridden to the far front and personally investigated the conditions but he was anxious that Field should understand he held the full confidence of his temporary commander He wished Field to realize that now he had opportunity for honorable distinction and a chance to show what was in him and having sent him forward Ray meant to rely on his reports and be ready to back if possible his dispositions Nothing so quickly demolishes prejudice in garrison as prowess in the field Not infrequently has an officer gone forth under a cloud and returned under a crown It is so much easier to be a hero in a single fight than a model soldier through an entire season at least it was so in the old days But the moment mister Field dismounted and leaving his horse with the others along the slope had gone crouching to the crest he levelled his glasses for one look then turned excitedly and began rapid signals to his followers Presently a young trooper came charging down making straight for Ray The lieutenant s compliments said he but there s a dozen Sioux in sight and he wishes to know shall he charge A dozen Sioux in sight That was unusual Ordinarily the Indian keeps in hiding lurking behind sheltering crests and ridges in the open country or the trees and underbrush where such cover is possible A dozen in sight How far ahead Murray asked the captain as he shook free his rein and started forward at the gallop Did you see them yourself Yes sir Most of em were bunched by the roadside jabbing with their lances at something or other Two or three were closer in They must ha been watching us for they only quit the ridge just before we came up Then they skedaddled The vernacular of the civil war days long since forgotten except about the few Veteran Soldiers Homes in the East was still in use at times in regiments like the th which had served the four years through with the Army of the Potomac Old sergeants give the tone to younger soldiers in all the customs of the service The captain and the two men now with him had caught up with Field s swift trotting support by this time and the eyes of the men kindled instantly at sight of their leader speeding easily by cool confident and as thoroughly at home as though it were the most ordinary skirmish drill Those who have never tried it do not quite realize what it means to ride in closed ranks and compact column silent and unswerving straight forward over open fields toward some equally silent crest that gives no sign of hostile occupancy and yet may suddenly blaze with vengeful fires and spit its hissing lead into the faces of the advancing force Even here where the ridge was already gained by two or three of the advance proving therefore that the enemy could not be in possession men saw by the excitement manifest in the signals of the lieutenant and indeed of Sergeant Scott who had spent fifteen years in the ranks that Indians must be close at hand The crest was barely five hundred yards in front of the section and they were still bunched a splendid mark if the foe saw fit by sudden dash to regain the ridge and pour in rapid fire from their magazine rifles Every ward of the nation as a rule had his Winchester or Henry about a six to one advantage to the red men over the sworn soldier of the government in a short range fight The lieutenant was a brave lad and all that and could be relied on to do his share in a shindy as the sergeant put it but when it came to handling the troop to the best advantage giving them full swing when they met the foe on even terms and a fair field but holding them clear of possible ambuscade then Captain Billy is the boss in the business was the estimate of his men and every heart beat higher at sight of him He would know just what to do for them and knowing would do it Even as he went loping by Ray had half turned with something like a smile in his dark eyes and a nod of his curly head to the sergeant commanding and a gesture of the gauntleted hand a horizontal sweep to right and left twice repeated had given the veteran his cue and with another moment Winsor had the dozen in line at open yet narrow intervals with carbines advanced and ready for business They saw their captain ride swiftly up the gentle slope until close to the crest then off he sprang tossed his reins to the trumpeter and went hurrying afoot to join the lieutenant They saw him kneeling as though to level his glasses and look fixedly forward saw Field run back to his horse and mount in a twinkling saw him whirl about as though coming to place himself at their head yet rein in at once his charger s fore feet ploughing the turf at some word from their leader Field was eager to charge but Ray had seen for himself and for his men and Ray said no Another moment and all at the front were again in saddle Field back with the advance Ray coolly seated astride his pet sorrel scouting a second ridge far to the north with his glasses and sending as before Scott and his three troopers straight on to the front and signalling to the flankers to continue the move Ten seconds study of the position in the long wide shallow depression before him had fathomed the scheme of the savage The little knot of Indians jabbering yelping prodding and circling about some unseen object on the turf feigning ignorance of the soldiers coming was at the old time trick to get the foremost troopers to charge and chase to draw them on in all the dash and excitement of the moment far ahead three miles perhaps of the main body and so enable all the lurking band behind that second curtain the farther ridge to come swooping down to surround overwhelm and butcher the luckless few then be off to safe distance long before the mass of the troop could possibly reach the scene No you don t Stabber laughed Ray as Field not a little chagrined and the dozen at his back came trotting within hearing distance That dodge was bald headed when I was a baby Look Field he continued They were jabbing at nothing there on the prairie That was a fake captive they were stabbing to death See them all scooting away now They ll rally beyond that next ridge and we ll do a little fooling of our own And so with occasional peep at feathered warriors on the far left flank and frequent hoverings of small parties on the distant front Ray s nervy half hundred pushed steadily on Two experiments had satisfied the Sioux that the captain himself was in command and they had long since recognized the sorrels They knew of old Ray was not to be caught by time worn tricks They had failed to pick off the advance or the officers as the troop approached the second ridge Lame Wolf s big band was coming fast but only a dozen of his warriors sent lashing forward had as yet reached Stabber The latter was too weak in numbers to think of fighting on even terms and as Ray seemed determined to come ahead why not let him Word was sent to Wolf not to risk showing south of the Elk Tooth spur There in the breaks and ravines would be a famous place to lie in ambush leaving to Stabber the duty of drawing the soldiers into the net So there in the breaks they waited while Ray s long skirmish line easily manoeuvred the red sharp shooters out of their lair on the middle divide Then reforming column the little command bore straight away for the Elk But all these diversions took time Twenty miles to the north of Frayne stretched the bold divide between the Elk Fork dry as a dead tooth much of the year and the sandy bottom of the Box Elder Here and there along the ridge were sudden moundlike upheavals that gave it a picturesque castellated effect for unlike the general run of the country the Elk Tooth seemed to have a backbone of rock that shot forth southeastward from the southern limit of the beautiful Big Horn range and in two or three places during some prehistoric convulsion of nature it had crushed itself out of shape and forced upward a mass of gleaming rock that even in the course of centuries had not been overgrown with grass Elk teeth the Indians had called these odd projections and one of them the middle one of the three most prominent was a landmark seen for many a mile except to the south and west Eagle Butte was the only point south of the Big Horn and in the valley of the Platte from which it could be seen and famous were these two points in the old days of the frontier for the beacon fires that burned or the mirror signals that flashed on their summits when the war parties of the Sioux were afield It was the sight of puffs of smoke sailing skyward from the crest of the middle tooth that caught Ray s attention the moment he reached the second ridge A moment more had been devoted to recalling some of his eager men who from the extreme right of the swinging skirmish line had broken away in pursuit of certain intentional laggards Then a dozen of the Indians finding themselves no longer followed gathered at comparatively safe distance across the prairie and while in eager consultation found time for taunting challenging and occasionally firing at the distant and angering troopers whom Sergeant Scott had sharply ordered back and Ray after calm survey of these fellows through his glass had then levelled it at the trio of buttes along the distant ridge and turned to Field sitting silent and disappointed by his side There Field said the captain Take this glass and look at those signal smokes Stabber has more men now at his call than he had when he started and more yet are coming They were just praying you would charge with a handful of men They would have let you through then closed around and cut you off Do you see boy Field touched his hat brim You know them best sir was the brief answer What I wanted was a chance at those fellows hanging about our front and calling us names You ll get it I m thinking before we re an hour older They know whither we re bound and mean to delay us all they can Ah Clayton he added as the junior lieutenant rode up to join them while his platoon dismounted to reset saddles behind the screen of the skirmish line Men look full of fight don t they There if anywhere is where we ll get it I ve just been showing Field those signal smokes Mount and follow when we re half way down to that clump of cottonwoods yonder We must reach those people at the stage station to night and I may have to give these beggars a lesson first Watch for my signal and come ahead lively if I turn toward you and swing my hat All ready Field Shove ahead And this was the last conference between the three officers that eventful morning As once again the advance guard pushed cautiously forward toward the banks of the arroyo in the bottom Ray turned to Field Skirmish work suits you better than office duty Field You look far livelier than you did yesterday Don t you begin to see that the major was right in sending you out with us And the dark eyes of the trained and experienced soldier shone kindly into the face of the younger man I m glad to be with you Captain Ray was the prompt answer It isn t my being sent but the way I was sent or the cause for which I was sent that stings me I thought then and I think now that if you had been post commander it wouldn t have been done I don t know yet what charge has been laid at my door There was no time to talk of reasons Field interposed Ray though his keen eyes were fixed on the distant ridge ahead beyond which the last of the Indians had now disappeared The outermost troopers with Sergeant Scott were within a few hundred yards of the little clump of cottonwoods that marked the site of a water hole To the right and left of it curved and twisted the dry water course between its low jagged precipitous banks Behind the advance full four hundred yards rode the skirmish line from the first platoon a dozen strong Far out to the east and west the flankers moved steadily northward keenly watching the slopes beyond them and scanning the crooked line of the arroyo ahead Not a sign at the moment could be seen of the painted foe yet every man in the troop well knew they swarmed by dozens behind the buttes and ridges ahead Ray and Field riding easily along in rear of the line with only the trumpeter within earshot relaxed in no measure the vigilance demanded by the situation yet each was deeply concerned in the subject of the talk There was no time We had to start at once continued Ray Wait until you are back at the old desk Field and you ll find the major is and was your stanch friend in this matter I ll never go back to it captain broke in Field impetuously If ordered to resume duty as adjutant come what may I shall refuse But before Ray could interpose again there came sudden and stirring interruption From a point far down the swale from behind the low bank of the stream bed three rifle shots rang out on the crisp morning air The horse of the leading flanker away out to the right reared and plunged violently the rider seeming vainly to strive to check him Almost instantly three mounted warriors were seen tearing madly away northeastward out of the gully their feathers streaming in the wind Field spurred away to join his men Ray whirled about in saddle and swung his broad brimmed scouting hat high above his head in signal to Clayton then shouted to Field Forward to the cottonwoods Gallop he cried We need them first of all CHAPTER XI A FIGHT WITH A FURY The noonday sun was staring hotly down an hour later on a stirring picture of frontier warfare with that clump of cottonwoods as the central feature Well for Ray s half hundred that brilliant autumn morning that their leader had had so many a year of Indian campaigning He now seemed to know by instinct every scheme of his savage foe and to act accordingly Ever since the command had come in sight of the Elk Tooth the conviction had been growing on Ray that Stabber must have received many accessions and was counting on the speedy coming of others The signal smokes across the wide valley the frequent essays to tempt his advance guard to charge and chase the boldness with which the Indians showed on front and flank the daring pertinacity with which they clung to the stream bed for the sake of a few shots at the foremost troopers relying evidently on the array of their comrades beyond the ridge to overwhelm any force that gave close pursuit the fact that other Indians opened on the advance guard and the left flankers and that a dozen at least tore away out of the sandy arroyo the moment they saw the line start at the gallop all these had tended to convince the captain that now at last when he was miles from home and succor the Sioux stood ready in abundant force to give him desperate battle To dart on in chase of the three warriors would simply result in the scattering of his own people and their being individually cut off and stricken down by circling swarms of their red foes To gather his men and attempt to force the passage of the Elk Tooth ridge meant certain destruction of the whole command The Sioux would be only to glad to scurry away from their front and let them through and then in big circle whirl all about him pouring in a concentric fire that would be sure to hit some at least exposed as they would be on the open prairie while their return shots radiating wildly at the swift darting warriors would be almost as sure to miss He would soon be weighted down with wounded refusing to leave them to be butchered unable therefore to move in any direction and so compelled to keep up a shelterless hopeless fight until one by one he and his gallant fellows fell pierced by Indian lead and sacrificed to the scalping knife as were Custer s three hundred a decade before No Ray knew too much of frontier strategy to be so caught There stood the little grove of dingy green a prairie fortress if one knew how to use it There in the sand of the stream bed by digging were they sure to find water for the wounded if wounded there had to be There by the aid of a few hastily thrown intrenchments he could have a little plains fort and be ready to repel even an attack in force Horses could be herded in the depths of the sandy shallows Men could be distributed in big circle through the trees and along the bank and with abundant rations in their haversacks and water to be had for the digging they could hold out like heroes until relief should come from the south Obviously therefore the cottonwood grove was the place and thither at thundering charge Field led the foremost line while Ray waved on the second all hands cheering with glee at sight of the Sioux darting wildly away up the northward slope Ten men in line far extended were sent right forward half way across the flats ordered to drive the Indians from the bottom and cripple as many as possible but if menaced by superior numbers to fall back at the gallop keeping well away from the front of the grove so that the fire of its garrison might not be masked The ten had darted after the scurrying warriors full half way to the beginning of the slope and then just as Ray had predicted down came a cloud of brilliant foemen seeking to swallow the little ten alive Instantly their sergeant leader whirled them about and pointing the way led them in wide circle horses well in hand back to the dry wash then down into its sandy depths Here every trooper sprang from saddle and with the rein looped on the left arm and from the shelter of the straight stiff banks opened sharp fire on their pursuers just as Clayton s platoon dismounting at the grove sprang to the nearest cover and joined in the fierce clamor of carbines Racing down the slope at top speed as were the Sioux they could not all at once check the way of their nimble mounts and the ardor of the chase had carried them far down to the flats before the fierce crackle began Then it was thrilling to watch them veering circling sweeping to right or left ever at furious gallop throwing their lithe painted bodies behind their chargers necks clinging with one leg and arm barely showing so much as an eyelid yet yelping and screeching like so many coyotes not one of their number coming within four hundred yards of the slender fighting line in the stream bed some of them indeed disdaining to stoop riding defiantly along the front firing wildly as they rode yet surely and gradually guiding their ponies back to the higher ground back out of harm s way and in five minutes from the time they had flashed into view coming charging over the mile away ridge not a red warrior was left on the low ground only three or four luckless ponies kicking in their last struggles or stiffening on the turf while their riders wounded or unhurt had been picked up and spirited away with the marvellous skill only known to these warriors of the plains Then Ray and his men had time to breathe and shout laughing comment and congratulation Not one as yet was hit or hurt They were secure for the time in a strong position and had signally whipped off the first assault of the Sioux Loudly excitedly angrily these latter were now conferring again far up the slope to the north At least an hundred in one concourse they were having hot discussion over the untoward result of the dash Others obedient to orders from the chief were circling far out to east and west and crossing the valley above and below the position of the defence Others still were galloping back to the ridge where against the sky line strong bodies of warriors could be plainly seen moving excitedly to and fro Two little groups slowly making their way to the crest gave no little comfort to the boys in blue Some at least of the charging force had been made to feel the bite of the cavalry weapon and were being borne to the rear But no time was to be wasted Already from far up the stream bed two or three Indians were hazarding long range shots at the grove and Ray ordered all horses into a bend of the wash where the side lines were whipped from the blanket straps and the excited sorrels securely hoppled Then here there and in a score of places along the bank and again at the edge of the cottonwoods men had been assigned their stations and bidden to find cover for themselves without delay Many burrowed in the soft and yielding soil throwing the earth forward in front of them Others utilized fallen trees or branches Some two or three piled saddles and blanket rolls into a low barricade and all while crouching about their work watched the feathered warriors as they steadily completed their big circle far out on the prairie Bullets came whistling now fast and frequently nipping off leaves and twigs and causing many a fellow to duck instinctively and to look about him ashamed of his dodge yet sure of the fact that time had been in the days of the most hardened veteran of the troop when he too knew what it was to shrink from the whistle of hostile lead It would be but a moment or two they all understood before the foe would decide on the next move then every man would be needed Meantime having stationed Field on the north front with orders to note every movement of the Sioux and having assigned Clayton to the minor duty of watching the south front and the flanks Ray was moving cheerily among his men speeding from cover to cover suggesting here helping there alert even joyous in manner We couldn t have a better roost lads he said We can stand off double their number easy We can hold out a week if need be but you bet the major will be reaching out after us before we re two days older Don t waste your shots Coax them close in Don t fire at a galloping Indian beyond three hundred yards It s waste of powder and lead Cheerily joyously they answered him these his comrades his soldier children men who had fought with him many of their number in a dozen fields and men who would stand by him their dark eyed little captain to the last Even the youngest trooper of the fifty seemed inspired by the easy laughing confidence of the lighter hearts among their number or the grim matter of fact pugnacity of the older campaigners It was significant too that the Indians seemed so divided in mind as to the next move There was loud wrangling and much disputation going on in that savage council to the north Stabber s braves and Lame Wolf s followers seemed bitterly at odds for old hands in the fast growing rifle pits pointed out on one side as many as half a dozen of the former s warriors whom they recognized and knew by sight while Ray studying the shifting concourse through his glasses could easily see Stabber himself raging among them in violent altercation with a tall superbly built and bedizened young brave a sub chief apparently who for his part seemed giving Stabber as good as he got Lame Wolf was not in sight at all He might still be far from the scene and this tall warrior be acting as his representative But whoever or whatever he was he had hearty following More than three fourths of the wrangling warriors in the group seemed backing him Ray after a few words to Sergeant Winsor crawled over beside his silent and absorbed young second in command and bringing his glasses to bear gazed across a low parapet of sand long and fixedly at the turbulent throng a thousand yards away It s easy to make out Stabber he presently spoke One can almost hear that foghorn voice of his But who the mischief is that red villain opposing him I ve seen every one of their chiefs in the last five years All are men of forty or more This fellow can t be a big chief He looks long years younger than most of em old Lame Wolf for instance yet he s cheeking Stabber as if he owned the whole outfit Another long stare then again Who the mischief can he be No answer at his side and Ray with the lenses still at his eyes took no note for the moment that Field remained so silent Out at the front the excitement increased Out through the veil of surging warriors the loud voiced impetuous brave twice burst his way and seemed at one and the same time in his superb poise and gesturings to be urging the entire body to join him in instant assault on the troops and hurling taunt and anathema on the besieged Whoever he was he was in a veritable fury As many as half of the Indians seemed utterly carried away by his fiery words and with much shouting and gesticulation and brandishing of gun and lance were yelling approbation of his views and urging Stabber s people to join them More furious language followed and much dashing about of excited ponies Have you ever seen that fellow before demanded Ray of brown eyed Sergeant Winsor who had spent a lifetime on the plains but Winsor was plainly puzzled I can t say for the life of me sir was the answer I don t know him at all and yet Whoever he is by Jove said Ray he s a bigger man this day than Stabber for he s winning the fight Now if he only leads the dash as he does the debate we can pick him off Who are our best shots on this front and eagerly he scanned the few faces near him Webber s tiptop and good for anything under five hundred yards when he isn t excited and Stoltz he s a keen cool one No not you Hogan laughed the commander as a freckled faced veteran popped his head up over a nearby parapet of sand and grinned his desire to be included I ve never seen the time you could hit what you aimed at Slip out of that hole and find Webber and tell him to come here and you take his burrow Whereupon Hogan grinning rueful acquiescence in his commander s criticism slid backwards into the stream bed and followed by the chaff of the three or four comrades near enough to catch the words went crouching from post to post in search of the desired marksman You used to be pretty sure with the carbine in the Tonto Basin when we were after Apaches sergeant continued Ray again peering through the glasses I m mistaken in this fellow if he doesn t ride well within range and we must make an example of him I want four first class shots to single him out The lieutenant can beat the best I ever did sir said Winsor with a lift of the hand toward the hat brim as though in apology for Field silent throughout the brief conference had half risen on his hands and knees and was edging over to the left apparently seeking to reach the shelter of a little hummock close to the bank Why surely Field was the quick reply as Ray turned toward his junior That will make it complete Illustration WITH ONE MAGNIFICENT RED ARM UPLIFTED But a frantic burst of yells and war whoops out at the front put sudden stop to the words The throng of warriors that had pressed so close about Stabber and the opposing orator seemed all in an instant to split asunder and with trailing war bonnet and followed by only two or three of his braves the former lashed his way westward and swept angrily out of the ruck and went circling away toward the crest while with loud acclamation brandishing shield and lance and rifle in superb barbaric tableau the warriors lined up in front of the victorious young leader who sitting high in his stirrups with one magnificent red arm uplifted began shouting in the sonorous tongue of the Sioux some urgent instructions Down from the distant crest came other braves as though to meet and ask Stabber explanation of his strange quitting the field Down came a dozen others young braves mad for battle eager to join the ranks of this new leader and Ray who had turned on Field once more fixed his glasses on that stalwart nearly stark naked brilliantly painted form foremost of the Indian array and now at last in full and unimpeded view By the gods of war he cried I never saw that scoundrel before but if it isn t that renegade Red Fox Why here Field Take my glass and look You were with the commissioners escort last year at the Black Hills council You must have seen him and heard him speak Isn t this Red Fox himself And to Ray s surprise the young officer s eyes were averted his face pale and troubled and the answer was a mere mumble I didn t meet Fox there captain He never seemed to see the glass held out to him until Ray almost thrust it into his hand and then persisted with his inquiry Look at him anyhow You may have seen him somewhere Isn t that Red Fox And now Ray was gazing straight at Field s half hidden face Field the soul of frankness hitherto the lad who was never known to flinch from the eyes of any man but to answer such challenge with his own brave fearless sometimes even defiant Now he kept the big binocular fixed on the distant hostile array but his face was white his hand unsteady and his answer when it came was in a voice that Ray heard in mingled pain and wonderment Could it be that the lad was unnerved by the sight In any event he seemed utterly unlike himself I cannot say sir It was dark or night at all events the only time I ever heard him CHAPTER XII THE ORDEAL BY FIRE That action had been resolved upon and prompt action was now apparent Stabber fighting chief though he had been in the past had had his reason for opposing the plans of this new and vehement leader but public sentiment stirred by vehement oratory had overruled him and he had bolted the field convention in a fury Lame Wolf a younger chief than Stabber had yet more power among the Ogalallas being Red Cloud s favorite nephew and among the Indians at least his acknowledged representative Whenever called to account however for that nephew s deeds the wary old statesman promptly disavowed them It was in search of Lame Wolf reasoned Ray that Stabber had sped away possibly hoping to induce him to call off his followers It was probably the deeper strategy of Stabber to oppose no obstacle to Ray s advance until the little troop was beyond the Elk Tooth ridge where on utterly shelterless ground the Indian would have every advantage He knew Ray of old knew well that left to himself the captain would push on in the effort to rescue the stage people and he and his command might practically be at the mercy of the Sioux if only the Sioux would listen and be patient Stabber knew that to attack the troopers now entrenching at the cottonwoods meant a desperate fight in which the Indians even if ultimately triumphant must lose many a valued brave and that is not the thoroughbred Indian s view of good generalship Stabber was old wily and wise The new chief whoever he might be seemed possessed of a mad lust for instant battle coupled with a possible fear that unless the golden moment were seized Ray might be reinforced and could then defy them all Indeed there were veteran campaigners among the troopers who noted how often the tall red chief pointed in sweeping gesture back to Moccasin Ridge troopers who even at the distance caught and interpreted a few of his words That s it sir said Winsor confidently to Ray He says more soldiers coming and I believe he knows At all events he had so convinced his fellows and even before Stabber reached the middle tooth where sat a little knot of mounted Indians signalling apparently to others still some distance to the north with a chorus of exultant yells the long gaudy glittering line of braves suddenly scattered and lashing away to right and left dozens of them darted at top speed to join those already disposed about that big circle while others still the main body probably seventy strong after some barbaric show of circus evolutions about their leader once more reined up for some final injunctions from his lips Then with a magnificent gesture of the hand he waved them on and accompanied by only two young riders rode swiftly away to a little swell of the prairie just out of range of the carbines and there took his station to supervise the attack Damn him growled old Winsor He s no charger like Crazy Horse He s a Sitting Bull breed of general like some we had in Virginia he added between his set teeth but Ray heard and grinned in silent appreciation Set your sights and give em their first volley as they reach that scorched line he called to the men along the northward front and pointed to a stretch of prairie where the dry grass had lately been burned away Five hundred yards will do it Then aim low when they rush closer in Look at the middle tooth captain came the sudden hail from his left Mirror flashes See It was Field who spoke and life and vim had returned to his voice and color to his face He was pointing eagerly toward the highest of the knobs where all on a sudden dazzling little beams of light shot forth toward the Indians in the lowlands tipping the war bonnet and lance of many a brave with dancing fire Whatever their purport the signals seemed ignored by the Sioux for presently two riders came sweeping down the long slope straight for the point where sat Red Fox as for want of other name we must for the present call him who for his part shading his eyes with his hand sat gazing toward the westward side of his warrior circle evidently awaiting some demonstration there before giving signal for action elsewhere Obedient to his first instructions the main body had spread out in long irregular skirmish rank their mettlesome ponies capering and dancing in their eagerness Chanting in chorus some shrill weird song the line was now slowly steadily advancing still too far away to warrant the wasting of a shot yet unmistakably seeking to close as much as possible before bursting in with the final charge Illustration SOME FEW OF THEIR NUMBER BORNE AWAY BY THEIR COMRADES And still the red leader sat at gaze oblivious for the moment of everything around him ignoring the coming of orders possibly from Lame Wolf himself Suddenly the silver armlets once more gleamed on high Then clapping the palm of his right hand to his mouth Red Fox gave voice to a ringing war whoop fierce savage and exultant and almost at the instant like the boom and rumble that follows some vivid lightning flash the prairie woke and trembled to the thunder of near a thousand hoofs From every point of the compass from every side yelling like fiends of some orthodox hell down they came the wild warriors of the frontier in furious rush upon the silent and almost peaceful covert of this little band of brothers in the dusty garb of blue One two three hundred yards they came centering on the leafy clump of cottonwoods riding at tearing gallop erect defiant daring at the start and giving full voice to their wild war cry Then bending forward then crouching low then flattening out like hunted squirrel for as the foremost in the dash came thundering on within good carbine range all on a sudden the watch dogs of the little plains fort began to bark Tiny jets of flame and smoke shot from the level of the prairie from over dingy mounds of sand from behind the trunks of stunted trees from low parapet of log or leather Then the entire grove seemed veiling itself in a drifting film of blue the whole charging circle to crown itself with a dun cloud of dust that swept eastward over the prairie driven by the stiff unhampered breeze The welkin rang with savage yell with answering cheer with the sputter and crackle of rifle and revolver the loud bellow of Springfield and then still yelping the feathered riders veered and circled ever at magnificent speed each man for himself apparently yet all guided and controlled by some unseen yet acknowledged power and in five minutes save where some hapless pony lay quivering and kicking on the turf the low ground close at hand was swept clean of horse or man The wild attack had been made in vain The Sioux were scampering back convinced but not discomfited Some few of their number borne away stunned and bleeding by comrade hands from underneath their stricken chargers some three or four perhaps who had dared too much were now closing their eyes on the last fight of their savage lives To Ray and to many of his men it was all an old story Stabber would never have counselled or permitted attack on seasoned troopers fighting behind even improvised shelter Something perhaps had occurred to blind his younger rival to the peril of such assault and now as three or four little parties were seen slowly drifting away toward the ridge burdened by some helpless form other couriers came thundering down at Red Fox and wild excitement prevailed among the Elk Teeth More signals were flashing More Indians came popping into view their feathered bonnets streaming in the rising wind and about the prairie wave where the savage general had established field headquarters a furious conference was going on Stabber had again interposed and with grim but hopeful eyes Ray and his fellows watched and noted Every lull in the fight was so much gain for them Twelve fifty two said the dark eyed commander swinging his watch into the pocket of his hunting shirt and sliding backward into the stream bed All serene so far Watch things on this front Field while I make the rounds and see how we came out All serene so far it was Not a man hurt Two of the sorrels had been hit by flying bullets and much amazed and stung thereat but neither was crippled Bidding their guards to dig for water that might soon be needed Ray once more made his way to the northward side and rejoined Field and Winsor In an almost cloudless sky of steely blue the sun had just passed the meridian and was streaming hotly down on the stirring picture Northward the ridge line and the long gradual slope seemed alive with swarms of Indian warriors many of them darting about in wild commotion About the little eminence where Stabber and the Fox had again locked horns in violent altercation as many as a hundred braves had gathered About the middle knob from whose summit mirror flashes shot from time to time was still another concourse listening apparently to the admonitions of a leader but recently arrived a chieftain mounted on an American horse almost black and Ray studied the pair long and curiously through his glasses Lame Wolf probably said he but the distance was too great to enable him to be certain What puzzled him more than anything was the apparent division of authority the unusual display of discord among the Sioux These were all doubtless of the Ogalalla tribe Red Cloud s own people yet here were they wrangling like ward heelers and wasting precious time Whatever his antecedents this new comer had been a powerful sower of strife and sedition for instead of following implicitly the counsels of one leader the Indians were divided now between three True to its practice the prairie wind was sweeping stronger and stronger with every moment as the sun warmed strata over the wide billowing surface sought higher levels and the denser cooler current from the west came rushing down And now all sounds of the debate were whisked away toward the breaks of the South Shyenne and it was no longer possible for old Sioux campaigners to catch a word of the discussion The leaves of the cottonwoods whistled in the rising gale and every time a pony crossed the stream bed and clambered the steep banks out to the west little clouds of dun colored dust came sailing toward the grove scattered and spent however far from the lair of the defence Oddly enough that method of spelling the river s name became official But while the discussion seemed endless among the Indians on the northward side never for a moment was the vigilance of the circle relaxed South east and west the slopes and lowlands were dotted with restless horsemen and from young Clayton came the word that through his glass he could make out three or four warriors far away toward the Moccasin Ridge That s good said Ray It means they too are looking for a column coming out from Frayne But where on earth did all these rascals come from There must be four hundred now in sight Well might he ask and marvel Stabber s little village had never more than fifty warriors Lame Wolf s band was counted at less than two hundred and forty fighting men and these so said the agents of the omniscient Bureau were all the Ogalallas away from the shelter of the reservation when the trouble started No more should be allowed to go was the confident promise yet a fortnight nearly had elapsed since the frontier fun began News of battle sweeps with marvellous speed through Indian haunted lands and here were warriors by the score come to strengthen the hands of kindred in the field and more were coming The mirror signals plainly told them that Yet it was now well nigh one o clock and not another hostile move was made Fox then was being held by stronger hands It meant that Lame Wolf had listened to reason and Stabber and would permit no fresh attack until his numbers should be so increased that resistance would practically be vain It meant even more that the Indian leader in chief command felt sure no force was yet within helping distance of the corralled troopers He could therefore take his time But this was a theory Ray would not whisper to his men He knew Webb He knew Webb would soon read the signs from the north and be coming to his relief and Ray was right Even as he reasoned there came a message from across the grove Lieutenant Clayton said the Indians he had seen away to the south were racing back Thank God was the murmured answer no man heard Now lads be ready was the ringing word that roused the little troop like bugle call To Arms And even as eager faces lifted over the low parapets to scan the distant foe fresh signals came flashing down from the northward ridge fresh bands of warriors came darting to join the martial throng about the still wrangling chieftains and then all on a sudden with mighty yelling and shrill commotion that savage council burst asunder and riding at speed a dozen braves went lashing away to the westward side while with fierce brandishing of arms and shields and much curveting and prancing of excited ponies the wild battle lines were formed again The Sioux were coming for the second trial Meet them as before Make every shot tell were the orders passed from man to man and heard and noted amidst the whistling of the wind and the sounds of scurry and commotion at the front Then silent and crouching low the soldiers shoved the brown barrels of their carbines forth again and waited And then the grim silence of the little fortress was broken as with startling sudden force there went up a shout from the westward side My God boys they re setting fire to the prairie Ray sprang to his feet and gazed Away out to the west and southwest whence came the strong breeze blowing from the Sweetwater Hills half a dozen dark agile forms bending low were scudding afoot over the sward and everywhere they moved there sprang up in their tracks little sheets of lambent flame little clouds of bluish blinding smoke and almost in less time than it takes to tell it a low wall of fire started in a dozen places reaching far across the low ground fencing the valley from stream bed to the southward slopes crowned by its swift sailing crest of hot stifling fume came lapping and seething and sweeping across the level licking up the dry buffalo grass like so much tow mounting higher and fiercer with every second and bearing down upon the little grove and its almost helpless defenders in fearful force in resistless fury a charge no bullet could stop an enemy no human valor could hope to daunt or down Quick men yelled Ray Out with you you on the west front Stay you here you others Watch the Sioux They ll be on us in an instant And away he sped from the shelter of the bank out from the thick of the cottonwoods out to the open prairie straight toward the coming torrent of flame still thank God full seven hundred yards away but leaping toward them with awful strides Out with him rushed Field and out from Clayton s front sped half a dozen old hands every man fumbling for his match box out until they had reached a line with their captain already sprawled upon the turf and there full an hundred yards from the grove they spread in rude skirmish line and reckless of the mad chorus of yells that came sweeping down the wind reckless of the clamor of the coming charge reckless of the whistling lead that almost instantly began nipping and biting the turf about them here there and everywhere they too had started little fires they too had run their line of flame across the windward front they too had launched a wall of flame sailing toward the grove and then back through blinding smoke they ran for their saddle blankets just as the sharp sputter of shots burst forth on the northward side and the Sioux with magnificent dash came thundering within range Then followed a thrilling battle for life two red enemies now enrolled against the blue Fight fire with fire is the old rule of the prairie Ray had promptly met the on coming sweep of the torrent by starting a smaller blaze that should at least clear the surface close at hand and by eating off the fuel stop possibly the progress of the greater flame But the minor blaze had also to be stopped lest it come snapping and devouring within the grove It is no easy matter to check a prairie fire against a prairie gale when every human aid is summoned It is desperate work to try to check one when to the fires of nature are added the furious blaze of hostile arms every rifle sighted by savage vengeful foe Check it lads ten yards out shouted Ray to his gallant fellows now lost in the smoke while he again rushed across the front to meet the charging Sioux With his brave young face all grime Field was already at work guiding urging aiding his little band Both hands Both hands he cried as wielding his folded blanket he smote the fringe of flame Stamp it out Great God Wing are you hit For answer the sergeant by his side went plunging down face foremost and little Trooper Denny rushing to aid his young officer in the effort to raise the stricken man as suddenly loosed his hold and together again these two sworn comrades of many a campaign lay side by side as they had lain in camp and bivouac all over the wide frontier and poor Denny could only gasp a loyal word of warning to his officer Get back sir for God s sake get back ere the life blood came gushing from his mouth Bending low Field grabbed the faithful fellow in his strong arms and calling to the nearmost men to look to Wing bore his helpless burden back through stifling smoke clouds laid him on the turf at the foot of a cottonwood then ran again to the perilous work of fighting the flame stumbling midway over another prostrate form Both hands Both hands he yelled as again his blanket whirled in air and so by dint of desperate work the inner line of flame at last was stayed but every man of the gallant little squad of fire fighters had paid the penalty of his devotion and felt the sting of hissing lead Field the last of all Westward now well nigh an hundred yards in width a broad black smoking patch stretched across the pathway of the swift coming wall of smoke and flame a safeguard to the beleaguered command worth all the soldier sacrifice it cost In grand and furious sweep the scourge of the prairie sent its destroying line across the wide level to the south of the sheltering grove but in the blood and sweat of heroic men the threatening flames of the windward side had sputtered out The little garrison was safe from one at least of its dread and merciless foes though five of its best and bravest lay dead or dying and others still sore stricken in the midst of the smoking grove Field old boy said Ray with brimming eyes as he knelt and clasped the hand of the bleeding lad while the Sioux fell back in wrath and dismay from the low aimed vengeful fire of the fighting line This means the Medal of Honor for you if word of mine can fetch it CHAPTER XIII WOUNDED BODY AND SOUL To say the Sioux were furious at the failure of their second attempt would be putting it far too mildly The fierce charge from the northward side made under cover of the blinding smoke sent drifting by the gale across the level flats had been pushed so close to the grove that two red braves and half a dozen ponies had met their death within sixty paces of the rifle pits There lay the bodies now and the Indians dare not attempt to reach them The dread wind driven flame of the prairie fire planned by the Sioux to burn out the defence to serve as their ally had been turned to their grave detriment Ray and his devoted men had stopped the sweep of so much of the conflagration as threatened their little stronghold but ranging unhampered elsewhere the seething wall rolled on toward the east spreading gradually toward its flanks and so not only consuming vast acres of bunch grass but checking the attack that should have been made from the entire southern half of the Indian circle Later leaping the sandy stream bed a little to the west of the cottonwoods it spread in wild career over a huge tract along the left bank and now reuniting with the southern wing some distance down the valley was roaring away to the bluffs of the Mini Pusa leaving death and desolation in its track Miles to the east the war parties from the reservation riding to join Lame Wolf sighted the black curtain of smoke swift sailing over the prairie and changed their course accordingly Not so many miles away to the south Webb s skirmishers driving before them three or four Sioux scouts from the northward slope of the Moccasin Ridge set spurs to their horses and took the gallop the main body following on With their eyelids blistered by heat and smoke Ray s silent determined little band could see nothing of the coming force yet knew relief was nigh for close at hand both east and west large bodies of the enemy could be seen swift riding away to the north They had hoped as Fox had planned and promised to burn out and overwhelm the little troop at the grove before the column from Frayne could possibly reach the spot They had even anticipated the probable effort of the command to check the flames and had told off some fifty braves to open concentric fire on any party that should rush into the open with that object in view They had thought to send in such a storm of lead even from long range that it should daunt and drive back those who had dared the attempt They had stormed indeed but could neither daunt nor drive back Ray s men had braved death itself in the desperate essay and even in dying had won the day But their losses had been cruel Three killed outright three dying and eight more or less severely wounded had reduced their fighting strength to nearly thirty The guards of the sorrels herded in the stream bed had all they could do to control the poor frightened creatures many of them hit several of them felled by the plunging fire from the far hillsides Even though driven back the Sioux never meant to give up the battle On every side leaving their ponies at safe distance by dozens the warriors crawled forward snake like to the edge of the burned and blackened surface and from there poured in a rapid and most harassing fire compelling the defence to lie flat or burrow further and wounding many horses The half hour that followed the repulse of their grand assault had been sorely trying to the troop for the wounded needed aid more men were hit and there was no chance whatever to hit back Moving from point to point Ray carried cheer and courage on every side yet was so constantly exposed as to cause his men fresh anxiety Even as he was bending over Field a bullet had nipped the right shoulderstrap and later another had torn through the crown of his campaign hat In all the years of their frontier fighting they had never known a hotter fire but Ray s voice rang out through the drifting vapor with the same old cheer and confidence They can t charge again till the ground cools off he cried By that time they ll have their hands full See how they re scudding away at the southward even now Just keep covered and you re all right And barring a growl or two from favored old hands who sought to make the captain take his own medicine and himself keep covered the answer was full of cheer And so they waited through the hot smoke and sunshine of the autumn afternoon and even while comforting the wounded with assurance of coming relief kept vigilant watch on every hostile move and at last toward three o clock the sharp fire about them slackened away the smouldering roots of the bunch grass had burned themselves out The smoke drifted away from the prairie and as the landscape cleared to the south and west a cheer of delight went up from the cottonwoods for the slopes three miles away were dotted here and there and everywhere with circling scurrying war ponies they and their wild riders steadily falling back before a long rank of disciplined horsemen the extended skirmish line of Webb s squadron backed by supports at regular intervals and all heading straight on for the broad lowlands of the Elk Send six of your men over to the south front sergeant were Ray s orders to Winsor as he hurried over to join Clayton again They may try one final charge from that side and give us a chance to empty a few more saddles Creeping and crouching through the timber the chosen men obeyed and were assigned to stations under Clayton s eye The precaution was wise indeed for just as the captain foresaw a rally in force began far out over the southward slopes the Indians gathering in great numbers about some chieftain midway between the coming force and the still beleaguered defenders of the grove Then brandishing lance and shield and rifle as before they began spreading out across the prairie heading now for the cottonwoods while others still faced and fired on the far blue skirmish line The fierce wind sweeping across the direction of the attack deadened all sound of hoof or war chant but there was no mistaking the signs no doubt of the intent when in a little moment more the earth began to tremble beneath the dancing pony feet telling almost with the swiftness of sight that the grand advance had again begun But other eyes were watching too Other soldiers keen campaigners as these at the Elk were there afield and almost at the moment the wild barbaric horde burst yelling into their eager gallop and before the dust cloud hid the distant slopes beyond the exultant shout went up from the captain s lips as he threw down his glass and grabbed his carbine It s all right men The major s coming at their heels Now let em have it In former days there had been scenes of wild rejoicing sometimes of deep emotion when relief came to some Indian besieged detachment of the old regiment Once far to the south in the wild romantic park country of Colorado a strong detachment had been corralled for days by an overwhelming force of Utes Their commander a dozen of their best men all the horses killed and many troopers sorely wounded They had been rescued at last by their skilled and gallant colonel after a long and most scientific march by both night and day Another time still farther in their past and yet within a dozen years away down the broad valley of the very stream of which this little Elk was a tributary the Cheyennes had hemmed in and sorely hammered two depleted troops that owed their ultimate rescue to the daring of the very officer who so coolly confidently headed the defence this day to a night ride through the Indian lines that nearly cost him his brave young life but that brought Captain Truscott with a fresh and powerful troop sweeping in to their succor with the dawn Then there had been men who strained other men to their hearts and who shed tears like women for gallant comrades had bitten the dust in the desperate fighting of the day before and hope itself had almost gone with the ammunition of the beleaguered command Now with heavier losses than had befallen Wayne in seventy six Ray s command beheld with almost tranquil hearts the coming of the fierce array in final charge Behind them not two miles to be sure rode in swift well ordered pursuit the long line of comrade troopers But there had been intervening years of campaign experiences that dulled to a degree the earlier enthusiasms of the soldier and taught at least the assumption of professional composure that was the secret wonder of the suckling trooper and that became his chief ambition to acquire It is one thing to charge home at a hard fighting command when friends and comrades back the effort and cheer the charging line It is another to charge home conscious that other chargers are coming at one s heels Magnificent as a spectacle therefore this closing dash of Lame Wolf s warriors was but a meek reminder of their earlier attack Long before they came within four hundred yards of the leafy stronghold the moment indeed the brown Springfields began their spiteful bark to right and left the warriors veered far out on either flank Screeching and yelling as was their savage way they tore madly by flattened out against their ponies necks and those who could use their arms at all pumping wild shots that whistled harmless over the heads of the defenders and bit the blackened prairie many a rod beyond Only jeers rewarded the stirring spectacle jeers and a few low aimed sputtering volleys that brought other luckless ponies to their knees and sprawled a few red riders But in less than five minutes from the warning cry that hailed their coming Lame Wolf and his hosts were lining Elk Tooth ridge and watching with burning hate and vengeful eyes the swift steady advance of Webb s long blue fighting line and the utter unconcern of the defence Even before the relieving squadron was within carbine range certain of Ray s men had scrambled out upon the northward bank and pushing forward upon the prairie were possessing themselves of the arms and ornaments of the two dead warriors whom the Sioux had strived in vain to reach and bear within their lines Ray and Clayton at the moment were strolling placidly forth upon the southward bench to receive and welcome the little knot of comrades sent galloping in advance to greet them There was perhaps just a suspicion of exaggerated nonchalance about their gait and bearing a regimental weakness possibly and no other officer save Lieutenant Field happened to be within earshot when Winsor s voice on the other front was heard in hoarse command Come back there you fellows Back or you re goners The sight had proved too much for some of the Sioux Down again at furious speed came a scattered cloud of young braves following the lead of the tall magnificent chief who had been the hero of the earlier attack down into the low ground never swerving or checking pace straight for the grove the three or four inquisitive blue coats in the meantime scurrying for shelter and the yell that went up at sight of the Indian dash and the quick reopening of the sputtering fire brought Ray running once again to the northward edge of the timber wondering what could be amiss Field was lying on his blanket just under the bank as the captain darted by and grinned his gratification as he heard the brief assuring words Webb s here all hands with him An instant later a bullet whizzed through the roots of the old cottonwood above his head and from far out afield deadened by the rush of the wind a dull crackle of shots told that something had recalled the Sioux to the attack and for three minutes there was a lively fusillade all along the northward side Then it slowly died away and other voices close at hand someone speaking his name called the lad s attention He was weak from loss of blood and just a little dazed and flighty He had meant three hours agone that when next he encountered his post commander his manner should plainly show that senior that even a second lieutenant had rights a major was bound to respect But only mistily now he saw bending over him the keen soldierly features the kind winsome gray eyes filled with such a world of concern and sympathy and heard the deep earnest tones of the voice he knew so well calling again his name and mingling cordial praise and anxious inquiry and all the rancor seemed to float away with the smoke of the last carbine shots He could only faintly return the pressure of that firm muscular hand only feebly smile his thanks and reassurance and then he too seemed floating away somewhere into space and he could not manage to connect what Webb had been saying with the next words that fastened on his truant senses It must have been hours later too for darkness had settled on the valley A little fire was burning under the shelter of the bank A little group of soldiers were chatting in low tone close at hand Among them his arm in a sling stood a stocky little chap whose face seen in the flickering light was familiar to him So was the eager brogue in which that little chap was speaking A steward was remonstrating and only vaguely at first Field grasped the meaning of his words The captain said you were not to try to follow Kennedy at least not until doctor Waller saw you Wait till he gets here He can t be three miles back now To hell wid ye was the vehement answer D ye think I d be maundherin here wid the whole command gone on afther thim bloody Sioux I ve made my mark on wan o thim an he s the buck I m afther He s made his mark on you Kennedy broke in a soldier voice You mad fool trying to tackle a chief like that even if he was hit for he had his whole gang behind him Sure he dared me out an what s this he called me a d d whiskey thafe me that niver Oh shut up Kennedy laughed a brother Irishman You were full as a goat at K Troop s stables Where d ye get the whiskey if I ll lay you Lanigan when I get two hands agin though I misdoubt wan would do it It s me horse I want now and lave to go on wid the captain n Ready now sir he added with sudden change of tone and manner for a tall slender form came striding into the fire light and Field knew Blake at the instant and would have called but for the first word from the captain s lips Your heart s safe Kennedy I wish your head was Your past master in blasphemy out there won t eat it at all events Did ye get him sorr afther all I didn t His English spoiled my aim Twas Winsor shot him Now you re to stay here you and Kilmaine The doctor may bring despatches and you follow us with the first to come An orderly had led forth a saddled horse and Blake s foot was already in the stirrup They say it was Red Fox himself Kennedy he added Where on earth did you meet him before Shure I niver knew him sorr was the quick reply as Blake s long lean leg swung over the big charger s back and the rider settled in saddle But he knew you perfectly well He dared you by name when we closed on them you and mister Field And when an hour later the veteran surgeon came and knelt by the side of the young officer reported seriously wounded and took his hand and felt his pulse there was something in the situation that seemed to call for immediate action We ll get you back to Frayne to morrow Field said Waller with kind intent Don t worry now Don t do that doctor feebly surprisingly moaned the fevered lad Don t take me back to Frayne CHAPTER XIV A VANISHED HEROINE Within forty eight hours of the coming of Trooper Kennedy with his rush despatches to Fort Frayne the actors in our little drama had become widely separated Webb and his sturdy squadron including Ray and such of his troop as still had mounts and no serious wounds were marching straight on for the Dry Fork of the Powder They were two hundred fighting men and although the Sioux had now three times that many they had learned too much of the shooting powers of these seasoned troopers and deemed it wise to avoid close contact The Indian fights well man for man when fairly cornered but at other times he is no true sportsman He asks for odds of ten to one as when he wiped out Custer on the Greasy Grass or Fetteman at Fort Phil Kearny as when he tackled the Gray Fox General Crook on the Rosebud and Sibley s little party among the pines of the Big Horn Ray s plucky followers had shot viciously and emptied far too many saddles for Indian equanimity It might be well in any event to let Webb s squadron through and wait for further accessions from the agencies at the southeast or the big turbulent bands of Uncapapas and Minneconjous at Standing Rock or the Cheyennes along the Yellowstone So back went Lame Wolf and his braves bearing Stabber with them flitting northward again toward the glorious country beyond the Chakadee and on went Webb with Blake Gregg Ray and their juniors with Tracy to take care of such as might be wounded on the way and later still the old post surgeon reached the Elk with guards and hospital attendants and on the morrow row began his homeward march with the dead and wounded a sad and solemn little procession Only twenty miles he had to go but it took long hours so few were the ambulances so rough the crossings of the ravines and not until near nightfall was the last of the wounded Lieutenant Field borne in the arms of pitying soldiers into the old post hospital too far gone with fever exhaustion and some strong mental excitement to know or care that his strange plea had been perforce disregarded to know or care later that the general himself the commander they loved and trusted was bending over him at dawn the following day Ordering forward all available troops from the line of the railway the Chief had stopped at Laramie only long enough for brief conference with the post commander then bidding him come on with all his cavalry had pushed ahead for Frayne It couldn t be a long campaign perhaps with winter close at hand but it would be a lively one Of that the chief felt well assured Now there was something uncanny about this outbreak on the part of the Sioux and the general was puzzled Up to September the Indians had been busy with the annual hunt They were fat well fed prosperous had got from the government pretty much everything that they could ask with any show of reason and so they said had been promised more The rows between the limited few of their young men and some bullies among the rustlers had been no more frequent nor serious than on previous summers when matters had been settled without resort to arms but this year the very devil seemed to have got into the situation Something or probably somebody said the general had been stirring the Indians up exciting exhorting possibly and almost the first thing the general did as he climbed stiffly out of his stout Concord wagon in the paling starlight of the early morning was to turn to Dade now commanding the post and to say he should like as soon as possible to see Bill Hay Meantime he wished to go in and look at the wounded It was not yet five o clock but doctor Waller was up and devoting himself to the needs of his patients and Dade had coffee ready for the general and his single aide de camp but not a sip would the general take until he had seen the stricken troopers He knew Field by reputation well and favorably He had intimately known Field s father in the old days in the old army when they served together on the then wild Pacific shores where rolls the Oregon The great civil war had divided them for Field had cast his soldier fortune with his seceding State but all that was a thing of the past Here was the son a loyal soldier of the flag the father had again sworn allegiance to when he took his seat in the House of Representatives The general thought highly of Field and was sore troubled at his serious condition He knew what despatches would be coming from the far South when the telegraph line began the busy clicking of the morning He was troubled to find the lad in high fever and to hear that he had been out of his head He was more than troubled at the concern and something like confusion in the old doctor s face You don t think him dangerously wounded do you he asked Not dangerously general was the reply It s well he seems to have something on his mind And more than this the doctor would not say It was not for him to tell the chief what Webb had confided ere he left the post that most of the currency for which Field was accountable was so much waste paper Field lay muttering and tossing in restless misery unconscious most of the time and sleeping only when under the influence of a strong narcotic Dade with sadness and constraint apparent in his manner hung back and did not enter the bare hospital room where with only a steward in attendance the young soldier lay The doctor had gone with the general to the bedside but the captain remained out of earshot at the door First call for reveille was just sounding on the infantry bugles as the trio came forth I have sent for Hay already general Dade was saying as they stood on the wooden veranda overlooking the valley of the murmuring river but will you not come now and have coffee He can join us over at my quarters Already however the orderly was hurrying back They met him when not half way over to the line of officers quarters The few men for duty in the two companies of infantry left to guard the post were gathering in little groups in front of their barracks awaiting the sounding of the assembly They knew the chief at a glance and were curiously watching him as he went thoughtfully pacing across the parade by the side of the temporary commander They saw the orderly coming almost at a run from the direction of the guard house saw him halt and salute evidently making some report but they could not guess what made him so suddenly start and run at speed toward the southward bluff the direction of the trader s corral and stables while Captain Dade whirled about and signalled Sergeant Crabb of the cavalry left behind in charge of the few custodians of the troop barracks Crabb too threw dignity to the winds and ran at the beck of his superior officer Have you two men who can ride hard a dozen miles or so and carry out their orders was the captain s sharp demand Certainly sir answered Crabb professionally resentful that such question should be asked of men of the th Cavalry Send two to report to me at once mounted Never mind breakfast And by this time apparently the chief the post commander and possibly even the aide de camp had forgotten about the waiting coffee They still stood there where they had halted in the centre of the parade The doctor coming from hospital was signalled to and speedily joined them The bugle sounded the men mechanically formed ranks and answered to their names all the while watching from the corner of their eyes the group of officers now increased by two infantry subalterns Lieutenants Bruce and Duncan who raised their caps to the preoccupied general such salutation being then a fashion not a regulation of the service and stood silently awaiting instructions for something of consequence was surely at hand Then the orderly again appeared returning from his mission out of breath and speaking with difficulty Craps I mean the Frenchman sir says it was after four perhaps half past when they started Pete drivin He didn t see who was in it Twas the covered buckboard he took sir the best one And then little by little it transpired that Hay the post trader whom the general had need to see had taken his departure by way of the Rawlins road and without so much as a whisper of his purpose to any one I knew he had thought of going He told Major Webb so said Dade presently But that was before the outbreak assumed proportions He had given up all idea of it yesterday and so told me Has anything happened to start him since then demanded the bearded general after a moment s thought Dade and the doctor looked into each other s eyes and the latter turned away It was not his affair W ell something has happened general was Dade s slow constrained reply If you will step this way I ll see you later gentlemen this to his subalterns I ll explain as far as I can And while doctor Waller fell back and walked beside the aide de camp gladly leaving to the post commander the burden of a trying explanation the general slowly pacing by the captain s side gave ear to his story Hay cleaned up quite a lot of money began the veteran and had intended starting it to Cheyenne when this Indian trouble broke out The courier reached us during the night as you know and the major ordered Ray to start at dawn and Field to go with him Why I thought Field was post adjutant interposed the general He was but well I beg you to let Major Webb give you his own reasons general faltered Dade sorely embarrassed He decided that Field should go He asked to go I suppose It runs in the blood said the general quickly with a keen look from his blue gray eyes I think not sir but you will see Webb within a few days and he will tell you all about it What I know is this that Field was ordered to go and that he gave the major an order on Hay for two packages containing the money for which he was accountable Field and Wilkins had had a falling out and instead of putting the cash in the quartermaster s safe Field kept it at Hay s At guard mounting Hay brought the package to the major who opened both in presence of the officers of the day Each package was supposed to contain three or four hundred dollars Neither contained twenty Some paper slips inserted between five dollar bills made up the packages Field was then far to the north and past conferring with Hay was amazed and distressed said that someone must have duplicate keys of his safe as well as of his stables Why the stables asked the chief pausing at the gate and studying the troubled face of the honored soldier he so well knew and so fully trusted He was thinking too how this was not the first occasion that the loss of public money had been hidden for the time in just that way slips inserted between good currency Because it transpires that some of his horses were out that very night without his consent or ken No one for a moment to my knowledge has connected Field with the loss of the money Hay thought however it threw suspicion on him and was mightily upset Then his sudden departure at this time without a word to anybody looks odd said the general thoughtfully But he had no need of money He s one of the wealthiest men in Wyoming And she his wife needs nothing He gives her all she can possibly want By this time they were at the door A lamp still burned dimly in the hallway and Dade blew it out as he ushered the general into the cosily lighted dining room You ll excuse missus Dade and Esther I hope sir They are not yet up quite overcome by anxiety and excitement there s been a lot about Frayne the last two days Take this chair General Coffee will be served at once No sir as you say the Hays have no need of money he and his wife that is But you suspect whom asked the general the blue gray eyes intent on the troubled face before him for Dade s very hesitancy told of some untold theory The doctor and the aide had taken seats at the other end of the table and dutifully engaged in low toned conversation That is a hard question for me to answer General was the answer I have no right to suspect anybody We had no time to complete the investigation There are many hangers on you know about Hay s store and indeed his house Then his household too has been increased as perhaps you did not know missus Hay s niece a very brilliant young woman is visiting them and she and Field rode frequently together The general s face was a study The keen eyes were reading Dade as a skilled physician would interpret the symptoms of a complicated case How old and what is she like Dade he asked The women can answer that better than I sir They say she must be twenty four missus Hay says nineteen She is very dark and very handsome at times Most of our young men seem to think so at least She certainly rides and dances admirably and mister Field was constantly her partner The general began to see light Field was constantly with her was he Riding just by themselves or with others when they went out he asked By themselves sir I doubt if any other of our equestriennes would care to ride at her pace She rather outstrips them all The major told me they seemed to go well every time he saw them at least up to Stabber s village and that was something he disapproved of though I dare say she was simply curious to see an Indian village as an Eastern girl might be Possibly said the general And what did you tell me she is missus Hay s niece I don t remember his having any niece when they were at Laramie in sixty six though I knew something of missus Hay who was then but a short time married She spoke Sioux and patois French better than English in those days What is the young lady s name Miss Flower sir Nanette Flower The chief dropped his head on his hand and reflected It s a good twenty years and I ve been knocking about all over the West since then but I d like to see missus Hay and that young woman Dade whether we overhaul Bill or not I must go on to Beecher at once You will wait for the cavalry from Laramie will you not sir asked the captain anxiously I can t I ll get a bath and breakfast and forty winks later then see missus Hay and Bill if he is back They ought to catch him before he reaches Sage Creek There are your couriers now he added at the sound of spurred heels on the front piazza The captain stepped forth into the hallway A trooper stood at the front door his hand lifted in salute Another in saddle and holding the reins of his comrade s horse was at the gate A rustle of feminine drapery swept downward from the upper floor and Dade glanced up half dreading to see Esther s face But it was his wife who peered over the balustrade I shall be down in ten minutes she said in low tone Esther is sleeping at last How did he seem this morning Sleeping too but only fitfully doctor Waller is here and then Dade would have ended the talk He did not wish to speak further of Field or his condition But she called again low toned yet dominant as is many a wife in and out of the army Surely you are not letting the general start with only two men No he goes by and by And again Dade would have escaped to the piazza but once again she held him Then where are you sending these After mister Hay He made an early start not knowing perhaps the general was coming Start she cried all excitement now Start Start for where and the dressing sacque in aspen like agitations came in full view at the head of the stairs Rawlins I suppose I don t know what it means But I do exclaimed his better half in emotion uncontrollable I do It means that she has made him that she has gone too I mean Nanette Flower CHAPTER XV A WOMAN S PLOT Woman s intuition often far outstrips the slower mental process of the other sex The mother who has to see a beloved daughter s silent suffering well knowing another girl to be however indirectly the cause of it sees all manner of other iniquities in that other girl Kind charitable and gentle was missus Dade a wise mother too as well as most loving but she could look with neither kindness nor charity on Miss Flower She had held her peace allowed no word of censure or criticism to escape her when the women were discussing that young lady but all the more vehement was her distrust because thus pent up and repressed With the swiftness of feminine thought for no man had yet suspected she fathomed the secret of the trader s sudden going and carried away by the excitement of the moment and the belief that none but her husband could hear she had made that startling announcement And her intuition was unerring Nanette Flower was indeed gone Yet for nearly an hour she stood alone in her conviction Her husband quickly cautioned silence and going forth gave instructions to the couriers that sent them speeding for the Rawlins road But at seven o clock missus Hay herself appeared and asked to see the general who was taking at the moment his accustomed bracer tonic and stimulant the only kind he was ever known to use a cold bath So it was to missus Dade in all apparent frankness and sincerity the trader s wife began her tale Everyone at Frayne well knew that her anxiety as to the outcome of the battle on the Elk had well nigh equalled that of the wives and sweethearts within the garrison While her niece after the first day s excitement kept to her room the aunt went flitting from house to house full of sympathy and suggestion but obviously more deeply concerned than they had ever seen her Now she seemed worried beyond words at thought of her husband s having to go at just this time It was mainly on Nanette s account she said Only last night with the mail from Laramie had come a letter posted in San Francisco the week before telling Miss Flower that her dearest friend and roommate for four years at school who had been on an extended bridal tour would pass through Rawlins eastward bound on Friday s train and begging Nanette to meet her and go as far at least as Cheyenne Her husband it seems had been hurriedly recalled to New York and there was no help for it Nanette had expected to join her and go all the way East in late October or early November had given her promise in fact for she was vastly excited by the news and despite headache and lassitude that had oppressed her for two days past she declared she must go and Uncle Will must take her So with only a small trunk hastily packed of her belongings and an iron bound chest of the trader s the two had started before dawn in Uncle Bill s stout buckboard behind his famous four mule team with Pete to drive and two sturdy ranchmen as outriders hoping to reach the Medicine Bow by late afternoon and rest at Brenner s Ranch Confidentially missus Hay told missus Dade that her husband was glad of the excuse to take the route up the Platte instead of the old rough trail southeastward over the mountains to Rock Creek for he had a large sum in currency to get to the bank and there were desperados along the mountain route who well knew he would have to send that money in and were surely on lookout to waylay him or it Ever since pay day two or three rough characters had been hanging about the store and Hay suspected they were watching his movements with the intention of getting word to their comrades in crime the moment he started and it was almost as much to steal a march on them as to oblige Nanette he so willingly left before it was light The Rawlins road followed the Platte Valley all the way to Brenner s and once there he would feel safe whereas the Rock Creek trail wound through gulch ravine and forest most of the distance affording many a chance for ambuscade Of course said missus Hay if her husband had for a moment supposed the general would wish to see him he would not have gone adding with just a little touch of proper wifelike spirit that on the general s previous visits he had never seemed to care whether he saw mister Hay or not All this did missus Dade accept with courteous yet guarded interest They were seated in the little army parlor talking in low tone for with unfailing tact missus Hay had asked for Esther and expressed her sympathy on hearing of her being unnerved by the excitement through which they had passed Well she knew that Field s serious condition had not a little to do with poor Esther s prostration but that was knowledge never to be hinted at Dade himself she did not wish to meet just now He was too direct a questioner and had said and looked things about Nanette that made her dread him She knew that however austere and commanding he might be when acting under his own convictions he was abnormally susceptible to uxorial views and the way to win the captain s sympathies or avert his censure was to secure the kindly interest of his wife missus Hay knew that he had sent couriers off by the Rawlins road a significant thing in itself and that couriers had come in from the north with further news from Webb She knew he had gone to the office and would probably remain there until summoned for breakfast and now was her time for there was something further to be spoken of and while gentle and civil missus Dade had not been receptive It was evident to the trader s wife that her lord and master had made a mistake in leaving when he did He knew the general was on the way He knew there was that money business to be cleared up yet she knew there were reasons why she wanted him away reasons hardest of all to plausibly explain There were reasons indeed why she was glad Nanette was gone All Fort Frayne was devoted to Esther Dade and however unjustly most of Fort Frayne men women and children attributed Field s defection as they chose to call it to Nanette Nanette who had set at naught her aunt s most ardent wishes in even noticing Field at all Money education everything she could give had been lavished on that girl and now instead of casting her net for that well to do and distinguished bachelor the major thereby assuring for herself the proud position of first lady of Fort Frayne the wife of the commanding officer Nanette had been deliberately throwing herself away at a beardless moneyless second lieutenant because he danced and rode well missus Hay did not blame missus Dade at that moment for hating the girl if hate she did She could have shaken her hard and well herself yet was utterly nonplussed to find that Nanette cared next to nothing how badly Field was wounded What she seemed to care to know was about the casualties among the Sioux and now that Stabber s village the last living trace of it old men squaws children pappooses ponies and puppies and other living creatures had between two days been whisked away to the hills there were no more Indians close at hand to whisper information She was glad Nanette was gone because Field wounded and present would have advantages over possible suitors absent on campaign because all the women and a few of the men were now against her and because from some vague intangible symptoms missus Hay had satisfied herself that there was something in the wind Nanette was hiding even from her her benefactress her best friend and it seemed like cold blooded treachery Hay had for two days been disturbed nervous and unhappy yet would not tell her why He had been cross questioning Pete Crapaud and other employees and searching about the premises in a way that excited curiosity and even resentment for the explanation he gave was utterly inadequate To satisfy her if possible he had confided as he said the fact that certain money for which Lieutenant Field was accountable had been stolen The cash had been carefully placed in his old fashioned safe the missing money therefore had been taken while still virtually in his charge They might even suspect me he said which she knew would not be the case They forbade my speaking of it to anybody but I simply had to tell you She felt sure there was something he was concealing something he would not tell her something concerning Nanette therefore because she so loved Nanette he shrank from revealing what might wound her Indeed it was best that Nanette should go for the time at least but missus Hay little dreamed that others would be saying even this kindly gentle woman before her that Nanette should have stayed until certain strange things were thoroughly and satisfactorily explained But the moment she began faltering not a little to speak of matters at the post as a means of leading up to Nanette matters concerning Lieutenant Field and his financial affairs to her surprise missus Dade gently uplifted her hand and voice I am going to ask you not to tell me missus Hay said she Captain Dade has given me to understand there was something to be investigated but preferred that I should not ask about it Now the general will be down in fifteen or twenty minutes I suggest that we walk over the hospital and see how mister Field is getting on We can talk you know as we go Then you will breakfast with us Indeed may I not give you a cup of coffee now missus Hay But missus Hay said no She had had coffee before coming She would go and see if there was anything they could do for Field and would try again to induce missus Dade to listen to certain of her explanations But missus Dade was silent and preoccupied She was thinking of that story of Nanette s going and wondering whether it could be true She was wondering if missus Hay knew the couriers had gone to recall Hay and that if he and Nanette failed to return it might mean trouble for both She could accord to missus Hay no confidences of her own and had been compelled to decline to listen to those with which missus Hay would have favored her She was thinking of something still more perplexing The general as her husband finally told her had asked first thing to see Hay and later declared that he wished to talk with missus Hay and see Nanette Was it possible he knew anything of what she knew that between Hay s household and Stabber s village there had been communication of some kind that the first thing found in the Indian pouch brought home by Captain Blake was a letter addressed in Nanette Flower s hand and with it three card photographs two of them of unmistakable Indians in civilized garb and two letters addressed like hers to mister Ralph Moreau one care of the reverend Jasper Strong Valentine Nebraska the other to the general delivery Omaha Yes that pouch brought in by Captain Blake had contained matter too weighty for one woman wise as she was to keep to herself missus Blake with her husband s full consent had summoned missus Ray soon after his departure on the trail of Webb and told her of the strange discovery They promptly decided there was only one thing to do with the letter hand or send it unopened to Miss Flower Then as Blake had had no time to examine further they decided to search the pouch There might be more letters in the same superscription But there were not They found tobacco beeswax an empty flask that had contained whiskey vaseline Pond s Extract salve pigments a few sheets of note paper envelopes and pencil odd things to find in the possession of a Sioux a burning glass matches some quinine pills cigars odds and ends of little consequence and those letters addressed to R Moreau The first one they had already decided should go to Miss Flower The others they thought should be handed unopened to the commanding officer They might contain important information now that the Sioux were at war and that Ralph Moreau had turned out probably to be a real personage But first they would consult missus Dade They had done so the very evening of Blake s departure even as he long miles away was telling Kennedy his Irish heart was safe from the designs of one blood thirsty Sioux and missus Dade had agreed with them that Nanette s letter should be sent to her forthwith and that as Captain Blake had brought it in the duty of returning the letter devolved upon his wife And so after much thought and consultation a little note was written saying nothing about the other contents or about the pouch itself Dear Miss Flower it read The enclosed was found by Captain Blake some time this morning He had no time to deliver it in person Yours sincerely N B Blake She would enter into no explanation and would say nothing of the consultation She could not bring herself to sign her name as usually she signed it Nannie Bryan Blake She had as any man or woman would have had a consuming desire to know what Miss Flower could be writing to a mister Moreau whose correspondence turned up in this remarkable way in the pouch of a painted Sioux But she and they deemed it entirely needless to assure Miss Flower no alien eye had peered into the mysterious pages It might have resulted in marvellous developments if Miss Flower thought they had Note and enclosure were sent first thing next morning by the trusty hand of Master Sanford Ray himself and by him delivered in person to Miss Flower who met him at the trader s gate She took it he said and smiled and thanked him charmingly before she opened it She was coming out for her customary walk at the hour of guard mounting but the next thing he knew she had scooted indoors again And from that moment Miss Flower had not been seen All this was missus Dade revolving in mind as she walked pityingly by the side of the troubled woman only vaguely listening to her flow of words They had thought to be admitted to the little room in which the wounded officer lay but as they tiptoed into the wide airy hall and looked over the long vista of pink striped coverlets in the big ward beyond the doctor himself appeared at the entrance and barred the way Is there nothing we can do asked missus Dade with tears in her voice Is he so much worse Nothing can be done just now answered Waller gravely He has had high fever during the night has been wakeful and flighty again I should rather no one entered just now And then they noted that even the steward who had been with poor Field was now hovering about the door of the dispensary and that only doctor Waller remained within the room I am hoping to get him to sleep again presently said he And when he is mending there will be a host of things for you both to do But that mending seemed many a day off and missus Hay poor woman had graver cares of her own before the setting sun Avoiding the possibility of meeting the general just now and finding missus Dade both silent and constrained at mention of her niece s name the trader s wife went straightway homeward from the hospital and did not even see the post commander hurrying from his office with an open despatch in his hand But by this time the chief and his faithful aide were out on the veranda surrounded by anxious wives and daughters many of whom had been earnestly bothering the doctor at the hospital before going to breakfast Dade much wished them away though the news brought in by night riders was both stirring and cheery The Indians had flitted away from Webb s front and he counted on reaching and rescuing the Dry Fork party within six hours from the time the courier started They might expect the good news during the afternoon of Thursday Scouts and flankers reported finding travois and pony tracks leading westward from the scene of Ray s fierce battle indicating that the Indians had carried their dead and wounded into the fastnesses of the southern slopes of the Big Horn and that their punishment had been heavy Among the chiefs killed or seriously wounded was this new vehement leader whom Captains Blake and Ray thought might be Red Fox who was so truculent at the Black Hills conference the previous year Certain of the men however who had seen Red Fox at that time expressed doubts Lieutenant Field said Webb had seen him and could probably say Over this despatch the general pondered gravely From what I know of Red Fox said he I should think him a leader of the Sitting Bull type a shrew intriguing mischief making fellow a sort of Sioux walking delegate not a battle leader but according to Blake and Ray this new man is a fighter Then missus Dade came out and bore the general off to breakfast and during breakfast the chief was much preoccupied missus Dade and the aide de camp chatted on social matters The general exchanged an occasional word with his host and hostess and finally surprised neither of them when breakfast was over and he had consumed the last of his glass of hot water by saying to his staff officer I should like to see missus Hay a few minutes if possible We ll walk round there first Then let the team be ready at ten o clock But the team although ready did not start northward at ten and the general though he saw missus Hay had no speech with her upon the important matters uppermost in his mind during the earlier hours of the day He found that good lady in a state of wild excitement and alarm One of the two outriders who had started with her husband and niece at dawn was mounted on a dun colored cow pony with white face and feet One of the two troopers sent by Dade to overtake and bring them back was turning a blown and exhausted horse over to the care of Hay s stablemen as he briefly told his story to the wild eyed well nigh distracted woman Six miles up stream he said they had come suddenly upon a dun colored cow pony dead in his tracks with white feet in air and white muzzle bathed in blood bridle saddle and rider gone signs of struggle in places but no signs of the party the team and wagon anywhere And no cavalry to send out after them said Dade when he reached the spot Old Crabb was called at once and mustered four semi invalided troopers The infantry supplied half a dozen stout riders and with a mixed escort the general accompanied by Dade and the aide de camp drove swiftly to the scene Six miles away they found the dead pony Seven miles away they encountered the second trooper coming back He had followed the trail of the four mule team as far as yonder point said he and there was met by half a dozen shots from unseen foe and so rode back out of range But Dade threw his men forward as skirmishers found no living soul either at the point or on the banks of the rocky ford beyond but in the shallows close to the shore lay the body of the second outrider shot and scalped In a clump of willows lay another body that of a pinto pony hardly cold while the soft sandy shores were cut by dozens of hoof tracks shoeless The tracks of the mules and wagon lay straight away across the stream bed up the opposite bank and out on the northward sweeping bench beyond Hay s famous four and well known wagon contents and all therefore had been spirited away not toward the haunts of the road agents in the mountains of the Medicine Bow but to those of the sovereign Sioux in the fastnesses of the storied Big Horn CHAPTER XVI NIGHT PROWLING AT FRAYNE In the full of the September moon the war bands of the Sioux had defied agents and peace chiefs commissioners and soldiers and started their wild campaign in northern Wyoming In the full of the October moon the big chief of the whites had swept the last vestige of their warriors from the plains and followed their bloody trails into the heart of the mountains all his cavalry and much of his foot force being needed for the work in hand Not until November therefore when the ice bridge spanned the still reaches of the Platte and the snow lay deep in the brakes and coulees did the foremost of the homeward bound commands come in view of old Fort Frayne and meantime very remarkable things had occurred and it was to a very different if only temporary post commander that Sandy Ray reported them as sighted Even brave old Dade had been summoned to the front with all his men and in their place had come from distant posts in Kansas other troops to occupy the vacant quarters and strive to feel at home in strange surroundings A man of austere mold was the new major one of the old Covenanter type who would march to battle shouting hymn tunes and to Christmas and Thanksgiving chanting doleful lays He hailed indeed from old Puritan stock had been a pillar in the village church in days before the great war and emulated Stonewall Jackson in his piety if he did not in martial prowess Backed by local and by no means secular influences he had risen in the course of the four years war from a junior lieutenancy to the grade of second in command of his far eastern regiment had rendered faithful services in command of convalescent camps and the like but developed none of that vain ambition which prompts the seeking of the bubble reputation at the cannon s mouth All he ever knew of Southern men in ante bellum days was what he heard from the lips of inspired orators or read from the pens of very earnest anti slavery editors Through lack of opportunity he had met no Southerner before the war and carried his stanch Calvinistic prejudices to such extent that he seemed to shrink from closer contact even then The war was holy The hand of the Lord would surely smite the slave holding arch rebel which was perhaps why the Covenanter thought it work of supererogation to raise his own He finished as he began the war in the unalterable conviction that the Southern President his cabinet and all his leading officers should be hung and their lands confiscated to the state or its representatives He had been given a commission in the army when such things were not hard to get at the reorganization in sixty six had been stationed in a Ku Klux district all one winter and in a sanitarium most of the year that followed He thought the nation on the highroad to hell when it failed to impeach the President of high crimes and misdemeanors and sent Hancock to harmonize matters in Louisiana He was sure of it when the son of a Southerner who had openly flouted him was sent to West Point He retained these radical views even unto the twentieth anniversary of the great surrender and while devoutly praying for forgiveness of his own sins could never seem to forgive those whose lot had been cast with the South He was utterly nonplussed when told that the young officer languishing in hospital on his arrival was the son of a distinguished major general of the Confederate Army and he planned for the father a most frigid greeting until reminded that the former major general was now a member of Congress and of the committee on military affairs Then it became his duty to overlook the past He had not entered Field s little room even when inspecting hospital Flint was forever inspecting something or other the doctor s assurance that though feeble his patient was doing quite well was all sufficient He had thought to greet the former Confederate a sorely anxious father with grave and distant civility as an avowed and doubtless unregenerate enemy of that sacred flag but as has been said that was before it was pointed out to him that this was the Honorable M C from the Pelican State now prominent as a member of the House Committee on Military Affairs Motherless and sister less was the wounded boy yet gentle and almost caressing hands had blessed his pillow and helped to drive fever and delirium to the winds It was twelve days after they brought him back to Frayne before the father could hope to reach him coming post haste too but by that time the lad was propped on his pillows weak sorrowing and sorely troubled none the less so because there was no one now to whom he could say why The men whom he knew and trusted were all away on campaign all save the veteran post surgeon whom hitherto he had felt he hardly knew at all The women whom he had best known and trusted were still present at the post missus Ray and missus Blake had been his friends frank cordial and sincere up to the week of his return from Laramie and his sudden and overwhelming infatuation for Nanette Flower Then they had seemed to hold aloof to greet him only with courtesy and to eye him with unspoken reproach The woman at Fort Frayne to whom he most looked up was missus Dade and now missus Dade seemed alienated utterly She had been to inquire for him frequently said his attendant when he was so racked with fever So had others and they sent him now jellies and similar delicacies but came no more in person just yet at least but he did not know the doctor so desired Field knew that his father after the long long journey from the distant South was now close at hand would be with him within a few hours and even with Ray s warm words of praise still ringing in his ears the young soldier was looking to that father s coming almost with distress It was through God s mercy and the wisdom of the old surgeon that no word as yet had been whispered to him of the discovery made when the money packages were opened of the tragic fate that had possibly befallen Bill Hay and Miss Flower That a large sum of money was missing and that Field was the accountable officer was already whispered about the garrison The fact that four officers and mister Hay were aware of it in the first place and the latter had told it to his wife was fatal to entire secrecy But in the horror and excitement that prevailed when the details of the later tragedy were noised about the post this minor incident had been almost forgotten The disappearance of Hay and his brilliant beautiful niece however was not to be forgotten for a moment day or night despite the fact that missus Hay who had been almost crazed with dread and terror when first informed there had been a hold up rallied almost immediately and took heart and hope when it became apparent that Indians not white men were the captors The Sioux would never harm a hair of his head she proudly declared He has been their friend for half a century Nor had she fears for Nanette The Sioux would harm nobody her husband sought to protect When it was pointed out to her that they had harmed the guards that one of them was found shot dead and scalped at the shores of the Platte and the other poor fellow had crawled off among the rocks and bled to death within gunshot of the scene missus Hay said they must have first shown fight and shot some of the Sioux for all the Indians knew mister Hay s wagon Then why asked Fort Frayne had they molested him and his The general had had to leave for the front without seeing missus Hay More than ever was it necessary that he should be afield for this exploit showed that some of the Sioux at least had cut loose from the main body and had circled back toward the Platte Stabber s people in all probability So sending Crabb and his little squad across the river to follow a few miles at least the trail of the wagon and its captors and ascertain if possible whither it had gone he hurried back to Frayne sent messengers by the Laramie road to speed the cavalry and orders to the colonel to send two troops at once to rescue Hay and his niece sent wires calling for a few reinforcements and was off on the way to Beecher guarded by a handful of sturdy doughboys in ambulances before ever the body of the second victim was found And then little by little it transpired that this mysterious war party venturing to the south bank of the Platte did not exceed half a dozen braves Crabb got back in thirty six hours with five exhausted men They had followed the wheel tracks over the open prairie and into the foothills far to the Northwest emboldened by the evidence of there being but few ponies in the original bandit escort But by four in the afternoon they got among the breaks and ravines and first thing they knew among the Indians for zip came the bullets and down went two horses and they had to dismount and fight to stand off possible swarms and though owning they had seen no Indians they had proof of having felt them and were warranted in pushing no further After dark they began their slow retreat and here they were And for seven days that was the last heard by the garrison at least of these most recent captives of the Sioux Gentle and sympathetic women however who called on missus Hay were prompt to note that though unnerved unstrung distressed she declared again and again her faith that the Indians would never really harm her husband They might hold him and Nanette as hostages for ransom They might take for their own purposes his wagon his mules and that store of money but his life was safe yes and Nanette s too Of this she was so confident that people began to wonder whether she had not received some assurance to that effect and when Pete the stable boy driver turned up at the end of the first week with a cock and bull story about having stolen an Indian pony and shot his way from the midst of the Sioux away up on No Wood Creek on the west side of the hills and having ridden by night and hidden by day until he got back to the Platte and Frayne people felt sure of it Pete could talk Sioux better than he could jabber English He declared the Indians were in the hills by thousands and were going to take Hay and the young lady away off somewhere to be held for safe keeping He said the two troops that never even halting at Frayne had pushed out on the trail would only get into trouble if they tried to enter the hills from the South and that they would never get the captives wherein Pete was right for away out among the spurs and gorges of the range fifty miles from Frayne the pursuers came upon the wreck of the wagon at the foot of an acclivity up which a force of Sioux had gone in single file Many warriors it would seem however must have joined the party on the way and from here where with the wagon was found Hay s stout box bereft of its contents in four different directions the pony tracks of little parties crossed or climbed the spurs and which way the captives had been taken Captain Billings the commander could not determine What the Sioux hoped he might do was divide his force into four detachments and send one on each trail Then they could fall upon them one by one and slay them at their leisure Billings saw the game however and was not to be caught He knew Bill Hay his past and his popularity among the red men He knew that if they meant to kill him at all they would not have taken the trouble to cart him fifty miles beforehand He dropped the stern chase then and there and on the following day skirted the foothills away to the east and circling round to the breaks of the Powder as he reached the open country struck and hard hit a scouting band of Sioux and joined the general three days later when most he was needed near the log palisades of old Fort Beecher Then there had been more or less of mysterious coming and going among the halfbreed hangers on about the trader s store and these were things the new post commander knew not how to interpret even when informed of them He saw missus Hay but once or twice He moved into the quarters of Major Webb possessing himself until his own should arrive of such of the major s belongings as the vigilance of Mistress McGann would suffer He stationed big guards from his two small companies about the post and started more hard swearing among his own men for getting only two nights in bed than had been heard at Frayne in long months of less pious post commandership He strove to make himself agreeable to the ladies left lamenting for their lords but as luck would have it fell foremost into the clutches of the quartermaster s wife the dominant and unterrified Wilkins Just what prompted that energetic and in many ways estimable woman to take the new major into close communion and tell him not only what she knew but what she thought about all manner of matters at the post can never be justly determined But within the first few days of his coming and on the eve of the arrival of General Field Major Flint was in possession of the story of how devoted young Field had been to Esther Dade and how cruelly he had jilted her for the brilliant Miss Flower her that was gone with the Sioux The differences between her stout veteran liege and the smooth faced stripling had given her text to start with The story of the money lost had filtered from her lips and finally that of other peccadilloes attributable to the young post adjutant whom as she said The meejor had to rejuice and sind to the front all along of his doin s in gar son Dade was gone There was no man save Wilkins to whom Major Flint felt that he could appeal for confirmation or denial of these stories doctor Waller was his senior in the service by ten years at least and a type of the old time officer and gentleman of whom such as Flint stood ever in awe He preferred therefore as he thought to keep the doctor at a distance to make him feel the immensity of his the post commander s station and so as Wilkins dare not disavow the sayings of his wife even had he been so minded the stories stood Flint was thinking of them this very evening when doctor Waller happening to meet him on his way from hospital briefly said that General Field should be with them on the morrow He leaves Rock Creek to night having hired transportation there I had hoped our lad might be in better spirits by this time The major answered vaguely How could a lad with all these sins upon his soul be in anything but low spirits Here was a brand to be snatched from the burning a youth whom prompt stern measures might redeem and restore one who should be taught the error of his ways forthwith only the coming of the member of the Military Committee of the House of Representatives might make the process embarrassing There were other ways therefore and however in which this valuable information in the major s possession might be put to use and of these was the major thinking more than of the condition of the wounded lad physical or spiritual as homeward through the gloaming he wended his way Might it not be well to wait until this important and influential personage had reached the post before proceeding further Might it not be well confidentially and gradually as it were to permit the Honorable M C to know that grave irregularities had occurred that up to this moment the complete knowledge thereof was locked in the breast of the present post commander that the suppression or presentation of the facts depended solely upon that post commander and then if the member of the House Committee on Military Affairs proved receptive appreciative in fact responsive might not the ends of justice better be subserved by leaving to the parent the duty of personally and privately correcting the son and in consideration of the post commander s wisdom and continence pledging the influence of the Military Committee to certain delectable ends in the major s behalf Long had Flint had his eye on a certain desirable berth in the distant East at the national capitol in fact but never yet had he found statesman or soldier inclined to further his desire That night the major bade mister and missus Wilkins hold their peace as to Field s peccadilloes until further leave was given them to speak That night the major calling at Captain Dade s was concerned to hear that missus Dade was not at home Gone over to the hospital with missus Blake and the doctor was the explanation and these gentle hearted women it seems were striving to do something to rouse the lad from the slough of despond which had engulfed him That night Pink Marble Hay s faithful book keeper and clerk for many a year a one armed veteran of the civil war calling as was his invariable custom when the trader was absent to leave the keys of the safe and desks with missus Hay was surprised to find her in a flood of tears for which she declined all explanation yet the sight of Pete the half breed slouching away toward the stables as Marble closed the gate more than suggested cause for Pink had long disapproved of that young man That night Crapaud the other stableman had scandalized Jerry Sullivan the bar keeper and old McGann Webb s Hibernian major domo by interrupting their game of Old Sledge with a demand for a quart of whiskey on top of all that he had obviously and surreptitiously been drinking and by further indulging in furious threats in a sputtering mixture of Dakota French and French Dakota when summarily kicked out That night late as twelve o clock missus Ray aroused by the infantile demands of the fourth of the olive branches and further disturbed by the suspicious growlings and challenge of old Tonto Blake s veteran mastiff peeped from the second story window and plainly saw two forms in soldier overcoats at the back fence and wondered what the sentries found about Blake s quarters to require so much attention Then she became aware of a third form rifle bearing and slowly pacing the curving line of the bluff the sentry beyond doubt Who then were these others who had now totally disappeared She thought to speak of it to Nannie in the morning and then thought not There were reasons why nervous alarm of any kind were best averted then from missus Blake But there came reason speedily why missus Ray could not forget it And that night later still along toward four o clock the persistent clicking of the telegraph instrument at the adjutant s office caught the ear of the sentry who in time stirred up the operator and a rush message was later thrust into the hand of Major Flint demolishing a day old castle in the air FROM ROCK CREEK WYOMING October twenty three one hundred eighty eight nine fifteen P M COMMANDING OFFICER FORT FRAYNE via Fort Laramie Stage capsized Crook Canon General Field seriously injured Have wired Omaha Signed Warner Commanding Camp CHAPTER XVII A RIFLED DESK Events moved swiftly in the week that followed Particulars of the accident to General Field however were slow in reaching Fort Frayne and to the feverish unrest and mental trouble of the son was now added a feverish anxiety on the father s account that so complicated the situation as to give doctor Waller grave cause for alarm Then it was that ignoring every possible thought of misbehavior on the part of the young officer toward the gentle girl so dear to them not only missus Blake and missus Ray but missus Dade herself insisted on being made of use insisted on being permitted to go to his bedside and there to minister as only women can to the suffering and distressed Waller thought it over and succumbed The lad was no longer delirious at least and if he revealed anything of what was uppermost in his mind it would be a conscious and voluntary revelation There were some things he had said and that Waller alone had heard the good old doctor wished were known to certain others of the garrison and to no one more than missus Dade and so the prohibition against their visiting the wounded lad was withdrawn and not only these but other women sympathetically attracted were given the necessary authority There was other reason for this From the commanding officer of the supply camp at Rock Springs had come finally a letter that was full of foreboding General Field it said was sorely injured and might not survive If the department commander had only been at Omaha or Cheyenne as the anxious father hastened to reach his son the mishap would never have occurred The general would gladly have seen to it that suitable transportation from the railway to Frayne was afforded his old time comrade But in his absence Field shrank from appealing to anyone else and through the train conductor wired ahead to Rock Creek for a stout four mule team and wagon with a capable driver The conductor assured him that such things were to be had for money and that everything would be in readiness on his arrival Team wagon and driver certainly were on hand but the team looked rickety so did the wagon so did the driver who had obviously been priming for the occasion It was this rig or nothing however and in spite of a courteous remonstrance from the two officers at the supply camp who saw and condemned the outfit General Field started on time and returned on an improvised trestle three hours later The outfit had been tumbled over a ledge into a rocky creek bottom and with disastrous results to all concerned except the one who deserved it most the driver The ways of Providence are indeed inscrutable A surgeon had been sent from Fort Russell and his report was such that Waller would not let it go in full to his patient They had carried the old soldier back to camp and such aid as could be given by the rude hands of untaught men was all he had for nearly twenty four hours and his suffering had been great Internal injuries it was feared had been sustained and at his advanced age that was something almost fatal No wonder Waller was worried Then Flint took alarm at other troubles closer at hand Up to this year he had been mercifully spared all personal contact with our Indian wards and when he was told by his sentries that twice in succession night riders had been heard on the westward bench and pony tracks in abundance had been found at the upper ford the site of Stabber s village and that others still were to be seen in the soft ground not far from Hay s corral the major was more than startled At this stage of the proceedings Sergeant Crabb of the Cavalry was the most experienced Indian fighter left at the post Crabb was sent for and unflinchingly gave his views The Sioux had probably scattered before the squadrons sent after them from the north had fled into the hills and in small bands probably were now raiding down toward the Platte well knowing there were few soldiers left to defend Fort Frayne and no cavalry were there to chase them What brings them here What do they hope to get or gain asked Flint I don t know sir answered Crabb But this I do know they are after something and expect to get it If I might make so bold sir I think the major ought to keep an eye on them blasted halfbreeds at Hay s It set Flint to serious thinking Pete and Crapaud paid henchmen of the trader had been taking advantage of their employer s absence and celebrating after the manner of their kind One of his officers new like himself to the neighborhood and to the Indians had had encounter with the two that rubbed his commissioned fur the wrong way A sentry in discharge of his duty had warned them one evening away from the rear gate of a bachelor den along officers row and had been told to go to sheol or words to that effect They had more business there than he had said they and under the potent sway of inspiring bold John Barleycorn had not even abated their position when the officer of the day happened along They virtually damned and defied him too The officer of the day reported to the commanding officer and that officer called on missus Hay to tell her he should order the culprits off the reservation if they were not better behaved missus Hay so said the servant was feeling far from well and had to ask to be excused when who should appear but that ministering angel missus Dade herself and missus Dade undertook to tell missus Hay of the misconduct of the men even when assuring Major Flint she feared it was a matter in which missus Hay was powerless They were afraid of Hay but not of her Hearing of missus Hay s illness missus Dade and other women had come to visit and console her but there were very few whom she would now consent to see Even though confident no bodily harm would befall her husband or her niece missus Hay was evidently sore disturbed about something Failing to see her Major Flint sent for the bartender and clerk and bade them say where these truculent semi savage bacchanals got their whiskey and both men promptly and confidently declared it wasn t at the store Neither of them would give or sell to either halfbreed a drop and old Wilkins stood sponsor for the integrity of the affiants both of whom he had known for years and both of whom intimated that the two specimens had no need to be begging buying or stealing whiskey when Bill Hay s private cellar held more than enough to fill the whole Sioux nation Moreover said Pink Marble they ve got the run of the stables now the old man s away and there isn t a night some of those horses ain t out When Flint said that was something missus Hay ought to know Pink Marble replied that was something missus Hay did know unless she refused to believe the evidence of her own senses as well as his and Pink thought it high time our fellows in the field had recaptured Hay and fetched him home If it wasn t done mighty soon he Pink wouldn t be answerable for what might happen at the post All the more anxious did this make Flint He decided that the exigencies of the case warranted his putting a sentry over Hay s stable with orders to permit no horse to be taken out except by an order from him and Crabb took him and showed him two days later the tracks of two horses going and coming in the soft earth in front of a narrow side door that led to the corral Flint had this door padlocked at once and Wilkins took the key and that night was surprised by a note from missus Hay The stablemen complain that the sentries will not let them take the horses out even for water and exercise which has never been the case before and missus Hay begged that the restriction might be removed Indeed if Major Flint would remove the sentry she would assume all responsibility for loss or damage The men had been with mister Hay she said for six years and never had been interfered with before and they were sensitive and hurt and would quit work they said if further molested Then there would be nobody to take their place and the stock would suffer In point of fact missus Hay was pleading for the very men against whom the other employes claimed to have warned her these two halfbreeds who had defied his sentries and Flint s anxieties materially increased It taxed all his stock of personal piety and strengthened the belief he was beginning to harbor that missus Hay had some use for the horses at night some sojourners in the neighborhood with whom she must communicate and who could they be but Sioux Then Mistress McGann sound sleeper that she used to be declared to the temporary post commander as he was and temporary lodger as she considered him that things was goin on about the post she d never heard the likes of before and that the meejor would never put up with a minute When missus McGann said the meejor she meant not Flint but his predecessor There was but one major in her world the one she treated like a minor Being a soldier s wife however she knew the deference due to the commanding officer even though she did not choose to show it and when bidden to say her say and tell what things was goin on Mistress McGann asseverated with the asperity of a woman who has had to put her husband to bed two nights running that the time had never been before that he was so drunk he didn t know his way home and so got into the back of the bachelor quarters instead of his own And to think av his bein propped up at his own gate by a lousy frog eatin half Frinchman half salvage Yet when investigated this proved to be the case and the further question arose where did McGann get his whiskey A faithful loyal devoted old servitor was McGann yet Webb as we have seen had ever to watch his whiskey carefully lest the Irishman should see it and seeing taste and tasting fall The store had orders from missus McGann countersigned by Webb to the effect that her husband was never to have a drop Flint was a teetotaller himself and noted without a shadow of disapprobation that the decanters on the sideboard were both empty the very day he took possession also that the cupboard was securely locked missus McGann was sure her liege got no liquor there nor at the store and his confused statement that it was given him by fellers at the stables was treated with scorn McGann then was still under marital surveillance and official displeasure the day after missus McGann s revelations with unexplained iniquities to answer for when his head cleared and his legs resumed their functions But by that time other matters were brought to light that laid still further accusation at his door With the consent of doctor Waller Lieutenant Field had been allowed to send an attendant for his desk There were letters he said he greatly wished to see and answer and missus Ray had been so kind as to offer to act as his amanuensis The attendant went with the key and came back with a scared face Somebody he said had been there before him They did not tell Field this at the time The doctor went at once with the messenger and in five minutes had taken in the situation Field s rooms had been entered and probably robbed There was only one other occupant of the desolate set that so recently had rung to the music of so many glad young voices Of the garrison proper at Frayne all the cavalry officers except Wilkins were away at the front all the infantry officers five in number were also up along the Big Horn The four who had come with Flint were strangers to the post but Herron who had been a classmate of Ross at the Point moved into his room and took the responsibility of introducing the contract doctor who came with them into the quarters at the front of the house on the second floor These rooms had been left open and unlocked There was nothing said the lawful occupant worth stealing which was probably true but Field had bolted inside the door of his sleeping room locked the hall door of his living room and taken the key with him when he rode with Ray The doctor looked over the rooms a moment then sent for Wilkins the post quartermaster who came in a huff at being disturbed at lunch Field had been rather particular about his belongings His uniforms always hung on certain pegs in the plain wooden wardrobe The drawers of his bureau were generally arranged like the clothes press of cadet days as though for inspection but now coats blouses dressingsack and smoking jacket hung with pockets turned inside out or flung about the bed and floor Trousers had been treated with like contempt The bureau looked like what sailors used to call a hurrah s nest and a writing desk brass bound and of solid make that stood on a table by a front window had been forcibly wrenched open and its contents were tossed about the floor A larger desk a wooden field desk stood upon a trestle across the room and this too had been ransacked Just what was missing only one man could tell Just how they entered was patent to all through a glazed window between the bed room and the now unused dining room beyond Just who were the housebreakers no man present could say but Mistress McGann that afternoon communicated her suspicion to her sore headed spouse and did it boldly and with the aid of a broomstick It s all along she said av your shtoopin to dhrink wid them low lived salvages at Hay s Now what d ye know about this But McGann swore piously he knew nothing barrin that Pete and Crapaud had some good liquor one night dear knows when it was an I helped em dhrink your health an when twas gone and more was wanted sure Pete said he d taken a demijohn to the lieutenant s with mister Hay s compliments the day before he left for the front and sure he couldn t have drunk all av it and if the back dure was open Pete would inquire anyhow That was all Michael remembered or felt warranted in revealing for stoutly he declared his and their innocence of having burglariously entered any premises let alone the lieutenant s Sure they d bite their own noses off fur him said Mike which impossible feat attested the full measure of halfbreed devotion Mistress McGann decided to make further investigation before saying anything to anybody but before the dawn of another day matters took such shape that fear of sorrowful consequences involving even Michael set a ban on her impulse to speak Field it seems had been at last induced to sleep some hours that evening and it was nearly twelve when he awoke and saw his desk on a table near the window The attendant was nodding in an easy chair and just as the young officer determined to rouse him missus Dade with the doctor appeared on tiptoe at the doorway For a few minutes they kept him interested in letters and reports concerning his father s condition the gravity of which however was still withheld from him Then there were reports from Tongue River brought in by courier that had to be told him But after a while he would be no longer denied He demanded to see his desk and his letters At a sign from the doctor the attendant raised it from the table and bore it to the bed I found things in some confusion in your quarters Field said Waller by way of preparation and I probably haven t arranged the letters as you would if you had had time They were lying about loosely But he got no further Field had started up and was leaning on one elbow The other arm was outstretched What do you mean he cried The desk hasn t been opened Too evidently however it had been and in an instant Field had pulled a brass pin that held in place a little drawer It popped part way out and with trembling hands he drew it forth empty Before he could speak missus Dade suddenly held up her hand in signal for silence her face paling at the instant There was a rush of slippered feet through the corridor a hum of excited voices and both doctor Waller and the attendant darted for the door Outside in the faint starlight sound of commotion came from the direction of the guard house of swift footfalls from far across the parade of the vitreous jar of windows hastily raised Two or three lights popped suddenly into view along the dark line of officers quarters and Waller s voice with a ring of authority unusual to him halted a running corporal of the guard What is it demanded he I don t know sir was the soldier s answer There was an awful scream from the end quarters Captain Ray s sir Then on he went again And then came the crack crack of a pistol CHAPTER XVIII BURGLARY AT BLAKE S The doctor started at the heels of the corporal but was distanced long before he reached the scene The sergeant of the guard was hammering on the front door of Blake s quarters but before the summons was answered from within missus Ray in long loose wrapper came hurrying forth from her own the adjoining hallway Her face was white with dread It is I Nannie Let us in she cried and the door was opened by a terrified servant as the doctor came panting up the steps Together he and missus Ray hurried in Robbers gasped the servant girl Gone the back way and collapsed on the stairs Sergeant and corporal both tore around to the west side and out of the rear gate Not a sign of fugitives could they see and what was worse not a sign of sentry Number five of the third relief should at that moment have been pacing the edge of the bluff in rear of the northernmost quarters and yet might be around toward the flagstaff Find Number five were the sergeant s orders and back he hurried to the house not knowing what to expect By that time others of the guard had got there and the officer of the day was coming the clink of his sword could be heard down the road and more windows were uplifted and more voices were begging for information and then came missus Dade breathless but calm Within doors she found the doctor ministering to a stout female who seemed to have gone off in an improvised swoon missus Blake s imported cook Up the stairs to her own room again missus Blake was being led by Marion Ray s encircling arm Three women were speedily closeted there for missus Dade was like an elder sister to these two sworn friends and not until missus Dade and they were ready did that lady descend the stairs and communicate the facts to the excited gathering in the parlor and they in turn to those on the porch in front By this time Flint himself with the poet quartermaster was on hand and all Fort Frayne seemed to rouse and missus Gregg had come with missus Wilkins and these two had relieved the doctor of the care of the cook now talking volubly and partly through her revelations but mainly through the more coherent statements of missus Dade were the facts made public Margaret the cook had a room to herself on the ground floor adjoining her kitchen Belle the maid had been given the second floor back in order to be near to her young mistress Bitzer the Blakes man of all work like McGann a discharged soldier slept in the basement at the back of the house and there was he found blinking bewildered and only with difficulty aroused from stupor by a wrathful sergeant The cook s story in brief was that she was awakened by missus Blake s voice at her door and thinking Belle was sick she jumped up and found missus Blake in her wrapper asking was she Margaret up stairs a moment before Then missus Blake with her candle went into the dining room and out jumped a man in his stocking feet from the captain s den across the hall and knocked over missus Blake and the light and made for her the cook whereat she screamed and slammed her door in his face and that was really all she knew about it But missus Blake knew more Awakened by some strange consciousness of stealthy movement about the house she called Belle by name thinking possibly the girl might be ill and seeking medicine There was sound of more movement but no reply missus Blake s girlhood had been spent on the frontier She was a stranger to fear She arose struck a light and seeing no one in her room or the guest chamber and hallway hastened to the third room and was surprised to find Belle apparently quietly sleeping Then she decided to look about the house and first went down and roused the cook As she was coming out of the dining room a man leaped past her in the hall hurling her to one side and dashing out the light Her back was toward him for he came from Gerald s own premises known as the den In that den directly opposite was one of her revolvers loaded She found it even in the darkness and hurrying forth again intending to chase the intruder and alarm the sentry at the rear encountered either the same or a second man close to the back door a man who sprang past her like a panther and darted down the steps at the back of the house followed by two shots from her Smith Wesson One of these men wore a soldier s overcoat for the cape ripped from the collar seam was left in her hands Another soldier s overcoat was later found at the rear fence but no boots shoes or tracks thereof yet both these men judging from the sound had been in stocking feet or possibly rubbers or perhaps but that last suspicion she kept to herself for missus Hay too was now among the arrivals in the house full of sympathy and genuine distress The alarm then had gone beyond the guard house and the creators thereof beyond the ken of the guard for not a sentry had seen or heard anything suspicious until after the shots then Number eight Flint s latest addition declared that from his post at Hay s corral he had distinctly heard the swift hoofbeats of a brace of ponies darting up the level bench to the westward Number five had turned up safely and declared that at the moment the scream was heard he was round by the flagstaff listening to the night chorus of a pack of yelping coyotes afar out to the northwest and then he thought he heard scrambling and running down at the foot of the bluff just as the shots were fired Investigation on his part was what took him out of sight for the moment and later investigation showed that one marauder at least had gone that way for a capeless greatcoat was found close down by the shore where some fugitive had tossed it in his flight This overcoat bore half erased from the soiled lining the name of Culligan Troop K but Culligan had served out his time and taken his discharge a year before The other overcoat was even older an infantry coat with shorter cape bearing a company number forty seven but no name Both garments savored strongly of the stable Then before quiet was restored certain search was made about the quarters It was found the intruders had obtained admission through the basement door at the back which was never locked for the sentry on Number five had orders to call Bitzer at five thirty A M to start the fires milk the cow et cetera Hogan Ray s factotum being roused about the same time The marauders had gone up the narrow stairway into the kitchen first lashing one end of a leather halter strap about the knob of Bitzer s door and the other to the base of the big refrigerator a needless precaution as it took sustained and determined effort as many a sentry on Number five could testify to rouse Bitzer from even a nap It was no trick for the prowlers to softly raise the trap door leading to the kitchen and once there the rest of the house was practically open Such a thing as burglary or sneak thieving about the officers quarters had been unheard of at Frayne for many a year One precaution the visitors had taken that of unbolting the back door so that retreat might not be barred in case they were discovered Then they had gone swiftly and noiselessly about their work But what had they taken The silver was upstairs intact under missus Blake s bed so was the little safe in which was kept her jewelry and their valuable papers Books bric a brac everything down stairs seemed unmolested No item was missing from its accustomed place missus Blake thought perhaps the intruders had not entered her room at all In Gerald s den were stacks as he said of relics souvenirs trophies of chase and war but no one thing of the intrinsic value of fifty dollars What could have been the object of their midnight search was the question all Fort Frayne was asking as people dispersed and went home the doctor intimating it was high time that missus Blake was permitted to seek repose Not until he had practically cleared the house of all but her most intimate friends missus Dade and missus Ray would Waller permit himself to ask a question that had been uppermost in his mind ever since he heard her story missus Blake someone has been ransacking mister Field s quarters for letters or papers Now was there anything of that kind left by the captain that someone may have needed Nannie Blake s head was uplifted instantly from Marion s shoulder She had been beginning to feel the reaction For one moment the three women looked intently into each other s faces Then up they started and trooped away into Gerald s den The doctor followed The upper drawer of a big flat topped desk stood wide open and pretty missus Blake opened her eyes and mouth in emulation as she briefly exclaimed It s gone Then Waller went forthwith to the quarters of the commander and caught him still in conference with his quartermaster and the guard four or five of the latter being grouped without The major retired to his front room where with Wilkins he received the doctor Major Flint said Waller those overcoats belong to mister Hay s stablemen Pete and Crapaud Will you order their immediate arrest I would doctor was the answer but they are not at the corral We know how to account for the hoofbeats in the valley Those scoundrels have got nearly an hour s start and we ve nobody to send in chase Then it presently appeared that the post commander desired to continue conference with his staff officer for he failed to invite the post surgeon to be seated Indeed he looked up into the doctor s kindling eyes with odd mixture of impatience and embarrassment in his own and the veteran practitioner felt the slight flushed instantly and with much hauteur of manner took prompt but ceremonious leave And when morning came and Fort Frayne awoke to another busy day as if the excitements of the night gone by had not been enough for it a new story went buzzing with the first call for guard mount about the garrison and bigger even than yesterday the two details in soldier silence began to gather in front of the infantry quarters Major Flint had ordered sentries posted at the trader s home with directions that missus Hay was not to be allowed outside her gate and no one man or woman permitted to approach her from without except by express permission of the post commander General Harney and Dan the two best horses of the trader s stable despite the presence of the sentry at the front had been abstracted sometime during the earlier hours of the night and later traced to the ford at Stabber s old camp and with Pete and Crapaud doubtless were gone That day the major wired to Omaha that he should be reinforced at once One half his little force he said was now mounted each day for guard and the men couldn t stand it The general of course was in the field but his chief of staff remained at headquarters and was empowered to order troops from post to post within the limits of the department Flint hoped two more companies could come at once and he did not care what post was denuded in his favor His he said was close to the Indian lands separated from them in fact only by a narrow and fordable river The Indians were all on the warpath and aware of his puny numbers might be tempted at any moment to quit the mountains and concentrate on him Moreover he was satisfied there had been frequent communication between their leaders and the household of the post trader at Fort Frayne He was sure missus Hay had been giving them valuable information and he expected soon to be able to prove very serious charges against her Meantime he had placed her under surveillance That she had been ever since his coming although she never realized it Fancy the sensation created at Omaha where the Hays were well known when this news was received Flint did not say under arrest guarded day and night by a brace of sentries who were sorely disgusted with their duty He had no doubt his appeals for more troops would be honored in view of his strenuous representations but the day passed without assurance to that effect and without a wired word to say his action regarding missus Hay had been approved It began to worry him At three P M missus Hay sent and begged him to call upon her that she might assure and convince him of her innocence But this the major found means to refuse promising however a meeting in the near future after he had received tidings from the front which he was awaiting and expecting every moment He had reluctantly given permission to visit her to missus Dade missus Ray and two or three other women whose hearts were filled with sympathy and sorrow and their heads with bewilderment over the amazing order Indeed it was due to missus Dade s advice that she so far triumphed over pride and wrath as to ask to see the major and explain She had received tidings from her husband and Nanette She was perfectly willing to admit it to tell all about it and now that Pete and Crapaud had turned out to be such unmitigated rascals to have them caught and castigated if caught they could be But all this involved no disloyalty They had always been friendly with the Sioux and the Sioux with them Everybody knew it no one better than General Crook himself and if he approved why should a junior disapprove Indeed as she asked her friends what junior who had ever known mister Hay and her or the Indians either would be apt to disapprove so long as the Indians when on the warpath received no aid or comfort from either her husband or herself And if they had said she further waxing eloquent over her theme could we have begun to give them half the aid or comfort or a thousandth part of the supplies and ammunition they got day after day through the paid agents of the Interior Department But these were questions army people could not properly discuss their mission in life being rather to submit to than suggest criticism And so another restless day went by and no more news came from either front or rear from the range to the north or Rock Springs at the south and Flint was just formulating another fervid appeal to that impassive functionary the adjutant general at Omaha when toward evening word came whistling down the line in the person of Master Sanford Ray that two couriers were in sight scooting in from Moccasin Ridge and Flint and fully half the soldier strength of Fort Frayne gathered on the northward bluff like the wan burghers of ancient Rome to watch and speed their coming Who could tell what the day might yet bring forth It was well nigh dark before the foremost reached the ford a scout in worn and tawdry buckskin wearied and impassive He gave his despatch to the care of the first officer to accost him and took the way to the store briefly saying in reply to questions that he was too dry to speak the truth So they flocked at respectful distance about the major as he read the hurried lines The general bade the post commander wire the entire message to Washington and to take all precautions for the protection of the few settlers about him The columns under Colonel Henry and Major Webb had united near the head waters of the Clear Fork of the Powder had had a rattling running fight with Lame Wolf s people had driven them into the mountains and were following hot on the trail but that Stabber s band and certain disaffected Sioux had cut loose from the main body and gone south Whistling Elk a young chief of much ambition had quarrelled with certain of the Red Cloud element and joined Stabber with his entire band Look out for them and watch for signals any day or night from Eagle Butte Flint read with sinking heart Indian fighting was something far too scientific for his martial education and too much for his skeleton command In the gathering dusk his face looked white and drawn and old Wilkins breasting his way up the slope puffed hard as he begged for news There was still another despatch however which was evidently adding to the major s perturbation for it concerned him personally and for the moment Wilkins went unheard The general desires that you send the couriers back within twenty four hours of their arrival after you have had time to scout the line of the Platte say twenty miles each way giving full report of every Indian seen or heard of He enjoins vigilance and hopes to keep the Sioux so busy that they can send no more in your direction Should they do so however he will pursue at once He trusts that you are doing everything possible to comfort and reassure missus Hay and that you can send good news of Lieutenant Field And this when he had just refused to remove the sentries or to visit missus Hay this when he had just been told by doctor Waller that Lieutenant Field was distinctly worse He is simply fretting his heart out here were the doctor s words to him but a short time before and while unable to mount a horse he is quite strong enough now to take the trip by ambulance slowly that is to Rock Springs I fear his father is failing I fear Field will fail if not allowed to go I recommend a seven days leave with permission to apply to Omaha for thirty he ll probably need it I can t permit government teams and ambulances to be used for any such purpose said the major stoutly It is distinctly against orders Then sir he can go in my spring wagon and we ll hire mules from missus Hay was the doctor s prompt reply He can do no good here major He may do much good there But Flint was full of information and official zeal The matter of Field s going had been broached before and when told of it the Wilkins pair had been prompt with their protests Of course he d be wantin to get away said Wilkins wid all that money to account for let alone these other things The Irishman was hot against the young West Pointer who had derided him He doubtless believed his own words He never dreamed how sorely the lad now longed to see his father how deep was his anxiety on that father s account how filled with apprehension on his own for that rifled desk had brought him reason for most painful thought Wilkins and Field had been antagonistic from the start Neither could see good in the other and egged on by his worthy spouse s exhortations the quartermaster had seized the opportunity to fill the post commander s too receptive mind with all his own suspicions and this at a crucial time I can t listen to it doctor Waller said the major sternly Here s a matter of near a thousand dollars that young man has got to answer for the moment he is well enough to stir And if he can t account for it you well know what my duty will demand CHAPTER XIX A SLAP FOR THE MAJOR The columns of Colonel Henry and Major Webb as said the Chief had united and here were two men who could be counted on to push the pursuit for all they were worth Hitherto acting in the open country and free from encumbrance the Indians had been hard to reach Now they were being driven into their fastnesses among the mountains toward the distant shelter whither their few wounded had been conveyed and where the old men the women and children were in hiding Now it meant that unless the troops could be confronted and thrown back another transfer of tepees and travois ponies and dogs wounded and aged would have to be made Lame Wolf had thought his people safe behind the walls of the Big Horn and the shifting screen of warriors along the foothills but the blue skirmish lines pushed steadily on into the fringing pines driving the feathered braves from ridge to ridge and Lame Wolf had sense enough to see that here were leaders that meant business and would not be held Henry had ten veteran troops at his back when he united with Webb who led his own and the Beecher squadron making eighteen companies or troops of Horse with their pack mules all out at the front while the wagon train and ambulances were thoroughly guarded by a big battalion of sturdy infantry nearly all of them good marksmen against whose spiteful Springfields the warriors made only one essay in force and that was more than enough The blue coats emptied many an Indian saddle and strewed the prairie with ponies and sent Whistling Elk and his people to the right about in sore dismay and then it dawned on Lame Wolf that he must now either mislead the cavalry leader throw him off the track as it were or move the villages wounded prisoners and all across the Big Horn river where hereditary foemen Shoshone and Absaraka would surely welcome them red handed It was at this stage of the game he had his final split with Stabber Stabber was shrewd and saw unerringly that with other columns out from Custer on the Little Horn and Washakie on the Wind River with reinforcements coming from north and south the surrounding of the Sioux in arms would be but a matter of time He had done much to get Lame Wolf into the scrape and now was urging hateful measures as unless they were prepared for further and heavier losses the one way out and that way was surrender Now this is almost the last thing the Indian will do Not from fear of consequences at the hands of his captors for he well knows that physically he is infinitely better off when being coddled by Uncle Sam than when fighting in the field It is simply the loss of prestige among his fellow red men that he hates and dreads Therefore nothing short of starvation or probable annihilation prompts him as a rule to yield himself a prisoner Stabber urged it rather than risk further battle and further loss but Stabber had long been jealous of the younger chief envied him his much larger following and his record as a fighter and Stabber presumably would be only too glad to see him fallen from his high estate They could then enjoy the hospitality of a generous nation a people of born fools said the unreasoning and unregenerate red man all winter and when next they felt sufficiently slighted to warrant another issue on the warpath they could take the field on equal terms Lame Wolf therefore swore he d fight to the bitter end Stabber swore he d gather all his villagers now herding with those of Wolf and having segregated his sheep from the more numerous goats would personally lead them whither the white man could not follow At all events he made this quarrel the pretext for his withdrawal with full five score fighting men and Lame Wolf cursed him roundly as the wretch deserved and all short handed now with hardly five hundred braves to back him bent his energies to checking Henry s column in the heart of the wild hill country And this was the situation when the general s first despatches were sent in to Frayne this the last news to reach the garrison from the distant front for five long days and then one morning when the snow was sifting softly down there came tidings that thrilled the little community heart and soul tidings that were heard with mingled tears and prayers and rejoicings and that led to many a visit of congratulation to missus Hay who poor woman dare not say at the moment that she had known it all as much as twenty four hours earlier despite the fact that Pete and Crapaud were banished from the roll of her auxiliaries Even as the new couriers came speeding through the veil of falling flakes riding jubilantly over the wide rolling prairie with their news of victory and battle the post commander at Fort Frayne was puzzling over a missive that had come to him he knew not how mysterious as the anarchists warnings said to find their way to the very bedside of the guarded Romanoffs Sentry Number four had picked it up on his post an hour before the dawn a letter addressed in bold hand to Major Stanley Flint commanding Fort Frayne and presuming the major himself had dropped it he turned it over to the corporal of his relief and so it found its way toward reveille into the hands of old McGann wheezing about his work of building fires and Michael laid it on the major s table and thought no more about it until two hours later when the major roused and read and then a row began that ended only with the other worries of his incumbency at Frayne Secretly Flint was still doing his best to discover the bearer when came the bold riders from the north with their thrilling news Secretly he had been over at the guard house interviewing as best he could by the aid of an unwilling clerk who spoke a little Sioux a young Indian girl whom Crabb s convalescent squad four in number had most unexpectedly run down when sent scouting five miles up the Platte and brought screaming scratching and protesting back to Frayne Her pony had been killed in the dash to escape and the two Indians with her seemed to be young lads not yet well schooled as warriors for they rode away pellmell over the prairie leaving the girl to the mercy of the soldiers Flint believed her to be connected in some way with the coming of the disturbing note which was why he compelled her detention at the guard house Under Webb s regime she would have been questioned by Hay or some one of his household Under Flint no one of Hay s family or retainers could be allowed to see her He regarded it as most significant that her shrillest screams and fiercest resistance should have been reserved until just as her guardians were bearing her past the trader s house She had the little light prison room to herself all that wintry morning and there disdainful of bunk or chair enveloped in her blanket she squatted disconsolate greeting all questioners with defiant and fearless shruggings and inarticulate protest Not a syllable of explanation not a shred of news could their best endeavors wring from her Yet her glittering eyes were surely in search of some one for she looked up eagerly every time the door was opened and Flint was just beginning to think he would have to send for missus Hay when the couriers came with their stirring news and he had to drop other affairs in order to forward this important matter to headquarters Once again it seems Trooper Kennedy had been entrusted with distinguished duty for it was he who came trotting foremost up the road waving his despatch on high A comrade from Blake s troop following through the ford had turned to the left and led his horse up the steep to the quarters nearest the flagstaff This time there was no big hearted post commander to bid the Irishman refresh himself ad libitum Flint was alone at his office at the moment and knew not this strange trooper and looked askance at his heterodox garb and war worn guise Such laxity said he to himself was not permitted where he had hitherto served which was never on Indian campaign Kennedy having delivered his despatches stood mutely expectant of question and struggling with an Irishman s enthusiastic eagerness to tell the details of heady fight But Flint had but one method of getting at facts the official reports and Kennedy stood unnoticed until impatient at last he queried Beg pardon sir but may we put up our horses Who s we asked the major bluntly And where are the others Trigg sir Captain Blake s troop He went to the captain s quarters with a package He should have reported himself first to the post commander said the major who deemed it advisable to make prompt impression on these savage hunters of savage game Thim wasn t his ordhers surr said Kennedy with zealous but misguided loyalty to his comrades and his regiment No one has a right sir to give orders that are contrary in spirit to the regulations and customs of the service answered the commander with proper austerity mister Wilkins he continued as the burly quartermaster came bustling in have the other trooper sent to report at once to me and let this man wait outside till I am ready to see him And so it happened that a dozen members of the garrison gathered from the lips of a participant stirring particulars of a spirited chase and fight that set soldiers to cheering and women and children to extravagant scenes of rejoicing before the official head of the garrison was fairly ready to give out the news Kennedy had taken satisfaction for the commander s slights by telling the tidings broadcast to the crowd that quickly gathered and in three minutes the word was flying from lip to lip that the troops had run down Lame Wolf s main village after an all day all night rush to head them off and that with very small loss they had been able to capture many of the families and to scatter the warriors among the hills In brief while Henry with the main body had followed the trail of the fighting band Webb had been detached and with two squadrons had ridden hard after a Shoshone guide who led them by a short cut through the range and enabled them to pounce on the village where were most of Lame Wolf s noncombatants guarded only by a small party of warriors and while Captains Billings and Ray with their troops remained in charge of these captives Webb with Blake and the others had pushed on in pursuit of certain braves who had scampered into the thick of the hills carrying a few of the wounded and prisoners with them Among those captured or recaptured were mister Hay and Crapaud Among those who had been spirited away was Nanette Flower This seemed strange and unaccountable And yet Blake had found time to write to his winsome wife to send her an important missive and most important bit of news It was with these she came running in to missus Ray before the latter had time to half read the long letter received from her soldier husband and we take the facts in the order of their revelation Think of it Maidie she cried Think of it Gerald s first words almost are Take good care of that pouch and contents and now pouch and contents are gone Whoever dreamed that they would be of such consequence He says the newspaper will explain And presently the two bonny heads were bent over the big sheets of a dingy grimy copy of a Philadelphia daily and there on an inner page heavily marked appeared a strange item and this Quaker City journal had been picked up in an Ogalalla camp The item read as follows AN UNTAMED SIOUX The authorities of the Carlisle School and the police of Harrisburg are hunting high and low for a young Indian known to the records of the Academy as Ralph Moreau but borne on the payrolls of Buffalo Bill s Wild West aggregation as Eagle Wing a youth who is credited with having given the renowned scout showman more trouble than all his braves bronchos and busters thereof combined Being of superb physique and a daring horseman Moreau had been forgiven many a peccadillo and had followed the fortunes of the show two consecutive summers until Cody finally had to get rid of him as an intolerable nuisance It seems that when a lad of eighteen Eagle Wing had been sent to Carlisle where he ran the gamut of scrapes of every conceivable kind He spoke English picked up about the agencies had influential friends and in some clandestine way received occasional supplies of money that enabled him to take French leave when he felt like it He was sent back from Carlisle to Dakota as irreclaimable and after a year or two on his native heath reappeared among the haunts of civilization as one of Buffalo Bill s warriors Bill discharged him at Cincinnati and at the instance of the Indian Bureau he was again placed at Carlisle only to repeat on a larger scale his earlier exploits and secure a second transfer to the Plains where his opportunities for devilment were limited Then Cody was induced to take him on again by profuse promises of good behavior which were kept until Pennsylvania soil was reached two weeks ago when he broke loose again was seen in store clothes around West Philadelphia for a few days plentifully supplied with money and next he turned up in the streets of Carlisle where he assaulted an attache of the school whose life was barely saved by the prompt efforts of other Indian students Moreau escaped to Harrisburg which he proceeded to paint his favorite color that very night and wound up the entertainment by galloping away on the horse of a prominent official who had essayed to escort him back to Carlisle It is believed that he is now in hiding somewhere about the suburbs and that an innate propensity for devilment will speedily betray him to the clutches of the law A few moments after reading this oddly interesting story the two friends were in consultation with missus Dade who in turn called in doctor Waller just returning from the hospital and a not too satisfactory visit to mister Field There had been a slight change for the better in the condition of General Field that had enabled doctor Lorain of Fort Russell and a local physician to arrange for his speedy transfer to Cheyenne This had in a measure relieved the anxiety of Waller s patient but never yet had the veteran practitioner permitted him to know that he was practically a prisoner as well as a patient Waller feared the result on so high strung a temperament and had made young Field believe that when strong and well enough to attempt the journey he should be sent to Rock Springs Indeed doctor Waller had no intention of submitting to Major Flint s decision as final He had written personally to the medical director of the department acquainting him with the facts and meanwhile had withdrawn himself as far as possible officially and socially from the limited circle in which moved his perturbed commanding officer He was at a distant point of the garrison therefore and listening to the excited and vehement comments of the younger of the three women upon this strange newspaper story and its possible connection with matters at Frayne at the moment when a dramatic scene was being enacted over beyond the guard house Kennedy was still the center of a little group of eager listeners when Pink Marble factotum of the trader s store came hurrying forth from the adjutant s office speedily followed by Major Flint You may tell missus Hay that while I cannot permit her to visit the prisoner he called after the clerk I will send the girl over under suitable guard To this mister Marble merely shrugged his shoulders and went on He fancied Flint no more than did the relics of the original garrison A little later Flint personally gave an order to the sergeant of the guard and then came commotion First there were stifled sounds of scuffle from the interior of the guard house then shrill wrathful screams then a woman s voice unlifted in wild upbraidings in an unknown tongue at sound of which Trooper Kennedy dropped his rein and his jaw stood staring one minute then with the exclamation Mother of God but I know that woman burst his way through the crowd and ran toward the old log blockhouse at the gate the temporary post of the guard Just as he turned the corner of the building almost stumbling against the post commander there came bursting forth from the dark interior a young woman of the Sioux daring furious raging and breaking loose from the grasp of the two luckless soldiers who had her by the arms away she darted down the road still screaming like some infuriated child and rushed straight for the open gateway of the Hays Of course the guard hastened in pursuit the major shouting Stop her Catch her and the men striving to appear to obey yet shirking the feat of seizing the fleeing woman Fancy then the amaze of the swiftly following spectators when the trader s front door was thrown wide open and missus Hay herself sprang forth Another instant and the two women had met at the gate Another instant still and with one motherly arm twining about the quivering panting pleading girl and straining her to the motherly heart missus Hay s right hand and arm flew up in the superb gesture known the wide frontier over as the Indian signal Halt And halt they did every mother s son save Kennedy who sprang to the side of the girl and faced the men in blue And then another woman s voice rich deep ringing powerful fell on the ears of the amazed swift gathering throng with the marvellous order Stand where you are You shan t touch a hair of her head She s a chief s daughter She s my own kin and I ll answer for her to the general himself As for you she added turning now and glaring straight at the astounded Flint all the pent up sense of wrath indignity shame and wrong overmastering any thought of prudence or of the divinity that doth hedge the commanding officer As for you she cried I pity you when our own get back again God help you Stanley Flint the moment my husband sets eyes on you D you know the message that came to him this day And now the words rang louder and clearer as she addressed the throng I do and so do officers and gentlemen who d be shamed to have to shake hands with such as he He s got my husband s note about him now and what my husband wrote was this I charge myself with every dollar you charge to Field and with the further obligation of thrashing you on sight and mark you he ll do it CHAPTER XX THE SIOUX SURROUNDED In the hush of the wintry night under a leaden sky with snowflakes falling thick and fast and mantling the hills in fleecy white Webb s column had halted among the sturdy pines the men exchanging muttered low toned query and comment the horses standing with bowed heads occasionally pawing the soft coverlet and sniffing curiously at this filmy barrier to the bunch grass they sought in vain They had feasted together these comrade troopers and chargers ere the sun went down the men on abundant rations of agency bacon flour and brown sugar found with black tailed deer and mountain sheep in abundance in the captured village and eked out by supplies from the pack train the horses on big blankets of oats set before them by sympathetic friends and masters Then when the skies were fairly dark Webb had ordered little fires lighted all along the bank of the stream leaving the men of Ray s and Billings troops to keep them blazing through the long night watches to create the impression among the lurking Sioux that the whole force was still there guarding the big village it had captured in the early afternoon and then in silence the troopers had saddled and jogged away into the heart of the hills close on the heels of their guides There had been little time to look over the captures The main interest of both officers and men of course centred in mister Hay who was found in one of the tepees prostrate from illness and half frantic from fever and strong mental excitement He had later tidings from Frayne it seems than had his rescuers He could assure them of the health and safety of their wives and little ones but would not tell them what was amiss in his own household One significant question he asked Did any of them know this new Major Flint No Well God help Flint if ever he Hay got hold of him He s delirious whispered Webb and rode away in that conviction leaving him to Ray and Billings Three miles out on the tortuous trail of the pursued the column halted and dismounted among the pines Then there was brief conference and the word Mount was whispered along the Beecher squadron while Blake s men stood fast With a parting clasp of the hand Webb and Legs had returned to the head of their respective commands Legs and his fellows to follow steadily the Indian trail through the twisting ravines of the foothills Webb to make an all night forced march in wide detour and determined effort to head off the escaping warriors before they could reach the rocky fastnesses back of Bear Cliff Webb s chief scout Bat chosen by General Crook himself had been a captive among the Sioux through long years of his boyhood and knew the Big Horn range as Webb did the banks of the Wabash They can stand off a thousand soldiers said the guide if once they get into the rocks They d have gone there first off only there was no water Now there s plenty snow So Blake s instructions were to follow them without pushing to let them feel they were being pursued yet by no means to hasten them and if the general s favorite scout proved to be all he promised as guide and pathfinder Webb might reasonably hope by dint of hard night riding to be first at the tryst at break of day Then they would have the retreating Sioux hampered by their few wounded and certain prisoners whom they prized hemmed between rocky heights on every side and sturdy horsemen front and rear It was eight by the watch at the parting of the ways It was eight thirty when Blake retook the trail with Sergeants Schreiber and Winsor the latter borrowed from Ray far in the van Even had the ground been hard and stony these keen eyed soldier scouts could have followed the signs almost as unerringly as the Indians for each had had long years of experience all over the West but despite the steadily falling snow the traces of hoofs and for a time of travois poles could be readily seen and followed in the dim gray light of the blanketed skies Somewhere aloft above the film of cloud the silvery moon was shining and that was illumination more than enough for men of their years on the trail For over an hour Blake followed the windings of a ravine that grew closer and steeper as it burrowed into the hills Old game trails are as good as turnpikes in the eyes of the plainsman It was when the ravine began to split into branches that the problem might have puzzled them had not the white fleece lain two inches deep on the level when Lo made his dash to escape Now the rough edges of the original impression were merely rounded over by the new fallen snow The hollows and ruts and depressions led on from one deep cleft into another and by midnight Blake felt sure the quarry could be but a few miles ahead and Bear Cliff barely five hours march away So noiselessly the signal Halt went rearward down the long dark sinuous column of twos and every man slipped out of saddle some of them stamping so numb were their feet With every mile the air had grown keener and colder They were glad when the next word whispered was Lead on instead of Mount By this time they were far up among the pine fringed heights with the broad valley of the Big Horn lying outspread to the west invisible as the stars above and neither by ringing shot nor winged arrow had the leaders known the faintest check It seemed as though the Indians in their desperate effort to carry off the most important or valued of their charges were bending all their energies to expediting the retreat Time enough to turn on the pursuers when once the rocks had closed about them when the wounded were safe in the fastnesses and the pursuers far from supports But at the foot of a steep ascent the two leading scouts rival sergeants of rival troops but devoted friends for nearly twenty years were seen by the next in column a single corporal following them at thirty yards distance to halt and begin poking at some dark object by the wayside Then they pushed on again A dead pony under a quarter inch coverlet of snow was what met the eyes of the silently trudging command as it followed The high peaked wooden saddle tree was still cinched to the stiffening carcass Either the Indians were pushed for time or overstocked with saddlery Presently there came a low whistle from the military middleman between the scouts and a little advance guard Run ahead growled the sergeant commanding to his boy trumpeter Give me your reins And leaving his horse the youngster stumbled along up the winding trail got his message and waited Give this to the captain was the word sent back by Schreiber and this was a mitten of Indian tanned buckskin soft and warm if unsightly a mitten too small for a warrior s hand if ever warrior deigned to wear one a mitten the captain examined curiously as he ploughed ahead of his main body and then returned to his subaltern with a grin on his face Beauty draws us with a single hair said he and can t shake us even when she gives us the mitten Ross he added after a moment s thought remember this With this gang there are two or three sub chiefs that we should get alive or dead but the chief end of man so far as K Troop s concerned is to capture that girl unharmed And just at dawn so gray and wan and pallid it could hardly be told from the pale moonlight of the earlier hours the dark snake like column was halted again nine miles further in among the wooded heights With Bear Cliff still out of range and sight something had stopped the scouts and Blake was needed at the front He found Schreiber crouching at the foot of a tree gazing warily forward along a southward sloping face of the mountain that was sparsely covered with tall straight pines and that faded into mist a few hundred yards away The trail the main trail that is seemed to go straight away eastward and for a short distance downward through a hollow or depression while up the mountain side to the left the north following the spur or shoulder there were signs as of hoof tracks half sheeted by the new fallen snow and through this fresh fleecy mantlet ploughed the trooper boots in rude insistent pursuit The sergeants horses were held by a third soldier a few yards back behind the spur for Winsor was side scouting up the heights The snowfall had ceased for a time The light was growing broader every moment and presently a soft whistle sounded somewhere up the steep and Schreiber answered He wants us sir was all he said and in five minutes they had found him sprawled on his stomach on a projecting ledge and pointing southeastward where boldly outlined against the gray of the morning sky a black and beetling precipice towered from the mist wreathed pines at its base Bear Cliff beyond a doubt How far sergeant asked the captain never too reliant on his powers of judging distance Five miles sir at least yet some three or four Indians have turned off here and gone somewhere up there And rolling half over Winsor pointed again toward a wooded bluff perhaps three hundred feet higher and half a mile away That s probably the best lookout this side of the cliff itself he continued in explanation as he saw the puzzled look on the captain s face From there likely they can see the trail over the divide the one Little Bat is leading the major and if they ve made any time at all the squadron should be at Bear Cliff now They were crawling to him by this time Blake and Schreiber among the stunted cedars that grew thickly along the rocky ledge Winsor flat again on his stomach sprawled like a squirrel close to the brink Every moment as the skies grew brighter the panorama before them became more extensive a glorious sweep of highland scenery of boldly tossing ridges east and south and west the slopes all mantled the trees all tipped with nature s ermine and studded now with myriad gems taking fire at the first touch of the day god s messenger as the mighty king himself burst his halo of circling cloud and came peering over the low curtain far at the eastward horizon Chill and darkness and shrouding vapor vanished all in a breath as he rose dominant over countless leagues of wild unbroken yet magnificent mountain landscape Worth every hour of watch and mile of climb muttered Blake But it s Indians not scenery we re after What are we here for Winsor and narrowly he eyed Ray s famous right bower If the major got there first sir and I believe he did they have to send the prisoners and wounded back this way Then we ve got em broke in Schreiber low toned but exultant Look sir he added as he pointed along the range They are signalling now From the wooded height ten hundred yards away curious little puffs of smoke one following another were sailing straight for the zenith and Blake screwing his field glasses to the focus swept with them the mountain side toward the five mile distant cliff and presently the muscles about his mouth began to twitch sure sign with Blake of gathering excitement You re right sergeant he presently spoke repressing the desire to shout and striving lest Winsor should be moved to invidious comparisons to seem as nonchalant as Billy Ray himself They re coming back already Then down the mountain side he dove to plan and prepare appropriate welcome leaving Winsor and the glasses to keep double powered watch on the situation Six fifty of a glorious keen November morning and sixty troopers of the old regiment were distributed along a spur that crossed almost at right angles the line of the Indian trail Sixty fur capped rough coated fellows with their short brown carbines in hand crouching behind rocks and fallen trees keeping close to cover and warned to utter silence Behind them two hundred yards away their horses were huddled under charge of their disgusted guards envious of their fellows at the front and cursing hard their luck in counting off as number four Schreiber had just come sliding stumbling down from Winsor s perch to say they could hear faint sound of sharp volleying far out to the eastward where the warriors evidently were trying to stand off Webb s skirmish line until the travois with the wounded and the escort of the possible prisoners should succeed in getting back out of harm s way and taking surer and higher trail into the thick of the wilderness back of Bear Cliff Some of em must come in sight here in a minute sir panted the veteran sergeant We could see them plainly up there a mule litter and four travois and there must be a dozen in saddle A dozen there were for along the line of crouching men went sudden thrill of excitement Shoulders began to heave nervous thumbs bore down on heavy carbine hammers and there was sound of irrepressible stir and murmur Out among the pines five hundred yards away two mounted Indians popped suddenly into view two others speedily following their well nigh exhausted ponies feebly shaking their shaggy protesting heads as their riders plied the stinging quirt or jabbed with cruel lance only in painful jog trot could they zig zag through the trees Then came two warriors leading the pony of a crippled comrade Don t fire Don t harm them Fall back from the trail there and let them in They ll halt the moment they see our tracks Get em alive if possible were Blake s rapid orders for his eyes were eagerly fixed on other objects beyond these dejected leaders upon stumbling mules lashed fore and aft between long spliced saplings and bearing thus a rude litter Hay s pet wheelers turned to hospital use An Indian boy mounted led the foremost mule another watched the second while on each side of the occupant of this Sioux palanquin jogged a blanketed rider on jaded pony Here was a personage of consequence luckier much than these others following dragged along on travois whose trailing poles came jolting over stone or hummock along the rugged path It was on these that Blake s glittering eyes were fastened Pounce on the leaders you that are nearest he ordered in low telling tones the men at his left then turned to Schreiber crouching close beside him the fringe of his buckskin hunting shirt quivering over his bounding heart There s the prize I want he muttered low Whatever you do let no shot reach that litter Charge with me the moment the leaders yell You men to the right he added slightly raising his voice be ready to jump with me Don t shoot anybody that doesn t show fight Nab everything in sight Illustration CHARGE WITH ME THE MOMENT THE LEADERS YELL Whoo oop All in a second the mountain woke the welkin rang to a yell of warning from the lips of the leading Sioux All in a second they whirled their ponies about and darted back All in that second Blake and his nearmost sprang to their feet and flung themselves forward straight for the startled convoy In vain the few warriors bravely rallied about their foremost wounded the unwieldy litter could not turn about the frantic mules crazed by the instant pandemonium of shouts and shots the onward rush of charging men the awful screams of a brace of squaws broke from their leading reins crashed with their litter against the trees hurling the luckless occupant to earth Back drove the unhit warriors before the dash of the cheering line Down went first one pony then a second in his bloody tracks One after another litter travois wounded and prisoner was clutched and seized by stalwart hands and Blake panting not a little found himself bending staring over the prostrate form flung from the splintered wreck of the litter a form writhing in pain that forced no sound whatever from between grimly clinching teeth yet that baffled effort almost superb to rise and battle still a form magnificent in its proportions yet helpless through wounds and weakness Not the form Blake thought to see of shrinking delicate dainty woman but that of the furious warrior who thrice had dared him on the open field the red brave well known to him by sight and deed within the moon now waning but only within the day gone by revealed to him as the renegade Ralph Moreau Eagle Wing of the Ogalalla Sioux Where then was Nanette Look out for this man corporal he called to a shouting young trooper See that no harm comes to him Then quickly he ran on to the huddle of travois Something assured him she could not be far away The first drag litter held another young warrior sullen and speechless like the foremost The next bore a desperately wounded brave whose bloodless lips were compressed in agony and dumb as those of the dead About these cowered shivering and whimpering two or three terror stricken squaws one of them with a round eyed pappoose staring at her back A pony lay struggling in the snow close by Half a dozen rough soldier hands were dragging a stricken rider from underneath Half a dozen more were striving to control the wild plungings of another mettlesome little beast whose rider sitting firmly astride lashed first at his quivering flank and then at the fur gauntleted hands even at the laughing bearded faces sure sign of another squaw and a game one Far out to the front the crackle of carbine and rifle told that Webb was driving the scattered braves before him that the comrade squadron was coming their way that Bear Cliff had been sought by the Sioux in vain that Indian wiles and strategy Indian pluck and staying power all had more than met their match Whatever the fate of Lame Wolf s fighting force now pressed by Henry s column far in the southward hills here in sight of the broad Big Horn valley the white chief had struck a vital blow Village villagers wounded and prisoners were all the spoil of the hated soldiery Here at the scene of Blake s minor affair there appeared still in saddle just one undaunted unconquered amazon whose black eyes flashed through the woolen hood that hid the rest of her face whose lips had uttered as yet no sound but from whom two soldiers recoiled at the cry of a third Look at the hand of her fellers It s whiter than mine That s all right Lanigan answered the jovial voice of the leader they loved and laughed with Hold that pony steady Now by your ladyship s leave and two long sinewy arms went circling about the shrinking rider s waist and a struggling form was lifted straightway out of saddle and deposited not too gracefully on its moccasined feet We will remove this one impediment to your speech continued Blake whereat the muffling worsted was swiftly unwound and then we will listen to our meed of thanks Ah no wonder you did not need a side saddle that night at Frayne You ride admirably a califourchon My compliments Mademoiselle La Fleur or should I say Madame Moreau For all answer Blake received one quick stinging slap in the face from that mittenless little right hand CHAPTER XXI THANKSGIVING AT FRAYNE Thanksgiving Day at Frayne Much of the garrison was still afield bringing back to their lines and let us hope to their senses the remnant of Stabber s band chased far into the Sweetwater Hills before they would stop while Henry s column kept Lame Wolf in such active movement the misnamed chieftain richly won his later sobriquet The Skipper The general had come whirling back from Beecher in his Concord wagon to meet mister Hay as they bore that invalid homeward from the Big Horn Between the fever weakened trader and the famous frontier soldier there had been brief conference all that the doctors felt they could allow and then the former had been put to bed under the care of his devoted wife while the latter without so much as sight of a pillow had set forth again out Sweetwater way to wind up the campaign This time he went in saddle sending his own team over the range of the Medicine Bow to carry a convalescent subaltern to the side of a stricken father the sender ignorant possibly of the post commander s prohibition ignoring it if as probable it was known to him The good old doctor himself had bundled the grateful lad and sent a special hospital attendant with him missus Dade and her devoted allies up the row had filled with goodies a wonderful luncheon basket while missus Hay had sent stores of wine for the use of both invalids and had come down herself to see the start for without a word indicative of reproof the general had bidden Flint remove the blockade simply saying he would assume all responsibility both for missus Hay and the young Indian girl given refuge under the trader s roof until the coming of her own people still out with Stabber s band Flint could not fathom it He could only obey And now with the general gone and Beverly Field away with Hay home and secluded by order from all questioning or other extraneous worry with the wounded soldiers safely trundled into hospital garrison interest seemed to centre for the time mainly in that little Ogalalla maid Flint s sole Sioux captive who was housed said the much interrogated domestic in missus Hay s own room instead of Miss Flower s while the lady of the house when she slept at all occupied a sofa near her husband s bedside Then came the tidings that Blake with the prisoners from No Wood Creek and Bear Cliff was close at hand and everybody looked with eager eyes for the coming across the snowy prairie of that homeward bound convoy that big village of the Sioux with its distinguished captives wounded and unwounded one of the former the young sub chief Eagle Wing alias Moreau one of the latter a self constituted martyr since she was under no official restraint Nanette Flower hovering ever about the litter bearing that sullen and still defiant brave whose side she refused to leave Not until they reached Fort Frayne not until the surgeon after careful examination declared there was no need of taking Moreau into hospital no reason why he should not be confined in the prison room of the guard house were they able to induce the silent almost desperate girl to return to her aunt Not until Nanette realized that her warrior was to be housed within wooden walls whence she would be excluded could missus Hay devoted to the last persuade the girl to reoccupy her old room and to resume the dress of civilization Barring that worsted hood she was habited like a chieftain s daughter in gaily beaded and embroidered garments when recaptured by Blake s command Once within the trader s door she had shut herself in her old room the second floor front refusing to see anybody from outside the house unless she could be permitted to receive visits from the captive Sioux and this the major flintily forebade It was nightfall when the litter bearers reached the post Hay s rejoicing mules braying unmelodious ecstasy at sight of their old stable It was dark when the wounded chief was borne into the guard house uttering not a sound and Nanette was led within the trader s door yet someone had managed to see her face for the story went all over the wondering post that very night women flitting with it from door to door that every vestige of her beauty was gone she looked at least a dozen years older Blake when questioned after the first rapture of the home coming had subsided would neither affirm nor deny She would neither speak to me nor harken said he whimsically The only thing she showed was teeth and temper Then presently they sent a lot of the Sioux Stabber s villagers and Lame Wolf s combined by easy stages down the Platte to Laramie and then around by Rawhide and the Niobrara to the old Red Cloud agency there to be fed and coddled and cared for wounded warriors and all except a certain few including this accomplished orator and chieftain convalescing under guard at Frayne About his case there hung details and complications far too many and intricate to be settled short of a commission Already had the tidings of this most important capture reached the distant East Already both Indian Bureau and Peace Societies had begun to wire the general in the field and work the President and the Press at home Forgotten was the fact that he had been an intolerable nuisance to Buffalo Bill and others who had undertaken to educate and civilize him The Wild West Show was now amazing European capitals and therefore beyond consulting distance Forgotten were escapades at Harrisburg Carlisle and Philadelphia Suppressed were circumstances connecting him with graver charges than those of repeated roistering and aggravated assault Ignored or as yet unheard were the details of his reappearance on the frontier in time to stir up most of the war spirit developed that September and to take a leading part in the fierce campaign that followed He was a pupil of the nation said the good people of the Indian Friends Societies a youth of exceptional intelligence and promise a son of the Sioux whose influence would be of priceless value could he be induced to complete his education and accept the views and projects of his eastern admirers It would never do to let his case be settled by soldiers settlers and cowboys said philanthropy They would hang him starve him break his spirit at the very least They were treating him particularly well just now as he had sense enough to see There must be a deputation a committee to go out at once to the West with proper credentials per diem mileage and clerks to see to it that these unfortunate children of the mountain and prairie were accorded fair treatment and restored to their rights especially this brilliant young man Moreau The general was beyond reach and reasoning with but there was Flint eminent for his piety and untrammelled in command Flint with aspirations of his own the very man to welcome such influence as theirs and correspondingly to give ear to their propositions Two days after the safe lodgment of Eagle Wing behind the bars the telegrams were coming by dozens and one week after that deserved incarceration Fort Frayne heard with mild bewilderment the major s order for Moreau s transfer to the hospital By that time letters too were beginning to come and two nights after this removal to the little room but lately occupied by Lieutenant Field this very Thanksgiving night in fact the single sentry at the door stood attention to the commanding officer who in person ushered in a womanly form enveloped in hooded cloak and with bowed head Nanette Flower passed within the guarded portal which then closed behind her and left her alone with her wounded brave Blake and Billings had been sent on to Red Cloud guarding the presumably repentant Ogalallas Webb Ray Gregg and Ross were still afield in chase of Stabber Dade with four companies of infantry was in the Big Horn guarding Henry s wagon train There was no one now at Frayne in position to ask the new commander questions for doctor Waller had avoided him in every possible way but Waller had nobly done the work of his noble profession Moreau or Eagle Wing was mending so very fast there was no reason whatever why the doctor should object to his receiving visitors It was Flint alone who would be held responsible if anything went wrong Yet Fort Frayne to a woman took fire at the major s action Two days previous he might have commanded the support of missus Wilkins but Nanette herself had spoiled all chance of that It seems the lady had been to call at missus Hay s the previous day that missus Hay had begged to be excused that missus Wilkins had then persisted possibly as a result of recent conference with Flint and had bidden the servant say she d wait until Miss Flower could come down and so sailed on into the parlor intent on seeing all she could of both the house and its inmates But not a soul appeared missus Hay was watching over her sleeping husband whose slow recovery Flint was noting with unimpatient eye Voices low yet eager could be heard aloft in Nanette s room The servant when she came down had returned without a word to the inner regions about the kitchen and missus Wilkins s wait became a long one At last the domestic came rustling through the lower floor again and missus Wilkins hailed Both were Irish but one was the wife of an officer and long a power if not indeed a terror in the regiment The other feared the quartermaster s wife as little as missus Wilkins feared the colonel s and when ordered to stand and say why she brought no answer from Miss Flower declined to stand but decidedly said she brought none because there was none Did ye tell her I d wait said missus Wilkins I did said Miss McGrath an she said Let her an so I did Then in came missus Hay imploring hush and with rage in her Hibernian heart the consort of the quartermaster came away There was not one woman in all Fort Frayne therefore to approve the major s action in permitting this wild girl to visit the wilder Indian patient missus Hay knew nothing of it because Nanette well understood that there would be lodged objection that she dare not disregard her uncle s will One other girl there was that night at Frayne who marked her going and sought to follow and was recalled restrained at the very threshold by the sound of a beloved voice softly in the Sioux tongue calling her name One other girl there was who knew not of her going who shrank from thought of meeting her at any time in any place and yet was destined to an encounter fateful in its results in every way Just as tattoo was sounding on the infantry bugle Esther Dade sat reading fairy stories at the children s bedside in the quarters of Sergeant Foster of her father s company There had been Thanksgiving dinner with missus Ray an Amazonian feast since all their lords were still away on service and Sandy Ray and Billy junior were perhaps too young to count Dinner was all over by eight o clock and despite some merry games the youngsters eyes were showing symptoms of the sandman s coming when that privileged character Hogan Ray s long tried trooper now turned major domo appeared at the doorway of the little army parlor He had been bearer of a lot of goodies to the children among the quarters of the married soldiers and now would missus Dade please speak with missus Foster who had come over with him and missus Dade departed for the kitchen forthwith Presently she returned I m going back awhile with missus Foster said she She s sitting up to night with poor missus Wing who But there was no need of explanation They all knew They had laid so recently their wreaths of evergreen on the grave of the gallant soldier who fell fighting at the Elk and now another helpless little soul had come to bear the buried name and all that were left for mother and babe was woman s boundless charity It was Thanksgiving night and while the wail of the bereaved and stricken went up from more than one of these humble tenements below the eastward bluff there were scores of glad and grateful hearts that lifted praise and thanksgiving to the throne on high even though they knew not at the moment but that they too might even then be robbed of all that stood between them and desolation Once it happened in the story of our hard fighting hard used little army that a bevy of fair young wives nearly half a score in number in all the bravery of their summer toilets sat in the shadow of the flag all smiles and gladness and applause joining in the garrison festivities on the Nation s natal day never dreaming of the awful news that should fell them ere the coming of another sun that one and all they had been widowed more than a week that the men they loved whose names they bore lay hacked and mutilated beyond recognition within sight of those very hills where now the men from Frayne were facing the same old foe In the midst of army life we are indeed in death and the thanksgiving of loving ones about the fireside for mercies thus far shown is mingled ever with the dread of what the morrow may unfold Let me go too mamma was Esther s prompt appeal as she heard her mother s words I can put the children to bed while you and missus Foster are over there And so with Hogan lantern bearing mother and daughter had followed the sergeant s wife across the broad snow covered parade had passed without comment though each was thinking of the new inmate the brightly lighted hospital building on the edge of the plateau and descended the winding pathway to the humble quarters of the married soldiers nestling in the sheltered flats between the garrison proper and the bold bluffs that again close bordered the rushing stream And here at Sergeant Foster s doorway Esther parted from the elders and was welcomed by shrieks of joy from three sturdy little cherubs the sergeant s olive branches and here as the last notes of tattoo went echoing away under the vast and spangled sky one by one her charges closed their drooping lids and dropped to sleep and left their gentle friend and reader to her own reflections There was a soldier dance that night in one of the vacant messrooms Flint s two companies were making the best of their isolation and found as is not utterly uncommon quite a few maids and matrons among the households of the absent soldiery quite willing to be consoled and comforted There were bright lights therefore further along the edge of the steep beyond those of the hospital and the squeak of fiddle and drone of cello mingled with the plaintive piping of the flute were heard at intervals through the silence of the wintry night No tramp of sentry broke the hush about the little rift between the heights the major holding that none was necessary where there were so many dogs Most of the soldiers families had gone to the dance all of the younger children were asleep even the dogs were still and so when at ten o clock Esther tiptoed from the children s bedside and stood under the starlight the murmur of the Platte was the only sound that reached her ears until away over at the southwest gate the night guards began the long drawn heralding of the hour Ten o clock and all s well it went from post to post along the west and northward front but when Number Six at the quartermaster s storehouse near the southeast corner should have taken up the cry where it was dropped by Number Five afar over near the flagstaff there was unaccountable silence Six did not utter a sound Looking up from the level of Sudstown as it had earlier been named Esther could see the black bulk of the storehouse close to the edge of the plateau Between its westward gable end and the porch of the hospital lay some fifty yards of open space and through this gap now gleamed a spangled section of the western heavens Along the bluff just under the crest ran a pathway that circled the southeastward corner and led away to the trader s store south of the post Tradition had it that the track was worn by night raiders bearing contraband fluids from store to barracks in the days before such traffic was killed by that common sense promoter of temperance soberness and chastity the post exchange Along that bluff line from the storehouse toward the hospital invisible doubtless from either building or from the bluff itself but thrown in sharp relief against that rectangular inlet of starry sky two black figures crouching and bearing some long flat object between them swift and noiseless were speeding toward the hospital The next instant they were lost in the black background of that building Then as suddenly and a moment later one of them reappeared just for a moment against the brightly lighted window the southernmost window on the easterward side the window of the room that had been Beverly Field s the window of the room now given over to Eagle Wing the Sioux the captive for whose safe keeping a special sentry within the building and this strangely silent Number Six without were jointly responsible Then that silhouetted figure was blotted from her sight in general darkness for the lights within as suddenly went out And at that very moment a sound smote upon her ear unaccountable at that hour and that side of the garrison hoofbeats swiftly coming down into the hollow from the eastward bluff hoofbeats and low excited voices Foster s little house was southernmost of the settlement The ground was open between it and the heights and despite the low cautious tones Esther heard the foremost rider s muttered angering words Dam fool Crazy Heap crazy Too much hurry Ought t let him call off first Then an answer in guttural Sioux And then in an instant it dawned upon the girl that here was new crime new bloodshed perhaps and a plot to free a villianous captive Her first thought was to scream for aid but what aid could she summon Not a man was within hail except these the merciless haters of her race and name To scream would be to invite their ready knives to her heart to the heart of any woman who might rush to her succor The cry died in her throat and trembling with dread and excitement she clung to the door post and crouched and listened for stifled mutterings could be heard a curse or two in vigorous English a stamping of impatient ponies a warning in a woman s tone Then thank God Up at the storehouse corner a light came dancing into view In honest soldier tones boomed out the query What s the matter Six and then followed by a scurry of hoofs a mad lashing of quirts a scramble and rush of frightened steeds and a cursing of furious tongues her own brave young voice rang out on the night This way sergeant Help Quick Black forms of mounts and riders sped desperately away and then with all the wiry sinewy strength of her lithe and slender form Esther hurled herself upon another slender figure speeding after these afoot Desperately she clung to it in spite of savage blows and strainings And so they found her as forth they came a rush of shrieking startled candle bearing women of bewildered and unconsciously blasphemous men of the guard her arms locked firmly about a girl in semi savage garb The villain of the drama had been whisked away leaving the woman who sought to save him to the mercy of the foe CHAPTER XXII BEHIND THE BARS In the whirl and excitement following the startling outcry from the flats all Fort Frayne was speedily involved The guard came rushing through the night Corporal Shannon stumbling over a prostrate form the sentry on Number Six gagged and bound The steward shouted from the hospital porch that Eagle Wing the prisoner patient had escaped through the rear window despite its height above the sloping ground A little ladder borrowed from the quartermaster s corral was found a moment later An Indian pony saddled Sioux fashion was caught running riderless toward the trader s back gate his horsehair bridle torn half way from his shaggy head Sergeant Crabb waiting for no orders from the major no sooner heard that Moreau was gone than he rushed his stable guard to the saddleroom and in fifteen minutes had not only his own squad but half a dozen casual troopers circling the post in search of the trail and in less than half an hour was hot in chase of two fleeing horsemen dimly seen ahead through the starlight across the snowy wastes That snowfall was the Sioux s undoing Without it the trail would have been invisible at night With it the pursued were well nigh hopeless from the start Precious time had been lost in circling far out south of the post before making for the ford whither Crabb s instinct sent him at once to the end that he and two of his fellows ploughed through the foaming waters barely five hundred yards behind the chase and as they rode vehemently onward through the starlight straining every nerve they heard nothing of the happenings about the Fosters doorway where by this time post commander post surgeon post quartermaster and acting post adjutant post ordnance quartermaster and commissary sergeants many of the post guard and most of the post laundresses had gathered some silent anxious and bewildered some excitedly babbling while within the sergeant s domicile Esther Dade very pale and somewhat out of breath was trying with quiet self possession to answer the myriad questions poured at her while doctor Waller was ministering to the dazed and moaning sentry and in an adjoining tenement a little group had gathered about an unconscious form Someone had sent for missus Hay who was silently tearfully chafing the limp and almost lifeless hands of a girl in Indian garb The cloak and skirts of civilization had been found beneath the window of the deserted room and were exhibited as a means of bringing to his senses a much bewildered major whose first words on entering the hut gave rise to wonderment in the eyes of most of his hearers and to an impulsive reply from the lips of missus Hay I warned the general that girl would play us some Indian trick but he ordered her release said Flint and with wrathful emphasis came the answer The general warned you this girl would play you a trick and thanks to no one but you she s done it Then rising and stepping aside the long suffering woman revealed the pallid senseless face not of the little Indian maid her shrinking charge and guest but of the niece she loved and had lived and lied for many and trying years Nanette La Fleur a long lost sister s only child So Blake knew what he was talking about that keen November morning among the pines at Bear Cliff He had unearthed an almost forgotten legend of old Fort Laramie But the amaze and discomfiture of the temporary post commander turned this night of thanksgiving so far as he was concerned into something purgatorial The sight of his sentry bound gagged and bleeding the discovery of the ladder and of the escape of the prisoner for whom he was accountable had filled him with dismay yet for the moment failed to stagger his indomitable self esteem There had been a plot of course and the instant impulse of his soul was to fix the blame on others and to free himself An Indian trick of course and who but the little Indian maid within the trader s gates could be the instrument Through her of course the conspirators about the post had been enabled to act She was the general s protegee not his and the general must shoulder the blame Even when Flint saw Nanette self convicted through her very garb and her presence at the scene of the final struggle even when assured it was she and not the little Ogalalla girl who had been caught in the act that the latter in fact had never left the trader s house his disproportioned mind refused to grasp the situation Nanette he declared with pallid face must have been made a victim Nothing could have been farther from her thoughts than complicity in the escape of Eagle Wing She had every reason to desire his restoration to health strength and to the fostering care of the good and charitable body of Christian people interested in his behalf All this would be endangered by his attempt to rejoin the warriors on the warpath The major ordered the instant arrest of the sentry stationed at the door of the hospital room shut out by the major s own act from all possibility of seeing what was going on within He ordered under arrest the corporal of the relief on post for presumable complicity and mindful of a famous case of Ethiopian skill then new in the public mind demanded of doctor Waller that he say in so many words that the gag and wrist thongs on the prostrate sentry had not been self applied Waller impassively pointed to the huge lump at the base of the sufferer s skull Gag and bonds he might have so placed after much assiduous practice said he but no man living could hit himself such a blow at the back of the head Who could have done it then asked Flint It was inconceivable to Waller s mind that any one of the soldiery could have been tempted to such perfidy for an Indian s sake There was not at the moment an Indian scout or soldier at the post or an Indian warrior not a prisoner unaccounted for There had been halfbreeds hanging about the store prior to the final escapade of Pete and Crapaud but these had realized their unpopularity after the battle on the Elk and had departed for other climes Crapaud was still under guard Pete was still at large perchance with Stabber s braves There was not another man about the trader s place whom Flint or others could suspect Yet the sergeant of the guard searching cautiously with his lantern about the post of Number Six had come upon some suggestive signs The snow was trampled and bloody about the place where the soldier fell and there were here and there the tracks of moccasined feet those of a young woman or child going at speed toward the hospital running probably and followed close by a moccasined man Then those of the man alone went sprinting down the bluff southeastward over the flats some distance south of the Foster s doorway and up the opposite bluff to a point where four ponies shoeless had been huddled for as much perhaps as half an hour Then all four had come scampering down close together into the space below the hospital not fifty yards from where the sentry fell and the moccasined feet of a man and woman had scurried down the bluff from the hospital window to meet them west of Foster s shanty Then there had been confusion trouble of some kind One pony pursued a short distance had broken away the others had gone pounding out southeastward up the slope and out over the uplands then down again in wide sweep through the valley of the little rivulet and along the low bench southwest of the fort crossing the Rock Springs road and striking further on diagonally the Rawlins trail where Crabb and his fellows had found it and followed But all this took hours of time and meanwhile only half revived Nanette had been gently pityingly borne away to a sorrowing woman s home for at last it was found through the thick and lustrous hair that she too had been struck a harsh and cruel blow that one reason probably why she had been able to oppose no stouter resistance to so slender a girl as Esther Dade was that she was already half dazed through the stroke of some blunt heavy weapon wielded probably by him she was risking all to save Meantime the major had been pursuing his investigations Schmidt the soldier sentry in front of Moreau s door a simple hearted Teuton of irreproachable character tearfully protested against his incarceration He had obeyed his orders to the letter The major himself had brought the lady to the hospital and showed her in The door that had been open permitting the sentry constant sight of his prisoner had been closed by the commanding officer himself Therefore it was not for him a private soldier to presume to reopen it The major said to the lady he would return for her soon after ten and the lady smilingly Schmidt did not say how smilingly how bewitchingly smilingly but the major needed no reminder thanked him and said by that time she would be ready In a few minutes she came out saying doubtless with the same bewitching smile she would have to run over home for something and she was gone nearly half an hour and all that time the door was open the prisoner on the bed in his blankets the lamp brightly burning It was near tattoo when she returned with some things under her cloak and she was breathing quick and seemed hurried and shut the door after thanking him and he saw no more of her for fifteen minutes when the door opened and out she came the same cloak around her yet she looked different somehow and must have tiptoed for he didn t hear her heels as he had before She didn t seem quite so tall either and that was all for he never knew anything more about it till the steward came running to tell of the escape So Schmidt could throw but little light upon the situation save to Flint himself who did not then see fit to say to anyone that at no time was it covenanted that Miss Flower should be allowed to go and come unattended In doing so she had deluded someone beside the sentry It was late in the night when Number Six regained his senses and could tell his tale which was even more damaging Quite early in the evening so he said as early as nine o clock he was under the hospital corner listening to the music further up along the bluff A lady came from the south of the building as though she were going down to Sudstown missus Foster had gone down not long before and Hogan with a lantern and two officers ladies But this one came all alone and spoke to him pleasant like and said she was so sorry he couldn t be at the dance She d been seeing the sick and wounded in hospital she said and was going to bring some wine and jellies If he didn t mind she d take the path around the quartermaster s storehouse outside as she was going to mister Hay s and didn t care to go through by the guard house So Six let her go as he had no orders agin it even though it dawned upon him that this must be the young lady that had been carried off by the Sioux That made him think a bit he said and when she came back with a basket nicely covered with a white napkin she made him take a big chicken sandwich Sure I didn t know how to refuse the lady until she poured me out a big tumbler of wine wine she said she was taking in to Sergeant Briggs and Corporal Turner that was shot at the Elk and she couldn t bear to see me all alone out there in the cold But Six said he dasn t take the wine He got six months blind once for a similar solecism and mindful of the major s warning this was diplomatic Six swore he had sworn off and had to refuse the repeated requests of the lady He suspicioned her he said because she was so persistent Then she laughed and said good night and went on to the hospital What became of the wine she had poured out This from the grim and hitherto silent doctor seated by the bedside She must have tossed it out or drunk it herself perhaps Six didn t know Certainly no trace of it could be found in the snow Then nothing happened for as much as twenty minutes or so and he was over toward the south end of his post but facing toward the hospital when she came again down the steps and this time handed him some cake and told him he was a good soldier not to drink even wine and asked him what were the lights away across the Platte and he couldn t see any and was following her pointing finger and staring and then all of a sudden he saw a million lights dancing and stars and bombs and that was all he knew till they began talking to him here in hospital 
2397_162253_000012_000017	train-clean-360	Something had hit him from behind but he couldn t tell what 
2397_162253_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Flint s nerve was failing him for here was confirmation of the general s theory but there was worse to come and more of it 
none	none	Miss McGrath domestic at the trader s had told a tale that had reached the ears of Mistress McGann and twas the latter that bade the major summon the girl and demand of her what it was she had seen and heard concerning Crappo and the lady occupant of the second floor front at the trader s home Then it was that the major heard what others had earlier conjectured that there had been clandestine meetings whispered conferences and the like within the first week of the lovely niece s coming to Fort Frayne That notes had been fetched and carried by Crappo as well as Pete that Miss Flower was either a somnambulist or a good imitation of one as on two occasions the maid had peeked and seen her down stairs at the back door in the dead hours of the night or the very early morning That was when she first came Then since the recapture Miss McGrath felt confident that though never again detected down stairs Miss Flower had been out at night as Miss McGrath believed her to have been the night when was it when little Kennedy had his scrap wid the Sioux the boys do be all talkin about the night in fact that Stabber s band slipped away from the Platte Ray s troop following at dawn Questioned as to how it was possible for Miss Flower to get out without coming down stairs Miss McGrath said she wasn t good at monkeyshines herself but wimmen that could ride sthraddle wise were capable of climbs more difficult than that which the vine trellis afforded from the porch floor to the porch roof Miss McGrath hadn t been spying of course because her room was at the back of the house beyond the kitchen but how did the little heel tracks get on the veranda roof the road dust on the matting under the window the vine twigs in that quare made skirt never worn by day That Miss Flower could and did ride asthraddle and ride admirably when found with the Sioux at Bear Cliff everybody at Frayne well knew by this time That she had so ridden at Fort Frayne was known to no officer or lady of the garrison then present but believed by Miss McGrath because of certain inexpressibles of the same material with the quare made skirt both found dusty and somewhat bedraggled the morning Captain Blake was having his chase after the Indians and Miss Flower was so wild excited like All this and more did Miss McGrath reveal before being permitted to return to the sanctity of her chamber and Flint felt the ground sinking beneath his feet It might even be alleged of him now that he had connived at the escape of this most dangerous and desperate character this Indian leader of whom example prompt and sharp would certainly have been made unless the general and the ends of justice were defeated But what stung the major most of all was that he had been fairly victimized hoodwinked cajoled wheedled flattered into this wretched predicament all through the wiles and graces of a woman No one knew it whatever might be suspected but Nanette had bewitched him quite as much as missives from the East had persuaded and misled And so it was with hardened and resentful heart that the major sought her on the morrow The general and the commands afield would soon be coming home Such Indians as they had not rounded up and captured were scattered far and wide The campaign was over Now for the disposition of the prisoners It was to tell missus Hayand Nanette especially Nanette why the sentries were re established about their home and that though he would not place the trader s niece within a garrison cell he should hold her prisoner beneath the trader s roof to await the action of superior authority on the grievous charges lodged at her door She was able to be up said Miss McGrath not only up but down down in the breakfast room looking blither and more like herself than she had been since she was brought home Say that Major Flint desires to see her and missus Hay said Flint with majesty of mien as followed by two of his officers he was shown into the trader s parlor 
2397_162253_000017_000000	train-clean-360	And presently they came missus 
none	none	Hay pale and sorrowing Miss Flower pale perhaps but triumphantly defiant The one sat and covered her face with her hands as she listened to the major s few words cold stern and accusing The other looked squarely at him with fearless glittering eyes You may order what you like so far as I m concerned was the utterly reckless answer of the girl I don t care what you do now that I know he is safe free and that you will never lay hands on him again That s where you are in error Miss Flower was the major s calm cold blooded yet rejoiceful reply It was for this indeed that he had come Ralph Moreau was run down by my men soon after midnight and he s now behind the bars CHAPTER XXIII A SOLDIER ENTANGLED December and bitter cold The river frozen stiff The prairie sheeted in unbroken snow Great log fires roaring in every open fireplace Great throngs of soldiery about the red hot barrack stoves for all the columns were again in winter columns and Flint s two companies had got the route for home They were to march on the morrow escorting as far as Laramie the intractables of Stabber s band some few of the Indians to go in irons among them Ralph Moreau or Eagle Wing now a notorious character The general was there at Frayne with old Black Bill erstwhile chief inspector of the department once a subaltern in days long gone by when Laramie was Ultima Thule of the plains forts The general had heard Flint s halting explanation of his laxity in Moreau s case saying almost as little in reply as his old friend Grant when interviewed by those of whom he disapproved Black Bill it was who waxed explosive when once he opened on the major and showed that amazed New Englander something of the contents of Moreau s Indian kit including the now famous hunting pouch all found with Stabber s village A precious scoundrel as it turned out was this same Moreau with more sins to answer for than many a convicted jail bird and with not one follower left to do him reverence except perhaps that lonely girl self secluded at the Hays Hay himself though weak was beginning to sit up Dade Blake and Ray were all once more housed in garrison Truscott and Billings with their hardy troopers had taken temporary station at the post until the general had decided upon the disposition of the array of surrendered Indians nearly three hundred in number now confined under strong guard in the quartermaster s corral at the flats with six head devils including Eagle Wing in the garrison prison All the officers with two exceptions were again for duty at Frayne Webb laid by the heels at Beecher his feet severely frozen and Beverly Field who recalled from a brief and solemn visit to a far southern home had reached the post at nightfall of the tenth There had hardly been allowed him time to uplift a single prayer to receive a word of consolation from the lips of friends and kindred who loved the honored father borne to his last resting place Come as soon as possible read the message wired him by Ray and though the campaign was over it was evident that something was amiss and with all his sorrow fresh upon him the lad sore in body and soul had hastened to obey And it was Ray who received and welcomed him and took him straightway to his own cosy quarters that missus Ray and then the Blakes might add their sympathetic and cordial greeting ere it came to telling why it was that these his friends despite that trouble that could not be talked of were now so earnest in their sympathy before telling him that his good name had become involved that there were allegations concerning him which the chief had ordered pigeon holed until he should come to face them A pity it is that Bill Hay could not have been there too but his fever had left him far too weak to leave his room Only Ray and Blake were present and it was an interview not soon if ever to be forgotten I m no hand at breaking things gently Field said Ray when finally the three were closeted together in the captain s den It used to worry Webb that you were seen so often riding with Miss Miss Flower up to Stabber s village and in the light of what has since happened you will admit that he had reasons Hear me through he continued as Field sitting bolt upright in the easy chair essayed to speak Neither Captain Blake nor I believe one word to your dishonor in the matter but it looks as though you had been made a tool of and you are by no means the first man It was to see this fellow Moreau Eagle Wing whom you recognized at the Elk she was there so frequently was it not Into Field s pale face there had come a look of infinite distress For a moment he hesitated and little beads began to start out on his forehead Captain Ray he finally said they tell me I heard it from the driver on the way up from Rock Springs that Miss Flower is virtually a prisoner that she had been in league with the Sioux and yet until I can see her can secure my release from a promise I have to answer you as I answered you before I cannot say Blake started impatiently and heaved up from his lounging chair his long legs taking him in three strides to the frost covered window at the front Ray sadly shook his dark curly head You are to see her Field The general bless him for a trump wouldn t listen to a word against you in your absence but that girl has involved everybody you her aunt who has been devotion itself to her her uncle who was almost her slave She deliberately betrayed him into the hands of the Sioux In fact this red robber and villain Moreau is the only creature she hasn t tried to work and he abandoned her after she had lied sneaked and stolen for him Captain Ray The cry came from pallid lips and the young soldier started to his feet appalled at such accusation Every word of it is true said Ray She joined him after his wounds She shared his escape from the village at our approach She was with him when Blake nabbed them at Bear Cliff She was going with him from here What manner of girl was that Field for you to be mixed up with He is her half brother protested Field with kindling eyes She told me everything told me of their childhood together and Told you a pack of infernal lies burst in Blake no longer able to contain himself Made you a cat s paw led you even to taking her by night to see him when she learned the band were to jump for the mountains used you by God as he used her and like the Indian she is she d turn and stab you now if you stood in her way or his Why Field that brute s her lover and she s his It s a lie You shall not say it sir cried Field beside himself with wrath and amaze as he stood quivering from head to foot still weak from wounds fever and distress of mind But Ray sprang to his side Hush Blake Hush Field Don t speak What is it Hogan And sharply he turned him to the door never dreaming what had caused the interruption The general sir to see the captain And there in the hallway throwing off his heavy overcoat and arctics there with that ever faithful aide in close attendance was the chief they loved dropped in all unsuspecting just to say good bye I knocked twice began Hogan but Ray brushed him aside for catching sight of the captain s face the general was already at the door Another moment and he had discovered Field and with both hands extended all kindliness and sympathy he stepped at once across the room to greet him I was so very sorry to hear the news said he I knew your father well in the old days How s your wound What brought you back so soon And then there was one instant of awkward silence and then Ray spoke That was my doing general I believed it best that he should be here to meet you and every allegation at his expense mister Field I feel sure does not begin to know them yet especially as to the money It was all recovered said the general It was found almost intact so was much of that that they took from Hay Even if it hadn t been Hay assumed all responsibility for the loss With new bewilderment in his face the young officer still white and trembling was gazing half stupefied from one to the other What money he demanded I never heard Wait said the general with significant glance at Ray who was about to speak I am to see them missus Hay and her niece at nine o clock It is near that now Webb cannot be with us but I shall want you Blake Say nothing until then Sit down mister Field and tell me about that leg Can you walk from here to Hay s I wonder Then the ladies missus Ray and her charming next door neighbor appeared and the general adjourned the conference forthwith and went with them to the parlor Say nothing more Ray found time to whisper You ll understand it all in twenty minutes And at nine o clock the little party was on its way through the sharp and wintry night the general and Captain Blake side by side ahead the aide de camp and mister Field close following doctor Waller who had been sent for met them near the office The sentries at the guard house were being changed as the five tramped by along the snapping and protesting board walk and a sturdy little chap in fur cap and gauntlets and huge buffalo overcoat caught sight of them and facing outward slapped his carbine down to the carry the night signal of soldier recognition of superior rank as practised at the time Tables are turned with a vengeance said the general with his quiet smile That s little Kennedy isn t it I seem to see him everywhere when we re campaigning Moreau was going to eat his heart out next time they met I believe So he said grinned Blake before Winsor s bullet fetched him Pity it hadn t killed instead of crippling him He s a bad lot sighed the general Wing won t fly away from Kennedy I fancy Not if there s a shot left in his belt said Blake And Ray is officer of the day There ll be no napping on guard this night At the barred aperture that served for window on the southward front a dark face peered forth in malignant hate as the speakers strode by But it shrank back when the sentry once more tossed his carbine to the shoulder and briskly trudged beneath the bars Six Indians shared that prison room four of their number destined to exile in the distant East to years perhaps within the casemates of a seaboard fort the last place on earth for a son of the warlike Sioux They know their fate I understand said Blake as the general moved on again Oh yes Their agent and others have been here with Indian Bureau orders permitting them to see and talk with the prisoners Their shackles are to be riveted on to night Nearly time now isn t it At tattoo sir The whole guard forms then and the four are to be moved into the main room for the purpose I am glad this is the last of it Yes we ll start them with Flint at dawn in the morning He ll be more than glad to get away too He hasn t been over lucky here either A strange domestic the McGrath having been given warning and removed to Sudsville showed them into the trader s roomy parlor the largest and most pretentious at the post Hay had lavished money on his home and loved it and the woman who had so adorned it She came in almost instantly to greet them looking piteously into the kindly bearded face of the general and civilly yet absently welcoming the others She did not seem to realize that Field who stood in silence by the side of Captain Blake had been away She had no thought apparently for anyone but the chief himself he who held the destinies of her dear ones in the hollow of his hand His first question was for Fawn Eyes the little Ogalalla maiden whose history he seemed to know She is well and trying to be content with me was the reply She has been helping poor Nanette She does not seem to understand or realize what is coming to him Have they ironed him yet Illustration HUSH SHE S COMING SHE WAS THERE I believe not said the general But it has to be done to night They start so early in the morning And you won t let her see him general No good can come from it She declares she will go to him in the morning if you prohibit it to night and the richly jewelled hands of the unhappy woman were clasped almost in supplication By morning he will be beyond her reach The escort starts at six And these gentlemen here She looked nervously appealingly about her Must they all know These and the inspector general He will be here in a moment But indeed missus Hay it is all known practically said the general with sympathy and sorrow in his tone Not all not all general Even I don t know all She herself has said so Hush She s coming She was there They had listened for swish of skirts or fall of slender feet upon the stairway but there had not been a sound They saw the reason as she halted at the entrance lifting with one little hand the costly Navajo blanket that hung as a portiere In harmony with the glossy folds of richly dyed wool she was habited in Indian garb from head to foot In two black lustrous braids twisted with feather and quill and ribbon her wealth of hair hung over her shoulders down the front of her slender form A robe of dark blue stuff rich with broidery of colored bead and bright hued plumage hung close clinging and her feet were shod in soft moccasins also deftly worked with bead and quill But it was her face that chained the gaze of all and that drew from the pallid lips of Lieutenant Field a gasp of mingled consternation and amaze Without a vestige of color with black circles under her glittering eyes with lines of suffering around the rigid mouth and with that strange pinched look about the nostrils that tells of anguish bodily and mental Nanette stood at the doorway looking straight at the chief She had no eyes for lesser lights All her thought apparently was for him for him whose power it was in spite of vehement opposition to deal as he saw fit with the prisoner in his hands Appeal on part of Friends Societies Peace and Indian Associations had failed The President had referred the matter in its entirety to the general commanding in the field and the general had decided One moment she studied his face then came slowly forward No hand extended No sign of salutation greeting much less of homage Ignoring all others present she addressed herself solely to him Is it true you have ordered him in irons and to Fort Rochambeau she demanded It is Simply because he took part with his people when your soldiers made war on them she asked her pale lips quivering You well know how much else there was answered the general simply And I have told you he deserves no pity of yours Oh you say he came back here a spy she broke forth impetuously It is not so He never came near the post nearer than Stabber s village and there he had a right to be You say twas he who led them to the warpath that he planned the robbery here and took the money He never knew they were going till they were gone He never stole a penny That money was loaned him honestly and for a purpose and with the hope and expectation of rich profit thereby By you do you mean asked the general calmly as before By me No What money had I He asked it and it was given him by Lieutenant Field A gasp that was almost a cry following instantly on this insolent assertion a sound of stir and start among the officers at whom she had not as yet so much as glanced now caused the girl to turn one swift contemptuous look their way and in that momentary flash her eyes encountered those of the man she had thus accused Field stood like one turned suddenly to stone gazing at her with wild incredulous eyes One instant she seemed to sway as though the sight had staggered her but the rally was as instantaneous Before the general could interpose a word she plunged on again He at least had a heart and conscience He knew how wrongfully Moreau had been accused that money was actually needed to establish his claim It would all have been repaid if your soldiers had not forced this wicked war and and now in her vehemence her eyes were flashing her hand uplifted when all on a sudden the portiere was raised the second time and there at the doorway stood the former inspector general Black Bill At sight of him the mad flow of words met sudden stop Down slowly down came the clinched uplifted hand Her eyes glaring as were Field s a moment agone were fixed in awful fascination on the grizzled face Then actually she recoiled as the veteran officer stepped quietly forward into the room And what said he with placid interest I haven t heard you rave in many a moon Nanette You are your mother over again without your mother s excuse for fury But a wondrous silence had fallen on the group The girl had turned rigid For an instant not a move was made and in the hush of all but throbbing hearts the sound of the trumpets pealing forth the last notes of tattoo came softly through the outer night Then sudden close at hand yet muffled by double door and windows came other sounds sounds of rush and scurry excited voices cries of halt halt the ring of a carbine a yell of warning another shot and Blake and the aide de camp sprang through the hallway to the storm door without missus Hay shuddering with dread ran to the door of her husband s chamber beyond the dining room She was gone but a moment When she returned the little Ogalalla maid trembling and wild eyed had come running down from aloft The general had followed into the lighted hallway they were all crowding there by this time and the voice of Captain Ray with just a tremor of excitement about it was heard at the storm door on the porch in explanation to the chief Moreau sir Broke guard and stabbed Kennedy The second shot dropped him He wants Fawn Eyes his sister A scream of agony rang through the hall shrill and piercing Then the wild cry followed You shall not hold me Let me go to him I say I am his wife CHAPTER XXIV THE DEATH SONG OF THE SIOUX That was a gruesome night at Frayne Just at tattoo the door leading to the little cell room had been thrown open and the sergeant of the guard bade the prisoners come forth all warriors of the Ogalalla band and foremost of their number was Eagle Wing the battle leader Recaptured by Crabb and his men after a desperate flight and fight for liberty he had apparently been planning ever since a second essay even more desperate In sullen silence he had passed his days showing no sign of recognition of any face among his guards until the morning Kennedy appeared all malice forgotten now that his would be slayer was a helpless prisoner and therefore did the Irishman greet him jovially That man would knife you if he had half a chance said the sergeant Watch out for him You bet I ll watch out said Kennedy never dreaming that despite all search and vigilance Moreau had managed to obtain and hide a knife In silence they had shuffled forth into the corridor The heavy portal swung behind them confining the other two Another door opened into the guardroom proper where stood the big red hot stove and where waited two blacksmiths with the irons Once in the guard room every window was barred and members of the guard three deep blocked in eager curiosity the doorway leading to the outer air In the corridor on one side stood three infantry soldiers with fixed bayonets On the other facing them three others of the guard Between them shuffled the Sioux Wing leading One glance at the waiting blacksmiths was enough With the spring of a tiger he hurled himself head foremost and bending low straight at the open doorway and split his way through the astonished guards like center rush at foot ball scattering them right and left then darted round the corner of the guard house agile as a cat And there was Kennedy confronting him One furious lunge he made with gleaming knife then shot like an arrow straight for the southward bluff It was bad judgment He trusted to speed to dim starlight to bad aim perhaps but the little Irishman dropped on one knee and the first bullet tore through the muscles of a stalwart arm the second better aimed pierced the vitals Then they were on him men by the dozen in another instant as he staggered and fell there impotent and writhing They bore him to the cell again the hospital was too far and Waller and his aides came speedily to do all that surgery could accomplish but he cursed them back He raved at Ray who entered leading poor sobbing little Fawn Eyes and demanded to be left alone with her Waller went out to minister to Kennedy bleeding fast and the others looked to Ray for orders when the door was once more opened and Blake entered with Nanette By the general s order said he in brief explanation and in an instant she was on her knees beside the dying Sioux There and thus they left them Waller said there was nothing to be done The junior surgeon Tracy he whom she had so fascinated only those few weeks before bent and whispered Call me if you need I shall remain within hearing But there came no call At taps the door was once more softly opened and Tracy peered within Fawn Eyes rocking to and fro was sobbing in an abandonment of grief Nanette face downward lay prone upon a stilled and lifeless heart Flint and his escort duly went their way and spread their story as they camped at Laramie and the Chug The general tarried another week at Frayne There was still very much to keep him there so not until he and Black Bill came down did we at other stations learn the facts The general as usual had little to say The colonel talked for both A woful time it seems they had had with poor Nanette when at last it became necessary to take her away from her dead brave She raged and raved at even her pleading aunt Defiant of them all from the general down and reckless of law or fact she vowed it was all a conspiracy to murder Moreau in cold blood They gave him the knife she declared although it later developed that she had tossed it through the open window They had given him the chance to escape the sight of Kennedy who had striven to kill him twice before and then of the blacksmiths with their degrading shackles all just to tempt him to make a dash for freedom just as they had lured and murdered Crazy Horse Crazy Horse his brave kinsman not ten years before then had placed a dead shot on the path to life and liberty a man who killed him in cold blood as deliberately planned These were her accusations and that story took strong hold in certain circles in the far East where love of truth inspired its widespread publication but not its contradiction when the facts became known The same conditions obtain to day in dealing with affairs across the sea Nanette said many other things before her final breakdown and Hay and his sorrowing wife found their load of care far heaviest for the strain of Indian blood now known to all had steeled the soul of the girl against the people at Fort Frayne men and women both against none so vehemently as those who would have shown her sympathy none so malignantly as those who had suffered for her sake This was especially true of Field In the mad hope of getting justice as she termed it for the dead she had demanded speech of the general and in presence of Black Bill and the surgeon he had given her a hearing It proved fatal to her cause for in her fury at what she termed the triumph of his foes she lost all sense of right or reason and declared that it was Field who had warned Stabber s band and sent them fleeing to unite with Lame Wolf Field who took the trader s horses and rode by night with Kennedy to warn them it was Webb s intention to surround the village at dawn and make prisoners of the men It was Field she said who furnished the money Moreau needed to establish his claim to a gold mine in the Black Hills the ownership of which would make them rich and repay Field a dozen times over It was Field who sought to protect her kindred among the Sioux in hopes she said it boldly of winning her But the general had heard enough The door was opened and Ray and Blake were ushered in The former briefly told of the finding of her note in Field s room the night the adjutant was so mysteriously missing The note itself was held forth by the inspector general and she was asked if she cared to have it opened and read aloud Her answer was that Field was a coward a dastard to betray a woman who had trusted him Oh he didn t said Blake drily Twas just the other way He couldn t be induced to open his head so his friends took a hand You got word of the outbreak through your Indian followers You wrote to Field and sent the note by Pete bidding him join you at that godless hour telling him that you would provide the horses and that you must ride to Stabber s camp to see Moreau for the last time as he was going at once to the Black Hills You made Field believe he was your half brother instead of what he was You brought Moreau back to the post and took something I can t say what down to him from mister Hay s he waiting for you on the flats below the trader s corral You should have worn your moccasins as well as a divided skirt that night instead of French heeled bottines The rest others can tell The others were Kennedy and the recaptured half recalcitrant Pete the latter turned state s evidence Kennedy told how he had wandered down into the flats after the few dhrinks that made him think scornful of Sioux of his encounter with Eagle Wing his rescue by Field and a girl who spoke Sioux like a native He thought it was little Fawn Eyes when he heard her speak and until he heard this lady then he understood He had been pledged to secrecy by the lieutenant and never meant to tell a soul but when he heard the lie the lady told about the lieutenant it ended any promise Then Pete an abject whining wretch was ushered in and his story when dragged out by the roots was worst of all Poor missus Hay She had to hear it for they sent for her somebody had to restrain Nanette Pete said he had known Nanette long time ever since baby So had Crapaud Yes and they had known Eagle Wing Moreau always knew his father and mother Knew Nanette s father and mother But Black Bill interposed No need to go into these particulars as substantiating missus Hay and himself said he The lady knows perfectly well that I know all about her girlhood so Pete returned to modern history Eagle Wing it seems came riding often in from Stabber s camp to see Nanette by night and he was in heap trouble always heap trouble always want money and one night she told Pete he must come with her must never tell of it She had money she said her own in the trader s safe but the door was too heavy she couldn t open it even though she had the key She had opened the store by the back door then came to him to help her with the rest He pulled the safe door open he said and then she hunted and found two big letters and took them to the house and next night she opened the store again and he pulled open the safe and she put back the letters and sent him to mister Field s back door with note and then over to saddle Harney and Dan and bring em out back way from stable Then later she told him Captain Blake had Eagle Wing s buckskin pouch and letters and they must get them or somebody would hang Eagle Wing and she kept them going all time going meeting messengers from the Sioux camps or carrying letters She fixed everything for the Sioux to come and capture Hay and the wagon fixed everything even to nearly murdering the sentry on Number Six Pete and Spotted Horse a young brave of Stabber s band had compassed that attempted rescue She would have had them kill the sentry if need be and the reason they didn t get Wing away was that she couldn t wait until the sentries had called off They might even then have succeeded only her pony broke away and she clung to Eagle Wing s until he he had to hit her to make her let go The wild girl in a fury declared it false from end to end The poor woman weeping by her side bowed her head and declared it doubtless true Her story missus Hay s was saddest of all Her own father died when she was very very young He was a French Canadian trader and traveller who had left them fairly well to do Next to her Indian mother missus Hay had loved no soul on earth as she had her pretty baby sister The girls grew up together The younger petted and spoiled fell in love with a handsome reckless young French half breed Jean La Fleur against all warnings became his wife and was soon bullied beaten and deserted She lived but a little while leaving to her more prosperous and level headed sister now wedded to mister Hay their baby daughter also named Nanette and by her the worthy couple had done their very best Perhaps it would have been wiser had they sent the child away from all association with the Sioux but she had lived eight years on the Laramie in daily contact with them sharing the Indian sports and games loving their free life and rebelling furiously when finally taken East She was the real reason why her aunt spent so many months of each succeeding year away from her husband and the frontier One of the girl s playmates was a magnificent young savage a son of Crow Killer the famous chief The father was killed the day of Crazy Horse s fierce assault on the starving force of General Crook at Slim Buttes in seventy six and good kind missionary people speedily saw promise in the lad put him at school and strove to educate him The rest they knew Sometimes at eastern schools sometimes with Buffalo Bill but generally out of money and into mischief Eagle Wing went from one year to another and Nanette foolishly permitted to meet him again in the East had become infatuated All that art and education wealth travel and luxury combined could do was done to wean her from her passionate adoration of this superb young savage There is no fiercer more intense devotion than that the Sioux girl gives the warrior who wins her love She becomes his abject slave She will labor lie steal sin suffer die gladly die for him if only she believes herself loved in turn and this did Nanette more than believe and believing slaved and studied between his irregular appearances that she might wheedle more money from her aunt to lavish on her brave When discovered meeting him in secret and by night she was locked in her third story room and thought secure until the day revealed her gone by way of the lightning rod They had to resort to more stringent measures but time and again she met him undetected until too late and when at last her education was declared complete she had amazed her aunt by expressing willingness to go to Frayne when the good woman thought the objectionable kinsman abroad with Buffalo Bill Until too late missus Hay knew nothing of his having been discharged and of his preceding them to the West Then Nanette begged her for more money because he was in dreadful trouble had stabbed a police officer at Omaha whose people so Moreau said agreed not to prosecute him if one thousand dollars could be paid at once Hay s patience had been exhausted He had firmly refused to contribute another cent to settle Moreau s scrapes even though he was a distant kinsman of his wife and they both were fond of his little sister Fawn Eyes It had never occurred to missus Hay that Nan could steal from or plot against her benefactors but that was before she dreamed that Nanette had become the Indian s wife After that anything might happen If she could do that for love of Moreau said she there was nothing she could not do And it would seem there was little short of deliberate murder she had not done for her Sioux lover who had rewarded her utter self sacrifice by a savage blow with a revolver butt Poor Nanette sobbed missus Hay and Poor Nanette said all Fort Frayne their distrust of her buried and forgotten as she lay refusing herself to everyone starving herself in dull desperate misery in her lonely room Even grim old Black Bill whom she had recognized at once Bill who had been the first to confirm Blake s suspicions as to her identity had pity and compassion for her It s the way of the blood said Blake She is Bred out of that bloody strain That haunted us in our familiar paths She could do no different said the general having fixed her love on him It s the strain of the Sioux We call her conduct criminal they call it sublime And one night while decision in Nanette s case was still pending and still self secluded she hid within the trader s home refusing speech with anyone but little Fawn Eyes a sleighing party set out from Frayne for a spin by moonlight along the frozen Platte Wagon bodies had been set on runners and piled with hay The young people from officers row with the proper allowance of matrons and elders were stowed therein and tucked in robes and furs Esther Dade among them gentle and responsive as ever yet still very silent Field in his deep mourning went nowhere He seemed humiliated beyond words by his connection with this most painful affair Even the general failed to cheer and reassure him He blamed himself for everything and shrank even from his friends They saw the dim glow of the student lamp in his quarters as they jingled cheerily away They were coming homeward toward ten o clock The moon was shining brilliantly along the bold heights of the southern bank and insensibly chat and laughter gradually ceased as they came again in sight of the twinkling lights of Frayne and glanced aloft at a new made scaffolding standing black against the sky at the crest of Fetterman Bluff Eagle Wing roosts high said a thoughtless youngster The general let them have their way to the last What s that he added with sudden stop The sleigh had as suddenly been reined in The driver an Irish trooper crossed himself for on the hush of the breathless winter night there rose and fell shrill quavering now high now low in mournful minor a weird desolate despairing chant the voice of a heart broken woman and one and all they knew at once it was Nanette after the manner of her mother s people alone on the lofty height alone in the wintry wilderness sobbing out her grief song to the sleeping winds mourning to the last her lost her passionately loved brave Then all on a sudden it ceased A black form started from under the scaffolding to the edge of the bluff Then again weird wild uncanny a barbaric almost savage strain burst from the lips of the girl Mother of Heavin cried the driver Can no one shtop that awful keen It s her death song she s singin Two young officers sprang from the sleigh but at the instant another cry arose Another form this one of horse and rider appeared at the crest silhouetted with the girl s against the stars They saw the rider leap from saddle almost within arms length of the singer saw her quickly turn as though for the first time aware of an intruder Then the wailing song went out in sudden scream of mingled wrath hatred and despair and like the Sioux that she was at heart the girl made one mad rush to reach the point of bluff where was a sheer descent of over eighty feet A shriek of dread went up from the crowded sleigh a cry of rejoicing as the intruder sprang and clasped her preventing her reaching the precipice But almost instantly followed a moan of anguish for slipping at the crest together firmly linked they came rolling sliding shooting down the steep incline of the frozen bluff and brought up with stunning force among the ice blocks logs and driftwood at the base They bore them swiftly homeward Field senseless and sorely shaken Nanette s fierce spirit slowly drifting away from the bruised and broken tenement held there so pityingly in the arms of Esther Dade Before the Christmas fires were lighted in the snowbound frontier fort they had laid all that was mortal of the brave deluded girl in the little cemetery of Fort Frayne her solemn story closed on earth forever L ENVOI Nearly two years later with the old regiment still serving along the storied Platte they were talking of her one moonlit evening at the flagstaff The band by this time a fixture at Frayne had been playing delightfully and some of the girls and young gallants had been waltzing on the Rays veranda A few new faces were there Two faces well known were missing those of Esther Dade and Beverly Field The latter had never been the same man since the tragic events that followed so closely on the heels of the Lame Wolf campaign Wounds had slowly healed Injuries physical were well nigh forgotten but mentally he had been long a sufferer For months after the death of Nanette even when sufficiently restored to be on duty he held shrinkingly aloof from post society Even Webb Blake and Ray were powerless to pull him out of his despond He seemed to feel indeed he said so that his brief entanglement with that strange fascinating girl had clouded his soldier name for all time To these stanch friends and advisers he frankly told the whole story and they in turn had told it to the general to the colonel commanding the regiment and to those whose opinions they most valued but Field could speak of it to none others Frankly he admitted that from the moment he met the girl he fell under the influence of a powerful fascination Within twenty four hours of his return from the Laramie trip they were riding together and during that ride she asked to be taken to Stabber s village and there had talked long with that magnificent young Sioux Later Field surprised her in tears and then she told him a pitiful tale Eagle Wing had been educated she said by her aunt and uncle was indeed their nephew and her own cousin He had been wild and had given them much trouble and her aunt was in bitter distress over his waywardness It was to plead with him that she Nanette had gone Moreau had been taught mining and mineralogy it seems and declared that he had located a most promising mine in the Black Hills He could buy off every claim if he had a thousand dollars and the mine might be worth millions Hay pooh poohed the story missus Hay could not persuade him Then Moreau became threatening He would join the hostiles he swore if his aunt would not help him Indeed and here Field s young face burned with shame Nanette told him that she understood that he Field was an only son who might inherit wealth in days to come and could draw upon his father now for any reasonable sum and within the week of his meeting her he was on the point of offering everything she needed but that he disbelieved the Indian s story Then one night there came a note begging him to meet her at once She had a dreadful message she said from Moreau The fellow had frequently been prowling about the trader s during the dark hours and now she was afraid of him yet must see him and see him at once even if she had to ride to Stabber s camp Field s eyes were blinded and he went Hay s horses were ready beyond the corral and she rode astride on one of Hay s own saddles They found Moreau awaiting them at the ford and there was a scene Field could not understand for they spoke in the Sioux language That night it was that all in tears at the Indian s obduracy she owned that he was her own brother not merely a cousin and together they had all gone back toward Frayne Moreau was to wait on the flats until she could return to the house She had been striving to get him to make certain promises she said contingent on her giving him something from her own means Field said he remonstrated with her to the utmost but she told him no woman with Sioux blood in her veins ever deserted a brother or lover And so she had returned with a packet presumably of money and there they found the Indian clinched with Kennedy Kennedy was rescued in the nick of time and pledged to silence The Indian rode away triumphant Nanette climbed back to her window exhausted apparently by her exertions and Field started for his quarters only to find the entire garrison astir The rest they knew Asked how she came to know of the money in the trader s safe he said no secret had been made of it by either Hay or him She had asked him laughingly about his quarrel with Wilkins and seemed deeply interested in all the details of subaltern life Either Hay or he fortunately could have made good the missing sum even had most of it not been found amongst Stabber s plunder Field had never seen her again until the night the general took him to confront her at the Hays and all too late had realized how completely she had lured and used him In pride honor self respect he had been sorely wounded and even when assured that the general attached no blame to him and that his name was no longer involved he would have resigned his commission and quit the service had it not been for these soldiers three Webb Blake and Ray They made him see that all the more because his father s death had left him independent sole master of quite a valuable property he must stick to the sword and live down the possible stain And stay he did refusing even a chance to go abroad the following spring and devoting himself assiduously to his duties although he shrank from society They made him sometimes spend a quiet evening at Ray s or Blake s where twice Miss Dade was found But that young lady was quick to see that her hostess had been scheming as loving women will And then when he went hoping to see her yet half afraid she came no more They could not coax her The early spring had taken him forth on long campaign The ensuing fall had taken her to the far distant East for gallant old Dade was breaking down The doctors sent him on prolonged sick leave Then was Fort Frayne indeed a desolate post to Beverly Field and when midwinter came and with it the news that Dade had but little while to live he took counsel with Ray and a month s leave not much of which was spent in the South The old regiment was represented at the sad and solemn little ceremony when the devoted husband father and fellow soldier was laid at rest Nor was Field a happier man when he rejoined from leave and they all thought they knew why Letters came black bordered with Esther s superscription sometimes but only for missus Blake or missus Ray There was never one for Field And so a second summer came and went and a second September was ushered in and in the flood of the full moonlight there was again music and dancing at Fort Frayne but not for Field not for Esther Dade They were all talking of Nanette Daughter of the Dakotas and Esther Daughter of the Regiment as they called her in her father s Corps and the mail came late from Laramie and letters were handed round as tattoo sounded and missus Blake eagerly scanning a black bordered page was seen suddenly to run in doors her eyes brimming over with tears Later that night Hogan tapped at Field s front door and asked would the lieutenant step over to missus Ray s a minute and he went Read that said missus Ray pointing to a paragraph on the third page of the black bordered missive that had been too much for missus Blake And he read Through it all Esther has been my sweetest comfort but now I must lose her too Our means are so straitened that she has made me see the necessity Hard as it is I must yield to her for the help that it may bring She has been studying a year and is to join the staff of trained nurses at saint Luke s the first of October For a moment there was silence in the little army parlor Field s hands were trembling his face was filled with trouble She knew he would speak his heart to her at last and speak he did All these months that she has been studying I ve been begging and pleading missus Ray You know what I went for last winter all to no purpose I m going again now if I have to stay a patient at saint Luke s to coax her out of it
