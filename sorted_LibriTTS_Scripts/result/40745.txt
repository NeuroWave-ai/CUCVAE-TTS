twenty five AN HONEST THIEF One morning just as I was about to set off to my office Agrafena my cook washerwoman and housekeeper came in to me and to my surprise entered into conversation She had always been such a silent simple creature that except her daily inquiry about dinner she had not uttered a word for the last six years I at least had heard nothing else from her Here I have come in to have a word with you sir she began abruptly you really ought to let the little room Which little room Why the one next the kitchen to be sure What for What for Why because folks do take in lodgers to be sure But who would take it Who would take it Why a lodger would take it to be sure But my good woman one could not put a bedstead in it there wouldn t be room to move Who could live in it Who wants to live there As long as he has a place to sleep in Why he would live in the window In what window In what window As though you didn t know The one in the passage to be sure He would sit there sewing or doing anything else Maybe he would sit on a chair too He s got a chair and he has a table too he s got everything Who is he then Oh a good man a man of experience I will cook for him And I ll ask him three roubles a month for his board and lodging After prolonged efforts I succeeded at last in learning from Agrafena that an elderly man had somehow managed to persuade her to admit him into the kitchen as a lodger and boarder Any notion Agrafena took into her head had to be carried out if not I knew she would give me no peace When anything was not to her liking she at once began to brood and sank into a deep dejection that would last for a fortnight or three weeks During that period my dinners were spoiled my linen was mislaid my floors went unscrubbed in short I had a great deal to put up with I had observed long ago that this inarticulate woman was incapable of conceiving a project of originating an idea of her own But if anything like a notion or a project was by some means put into her feeble brain to prevent its being carried out meant for a time her moral assassination And so as I cared more for my peace of mind than for anything else I consented forthwith Has he a passport anyway or something of the sort To be sure he has He is a good man a man of experience three roubles he s promised to pay The very next day the new lodger made his appearance in my modest bachelor quarters but I was not put out by this indeed I was inwardly pleased I lead as a rule a very lonely hermit s existence I have scarcely any friends I hardly ever go anywhere As I had spent ten years never coming out of my shell I had of course grown used to solitude But another ten or fifteen years or more of the same solitary existence with the same Agrafena in the same bachelor quarters was in truth a somewhat cheerless prospect And therefore a new inmate if well behaved was a heaven sent blessing Agrafena had spoken truly my lodger was certainly a man of experience From his passport it appeared that he was an old soldier a fact which I should have known indeed from his face An old soldier is easily recognised Astafy Ivanovitch was a favourable specimen of his class We got on very well together What was best of all Astafy Ivanovitch would sometimes tell a story describing some incident in his own life In the perpetual boredom of my existence such a story teller was a veritable treasure One day he told me one of these stories It made an impression on me The following event was what led to it I was left alone in the flat both Astafy and Agrafena were out on business of their own All of a sudden I heard from the inner room somebody I fancied a stranger come in I went out there actually was a stranger in the passage a short fellow wearing no overcoat in spite of the cold autumn weather What do you want Does a clerk called Alexandrov live here Nobody of that name here brother Good bye Why the dvornik told me it was here said my visitor cautiously retiring towards the door Be off be off brother get along Next day after dinner while Astafy Ivanovitch was fitting on a coat which he was altering for me again some one came into the passage I half opened the door Before my very eyes my yesterday s visitor with perfect composure took my wadded greatcoat from the peg and stuffing it under his arm darted out of the flat Agrafena stood all the time staring at him agape with astonishment and doing nothing for the protection of my property Astafy Ivanovitch flew in pursuit of the thief and ten minutes later came back out of breath and empty handed He had vanished completely Well there s a piece of luck Astafy Ivanovitch It s a good job your cloak is left Or he would have put you in a plight the thief But the whole incident had so impressed Astafy Ivanovitch that I forgot the theft as I looked at him He could not get over it Every minute or two he would drop the work upon which he was engaged and would describe over again how it had all happened how he had been standing how the greatcoat had been taken down before his very eyes not a yard away and how it had come to pass that he could not catch the thief Then he would sit down to his work again then leave it once more and at last I saw him go down to the dvornik to tell him all about it and to upbraid him for letting such a thing happen in his domain Then he came back and began scolding Agrafena Then he sat down to his work again and long afterwards he was still muttering to himself how it had all happened how he stood there and I was here how before our eyes not a yard away the thief took the coat off the peg and so on In short though Astafy Ivanovitch understood his business he was a terrible slow coach and busy body He s made fools of us Astafy Ivanovitch I said to him in the evening as I gave him a glass of tea I wanted to while away the time by recalling the story of the lost greatcoat the frequent repetition of which together with the great earnestness of the speaker was beginning to become very amusing Fools indeed sir Even though it is no business of mine I am put out It makes me angry though it is not my coat that was lost To my thinking there is no vermin in the world worse than a thief Another takes what you can spare but a thief steals the work of your hands the sweat of your brow your time Ugh it s nasty One can t speak of it it s too vexing How is it you don t feel the loss of your property sir Yes you are right Astafy Ivanovitch better if the thing had been burnt it s annoying to let the thief have it it s disagreeable Disagreeable I should think so Yet to be sure there are thieves and thieves And I have happened sir to come across an honest thief An honest thief But how can a thief be honest Astafy Ivanovitch There you are right indeed sir How can a thief be honest There are none such I only meant to say that he was an honest man sure enough and yet he stole I was simply sorry for him Why how was that Astafy Ivanovitch It was about two years ago sir I had been nearly a year out of a place and just before I lost my place I made the acquaintance of a poor lost creature We got acquainted in a public house He was a drunkard a vagrant a beggar he had been in a situation of some sort but from his drinking habits he had lost his work Such a ne er do weel God only knows what he had on Often you wouldn t be sure if he d a shirt under his coat everything he could lay his hands upon he would drink away But he was not one to quarrel he was a quiet fellow A soft good natured chap And he d never ask he was ashamed but you could see for yourself the poor fellow wanted a drink and you would stand it him And so we got friendly that s to say he stuck to me It was all one to me And what a man he was to be sure Like a little dog he would follow me wherever I went there he would be and all that after our first meeting and he as thin as a thread paper At first it was let me stay the night well I let him stay I looked at his passport too the man was all right Well the next day it was the same story and then the third day he came again and sat all day in the window and stayed the night Well thinks I he is sticking to me give him food and drink and shelter at night too here am I a poor man and a hanger on to keep as well And before he came to me he used to go in the same way to a government clerk s he attached himself to him they were always drinking together but he through trouble of some sort drank himself into the grave My man was called Emelyan Ilyitch I pondered and pondered what I was to do with him To drive him away I was ashamed I was sorry for him such a pitiful God forsaken creature I never did set eyes on And not a word said either he does not ask but just sits there and looks into your eyes like a dog To think what drinking will bring a man down to I keep asking myself how am I to say to him You must be moving Emelyanoushka there s nothing for you here you ve come to the wrong place I shall soon not have a bite for myself how am I to keep you too I sat and wondered what he d do when I said that to him And I seemed to see how he d stare at me if he were to hear me say that how long he would sit and not understand a word of it And when it did get home to him at last how he would get up from the window would take up his bundle I can see it now the red check handkerchief full of holes with God knows what wrapped up in it which he had always with him and then how he would set his shabby old coat to rights so that it would look decent and keep him warm so that no holes would be seen he was a man of delicate feelings And how he d open the door and go out with tears in his eyes Well there s no letting a man go to ruin like that One s sorry for him And then again I think how am I off myself Wait a bit Emelyanoushka says I to myself you ve not long to feast with me I shall soon be going away and then you will not find me Well sir our family made a move and Alexandr Filimonovitch my master now deceased God rest his soul said I am thoroughly satisfied with you Astafy Ivanovitch when we come back from the country we will take you on again I had been butler with them a nice gentleman he was but he died that same year Well after seeing him off I took my belongings what little money I had and I thought I d have a rest for a time so I went to an old woman I knew and I took a corner in her room There was only one corner free in it She had been a nurse so now she had a pension and a room of her own Well now good bye Emelyanoushka thinks I you won t find me now my boy And what do you think sir I had gone out to see a man I knew and when I came back in the evening the first thing I saw was Emelyanoushka There he was sitting on my box and his check bundle beside him he was sitting in his ragged old coat waiting for me And to while away the time he had borrowed a church book from the old lady and was holding it wrong side upwards He d scented me out My heart sank Well thinks I there s no help for it why didn t I turn him out at first So I asked him straight off Have you brought your passport Emelyanoushka I sat down on the spot sir and began to ponder will a vagabond like that be very much trouble to me And on thinking it over it seemed he would not be much trouble He must be fed I thought Well a bit of bread in the morning and to make it go down better I ll buy him an onion At midday I should have to give him another bit of bread and an onion and in the evening onion again with kvass with some more bread if he wanted it And if some cabbage soup were to come our way then we should both have had our fill I am no great eater myself and a drinking man as we all know never eats all he wants is herb brandy or green vodka He ll ruin me with his drinking I thought but then another idea came into my head sir and took great hold on me So much so that if Emelyanoushka had gone away I should have felt that I had nothing to live for I do believe I determined on the spot to be a father and guardian to him I ll keep him from ruin I thought I ll wean him from the glass You wait a bit thought I very well Emelyanoushka you may stay only you must behave yourself you must obey orders Well thinks I to myself I ll begin by training him to work of some sort but not all at once let him enjoy himself a little first and I ll look round and find something you are fit for Emelyanoushka For every sort of work a man needs a special ability you know sir And I began to watch him on the quiet I soon saw Emelyanoushka was a desperate character I began sir with a word of advice I said this and that to him Emelyanoushka said I you ought to take a thought and mend your ways Have done with drinking Just look what rags you go about in that old coat of yours if I may make bold to say so is fit for nothing but a sieve A pretty state of things It s time to draw the line sure enough Emelyanoushka sat and listened to me with his head hanging down Would you believe it sir It had come to such a pass with him he d lost his tongue through drink and could not speak a word of sense Talk to him of cucumbers and he d answer back about beans He would listen and listen to me and then heave such a sigh What are you sighing for Emelyan Ilyitch I asked him Oh nothing don t you mind me Astafy Ivanovitch Do you know there were two women fighting in the street to day Astafy Ivanovitch One upset the other woman s basket of cranberries by accident Well what of that And the second one upset the other s cranberries on purpose and trampled them under foot too Well and what of it Emelyan Ilyitch Why nothing Astafy Ivanovitch I just mentioned it Nothing I just mentioned it Emelyanoushka my boy I thought you ve squandered and drunk away your brains And do you know a gentleman dropped a money note on the pavement in Gorohovy Street no it was Sadovy Street And a peasant saw it and said That s my luck and at the same time another man saw it and said No it s my bit of luck I saw it before you did Well Emelyan Ilyitch And the fellows had a fight over it Astafy Ivanovitch But a policeman came up took away the note gave it back to the gentleman and threatened to take up both the men Well but what of that What is there edifying about it Emelyanoushka Why nothing to be sure Folks laughed Astafy Ivanovitch Ach Emelyanoushka What do the folks matter You ve sold your soul for a brass farthing But do you know what I have to tell you Emelyan Ilyitch What Astafy Ivanovitch Take a job of some sort that s what you must do For the hundredth time I say to you set to work have some mercy on yourself What could I set to Astafy Ivanovitch I don t know what job I could set to and there is no one who will take me on Astafy Ivanovitch That s how you came to be turned off Emelyanoushka you drinking man And do you know Vlass the waiter was sent for to the office to day Astafy Ivanovitch Why did they send for him Emelyanoushka I asked I could not say why Astafy Ivanovitch I suppose they wanted him there and that s why they sent for him A ach thought I we are in a bad way poor Emelyanoushka The Lord is chastising us for our sins Well sir what is one to do with such a man But a cunning fellow he was and no mistake He d listen and listen to me but at last I suppose he got sick of it As soon as he sees I am beginning to get angry he d pick up his old coat and out he d slip and leave no trace He d wander about all day and come back at night drunk Where he got the money from the Lord only knows I had no hand in that No said I Emelyan Ilyitch you ll come to a bad end Give over drinking mind what I say now give it up Next time you come home in liquor you can spend the night on the stairs I won t let you in After hearing that threat Emelyanoushka sat at home that day and the next but on the third he slipped off again I waited and waited he didn t come back Well at least I don t mind owning I was in a fright and I felt for the man too What have I done to him I thought I ve scared him away Where s the poor fellow gone to now He ll get lost maybe Lord have mercy upon us Night came on he did not come In the morning I went out into the porch I looked and if he hadn t gone to sleep in the porch There he was with his head on the step and chilled to the marrow of his bones What next Emelyanoushka God have mercy on you Where will you get to next Why you were sort of angry with me Astafy Ivanovitch the other day you were vexed and promised to put me to sleep in the porch so I didn t sort of venture to come in Astafy Ivanovitch and so I lay down here I did feel angry and sorry too Surely you might undertake some other duty Emelyanoushka instead of lying here guarding the steps I said Why what other duty Astafy Ivanovitch You lost soul I was in such a rage I called him that if you could but learn tailoring work Look at your old rag of a coat It s not enough to have it in tatters here you are sweeping the steps with it You might take a needle and boggle up your rags as decency demands Ah you drunken man What do you think sir He actually did take a needle Of course I said it in jest but he was so scared he set to work He took off his coat and began threading the needle I watched him as you may well guess his eyes were all red and bleary and his hands were all of a shake He kept shoving and shoving the thread and could not get it through the eye of the needle he kept screwing his eyes up and wetting the thread and twisting it in his fingers it was no good He gave it up and looked at me Well said I this is a nice way to treat me If there had been folks by to see I don t know what I should have done Why you simple fellow I said it you in joke as a reproach Give over your nonsense God bless you Sit quiet and don t put me to shame don t sleep on my stairs and make a laughing stock of me Why what am I to do Astafy Ivanovitch I know very well I am a drunkard and good for nothing I can do nothing but vex you my bene bene factor And at that his blue lips began all of a sudden to quiver and a tear ran down his white cheek and trembled on his stubbly chin and then poor Emelyanoushka burst into a regular flood of tears Mercy on us I felt as though a knife were thrust into my heart The sensitive creature I d never have expected it Who could have guessed it No Emelyanoushka thought I I shall give you up altogether You can go your way like the rubbish you are Well sir why make a long story of it And the whole affair is so trifling it s not worth wasting words upon Why you for instance sir would not have given a thought to it but I would have given a great deal if I had a great deal to give that it never should have happened at all I had a pair of riding breeches by me sir deuce take them fine first rate riding breeches they were too blue with a check on it They d been ordered by a gentleman from the country but he would not have them after all said they were not full enough so they were left on my hands It struck me they were worth something At the second hand dealer s I ought to get five silver roubles for them or if not I could turn them into two pairs of trousers for Petersburg gentlemen and have a piece over for a waistcoat for myself Of course for poor people like us everything comes in And it happened just then that Emelyanoushka was having a sad time of it There he sat day after day he did not drink not a drop passed his lips but he sat and moped like an owl It was sad to see him he just sat and brooded Well thought I either you ve not got a copper to spend my lad or else you re turning over a new leaf of yourself you ve given it up you ve listened to reason Well sir that s how it was with us and just then came a holiday I went to vespers when I came home I found Emelyanoushka sitting in the window drunk and rocking to and fro Ah so that s what you ve been up to my lad And I went to get something out of my chest And when I looked in the breeches were not there I rummaged here and there they d vanished When I d ransacked everywhere and saw they were not there something seemed to stab me to the heart I ran first to the old dame and began accusing her of Emelyanoushka I d not the faintest suspicion though there was cause for it in his sitting there drunk No said the old body God be with you my fine gentleman what good are riding breeches to me Am I going to wear such things Why a skirt I had I lost the other day through a fellow of your sort I know nothing I can tell you nothing about it she said Who has been here who has been in I asked Why nobody has been my good sir says she I ve been here all the while Emelyan Ilyitch went out and came back again there he sits ask him Emelyanoushka said I have you taken those new riding breeches for anything you remember the pair I made for that gentleman from the country No Astafy Ivanovitch said he I ve not sort of touched them I was in a state I hunted high and low for them they were nowhere to be found And Emelyanoushka sits there rocking himself to and fro I was squatting on my heels facing him and bending over the chest and all at once I stole a glance at him Alack I thought my heart suddenly grew hot within me and I felt myself flushing up too And suddenly Emelyanoushka looked at me No Astafy Ivanovitch said he those riding breeches of yours maybe you are thinking maybe I took them but I never touched them But what can have become of them Emelyan Ilyitch No Astafy Ivanovitch said he I ve never seen them Why Emelyan Ilyitch I suppose they ve run off of themselves eh Maybe they have Astafy Ivanovitch When I heard him say that I got up at once went up to him lighted the lamp and sat down to work to my sewing I was altering a waistcoat for a clerk who lived below us And wasn t there a burning pain and ache in my breast I shouldn t have minded so much if I had put all the clothes I had in the fire Emelyanoushka seemed to have an inkling of what a rage I was in When a man is guilty you know sir he scents trouble far off like the birds of the air before a storm Do you know what Astafy Ivanovitch Emelyanoushka began and his poor old voice was shaking as he said the words Antip Prohoritch the apothecary married the coachman s wife this morning who died the other day I did give him a look sir a nasty look it was Emelyanoushka understood it too I saw him get up go to the bed and begin to rummage there for something I waited he was busy there a long time and kept muttering all the while No not there where can the blessed things have got to I waited to see what he d do I saw him creep under the bed on all fours I couldn t bear it any longer What are you crawling about under the bed for Emelyan Ilyitch said I Looking for the breeches Astafy Ivanovitch Maybe they ve dropped down there somewhere Why should you try to help a poor simple man like me said I crawling on your knees for nothing sir I called him that in my vexation Oh never mind Astafy Ivanovitch I ll just look They ll turn up maybe somewhere H m said I look here Emelyan Ilyitch What is it Astafy Ivanovitch said he Haven t you simply stolen them from me like a thief and a robber in return for the bread and salt you ve eaten here said I I felt so angry sir at seeing him fooling about on his knees before me No Astafy Ivanovitch And he stayed lying as he was on his face under the bed A long time he lay there and then at last crept out I looked at him and the man was as white as a sheet He stood up and sat down near me in the window and sat so for some ten minutes No Astafy Ivanovitch he said and all at once he stood up and came towards me and I can see him now he looked dreadful No Astafy Ivanovitch said he I never sort of touched your breeches He was all of a shake poking himself in the chest with a trembling finger and his poor old voice shook so that I was frightened sir and sat as though I was rooted to the window seat Well Emelyan Ilyitch said I as you will forgive me if I in my foolishness have accused you unjustly As for the breeches let them go hang we can live without them We ve still our hands thank God we need not go thieving or begging from some other poor man we ll earn our bread Emelyanoushka heard me out and went on standing there before me I looked up and he had sat down And there he sat all the evening without stirring At last I lay down to sleep Emelyanoushka went on sitting in the same place When I looked out in the morning he was lying curled up in his old coat on the bare floor he felt too crushed even to come to bed Well sir I felt no more liking for the fellow from that day in fact for the first few days I hated him I felt as one may say as though my own son had robbed me and done me a deadly hurt Ach thought I Emelyanoushka Emelyanoushka And Emelyanoushka sir went on drinking for a whole fortnight without stopping He was drunk all the time and regularly besotted He went out in the morning and came back late at night and for a whole fortnight I didn t get a word out of him It was as though grief was gnawing at his heart or as though he wanted to do for himself completely At last he stopped he must have come to the end of all he d got and then he sat in the window again I remember he sat there without speaking for three days and three nights all of a sudden I saw that he was crying He was just sitting there sir and crying like anything a perfect stream as though he didn t know how his tears were flowing And it s a sad thing sir to see a grown up man and an old man too crying from woe and grief What s the matter Emelyanoushka said I He began to tremble so that he shook all over I spoke to him for the first time since that evening Nothing Astafy Ivanovitch God be with you Emelyanoushka what s lost is lost Why are you moping about like this I felt sorry for him Oh nothing Astafy Ivanovitch it s no matter I want to find some work to do Astafy Ivanovitch And what sort of work pray Emelyanoushka Why any sort perhaps I could find a situation such as I used to have I ve been already to ask Fedosay Ivanitch I don t like to be a burden on you Astafy Ivanovitch If I can find a situation Astafy Ivanovitch then I ll pay it you all back and make you a return for all your hospitality Enough Emelyanoushka enough let bygones be bygones and no more to be said about it Let us go on as we used to do before No Astafy Ivanovitch you maybe think but I never touched your riding breeches Well have it your own way God be with you Emelyanoushka No Astafy Ivanovitch I can t go on living with you that s clear You must excuse me Astafy Ivanovitch Why God bless you Emelyan Ilyitch who s offending you and driving you out of the place am I doing it No it s not the proper thing for me to live with you like this Astafy Ivanovitch I d better be going He was so hurt it seemed he stuck to his point I looked at him and sure enough up he got and pulled his old coat over his shoulders But where are you going Emelyan Ilyitch Listen to reason what are you about Where are you off to No good bye Astafy Ivanovitch don t keep me now and he was blubbering again I d better be going You re not the same now Not the same as what I am the same But you ll be lost by yourself like a poor helpless babe Emelyan Ilyitch No Astafy Ivanovitch when you go out now you lock up your chest and it makes me cry to see it Astafy Ivanovitch You d better let me go Astafy Ivanovitch and forgive me all the trouble I ve given you while I ve been living with you Well sir the man went away I waited for a day I expected he d be back in the evening no Next day no sign of him nor the third day either I began to get frightened I was so worried I couldn t drink I couldn t eat I couldn t sleep The fellow had quite disarmed me On the fourth day I went out to look for him I peeped into all the taverns to inquire for him but no Emelyanoushka was lost Have you managed to keep yourself alive Emelyanoushka I wondered Perhaps he is lying dead under some hedge poor drunkard like a sodden log I went home more dead than alive Next day I went out to look for him again And I kept cursing myself that I d been such a fool as to let the man go off by himself On the fifth day it was a holiday in the early morning I heard the door creak I looked up and there was my Emelyanoushka coming in His face was blue and his hair was covered with dirt as though he d been sleeping in the street he was as thin as a match He took off his old coat sat down on the chest and looked at me I was delighted to see him but I felt more upset about him than ever For you see sir if I d been overtaken in some sin as true as I am here sir I d have died like a dog before I d have come back But Emelyanoushka did come back And a sad thing it was sure enough to see a man sunk so low I began to look after him to talk kindly to him to comfort him Well Emelyanoushka said I I am glad you ve come back Had you been away much longer I should have gone to look for you in the taverns again to day Are you hungry No Astafy Ivanovitch Come now aren t you really Here brother is some cabbage soup left over from yesterday there was meat in it it is good stuff And here is some bread and onion Come eat it it ll do you no harm I made him eat it and I saw at once that the man had not tasted food for maybe three days he was as hungry as

none	none	So it was hunger that had driven him to me My heart was melted looking at the poor dear Let me run to the tavern thought I I ll get something to ease his heart and then we ll make an end of it I ve no more anger in my heart against you Emelyanoushka I brought him some vodka Here Emelyan Ilyitch let us have a drink for the holiday Like a drink And it will do you good He held out his hand held it out greedily he was just taking it and then he stopped himself But a minute after I saw him take it and lift it to his mouth spilling it on his sleeve But though he got it to his lips he set it down on the table again What is it Emelyanoushka Nothing Astafy Ivanovitch I sort of Won t you drink it Well Astafy Ivanovitch I m not sort of going to drink any more Astafy Ivanovitch Do you mean you ve given it up altogether Emelyanoushka or are you only not going to drink to day He did not answer A minute later I saw him rest his head on his hand What s the matter Emelyanoushka are you ill Why yes Astafy Ivanovitch I don t feel well I took him and laid him down on the bed I saw that he really was ill his head was burning hot and he was shivering with fever I sat by him all day towards night he was worse I mixed him some oil and onion and kvass and bread broken up Come eat some of this said I and perhaps you ll be better He shook his head No said he I won t have any dinner to day Astafy Ivanovitch I made some tea for him I quite flustered our old woman he was no better Well thinks I it s a bad look out The third morning I went for a medical gentleman There was one I knew living close by Kostopravov by name I d made his acquaintance when I was in service with the Bosomyagins he d attended me The doctor come and looked at him He s in a bad way said he it was no use sending for me But if you like I can give him a powder Well I didn t give him a powder I thought that s just the doctor s little game and then the fifth day came He lay sir dying before my eyes I sat in the window with my work in my hands The old woman was heating the stove We were all silent My heart was simply breaking over him the good for nothing fellow I felt as if it were a son of my own I was losing I knew that Emelyanoushka was looking at me I d seen the man all the day long making up his mind to say something and not daring to At last I looked up at him I saw such misery in the poor fellow s eyes He had kept them fixed on me but when he saw that I was looking at him he looked down at once Astafy Ivanovitch What is it Emelyanoushka If you were to take my old coat to a second hand dealer s how much do you think they d give you for it Astafy Ivanovitch There s no knowing how much they d give Maybe they would give me a rouble for it Emelyan Ilyitch But if I had taken it they wouldn t have given a farthing for it but would have laughed in my face for bringing such a trumpery thing I simply said that to comfort the poor fellow knowing the simpleton he was But I was thinking Astafy Ivanovitch they might give you three roubles for it it s made of cloth Astafy Ivanovitch How could they only give one rouble for a cloth coat I don t know Emelyan Ilyitch said I if you are thinking of taking it you should certainly ask three roubles to begin with Emelyanoushka was silent for a time and then he addressed me again Astafy Ivanovitch What is it Emelyanoushka I asked Sell my coat when I die and don t bury me in it I can lie as well without it and it s a thing of some value it might come in useful I can t tell you how it made my heart ache to hear him I saw that the death agony was coming on him We were silent again for a bit So an hour passed by I looked at him again he was still staring at me and when he met my eyes he looked down again Do you want some water to drink Emelyan Ilyitch I asked Give me some God bless you Astafy Ivanovitch I gave him a drink Thank you Astafy Ivanovitch said he Is there anything else you would like Emelyanoushka No Astafy Ivanovitch there s nothing I want but I sort of What I only What is it Emelyanoushka Those riding breeches it was sort of I who took them Astafy Ivanovitch Well God forgive you Emelyanoushka said I you poor sorrowful creature Depart in peace And I was choking myself sir and the tears were in my eyes I turned aside for a moment Astafy Ivanovitch I saw Emelyanoushka wanted to tell me something he was trying to sit up trying to speak and mumbling something He flushed red all over suddenly looked at me then I saw him turn white again whiter and whiter and he seemed to sink away all in a minute His head fell back he drew one breath and gave up his soul to God A NOVEL IN NINE LETTERS I FROM PYOTR IVANITCH TO IVAN PETROVITCH DEAR SIR AND MOST PRECIOUS FRIEND IVAN PETROVITCH 
8678-280914-0000	train-other-500	For the last two days I have been I may say in pursuit of you my friend having to talk over most urgent business with you and I cannot come across you anywhere Yesterday while we were at Semyon Alexeyitch s my wife made a very good joke about you
8678-280914-0001	train-other-500	saying that Tatyana Petrovna and you were a pair of birds always on the wing
none	none	 You have not been married three months 
8678-280914-0002	train-other-500	and you already neglect your domestic hearth We all laughed heartily from our genuine kindly feeling for you of course but joking apart my precious friend
none	none	 you have given me a lot of trouble 
8678-280914-0003	train-other-500	Semyon Alexeyitch said to me that you might be going to the ball at the Social Union s club Leaving my wife with Semyon Alexeyitch s good lady I flew off to the Social Union It was funny and tragic Fancy my position Me at the ball and alone without my wife
none	none	 Ivan Andreyitch 
8678-280914-0004	train-other-500	meeting me in the porter s lodge and seeing me alone at once concluded the rascal that I had a passion for dances and taking me by the arm wanted to drag me off by force to a dancing class saying that it was too crowded at the Social Union that an ardent spirit had not room to turn
none	none	 and that his head ached from the patchouli and mignonette 
8678-280914-0005	train-other-500	I found neither you nor Tatyana Petrovna
none	none	 Ivan Andreyitch vowed and declared that you would be at Woe from Wit 
8678-280914-0006	train-other-500	at the Alexandrinsky theatre I flew off to the Alexandrinsky theatre you were not there either This morning I expected to find you at Tchistoganov s no sign of you there Tchistoganov sent to the Perepalkins the same thing there In fact I am quite worn out
none	none	 you can judge how much trouble I have taken 
8678-280914-0007	train-other-500	Now I am writing to you there is nothing else I can do My business is by no means a literary one you understand me it would be better to meet face to face
8678-280914-0008	train-other-500	it is extremely necessary to discuss something with you and as quickly as possible and so I beg you to come to us to day with Tatyana Petrovna to tea
none	none	 and for a chat in the evening 
8678-280914-0009	train-other-500	My Anna Mihalovna will be extremely pleased to see you You will truly as they say oblige me to my dying day By the way my precious friend since I have taken up my pen I ll go into all I have against you
8678-280914-0010	train-other-500	I have a slight complaint I must make in fact I must reproach you my worthy friend for an apparently very innocent little trick which you have played at my expense You are a rascal a man without conscience
8678-280914-0011	train-other-500	About the middle of last month you brought into my house an acquaintance of yours Yevgeny Nikolaitch you vouched for him by your friendly and for me of course sacred recommendation I rejoiced at the opportunity of receiving the young man with open arms
8678-280914-0012	train-other-500	and when I did so I put my head in a noose A noose it hardly is but it has turned out a pretty business I have not time now to explain and
none	none	 indeed it is an awkward thing to do in writing 
8678-280914-0013	train-other-500	only a very humble request to you my malicious friend
none	none	 could you not somehow very delicately in passing drop a hint into the young man s ear 
8678-280914-0014	train-other-500	that there are a great many houses in the metropolis besides ours It s more than I can stand my dear fellow We fall at your feet as our friend Semyonovitch says I will tell you all about it when we meet
8678-280914-0015	train-other-500	I don t mean to say that the young man has sinned against good manners or is lacking in spiritual qualities or is not up to the mark in some other way
none	none	 On the contrary he is an amiable and pleasant fellow 
8678-280914-0016	train-other-500	but wait we shall meet meanwhile if you see him for goodness sake whisper a hint to him my good friend I would do it myself but you know what I am I simply can t and that s all about it
8678-280914-0017	train-other-500	You introduced him But I will explain myself more fully this evening anyway Now good bye
none	none	 I remain et cetera 
8678-280914-0018	train-other-500	P S My little boy has been ailing for the last week and gets worse and worse every day he is cutting his poor little teeth My wife is nursing him all the time and is depressed poor thing Be sure to come
none	none	 you will give us real pleasure my precious friend II FROM IVAN PETROVITCH TO PYOTR IVANITCH 
8678-280914-0055	train-other-500	DEAR SIR PYOTR
none	none	 IVANITCH I got your letter yesterday I read it and was perplexed You looked for me goodness knows where and I was simply at home Till ten o clock I was expecting Ivan Ivanitch Tolokonov 
8678-280914-0020	train-other-500	At once on getting your letter I set out with my wife I went to the expense of taking a cab and reached your house about half past six You were not at home but we were met by your wife
none	none	 I waited to see you till half past ten I could not stay later I set off with my wife went to the expense of a cab again saw her home 
8678-280914-0021	train-other-500	and went on myself to the Perepalkins thinking I might meet you there
none	none	 but again I was out in my reckoning When I get home I did not sleep all night 
8678-280914-0022	train-other-500	I felt uneasy in the morning I drove round to you three times at nine at ten and at eleven three times I went to the expense of a cab and again you left me in the lurch I read your letter and was amazed You write about Yevgeny Nikolaitch
none	none	 beg me to whisper some hint and do not tell me what about I commend your caution 
8678-280914-0023	train-other-500	but all letters are not alike and I don t give documents of importance to my wife for curl papers I am puzzled in fact to know with what motive you wrote all this to me However if it comes to that why should I meddle in the matter I don t poke my nose into other people s business
none	none	 You can be not at home to him 
8678-280914-0024	train-other-500	I only see that I must have a brief and decisive explanation with you and moreover time is passing And I am in straits and don t know what to do if you are going to neglect the terms of our agreement A journey for nothing a journey costs something too
8678-280914-0025	train-other-500	and my wife s whining for me to get her a velvet mantle of the latest fashion About Yevgeny Nikolaitch I hasten to mention that when I was at Pavel Semyonovitch Perepalkin s yesterday I made inquiries without loss of time He has five hundred serfs
8678-280914-0026	train-other-500	in the province of Yaroslav and he has expectations from his grandmother of an estate of three hundred serfs near Moscow How much money he has I cannot tell I think you ought to know that better I beg you once for all to appoint a place where I can meet you
none	none	 You met Ivan Andreyitch yesterday 
8678-280914-0027	train-other-500	and you write that he told you that I was at the Alexandrinsky theatre with my wife I write that he is a liar and it shows how little he is to be trusted in such cases that only the day before yesterday he did his grandmother out of eight hundred roubles I have the honour to remain
8678-280914-0028	train-other-500	et cetera P S My wife is going to have a baby she is nervous about it and feels depressed at times At the theatre they sometimes have fire arms going off and sham thunderstorms And so for fear of a shock to my wife s nerves
none	none	 I do not take her to the theatre I have no great partiality for the theatre myself III FROM PYOTR IVANITCH TO IVAN PETROVITCH MY PRECIOUS FRIEND IVAN PETROVITCH 
8678-280914-0030	train-other-500	I am to blame to blame a thousand times to blame but I hasten to defend myself Between five and six yesterday just as we were talking of you with the warmest affection a messenger from Uncle Stepan Alexeyitch galloped up
8678-280914-0031	train-other-500	with the news that my aunt was very bad Being afraid of alarming my wife I did not say a word of this to her
none	none	 but on the pretext of other urgent business 
8678-280914-0032	train-other-500	I drove off to my aunt s house I found her almost dying Just at five o clock she had had a stroke the third she has had in the last two years Karl Fyodoritch their family doctor told us that she might not live through the night You can judge of my position dearest friend
none	none	 We were on our legs all night in grief and anxiety It was not till morning that utterly exhausted and overcome by moral and physical weakness 
8678-280914-0033	train-other-500	I lay down on the sofa I forgot to tell them to wake me
none	none	 and only woke at half past eleven 
8678-280914-0034	train-other-500	My aunt was better I drove home to my wife She poor thing was quite worn out expecting me I snatched a bite of something embraced my little boy reassured my wife and set off to call on you You were not at home At your flat I found Yevgeny Nikolaitch
8678-280914-0035	train-other-500	When I got home I took up a pen and here I am writing to you Don t grumble and be cross to me my true friend Beat me chop my guilty head off my shoulders but don t deprive me of your affection From your wife I learned that you will be at the Slavyanovs this evening
8678-280914-0036	train-other-500	I will certainly be there I look forward with the greatest impatience to seeing you I remain et cetera P S We are in perfect despair about our little boy Karl Fyodoritch prescribes rhubarb He moans
none	none	 Yesterday he did not know any one 
8678-280914-0037	train-other-500	This morning he did know us
none	none	 and began lisping papa mamma boo 
8678-280914-0038	train-other-500	My wife was in tears the whole morning
none	none	 IV FROM IVAN PETROVITCH TO PYOTR IVANITCH 
8678-280914-0039	train-other-500	MY DEAR SIR PYOTR IVANITCH I am writing to you in your room at your bureau and before taking up my pen I have been waiting for more than two and a half hours for you
8678-280914-0040	train-other-500	Now allow me to tell you straight out Pyotr Ivanitch my frank opinion about this shabby incident From your last letter I gathered that you were expected at the Slavyanovs that you were inviting me to go there I turned up I stayed for five hours
8678-280914-0041	train-other-500	and there was no sign of you Why am I to be made a laughing stock to people do you suppose Excuse me my dear sir
none	none	 I came to you this morning I hoped to find you not imitating certain deceitful persons who look for people God knows where when they can be found at home at any suitably chosen time There is no sign of you at home I don t know what restrains me from telling you now the whole harsh truth I will only say that I see you seem to be going back on your bargain regarding our agreement And only now reflecting on the whole affair I cannot but confess that I am absolutely astounded at the artful workings of your mind I see clearly now that you have been cherishing your unfriendly design for a long time This supposition of mine is confirmed by the fact that last week in an almost unpardonable way you took possession of that letter of yours addressed to me in which you laid down yourself though rather vaguely and incoherently the terms of our agreement in regard to a circumstance of which I need not remind you You are afraid of documents you destroy them and you try to make a fool of me But I won t allow myself to be made a fool of for no one has ever considered me one hitherto and every one has thought well of me in that respect I am opening my eyes You try and put me off confuse me with talk of Yevgeny Nikolaitch and when with your letter of the seventh of this month which I am still at a loss to understand I seek a personal explanation from you you make humbugging appointments while you keep out of the way Surely you do not suppose sir that I am not equal to noticing all this You promised to reward me for my services of which you are very well aware in the way of introducing various persons and at the same time and I don t know how you do it you contrive to borrow money from me in considerable sums without giving a receipt as happened no longer ago than last week Now having got the money you keep out of the way and what s more you repudiate the service I have done you in regard to Yevgeny Nikolaitch You are probably reckoning on my speedy departure to Simbirsk and hoping I may not have time to settle your business But I assure you solemnly and testify on my word of honour that if it comes to that I am prepared to spend two more months in Petersburg expressly to carry through my business to attain my objects and to get hold of you For I too on occasion know how to get the better of people 
8678-280914-0042	train-other-500	In conclusion I beg to inform you that if you do not give me a satisfactory explanation to day first in writing and then personally face to face and do not make a fresh statement in your letter of the chief points of the agreement existing between us
8678-280914-0043	train-other-500	and do not explain fully your views in regard to Yevgeny Nikolaitch I shall be compelled to have recourse to measures that will be highly unpleasant to you and indeed repugnant to me also Allow me to remain et cetera
none	none	 V FROM PYOTR IVANITCH TO IVAN PETROVITCH November eleven 
8678-280914-0044	train-other-500	MY DEAR AND HONOURED FRIEND
none	none	 IVAN PETROVITCH 
8678-280914-0045	train-other-500	I was cut to the heart by your letter I wonder you were not ashamed my dear but unjust friend to behave like this to one of your most devoted friends Why be in such a hurry and without explaining things fully
8678-280914-0046	train-other-500	wound me with such insulting suspicions But I hasten to reply to your charges
none	none	 You did not find me yesterday Ivan Petrovitch 
8678-280914-0047	train-other-500	because I was suddenly and quite unexpectedly called away to a death bed My aunt Yefimya Nikolaevna passed away yesterday evening at eleven o clock in the night By the general consent of the relatives
none	none	 I was selected to make the arrangements for the sad and sorrowful ceremony 
8678-280914-0048	train-other-500	I had so much to do that I had not time to see you this morning nor even to send you a line I am grieved to the heart at the misunderstanding which has arisen between us My words about Yevgeny Nikolaitch uttered casually and in jest you have taken in quite a wrong sense
none	none	 and have ascribed to them a meaning deeply offensive to me 
8678-280914-0049	train-other-500	You refer to money and express your anxiety about it But without wasting words I am ready to satisfy all your claims
none	none	 and demands though I must remind you 
8678-280914-0050	train-other-500	that the three hundred and fifty roubles I had from you last week were in accordance with a certain agreement and not by way of a loan In the latter case there would certainly have been a receipt I will not condescend to discuss the other points mentioned in your letter I see that it is a misunderstanding
8678-280914-0051	train-other-500	I see it is your habitual hastiness hot temper and obstinacy I know that your goodheartedness and open character will not allow doubts to persist in your heart and that you will be in fact the first to hold out your hand to me
none	none	 You are mistaken Ivan Petrovitch you are greatly mistaken 
8678-280914-0052	train-other-500	Although your letter has deeply wounded me I should be prepared even to day to come to you and apologise but I have been since yesterday in such a rush and flurry that I am utterly exhausted and can scarcely stand on my feet
8678-280914-0053	train-other-500	To complete my troubles my wife is laid up I am afraid she is seriously ill Our little boy thank God is better
none	none	 but I must lay down my pen I have a mass of things to do and they are urgent 
8678-280914-0054	train-other-500	Allow me my dear friend to remain et cetera
none	none	 VI FROM IVAN PETROVITCH TO PYOTR IVANITCH November fourteen DEAR SIR PYOTR IVANITCH 
8678-280914-0056	train-other-500	I have been waiting for three days I tried to make a profitable use of them
none	none	 meanwhile I feel that politeness and good manners are the greatest of ornaments for every one 
8678-280914-0057	train-other-500	Since my last letter of the tenth of this month I have neither by word nor deed reminded you of my existence partly in order to allow you undisturbed to perform the duty of a Christian in regard to your aunt
8678-280914-0058	train-other-500	partly because I needed the time for certain considerations and investigations in regard to a business you know of Now I hasten to explain myself to you in the most thoroughgoing and decisive manner I frankly confess that on reading your first two letters
8678-280914-0059	train-other-500	I seriously supposed that you did not understand what I wanted that was how it was that I rather sought an interview with you and explanations face to face I was afraid of writing and blamed myself for lack of clearness in the expression of my thoughts on paper
none	none	 You are aware that I have not the advantages of education and good manners 
8678-280914-0060	train-other-500	and that I shun a hollow show of gentility because I have learned from bitter experience how misleading appearances often are and that a snake sometimes lies hidden under flowers But you understood me you did not answer me as you should have done because
8678-280914-0061	train-other-500	in the treachery of your heart you had planned beforehand to be faithless to your word of honour and to the friendly relations existing between us You have proved this absolutely by your abominable conduct towards me of late which is fatal to my interests which I did not expect
none	none	 and which I refused to believe till the present moment From the very beginning of our acquaintance you captivated me by your clever manners by the subtlety of your behaviour your knowledge of affairs and the advantages to be gained by association with you I imagined that I had found a true friend and well wisher 
8678-280914-0062	train-other-500	Now I recognise clearly that there are many people who under a flattering and brilliant exterior hide venom in their hearts who use their cleverness to weave snares for their neighbour and for unpardonable deception and so are afraid of pen and paper
8678-280914-0063	train-other-500	and at the same time use their fine language not for the benefit of their neighbour and their country but to drug and bewitch the reason of those who have entered into business relations of any sort with them Your treachery to me my dear sir can be clearly seen from what follows
8678-280914-0064	train-other-500	In the first place when in the clear and distinct terms of my letter I described my position sir and at the same time asked you in my first letter what you meant by certain expressions and intentions of yours
8678-280914-0065	train-other-500	principally in regard to Yevgeny Nikolaitch you tried for the most part to avoid answering and confounding me by doubts and suspicions
none	none	 you calmly put the subject aside Then after treating me in a way which cannot be described by any seemly word 
8678-280914-0066	train-other-500	you began writing that you were wounded Pray what am I to call that sir Then when every minute was precious to me and when you had set me running after you all over the town you wrote pretending personal friendship
none	none	 letters in which intentionally avoiding all mention of business 
8678-280914-0067	train-other-500	you spoke of utterly irrelevant matters to wit of the illnesses of your good lady for whom I have in any case every respect and of how your baby had been dosed with rhubarb and was cutting a tooth All this you alluded to
8678-280914-0068	train-other-500	in every letter with a disgusting regularity that was insulting to me Of course I am prepared to admit that a father s heart may be torn by the sufferings of his babe but why make mention of this when something different far more important
8678-280914-0069	train-other-500	and interesting was needed I endured it in silence but now when time has elapsed I think it my duty to explain myself Finally treacherously deceiving me several times by making humbugging appointments you tried it seems
8678-280914-0070	train-other-500	to make me play the part of a fool and a laughing stock for you which I never intend to be Then after first inviting me and thoroughly deceiving me you informed me that you were called away to your suffering aunt who had had a stroke
8678-280914-0071	train-other-500	precisely at five o clock as you stated with shameful exactitude Luckily for me sir in the course of these three days I have succeeded in making inquiries and have learnt from them that your aunt had a stroke on the day before the seventh not long before midnight
8678-280914-0072	train-other-500	From this fact I see that you have made use of sacred family relations in order to deceive persons in no way concerned with them Finally in your last letter you mention the death of your relatives
none	none	 as though it had taken place precisely at the time when I was to have visited you to consult 
8678-280914-0073	train-other-500	about various business matters But here the vileness of your arts and calculations exceeds all belief for from trustworthy information which I was able by a lucky chance to obtain just in the nick of time I have found out that your aunt died twenty four hours later
none	none	 than the time you so impiously fixed for her decease in your letter 
8678-280914-0074	train-other-500	I shall never have done if I enumerate all the signs by which I have discovered your treachery in regard to me It is sufficient indeed for any impartial observer that in every letter you style me your true friend and call me all sorts of polite names
8678-280914-0075	train-other-500	which you do to the best of my belief for no other object than to put my conscience to sleep I have come now to your principal act of deceit and treachery in regard to me to wit your continual silence of late in regard to everything concerning our common interests
none	none	 in regard to your wicked theft of the letter in which you stated 
8678-280914-0076	train-other-500	though in language somewhat obscure and not perfectly intelligible to me our mutual agreements your barbarous forcible loan of three hundred and fifty roubles which you borrowed from me as your partner without giving any receipt and finally
8678-280914-0077	train-other-500	your abominable slanders of our common acquaintance Yevgeny Nikolaitch I see clearly now that you meant to show me that he was if you will allow me to say so like a billy goat good for neither milk nor wool
8678-280914-0078	train-other-500	that he was neither one thing nor the other neither fish nor flesh which you put down as a vice in him in your letter
none	none	 of the sixth instant I knew Yevgeny Nikolaitch as a modest and well behaved young man whereby he may well attract gain and deserve respect in society 
8678-280914-0079	train-other-500	I know also that every evening for the last fortnight you ve put into your pocket dozens and sometimes even hundreds of roubles playing games of chance with Yevgeny Nikolaitch Now you disavow all this and not only refuse to compensate me for what I have suffered
8678-280914-0080	train-other-500	but have even appropriated money belonging to me
none	none	 tempting me by suggestions that I should be partner in the affair

none	none	 Farewell farewell My darling Think of me sometimes I shall never forget you Farewell I sign this last like my first letter do you remember TATYANA The second letter was as follows IVAN PETROVITCH To morrow you will receive a new pair of galoshes It is not my habit to filch from other men s pockets and I am not fond of picking up all sorts of rubbish in the streets Yevgeny Nikolaitch is going to Simbirsk in a day or two on his grandfather s business and he has asked me to find a travelling companion for him wouldn t you like to take him with you AN UNPLEASANT PREDICAMENT This unpleasant business occurred at the epoch when the regeneration of our beloved fatherland and the struggle of her valiant sons towards new hopes and destinies was beginning with irresistible force and with a touchingly naive impetuosity One winter evening in that period between eleven and twelve o clock three highly respectable gentlemen were sitting in a comfortable and even luxuriously furnished room in a handsome house of two storeys on the Petersburg Side and were engaged in a staid and edifying conversation on a very interesting subject These three gentlemen were all of generals rank They were sitting round a little table each in a soft and handsome arm chair and as they talked they quietly and luxuriously sipped champagne The bottle stood on the table on a silver stand with ice round it The fact was that the host a privy councillor called Stepan Nikiforovitch Nikiforov an old bachelor of sixty five was celebrating his removal into a house he had just bought and as it happened also his birthday which he had never kept before The festivity however was not on a very grand scale as we have seen already there were only two guests both of them former colleagues and former subordinates of mister Nikiforov that is an actual civil councillor called Semyon Ivanovitch Shipulenko and another actual civil councillor Ivan Ilyitch Pralinsky They had arrived to tea at nine o clock then had begun upon the wine and knew that at exactly half past eleven they would have to set off home Their host had all his life been fond of regularity A few words about him He had begun his career as a petty clerk with nothing to back him had quietly plodded on for forty five years knew very well what to work towards had no ambition to draw the stars down from heaven though he had two stars already and particularly disliked expressing his own opinion on any subject He was honest too that is it had not happened to him to do anything particularly dishonest he was a bachelor because he was an egoist he had plenty of brains but he could not bear showing his intelligence he particularly disliked slovenliness and enthusiasm regarding it as moral slovenliness and towards the end of his life had become completely absorbed in a voluptuous indolent comfort and systematic solitude Though he sometimes visited people of a rather higher rank than his own yet from his youth up he could never endure entertaining visitors himself and of late he had if he did not play a game of patience been satisfied with the society of his dining room clock and would spend the whole evening dozing in his arm chair listening placidly to its ticking under its glass case on the chimney piece In appearance he was closely shaven and extremely proper looking he was well preserved looking younger than his age he promised to go on living many years longer and closely followed the rules of the highest good breeding His post was a fairly comfortable one he had to preside somewhere and to sign something In short he was regarded as a first rate man He had only one passion or more accurately one keen desire that was to have his own house and a house built like a gentleman s residence not a commercial investment His desire was at last realised he looked out and bought a house on the Petersburg Side a good way off it is true but it had a garden and was an elegant house The new owner decided that it was better for being a good way off he did not like entertaining at home and for driving to see any one or to the office he had a handsome carriage of a chocolate hue a coachman Mihey and two little but strong and handsome horses All this was honourably acquired by the careful frugality of forty years so that his heart rejoiced over it This was how it was that Stepan Nikiforovitch felt such pleasure in his placid heart that he actually invited two friends to see him on his birthday which he had hitherto carefully concealed from his most intimate acquaintances He had special designs on one of these visitors He lived in the upper storey of his new house and he wanted a tenant for the lower half which was built and arranged in exactly the same way Stepan Nikiforovitch was reckoning upon Semyon Ivanovitch Shipulenko and had twice that evening broached the subject in the course of conversation But Semyon Ivanovitch made no response The latter too was a man who had doggedly made a way for himself in the course of long years He had black hair and whiskers and a face that always had a shade of jaundice He was a married man of morose disposition who liked to stay at home he ruled his household with a rod of iron in his official duties he had the greatest self confidence He too knew perfectly well what goal he was making for and better still what he never would reach He was in a good position and he was sitting tight there Though he looked upon the new reforms with a certain distaste he was not particularly agitated about them he was extremely self confident and listened with a shade of ironical malice to Ivan Ilyitch Pralinsky expatiating on new themes All of them had been drinking rather freely however so that Stepan Nikiforovitch himself condescended to take part in a slight discussion with mister Pralinsky concerning the latest reforms But we must say a few words about his Excellency mister Pralinsky especially as he is the chief hero of the present story The actual civil councillor Ivan Ilyitch Pralinsky had only been his Excellency for four months in short he was a young general He was young in years too only forty three no more and he looked and liked to look even younger He was a tall handsome man he was smart in his dress and prided himself on its solid dignified character with great aplomb he displayed an order of some consequence on his breast From his earliest childhood he had known how to acquire the airs and graces of aristocratic society and being a bachelor dreamed of a wealthy and even aristocratic bride He dreamed of many other things though he was far from being stupid At times he was a great talker and even liked to assume a parliamentary pose He came of a good family He was the son of a general and brought up in the lap of luxury in his tender childhood he had been dressed in velvet and fine linen had been educated at an aristocratic school and though he acquired very little learning there he was successful in the service and had worked his way up to being a general The authorities looked upon him as a capable man and even expected great things from him in the future Stepan Nikiforovitch under whom Ivan Ilyitch had begun his career in the service and under whom he had remained until he was made a general had never considered him a good business man and had no expectations of him whatever What he liked in him was that he belonged to a good family had property that is a big block of buildings let out in flats in charge of an overseer was connected with persons of consequence and what was more had a majestic bearing Stepan Nikiforovitch blamed him inwardly for excess of imagination and instability Ivan Ilyitch himself felt at times that he had too much amour propre and even sensitiveness Strange to say he had attacks from time to time of morbid tenderness of conscience and even a kind of faint remorse With bitterness and a secret soreness of heart he recognised now and again that he did not fly so high as he imagined At such moments he sank into despondency especially when he was suffering from haemorrhoids called his life une existence manquee and ceased privately of course to believe even in his parliamentary capacities calling himself a talker a maker of phrases and though all that of course did him great credit it did not in the least prevent him from raising his head again half an hour later and growing even more obstinately even more conceitedly self confident and assuring himself that he would yet succeed in making his mark and that he would be not only a great official but a statesman whom Russia would long remember He actually dreamed at times of monuments From this it will be seen that Ivan Ilyitch aimed high though he hid his vague hopes and dreams deep in his heart even with a certain trepidation In short he was a good natured man and a poet at heart Of late years these morbid moments of disillusionment had begun to be more frequent He had become peculiarly irritable ready to take offence and was apt to take any contradiction as an affront But reformed Russia gave him great hopes His promotion to general was the finishing touch He was roused he held his head up He suddenly began talking freely and eloquently He talked about the new ideas which he very quickly and unexpectedly made his own and professed with vehemence He sought opportunities for speaking drove about the town and in many places succeeded in gaining the reputation of a desperate Liberal which flattered him greatly That evening after drinking four glasses he was particularly exuberant He wanted on every point to confute Stepan Nikiforovitch whom he had not seen for some time past and whom he had hitherto always respected and even obeyed He considered him for some reason reactionary and fell upon him with exceptional heat Stepan Nikiforovitch hardly answered him but only listened slyly though the subject interested him Ivan Ilyitch got hot and in the heat of the discussion sipped his glass more often than he ought to have done Then Stepan Nikiforovitch took the bottle and at once filled his glass again which for some reason seemed to offend Ivan Ilyitch especially as Semyon Ivanovitch Shipulenko whom he particularly despised and indeed feared on account of his cynicism and ill nature preserved a treacherous silence and smiled more frequently than was necessary They seem to take me for a schoolboy flashed across Ivan Ilyitch s mind No it was time high time he went on hotly We have put it off too long and to my thinking humanity is the first consideration humanity with our inferiors remembering that they too are men Humanity will save everything and bring out all that is He he he he was heard from the direction of Semyon Ivanovitch But why are you giving us such a talking to Stepan Nikiforovitch protested at last with an affable smile I must own Ivan Ilyitch I have not been able to make out so far what you are maintaining You advocate humanity That is love of your fellow creatures isn t it Yes if you like I Allow me As far as I can see that s not the only thing Love of one s fellow creatures has always been fitting The reform movement is not confined to that All sorts of questions have arisen relating to the peasantry the law courts economics government contracts morals and and and those questions are endless and all together may give rise to great upheavals so to say That is what we have been anxious about and not simply humanity Yes the thing is a bit deeper than that observed Semyon Ivanovitch I quite understand and allow me to observe Semyon Ivanovitch that I can t agree to being inferior to you in depth of understanding Ivan Ilyitch observed sarcastically and with excessive sharpness However I will make so bold as to assert Stepan Nikiforovitch that you have not understood me either No I haven t And yet I maintain and everywhere advance the idea that humanity and nothing else with one s subordinates from the official in one s department down to the copying clerk from the copying clerk down to the house serf from the servant down to the peasant humanity I say may serve so to speak as the corner stone of the coming reforms and the reformation of things in general Why Because Take a syllogism I am human consequently I am loved I am loved so confidence is felt in me There is a feeling of confidence and so there is trust There is trust and so there is love that is no I mean to say that if they trust me they will believe in the reforms they will understand so to speak the essential nature of them will so to speak embrace each other in a moral sense and will settle the whole business in a friendly way fundamentally What are you laughing at Semyon Ivanovitch Can t you understand Stepan Nikiforovitch raised his eyebrows without speaking he was surprised I fancy I have drunk a little too much said Semyon Ivanovitch sarcastically and so I am a little slow of comprehension Not quite all my wits about me Ivan Ilyitch winced We should break down Stepan Nikiforovitch pronounced suddenly after a slight pause of hesitation How do you mean we should break down asked Ivan Ilyitch surprised at Stepan Nikiforovitch s abrupt remark Why we should break under the strain Stepan Nikiforovitch evidently did not care to explain further I suppose you are thinking of new wine in old bottles Ivan Ilyitch replied not without irony Well I can answer for myself anyway At that moment the clock struck half past eleven One sits on and on but one must go at last said Semyon Ivanovitch getting up But Ivan Ilyitch was before him he got up from the table and took his sable cap from the chimney piece He looked as though he had been insulted So how is it to be Semyon Ivanovitch Will you think it over said Stepan Nikiforovitch as he saw the visitors out About the flat you mean I ll think it over I ll think it over Well when you have made up your mind let me know as soon as possible Still on business mister Pralinsky observed affably in a slightly ingratiating tone playing with his hat It seemed to him as though they were forgetting him Stepan Nikiforovitch raised his eyebrows and remained mute as a sign that he would not detain his visitors Semyon Ivanovitch made haste to bow himself out Well after that what is one to expect if you don t understand the simple rules of good manners mister Pralinsky reflected to himself and held out his hand to Stepan Nikiforovitch in a particularly offhand way In the hall Ivan Ilyitch wrapped himself up in his light expensive fur coat he tried for some reason not to notice Semyon Ivanovitch s shabby raccoon and they both began descending the stairs The old man seemed offended said Ivan Ilyitch to the silent Semyon Ivanovitch No why answered the latter with cool composure Servile flunkey Ivan Ilyitch thought to himself They went out at the front door Semyon Ivanovitch s sledge with a grey ugly horse drove up What the devil What has Trifon done with my carriage cried Ivan Ilyitch not seeing his carriage The carriage was nowhere to be seen Stepan Nikiforovitch s servant knew nothing about it They appealed to Varlam Semyon Ivanovitch s coachman and received the answer that he had been standing there all the time and that the carriage had been there but now there was no sign of it An unpleasant predicament mister Shipulenko pronounced Shall I take you home Scoundrelly people mister Pralinsky cried with fury He asked me the rascal to let him go to a wedding close here in the Petersburg Side some crony of his was getting married deuce take her I sternly forbade him to absent himself and now I ll bet he has gone off there He certainly has gone there sir observed Varlam but he promised to be back in a minute to be here in time that is Well there it is I had a presentiment that this would happen I ll give it to him You d better give him a good flogging once or twice at the police station then he will do what you tell him said Semyon Ivanovitch as he wrapped the rug round him Please don t you trouble Semyon Ivanovitch Well won t you let me take you along Merci bon voyage Semyon Ivanovitch drove off while Ivan Ilyitch set off on foot along the wooden pavement conscious of a rather acute irritation Yes indeed I ll give it to you now you rogue I am going on foot on purpose to make you feel it to frighten you He will come back and hear that his master has gone off on foot the blackguard Ivan Ilyitch had never abused any one like this but he was greatly angered and besides there was a buzzing in his head He was not given to drink so five or six glasses soon affected him But the night was enchanting There was a frost but it was remarkably still and there was no wind There was a clear starry sky The full moon was bathing the earth in soft silver light It was so lovely that after walking some fifty paces Ivan Ilyitch almost forgot his troubles He felt particularly pleased People quickly change from one mood to another when they are a little drunk He was even pleased with the ugly little wooden houses of the deserted street It s really a capital thing that I am walking he thought it s a lesson to Trifon and a pleasure to me I really ought to walk oftener And I shall soon pick up a sledge on the Great Prospect It s a glorious night What little houses they all are I suppose small fry live here clerks tradesmen perhaps That Stepan Nikiforovitch What reactionaries they all are those old fogies Fogies yes c est le mot He is a sensible man though he has that bon sens sober practical understanding of things But they are old old There is a lack of what is it There is a lack of something We shall break down What did he mean by that He actually pondered when he said it He didn t understand me a bit And yet how could he help understanding It was more difficult not to understand it than to understand it The chief thing is that I am convinced convinced in my soul Humanity the love of one s kind Restore a man to himself revive his personal dignity and then when the ground is prepared get to work I believe that s clear Yes Allow me your Excellency take a syllogism for instance we meet for instance a clerk a poor downtrodden clerk Well who are you Answer A clerk Very good a clerk further What sort of clerk are you Answer I am such and such a clerk he says Are you in the service I am Do you want to be happy I do What do you need for happiness This and that Why Because and there the man understands me with a couple of words the man s mine the man is caught so to speak in a net and I can do what I like with him that is for his good Horrid man that Semyon Ivanovitch And what a nasty phiz he has Flog him in the police station he said that on purpose No you are talking rubbish you can flog but I m not going to I shall punish Trifon with words I shall punish him with reproaches he will feel it As for flogging h m it is an open question h m What about going to Emerance Oh damnation take it the cursed pavement he cried out suddenly tripping up And this is the capital Enlightenment One might break one s leg H m I detest that Semyon Ivanovitch a most revolting phiz He was chuckling at me just now when I said they would embrace each other in a moral sense Well and they will embrace each other and what s that to do with you I am not going to embrace you I d rather embrace a peasant If I meet a peasant I shall talk to him I was drunk though and perhaps did not express myself properly Possibly I am not expressing myself rightly now H m I shall never touch wine again In the evening you babble and next morning you are sorry for it After all I am walking quite steadily But they are all scoundrels anyhow So Ivan Ilyitch meditated incoherently and by snatches as he went on striding along the pavement The fresh air began to affect him set his mind working Five minutes later he would have felt soothed and sleepy But all at once scarcely two paces from the Great Prospect he heard music He looked round On the other side of the street in a very tumble down looking long wooden house of one storey there was a great fete there was the scraping of violins and the droning of a double bass and the squeaky tooting of a flute playing a very gay quadrille tune Under the windows stood an audience mainly of women in wadded pelisses with kerchiefs on their heads they were straining every effort to see something through a crack in the shutters Evidently there was a gay party within The sound of the thud of dancing feet reached the other side of the street Ivan Ilyitch saw a policeman standing not far off and went up to him Whose house is that brother he asked flinging his expensive fur coat open just far enough to allow the policeman to see the imposing decoration on his breast It belongs to the registration clerk Pseldonimov answered the policeman drawing himself up instantly discerning the decoration Pseldonimov Bah Pseldonimov What is he up to Getting married Yes your Honour to a daughter of a titular councillor Mlekopitaev a titular councillor used to serve in the municipal department That house goes with the bride So that now the house is Pseldonimov s and not Mlekopitaev s Yes Pseldonimov s your Honour It was Mlekopitaev s but now it is Pseldonimov s H m I am asking you my man because I am his chief I am a general in the same office in which Pseldonimov serves Just so your Excellency The policeman drew himself up more stiffly than ever while Ivan Ilyitch seemed to ponder He stood still and meditated Yes Pseldonimov really was in his department and in his own office he remembered that He was a little clerk with a salary of ten roubles a month As mister Pralinsky had received his department very lately he might not have remembered precisely all his subordinates but Pseldonimov he remembered just because of his surname It had caught his eye from the very first so that at the time he had had the curiosity to look with special attention at the possessor of such a surname He remembered now a very young man with a long hooked nose with tufts of flaxen hair lean and ill nourished in an impossible uniform and with unmentionables so impossible as to be actually unseemly he remembered how the thought had flashed through his mind at the time shouldn t he give the poor fellow ten roubles for Christmas to spend on his wardrobe But as the poor fellow s face was too austere and his expression extremely unprepossessing even exciting repulsion the good natured idea somehow faded away of itself so Pseldonimov did not get his tip He had been the more surprised when this same Pseldonimov had not more than a week before asked for leave to be married Ivan Ilyitch remembered that he had somehow not had time to go into the matter so that the matter of the marriage had been settled offhand in haste But yet he did remember exactly that Pseldonimov was receiving a wooden house and four hundred roubles in cash as dowry with his bride The circumstance had surprised him at the time he remembered that he had made a slight jest over the juxtaposition of the names Pseldonimov and Mlekopitaev He remembered all that clearly He recalled it and grew more and more pensive It is well known that whole trains of thought sometimes pass through our brains instantaneously as though they were sensations without being translated into human speech still less into literary language But we will try to translate these sensations of our hero s and present to the reader at least the kernel of them so to say what was most essential and nearest to reality in them For many of our sensations when translated into ordinary language seem absolutely unreal That is why they never find expression though every one has them Of course Ivan Ilyitch s sensations and thoughts were a little incoherent But you know the reason Why flashed through his mind here we all talk and talk but when it comes to action it all ends in nothing Here for instance take this Pseldonimov he has just come from his wedding full of hope and excitement looking forward to his wedding feast This is one of the most blissful days of his life Now he is busy with his guests is giving a banquet a modest one poor but gay and full of genuine gladness What if he knew that at this very moment I I his superior his chief am standing by his house listening to the music Yes really how would he feel No what would he feel if I suddenly walked in H m Of course at first he would be frightened he would be dumb with embarrassment I should be in his way and perhaps should upset everything Yes that would be so if any other general went in but not I That s a fact any one else but not I Yes Stepan Nikiforovitch You did not understand me just now but here is an example ready for you Yes we all make an outcry about acting humanely but we are not capable of heroism of fine actions What sort of heroism This sort Consider in the existing relations of the various members of society for me for me after midnight to go in to the wedding of my subordinate a registration clerk at ten roubles the month why it would mean embarrassment a revolution the last days of Pompeii a nonsensical folly No one would understand it Stepan Nikiforovitch would die before he understood it Why he said we should break down Yes but that s you old people inert paralytic people but I shan t break down I will transform the last day of Pompeii to a day of the utmost sweetness for my subordinate and a wild action to an action normal patriarchal lofty and moral How Like this Kindly listen Here I go in suppose they are amazed leave off dancing look wildly at me draw back Quite so but at once I speak out I go straight up to the frightened Pseldonimov and with a most cordial affable smile in the simplest words I say This is how it is I have been at his Excellency Stepan Nikiforovitch s I expect you know close here in the neighbourhood Well then lightly in a laughing way I shall tell him of my adventure with Trifon From Trifon I shall pass on to saying how I walked here on foot Well I heard music I inquired of a policeman and learned brother that it was your wedding Let me go in I thought to my subordinate s let me see how my clerks enjoy themselves and celebrate their wedding I suppose you won t turn me out Turn me out What a word for a subordinate How the devil could he dream of turning me out I fancy that he would be half crazy that he would rush headlong to seat me in an arm chair would be trembling with delight would hardly know what he was doing for the first minute Why what can be simpler more elegant than such an action Why did I go in That s another question That is so to say the moral aspect of the question That s the pith H m what was I thinking about yes Well of course they will make me sit down with the most important guest some titular councillor or a relation who s a retired captain with a red nose Gogol describes these eccentrics so capitally Well I shall make acquaintance of course with the bride I shall compliment her I shall encourage the guests I shall beg them not to stand on ceremony To enjoy themselves to go on dancing I shall make jokes I shall laugh in fact I shall be affable and charming I am always affable and charming when I am pleased with myself H m the point is that I believe I am still a little well not drunk exactly but Of course as a gentleman I shall be quite on an equality with them and shall not expect any especial marks of But morally morally it is a different matter they will understand and appreciate it My actions will evoke their nobler feelings Well I shall stay for half an hour even for an hour I shall leave of course before supper but they will be bustling about baking and roasting they will be making low bows but I will only drink a glass congratulate them and refuse supper I shall say business And as soon as I pronounce the word business all of them will at once have sternly respectful faces By that I shall delicately remind them that there is a difference between them and me The earth and the sky It is not that I want to impress that on them but it must be done it s even essential in a moral sense when all is said and done I shall smile at once however I shall even laugh and then they will all pluck up courage again I shall jest a little again with the bride h m I may even hint that I shall come again in just nine months to stand godfather he he And she will be sure to be brought to bed by then They multiply you know like rabbits And they will all roar with laughter and the bride will blush I shall kiss her feelingly on the forehead even give her my blessing and next day my exploit will be known at the office Next day I shall be stern again next day I shall be exacting again even implacable but they will all know what I am like They will know my heart they will know my essential nature He is stern as chief but as a man he is an angel And I shall have conquered them I shall have captured them by one little act which would never have entered your head they would be mine I should be their father they would be my children Come now your Excellency Stepan Nikiforovitch go and do likewise But do you know do you understand that Pseldonimov will tell his children how the General himself feasted and even drank at his wedding Why you know those children would tell their children and those would tell their grandchildren as a most sacred story that a grand gentleman a statesman and I shall be all that by then did them the honour and so on and so on Why I am morally elevating the humiliated I restore him to himself Why he gets a salary of ten roubles a month If I repeat this five or ten times or something of the sort I shall gain popularity all over the place My name will be printed on the hearts of all and the devil only knows what will come of that popularity These or something like these were Ivan Ilyitch s reflections a man says all sorts of things sometimes to himself gentlemen especially when he is in rather an eccentric condition All these meditations passed through his mind in something like half a minute and of course he might have confined himself to these dreams and after mentally putting Stepan Nikiforovitch to shame have gone very peacefully home and to bed And he would have done well But the trouble of it was that the moment was an eccentric one As ill luck would have it at that very instant the self satisfied faces of Stepan Nikiforovitch and Semyon Ivanovitch suddenly rose before his heated imagination We shall break down repeated Stepan Nikiforovitch smiling disdainfully He he he Semyon Ivanovitch seconded him with his nastiest smile Well we ll see whether we do break down Ivan Ilyitch said resolutely with a rush of heat to his face He stepped down from the pavement and with resolute steps went straight across the street towards the house of his registration clerk Pseldonimov His star carried him away He walked confidently in at the open gate and contemptuously thrust aside with his foot the shaggy husky little sheep dog who flew at his legs with a hoarse bark more as a matter of form than with any real intention Along a wooden plank he went to the covered porch which led like a sentry box to the yard and by three decaying wooden steps he went up to the tiny entry Here though a tallow candle or something in the way of a night light was burning somewhere in a corner it did not prevent Ivan Ilyitch from putting his left foot just as it was in its galosh into a galantine which had been stood out there to cool Ivan Ilyitch bent down and looking with curiosity he saw that there were two other dishes of some sort of jelly and also two shapes apparently of blancmange The squashed galantine embarrassed him and for one brief instant the thought flashed through his mind whether he should not slink away at once But he considered this too low Reflecting that no one would have seen him and that they would never think he had done it he hurriedly wiped his galosh to conceal all traces fumbled for the felt covered door opened it and found himself in a very little ante room Half of it was literally piled up with greatcoats wadded jackets cloaks capes scarves and galoshes In the other half the musicians had been installed two violins a flute and a double bass a band of four picked up of course in the street They were sitting at an unpainted wooden table lighted by a single tallow candle and with the utmost vigour were sawing out the last figure of the quadrille From the open door into the drawing room one could see the dancers in the midst of dust tobacco smoke and fumes There was a frenzy of gaiety There were sounds of laughter shouts and shrieks from the ladies The gentlemen stamped like a squadron of horses Above all the Bedlam there rang out words of command from the leader of the dance probably an extremely free and easy and even unbuttoned gentleman Gentlemen advance ladies chain set to partners and so on and so on Ivan Ilyitch in some excitement cast off his coat and galoshes and with his cap in his hand went into the room He was no longer reflecting however For the first minute nobody noticed him all were absorbed in dancing the quadrille to the end Ivan Ilyitch stood as though entranced and could make out nothing definite in the chaos He caught glimpses of ladies dresses of gentlemen with cigarettes between their teeth He caught a glimpse of a lady s pale blue scarf which flicked him on the nose After the wearer a medical student with his hair blown in all directions on his head pranced by in wild delight and jostled violently against him on the way He caught a glimpse too of an officer of some description who looked half a mile high Some one in an unnaturally shrill voice shouted O o oh Pseldonimov as the speaker flew by stamping It was sticky under Ivan Ilyitch s feet evidently the floor had been waxed In the room which was a very small one there were about thirty people But a minute later the quadrille was over and almost at once the very thing Ivan Ilyitch had pictured when he was dreaming on the pavement took place A stifled murmur a strange whisper passed over the whole company including the dancers who had not yet had time to take breath and wipe their perspiring faces All eyes all faces began quickly turning towards the newly arrived guest Then they all seemed to draw back a little and beat a retreat Those who had not noticed him were pulled by their coats or dresses and informed They looked round and at once beat a retreat with the others Ivan Ilyitch was still standing at the door without moving a step forward and between him and the company there stretched an ever widening empty space of floor strewn with countless sweet meat wrappings bits of paper and cigarette ends All at once a young man in a uniform with a shock of flaxen hair and a hooked nose stepped timidly out into that empty space He moved forward hunched up and looked at the unexpected visitor exactly with the expression with which a dog looks at its master when the latter has called him up and is going to kick him Good evening Pseldonimov do you know me said Ivan Ilyitch and felt at the same minute that he had said this very awkwardly he felt too that he was perhaps doing something horribly stupid at that moment You our Ex cel len cy muttered Pseldonimov To be sure I have called in to see you quite by chance my friend as you can probably imagine But evidently Pseldonimov could imagine nothing He stood with staring eyes in the utmost perplexity You won t turn me out I suppose Pleased or not you must make a visitor welcome Ivan Ilyitch went on feeling that he was confused to a point of unseemly feebleness that he was trying to smile and was utterly unable that the humorous reference to Stepan Nikiforovitch and Trifon was becoming more and more impossible But as ill luck would have it Pseldonimov did not recover from his stupefaction and still gazed at him with a perfectly idiotic air Ivan Ilyitch winced he felt that in another minute something incredibly foolish would happen I am not in the way am I I ll go away he faintly articulated and there was a tremor at the right corner of his mouth But Pseldonimov had recovered himself Good heavens your Excellency the honour he muttered bowing hurriedly Graciously sit down your Excellency And recovering himself still further he motioned him with both hands to a sofa before which a table had been moved away to make room for the dancing Ivan Ilyitch felt relieved and sank on the sofa at once some one flew to move the table up to him He took a cursory look round and saw that he was the only person sitting down all the others were standing even the ladies A bad sign But it was not yet time to reassure and encourage them The company still held back while before him bending double stood Pseldonimov utterly alone still completely at a loss and very far from smiling It was horrid in short our hero endured such misery at that moment that his Haroun al Raschid like descent upon his subordinates for the sake of principle might well have been reckoned an heroic action But suddenly a little figure made its appearance beside Pseldonimov and began bowing To his inexpressible pleasure and even happiness Ivan Ilyitch at once recognised him as the head clerk of his office Akim Petrovitch Zubikov and though of course he was not acquainted with him he knew him to be a businesslike and exemplary clerk He got up at once and held out his hand to Akim Petrovitch his whole hand not two fingers The latter took it in both of his with the deepest respect The general was triumphant the situation was saved And now indeed Pseldonimov was no longer so to say the second person but the third It was possible to address his remarks to the head clerk in his necessity taking him for an acquaintance and even an intimate one and Pseldonimov meanwhile could only be silent and be in a tremor of reverence So that the proprieties were observed And some explanation was essential Ivan Ilyitch felt that he saw that all the guests were expecting something that the whole household was gathered together in the doorway almost creeping climbing over one another in their anxiety to see and hear him What was horrid was that the head clerk in his foolishness remained standing Why are you standing said Ivan Ilyitch awkwardly motioning him to a seat on the sofa beside him Oh don t trouble I ll sit here And Akim Petrovitch hurriedly sat down on a chair almost as it was being put for him by Pseldonimov who remained obstinately standing Can you imagine what happened addressing himself exclusively to Akim Petrovitch in a rather quavering though free and easy voice He even drawled out his words with special emphasis on some syllables pronounced the vowel ah like eh in short felt and was conscious that he was being affected but could not control himself some external force was at work He was painfully conscious of many things at that moment Can you imagine I have only just come from Stepan Nikiforovitch Nikiforov s you have heard of him perhaps the privy councillor You know on that special committee Akim Petrovitch bent his whole person forward respectfully as much as to say Of course we have heard of him He is your neighbor now Ivan Ilyitch went on for one instant for the sake of ease and good manners addressing Pseldonimov but he quickly turned away again on seeing from the latter s eyes that it made absolutely no difference to him The old fellow as you know has been dreaming all his life of buying himself a house Well and he has bought it And a very pretty house too Yes And to day was his birthday and he had never celebrated it before he used even to keep it secret from us he was too stingy to keep it he he But now he is so delighted over his new house that he invited Semyon Ivanovitch Shipulenko and me you know Akim Petrovitch bent forward again He bent forward zealously Ivan Ilyitch felt somewhat comforted It had struck him indeed that the head clerk possibly was guessing that he was an indispensable point d appui for his Excellency at that moment That would have been more horrid than anything So we sat together the three of us he gave us champagne we talked about problems even dis pu ted He he Akim Petrovitch raised his eyebrows respectfully Only that is not the point When I take leave of him at last he is a punctual old fellow goes to bed early you know in his old age I go out My Trifon is nowhere to be seen I am anxious I make inquiries What has Trifon done with the carriage It comes out that hoping I should stay on he had gone off to the wedding of some friend of his or sister maybe Goodness only knows Somewhere here on the Petersburg Side And took the carriage with him while he was about it Again for the sake of good manners the general glanced in the direction of Pseldonimov The latter promptly gave a wriggle but not at all the sort of wriggle the general would have liked He has no sympathy no heart flashed through his brain You don t say so said Akim Petrovitch greatly impressed A faint murmur of surprise ran through all the crowd Can you fancy my position Ivan Ilyitch glanced at them all There was nothing for it I set off on foot I thought I would trudge to the Great Prospect and there find some cabby he he He he he Akim Petrovitch echoed Again a murmur but this time on a more cheerful note passed through the crowd At that moment the chimney of a lamp on the wall broke with a crash Some one rushed zealously to see to it Pseldonimov started and looked sternly at the lamp but the general took no notice of it and all was serene again I walked and the night was so lovely so still All at once I heard a band stamping dancing I inquired of a policeman it is Pseldonimov s wedding Why you are giving a ball to all Petersburg Side my friend Ha ha He turned to Pseldonimov again He he he To be sure Akim Petrovitch responded There was a stir among the guests again but what was most foolish was that Pseldonimov though he bowed did not even now smile but seemed as though he were made of wood Is he a fool or what thought Ivan Ilyitch He ought to have smiled at that point the ass and everything would have run easily There was a fury of impatience in his heart I thought I would go in to see my clerk He won t turn me out I expect pleased or not one must welcome a guest You must please excuse me my dear fellow If I am in the way I will go I only came in to have a look But little by little a general stir was beginning Akim Petrovitch looked at him with a mawkishly sweet expression as though to say How could your Excellency be in the way all the guests stirred and began to display the first symptoms of being at their ease Almost all the ladies sat down A good sign and a reassuring one The boldest spirits among them fanned themselves with their handkerchiefs One of them in a shabby velvet dress said something with intentional loudness The officer addressed by her would have liked to answer her as loudly but seeing that they were the only ones speaking aloud he subsided The men for the most part government clerks with two or three students among them looked at one another as though egging each other on to unbend cleared their throats and began to move a few steps in different directions No one however was particularly timid but they were all restive and almost all of them looked with a hostile expression at the personage who had burst in upon them to destroy their gaiety The officer ashamed of his cowardice began to edge up to the table But I say my friend allow me to ask you your name Ivan Ilyitch asked Pseldonimov Porfiry Petrovitch your Excellency answered the latter with staring eyes as though on parade Introduce me Porfiry Petrovitch to your bride Take me to her I And he showed signs of a desire to get up But Pseldonimov ran full speed to the drawing room The bride however was standing close by at the door but as soon as she heard herself mentioned she hid A minute later Pseldonimov led her up by the hand The guests all moved aside to make way for them Ivan Ilyitch got up solemnly and addressed himself to her with a most affable smile Very very much pleased to make your acquaintance he pronounced with a most aristocratic half bow especially on such a day He gave a meaning smile There was an agreeable flutter among the ladies Charme the lady in the velvet dress pronounced almost aloud The bride was a match for Pseldonimov She was a thin little lady not more than seventeen pale with a very small face and a sharp little nose Her quick active little eyes were not at all embarrassed on the contrary they looked at him steadily and even with a shade of resentment Evidently Pseldonimov was marrying her for her beauty She was dressed in a white muslin dress over a pink slip Her neck was thin and she had a figure like a chicken s with the bones all sticking out She was not equal to making any response to the general s affability But she is very pretty he went on in an undertone as though addressing Pseldonimov only though intentionally speaking so that the bride could hear But on this occasion too Pseldonimov again answered absolutely nothing and did not even wriggle Ivan Ilyitch fancied that there was something cold suppressed in his eyes as though he had something peculiarly malignant in his mind And yet he had at all costs to wring some sensibility out of him Why that was the object of his coming They are a couple though he thought And he turned again to the bride who had seated herself beside him on the sofa but in answer to his two or three questions he got nothing but yes or no and hardly that If only she had been overcome with confusion he thought to himself then I should have begun to banter her But as it is my position is impossible And as ill luck would have it Akim Petrovitch too was mute though this was only due to his foolishness it was still unpardonable My friends Haven t I perhaps interfered with your enjoyment he said addressing the whole company He felt that the very palms of his hands were perspiring No don t trouble your Excellency we are beginning directly but now we are getting cool answered the officer The bride looked at him with pleasure the officer was not old and wore the uniform of some branch of the service Pseldonimov was still standing in the same place bending forward and it seemed as though his hooked nose stood out further than ever He looked and listened like a footman standing with the greatcoat on his arm waiting for the end of his master s farewell conversation Ivan Ilyitch made this comparison himself He was losing his head he felt that he was in an awkward position that the ground was giving way under his feet that he had got in somewhere and could not find his way out as though he were in the dark Suddenly the guests all moved aside and a short thick set middle aged woman made her appearance dressed plainly though she was in her best with a big shawl on her shoulders pinned at her throat and on her head a cap to which she was evidently unaccustomed In her hands she carried a small round tray on which stood a full but uncorked bottle of champagne and two glasses neither more nor less Evidently the bottle was intended for only two guests The middle aged lady approached the general Don t look down on us your Excellency she said bowing Since you have deigned to do my son the honour of coming to his wedding we beg you graciously to drink to the health of the young people Do not disdain us do us the honour Ivan Ilyitch clutched at her as though she were his salvation She was by no means an old woman forty five or forty six not more but she had such a good natured rosy cheeked such a round and candid Russian face she smiled so good humouredly bowed so simply that Ivan Ilyitch was almost comforted and began to hope again So you are the mo other of your so on he said getting up from the sofa Yes my mother your Excellency mumbled Pseldonimov craning his long neck and thrusting forward his long nose again Ah I am delighted de ligh ted to make your acquaintance Do not refuse us your Excellency With the greatest pleasure The tray was put down Pseldonimov dashed forward to pour out the wine Ivan Ilyitch still standing took the glass I am particularly particularly glad on this occasion that I can he began that I can testify before all of you In short as your chief I wish you madam he turned to the bride and you friend Porfiry I wish you the fullest completest happiness for many long years And he positively drained the glass with feeling the seventh he had drunk that evening Pseldonimov looked at him gravely and even sullenly The general was beginning to feel an agonising hatred of him And that scarecrow he looked at the officer keeps obtruding himself He might at least have shouted hurrah and it would have gone off it would have gone off And you too Akim Petrovitch drink a glass to their health added the mother addressing the head clerk You are his superior he is under you Look after my boy I beg you as a mother And don t forget us in the future our good kind friend Akim Petrovitch How nice these old Russian women are thought Ivan Ilyitch She has livened us all up I have always loved the democracy At that moment another tray was brought to the table it was brought in by a maid wearing a crackling cotton dress that had never been washed and a crinoline She could hardly grasp the tray in both hands it was so big On it there were numbers of plates of apples sweets fruit meringues and fruit cheeses walnuts and so on and so on The tray had been till then in the drawing room for the delectation of all the guests and especially the ladies But now it was brought to the general alone Do not disdain our humble fare your Excellency What we have we are pleased to offer the old lady repeated bowing Delighted said Ivan Ilyitch and with real pleasure took a walnut and cracked it between his fingers He had made up his mind to win popularity at all costs Meantime the bride suddenly giggled What is it asked Ivan Ilyitch with a smile encouraged by this sign of life Ivan Kostenkinitch here makes me laugh she answered looking down The general distinguished indeed a flaxen headed young man exceedingly good looking who was sitting on a chair at the other end of the sofa whispering something to Madame Pseldonimov The young man stood up He was apparently very young and very shy I was telling the lady about a dream book your Excellency he muttered as though apologising About what sort of dream book asked Ivan Ilyitch condescendingly There is a new dream book a literary one I was telling the lady that to dream of mister Panaev means spilling coffee on one s shirt front What innocence thought Ivan Ilyitch with positive annoyance Though the young man flushed very red as he said it he was incredibly delighted that he had said this about mister Panaev To be sure I have heard of it responded his Excellency No there is something better than that said a voice quite close to Ivan Ilyitch There is a new encyclopaedia being published and they say mister Kraevsky will write articles and satirical literature This was said by a young man who was by no means embarrassed but rather free and easy He was wearing gloves and a white waistcoat and carried a hat in his hand He did not dance and looked condescending for he was on the staff of a satirical paper called The Firebrand and gave himself airs accordingly He had come casually to the wedding invited as an honoured guest of the Pseldonimovs with whom he was on intimate terms and with whom only a year before he had lived in very poor lodgings kept by a German woman He drank vodka however and for that purpose had more than once withdrawn to a snug little back room to which all the guests knew their way The general disliked him extremely And the reason that s funny broke in joyfully the flaxen headed young man who had talked of the shirt front and at whom the young man on the comic paper looked with hatred in consequence it s funny your Excellency because it is supposed by the writer that mister Kraevsky does not know how to spell and thinks that satirical ought to be written with a y instead of an i But the poor young man scarcely finished his sentence he could see from his eyes that the general knew all this long ago for the general himself looked embarrassed and evidently because he knew it The young man seemed inconceivably ashamed He succeeded in effacing himself completely and remained very melancholy all the rest of the evening But to make up for that the young man on the staff of the Firebrand came up nearer and seemed to be intending to sit down somewhere close by Such free and easy manners struck Ivan Ilyitch as rather shocking Tell me please Porfiry he began in order to say something why I have always wanted to ask you about it in person why you are called Pseldonimov instead of Pseudonimov Your name surely must be Pseudonimov I cannot inform you exactly your Excellency said Pseldonimov It must have been that when his father went into the service they made a mistake in his papers so that he has remained now Pseldonimov put in Akim Petrovitch That does happen Un doubted ly the general said with warmth un doubted ly for only think Pseudonimov comes from the literary word pseudonym while Pseldonimov means nothing Due to foolishness added Akim Petrovitch You mean what is due to foolishness The Russian common people in their foolishness often alter letters and sometimes pronounce them in their own way For instance they say nevalid instead of invalid Oh yes nevalid he he he Mumber too they say your Excellency boomed out the tall officer who had long been itching to distinguish himself in some way What do you mean by mumber Mumber instead of number your Excellency Oh yes mumber instead of number To be sure to be sure He he he Ivan Ilyitch had to do a chuckle for the benefit of the officer too The officer straightened his tie Another thing they say is nigh by the young man on the comic paper put in But his Excellency tried not to hear this His chuckles were not at everybody s disposal Nigh by instead of near the young man on the comic paper persisted in evident irritation Ivan Ilyitch looked at him sternly Come why persist Pseldonimov whispered to him Why I was talking Mayn t one speak the latter protested in a whisper but he said no more and with secret fury walked out of the room He made his way straight to the attractive little back room where for the benefit of the dancing gentlemen vodka of two sorts salt fish caviare into slices and a bottle of very strong sherry of Russian make had been set early in the evening on a little table covered with a Yaroslav cloth With anger in his heart he was pouring himself out a glass of vodka when suddenly the medical student with the dishevelled locks the foremost dancer and cutter of capers at Pseldonimov s ball rushed in He fell on the decanter with greedy haste They are just going to begin he said rapidly helping himself Come and look I am going to dance a solo on my head after supper I shall risk the fish dance It is just the thing for the wedding So to speak a friendly hint to Pseldonimov She s a jolly creature that Kleopatra Semyonovna you can venture on anything you like with her He s a reactionary said the young man on the comic paper gloomily as he tossed off his vodka Who is a reactionary Why the personage before whom they set those sweet meats He s a reactionary I tell you What nonsense muttered the student and he rushed out of the room hearing the opening bars of the quadrille Left alone the young man on the comic paper poured himself out another glass to give himself more assurance and independence he drank and ate a snack of something and never had the actual civil councillor Ivan Ilyitch made for himself a bitterer foe more implacably bent on revenge than was the young man on the staff of the Firebrand whom he had so slighted especially after the latter had drunk two glasses of vodka Alas Ivan Ilyitch suspected nothing of the sort He did not suspect another circumstance of prime importance either which had an influence on the mutual relations of the guests and his Excellency The fact was that though he had given a proper and even detailed explanation of his presence at his clerk s wedding this explanation did not really satisfy any one and the visitors were still embarrassed But suddenly everything was transformed as though by magic all were reassured and ready to enjoy themselves to laugh to shriek to dance exactly as though the unexpected visitor were not in the room The cause of it was a rumour a whisper a report which spread in some unknown way that the visitor was not quite it seemed was in fact a little top heavy And though this seemed at first a horrible calumny it began by degrees to appear to be justified suddenly everything became clear What was more they felt all at once extraordinarily free And it was just at this moment that the quadrille for which the medical student was in such haste the last before supper began And just as Ivan Ilyitch meant to address the bride again intending to provoke her with some innuendo the tall officer suddenly dashed up to her and with a flourish dropped on one knee before her She immediately jumped up from the sofa and whisked off with him to take her place in the quadrille The officer did not even apologise and she did not even glance at the general as she went away she seemed in fact relieved to escape After all she has a right to be thought Ivan Ilyitch and of course they don t know how to behave Hm Don t you stand on ceremony friend Porfiry he said addressing Pseldonimov Perhaps you have arrangements to make or something please don t put yourself out Why does he keep guard over me he thought to himself Pseldonimov with his long neck and his eyes fixed intently upon him began to be insufferable In fact all this was not the thing not the thing at all but Ivan Ilyitch was still far from admitting this The quadrille began Will you allow me your Excellency asked Akim Petrovitch holding the bottle respectfully in his hands and preparing to pour from it into his Excellency s glass I I really don t know whether But Akim Petrovitch with reverent and radiant face was already filling the glass After filling the glass he proceeded writhing and wriggling as it were stealthily as it were furtively to pour himself out some with this difference that he did not fill his own glass to within a finger length of the top and this seemed somehow more respectful He was like a woman in travail as he sat beside his chief What could he talk about indeed Yet to entertain his Excellency was an absolute duty since he had the honour of keeping him company 
7762-280917-0000	train-other-500	The champagne served as a resource and his Excellency too was pleased that he had filled his glass not for the sake of the champagne for it was warm and perfectly abominable but just morally pleased
none	none	 The old chap would like to have a drink himself thought Ivan Ilyitch 
7762-280917-0001	train-other-500	but he doesn t venture till I do I mustn t prevent him And indeed it would be absurd for the bottle to stand between as untouched He took a sip anyway it seemed better than sitting doing nothing
7762-280917-0002	train-other-500	I am here he said with pauses and emphasis I am here you know so to speak accidentally and of course it may be that some people would consider it unseemly for me to be at such a gathering
7762-280917-0003	train-other-500	Akim Petrovitch said nothing but listened with timid curiosity But I hope you will understand with what object I have come
none	none	 I haven t really come simply to drink wine he he 
7762-280917-0004	train-other-500	Akim Petrovitch tried to chuckle following the example of his Excellency but again he could not get it out and again he made absolutely no consolatory answer I am here
none	none	 in order so to speak to encourage 
7762-280917-0005	train-other-500	to show so to speak a moral aim
none	none	 Ivan Ilyitch continued 
7762-280917-0006	train-other-500	feeling vexed at Akim Petrovitch s stupidity but he suddenly subsided into silence himself He saw that poor Akim Petrovitch had dropped his eyes as though he were in fault
7762-280917-0007	train-other-500	The general in some confusion made haste to take another sip from his glass and Akim Petrovitch clutched at the bottle as though it were his only hope of salvation and filled the glass again
none	none	 You haven t many resources thought Ivan Ilyitch looking sternly at poor Akim Petrovitch 
7762-280917-0008	train-other-500	The latter feeling that stern general like eye upon him made up his mind to remain silent for good and not to raise his eyes So they sat beside each other for a couple of minutes
7762-280917-0009	train-other-500	two sickly minutes for Akim Petrovitch A couple of words about Akim Petrovitch He was a man of the old school as meek as a hen reared from infancy to obsequious servility
7762-280917-0010	train-other-500	and at the same time a good natured and even honourable man He was a Petersburg Russian that is his father and his father s father were born grew up and served in Petersburg and had never once left Petersburg
7762-280917-0011	train-other-500	That is quite a special type of Russian They have hardly any idea of Russia though that does not trouble them at all Their whole interest is confined to Petersburg and chiefly the place in which they serve
none	none	 All their thoughts are concentrated on preference for farthing points on the shop 
7762-280917-0012	train-other-500	and their month s salary They don t know a single Russian custom a single Russian song except Lutchinushka and that only because it is played on the barrel organs
7762-280917-0013	train-other-500	However there are two fundamental and invariable signs by which you can at once distinguish a Petersburg Russian from a real Russian The first sign is the fact that Petersburg Russians
7762-280917-0014	train-other-500	all without exception speak of the newspaper as the Academic News and never call it the Petersburg News The second and equally trustworthy sign
7762-280917-0015	train-other-500	is that Petersburg Russians never make use of the word breakfast but always call it Fruhstuck with especial emphasis on the first syllable By these radical and distinguishing signs you can tell them apart in short this is a humble type
7762-280917-0016	train-other-500	which has been formed during the last thirty five years Akim Petrovitch however was by no means a fool If the general had asked him a question about anything in his own province he would have answered and kept up a conversation
7762-280917-0017	train-other-500	as it was it was unseemly for a subordinate even to answer such questions as these though Akim Petrovitch was dying from curiosity to know something more detailed about his Excellency s real intentions
none	none	 And meanwhile Ivan Ilyitch sank more and more into meditation and a sort of whirl of ideas 
7762-280917-0018	train-other-500	in his absorption he sipped his glass every half minute Akim Petrovitch at once zealously filled it up Both were silent
none	none	 Ivan Ilyitch began looking at the dances and immediately something attracted his attention 
7762-280917-0019	train-other-500	One circumstance even surprised him The dances were certainly lively Here people danced in the simplicity of their hearts to amuse themselves and even to romp wildly
7762-280917-0020	train-other-500	Among the dancers few were really skilful but the unskilled stamped so vigorously that they might have been taken for agile ones The officer was among the foremost
7762-280917-0021	train-other-500	he particularly liked the figures in which he was left alone to perform a solo Then he performed the most marvellous capers For instance standing upright as a post he would suddenly bend over to one side
7762-280917-0022	train-other-500	so that one expected him to fall over but with the next step he would suddenly bend over in the opposite direction at the same acute angle to the floor He kept the most serious face and danced in the full conviction
7762-280917-0023	train-other-500	that every one was watching him Another gentleman who had had rather more than he could carry before the quadrille dropped asleep beside his partner so that his partner had to dance alone
7762-280917-0024	train-other-500	The young registration clerk who had danced with the lady in the blue scarf through all the figures and through all the five quadrilles which they had danced that evening played the same prank the whole time
none	none	 that is he dropped a little behind his partner seized the end of her scarf and as they crossed over succeeded in imprinting some twenty kisses on the scarf 
7762-280917-0025	train-other-500	His partner sailed along in front of him as though she noticed nothing The medical student really did dance on his head and excited frantic enthusiasm stamping and shrieks of delight In short the absence of constraint was very marked
none	none	 Ivan Ilyitch whom the wine was beginning to affect 
7762-280917-0026	train-other-500	began by smiling but by degrees a bitter doubt began to steal into his heart of course he liked free and easy manners and unconventionality
7762-280917-0027	train-other-500	He desired he had even inwardly prayed for free and easy manners when they had all held back
7762-280917-0028	train-other-500	but now that unconventionality had gone beyond all limits One lady for instance the one in the shabby dark blue velvet dress bought fourth hand in the sixth figure pinned her dress so as to turn it into something like trousers
none	none	 This was the Kleopatra Semyonovna 
7762-280917-0029	train-other-500	with whom one could venture to do anything as her partner the medical student had expressed it The medical student defied description he was simply a Fokin How was it
7762-280917-0030	train-other-500	They had held back and now they were so quickly emancipated One might think it nothing but this transformation was somehow strange it indicated something
none	none	 It was as though they had forgotten Ivan Ilyitch s existence Of course he was the first to laugh and even ventured to applaud 
7762-280917-0031	train-other-500	Akim Petrovitch chuckled respectfully in unison though indeed with evident pleasure and no suspicion that his Excellency was beginning to nourish in his heart a new gnawing anxiety
none	none	 You dance capitally young man Ivan Ilyitch was obliged to say to the medical student as he walked past him The student turned sharply towards him 
7762-280917-0032	train-other-500	made a grimace and bringing his face close into unseemly proximity to the face of his Excellency crowed like a cock at the top of his voice This was too much
none	none	 Ivan Ilyitch got up from the table 
7762-280917-0033	train-other-500	In spite of that a roar of inexpressible laughter followed for the crow was an extraordinarily good imitation and the whole performance was utterly unexpected
none	none	 Ivan Ilyitch was still standing in bewilderment when suddenly Pseldonimov himself made his appearance 
7762-280917-0034	train-other-500	and with a bow began begging him to come to supper His mother followed him Your Excellency she said bowing do us the honour do not disdain our humble fare
none	none	 I I really don t know Ivan Ilyitch was beginning 
7762-280917-0035	train-other-500	I did not come with that idea I meant to be going He was in fact holding his hat in his hands What is more he had at that very moment taken an inward vow
none	none	 at all costs to depart at once and on no account whatever to consent to remain and he remained 
7762-280917-0036	train-other-500	A minute later he led the procession to the table Pseldonimov and his mother walked in front clearing the way for him They made him sit down in the seat of honour
7762-280917-0037	train-other-500	and again a bottle of champagne opened but not begun was set beside his plate By way of hors d oeuvres there were salt herrings and vodka He put out his hand poured out a large glass of vodka and drank it off
7762-280917-0038	train-other-500	He had never drunk vodka before He felt as though he were rolling down a hill were flying flying flying that he must stop himself catch at something but there was no possibility of it His position was certainly becoming more and more eccentric
none	none	 What is more it seemed as though fate were mocking at him 
7762-280917-0039	train-other-500	God knows what had happened to him in the course of an hour or so When he went in he had so to say opened his arms to embrace all humanity all his subordinates
7762-280917-0040	train-other-500	and here not more than an hour had passed and in all his aching heart he felt and knew that he hated Pseldonimov and was cursing him his wife and his wedding
none	none	 What was more he saw from his face from his eyes alone that Pseldonimov himself hated him that he was looking at him with eyes that almost said If only you would take yourself off curse you Foisting yourself on us All this he had read for some time in his eyes 
7762-280917-0041	train-other-500	Of course as he sat down to table
none	none	 Ivan Ilyitch 
7762-280917-0042	train-other-500	would sooner have had his hand cut off than have owned not only aloud but even to himself that this was really so The moment had not fully arrived yet There was still a moral vacillation
none	none	 But his heart his heart it ached It was clamouring for freedom for air for rest Ivan Ilyitch was really too good natured He knew of course that he ought long before to have gone away 
7762-280917-0043	train-other-500	not merely to have gone away but to have made his escape That all this was not the same but had turned out utterly different from what he had dreamed of on the pavement
7762-280917-0044	train-other-500	Why did I come Did I come here to eat and drink he asked himself as he tasted the salt herring He even had attacks of scepticism
none	none	 There was at moments a faint stir of irony in regard to his own fine action 
7762-280917-0045	train-other-500	at the bottom of his heart He actually wondered at times why he had come in But how could he go away To go away like this without having finished the business properly was impossible What would people say
7762-280917-0046	train-other-500	They would say that he was frequenting low company Indeed it really would amount to that if he did not end it properly
none	none	 What would Stepan Nikiforovitch Semyon Ivanovitch say for of course it would be all over the place by to morrow what would be said in the offices at the Shembels at the Shubins No he must take his departure 
7762-280917-0047	train-other-500	in such a way that all should understand why he had come he must make clear his moral aim And meantime the dramatic moment would not present itself They don t even respect me he went on thinking
7762-280917-0048	train-other-500	What are they laughing at They are as free and easy as though they had no feeling But I have long suspected that all the younger generation are without feeling I must remain at all costs
7762-280917-0049	train-other-500	They have just been dancing but now at table they will all be gathered together I will talk about questions about reforms about the greatness of Russia I can still win their enthusiasm Yes
7762-280917-0050	train-other-500	Perhaps nothing is yet lost Perhaps it is always like this in reality What should I begin upon with them to attract them
none	none	 What plan can I hit upon I am lost simply lost 
7762-280917-0051	train-other-500	And what is it they want what is it they require I see they are laughing together there Can it be at me merciful heavens But what is it I want why is it I am here
7762-280917-0052	train-other-500	why don t I go away why do I go on persisting
none	none	 He thought this and a sort of shame a deep unbearable shame rent his heart more and more intensely 
7762-280917-0053	train-other-500	But everything went on in the same way one thing after another Just two minutes after he had sat down to the table one terrible thought overwhelmed him completely He suddenly felt
none	none	 that he was horribly drunk 
7762-280917-0054	train-other-500	that is not as he was before but hopelessly drunk The cause of this was the glass of vodka which he had drunk after the champagne and which had immediately produced an effect He was conscious he felt in every fibre of his being
none	none	 that he was growing hopelessly feeble 
7762-280917-0055	train-other-500	Of course his assurance was greatly increased but consciousness had not deserted him and it kept crying out It is bad very bad and in fact utterly unseemly Of course his unstable drunken reflections
7762-280917-0056	train-other-500	could not rest long on one subject there began to be apparent and unmistakably so even to himself two opposite sides On one side there was swaggering assurance a desire to conquer
7762-280917-0057	train-other-500	a disdain of obstacles and a desperate confidence that he would attain his object The other side showed itself in the aching of his heart and a sort of gnawing in his soul What would they say How would it all end
7762-280917-0058	train-other-500	What would happen to morrow to morrow to morrow He had felt vaguely before that he had enemies in the company No doubt that was because I was drunk he thought with agonising doubt
7762-280917-0059	train-other-500	What was his horror when he actually by unmistakable signs convinced himself now that he really had enemies at the table and that it was impossible to doubt of it And why why he wondered
7762-280917-0060	train-other-500	At the table there were all the thirty guests of whom several were quite tipsy Others were behaving with a careless and sinister independence shouting and talking at the top of their voices bawling out the toasts before the time
7762-280917-0061	train-other-500	and pelting the ladies with pellets of bread One unprepossessing personage in a greasy coat had fallen off his chair as soon as he sat down and remained so till the end of supper
7762-280917-0062	train-other-500	Another one made desperate efforts to stand on the table to propose a toast and only the officer who seized him by the tails of his coat moderated his premature ardour
7762-280917-0063	train-other-500	The supper was a pell mell affair although they had hired a cook who had been in the service of a general there was the galantine there was tongue and potatoes there were rissoles with green peas
none	none	 there was finally a goose and last of all blancmange Among the drinks were beer 
7762-280917-0064	train-other-500	vodka and sherry The only bottle of champagne was standing beside the general which obliged him to pour it out for himself and also for Akim Petrovitch who did not venture at supper to officiate on his own initiative
7762-280917-0065	train-other-500	The other guests had to drink the toasts in Caucasian wine or anything else they could get The table was made up of several tables put together among them even a card table
7762-280917-0066	train-other-500	It was covered with many tablecloths amongst them one coloured Yaroslav cloth the gentlemen sat alternately with the ladies Pseldonimov s mother would not sit down to the table
7762-280917-0067	train-other-500	she bustled about and supervised But another sinister female figure
none	none	 who had not shown herself till then 
7762-280917-0068	train-other-500	appeared on the scene wearing a reddish silk dress with a very high cap on her head and a bandage round her face for toothache It appeared that this was the bride s mother who had at last consented to emerge from a back room for supper
none	none	 She had refused to appear till then owing to her implacable hostility to Pseldonimov s mother but to that we will refer later 
7762-280917-0069	train-other-500	This lady looked spitefully even sarcastically at the general and evidently did not wish to be presented to him
none	none	 To Ivan Ilyitch this figure appeared suspicious in the extreme But apart from her 
7762-280917-0070	train-other-500	several other persons were suspicious and inspired involuntary apprehension and uneasiness
none	none	 It even seemed that they were in some sort of plot together against Ivan Ilyitch At any rate it seemed so to him and throughout the whole supper he became more and more convinced of it 
7762-280917-0071	train-other-500	A gentleman with a beard some sort of free artist was particularly sinister
none	none	 he even looked at Ivan Ilyitch several times and then turning to his neighbour whispered something 
7762-280917-0072	train-other-500	Another person present was unmistakably drunk but yet from certain signs was to be regarded with suspicion The medical student too gave rise to unpleasant expectations
7762-280917-0073	train-other-500	Even the officer himself was not quite to be depended on But the young man on the comic paper was blazing with hatred he lolled in his chair he looked so haughty and conceited he snorted so aggressively
none	none	 And though the rest of the guests took absolutely no notice of the young journalist who had contributed only four wretched poems to the Firebrand and had consequently become a Liberal and evidently indeed disliked him yet when a pellet of bread aimed in his direction fell near Ivan Ilyitch he was ready to stake his head that it had been thrown by no other than the young man in question 
7762-280917-0074	train-other-500	All this of course had a pitiable effect on him Another observation was particularly unpleasant Ivan Ilyitch became aware that he was beginning to articulate indistinctly and with difficulty
none	none	 that he was longing to say a great deal 
7762-280917-0075	train-other-500	but that his tongue refused to obey him And then he suddenly seemed to forget himself and worst of all he would suddenly burst into a loud guffaw of laughter a propos of nothing
none	none	 This inclination quickly passed off after a glass of champagne which Ivan Ilyitch had not meant to drink though he had poured it out and suddenly drunk it quite by accident 
7762-280917-0076	train-other-500	After that glass he felt at once almost inclined to cry He felt that he was sinking into a most peculiar state of sentimentality he began to be again filled with love he loved every one
7762-280917-0077	train-other-500	even Pseldonimov even the young man on the comic paper
none	none	 He suddenly longed to embrace all of them to forget everything and to be reconciled 
7762-280917-0078	train-other-500	What is more to tell them everything openly all
none	none	 all 
7762-280917-0079	train-other-500	that is to tell them what a good nice man he was with what wonderful talents What services he would do for his country how good he was at entertaining the fair sex and above all how progressive he was
7762-280917-0080	train-other-500	how humanely ready he was to be indulgent to all to the very lowest and finally in conclusion
7762-280917-0081	train-other-500	to tell them frankly all the motives that had impelled him to turn up at Pseldonimov s uninvited to drink two bottles of champagne and to make him happy with his presence The truth the holy truth and candour before all things
7762-280917-0082	train-other-500	I will capture them by candour They will believe me I see it clearly they actually look at me with hostility but when I tell them all I shall conquer them completely
7762-280917-0083	train-other-500	They will fill their glasses and drink my health with shouts The officer will break his glass on his spur Perhaps they will even shout hurrah Even if they want to toss me after the Hussar fashion I will not oppose them
7762-280917-0084	train-other-500	and indeed it would be very jolly I will kiss the bride on her forehead she is charming Akim Petrovitch is a very nice man too
none	none	 Pseldonimov will improve of course later on 
7762-280917-0085	train-other-500	He will acquire so to speak a society polish
none	none	 And although of course the younger generation has not that delicacy of feeling yet yet I will talk to them about the contemporary significance of Russia among the European States I will refer to the peasant question too yes and and they will all like me and I shall leave with glory These dreams were of course extremely agreeable but what was unpleasant was that in the midst of these roseate anticipations Ivan Ilyitch suddenly discovered in himself another unexpected propensity that was to spit Anyway saliva began running from his mouth apart from any will of his own He observed this on Akim Petrovitch whose cheek he spluttered upon and who sat not daring to wipe it off from respectfulness Ivan Ilyitch took his dinner napkin and wiped it himself but this immediately struck him himself as so incongruous so opposed to all common sense that he sank into silence and began wondering Though Akim Petrovitch emptied his glass yet he sat as though he were scalded Ivan Ilyitch reflected now that he had for almost a quarter of an hour been talking to him about some most interesting subject but that Akim Petrovitch had not only seemed embarrassed as he listened but positively frightened Pseldonimov who was sitting one chair away from him also craned his neck towards him and bending his head sideways listened to him with the most unpleasant air He actually seemed to be keeping a watch on him Turning his eyes upon the rest of the company he saw that many were looking straight at him and laughing But what was strangest of all was that he was not in the least embarrassed by it on the contrary he sipped his glass again and suddenly began speaking so that all could hear I was saying just now he began as loudly as possible I was saying just now ladies and gentlemen to Akim Petrovitch that Russia yes Russia in short you understand that I mean to s s say Russia is living it is my profound conviction through a period of hu hu manity Hu hu manity was heard at the other end of the table Hu hu Tu tu Ivan Ilyitch stopped Pseldonimov got up from his chair and began trying to see who had shouted Akim Petrovitch stealthily shook his head as though admonishing the guests Ivan Ilyitch saw this distinctly but in his confusion said nothing Humanity he continued obstinately and this evening and only this evening I said to Stepan Niki ki foro vitch yes that that the regeneration so to speak of things Your Excellency was heard a loud exclamation at the other end of the table What is your pleasure answered Ivan Ilyitch pulled up short and trying to distinguish who had called to him Nothing at all your Excellency I was carried away continue Con ti nue the voice was heard again Ivan Ilyitch felt upset The regeneration so to speak of those same things Your Excellency the voice shouted again What do you want How do you do This time Ivan Ilyitch could not restrain himself He broke off his speech and turned to the assailant who had disturbed the general harmony He was a very young lad still at school who had taken more than a drop too much and was an object of great suspicion to the general He had been shouting for a long time past and had even broken a glass and two plates maintaining that this was the proper thing to do at a wedding At the moment when Ivan Ilyitch turned towards him the officer was beginning to pitch into the noisy youngster What are you about Why are you yelling We shall turn you out that s what we shall do I don t mean you your Excellency I don t mean you Continue cried the hilarious schoolboy lolling back in his chair Continue I am listening and am very ve ry ve ry much pleased with you Praisewor thy praisewor thy The wretched boy is drunk said Pseldonimov in a whisper I see that he is drunk but I was just telling a very amusing anecdote your Excellency began the officer about a lieutenant in our company who was talking just like that to his superior officers so this young man is imitating him now To every word of his superior officers he said praiseworthy praiseworthy He was turned out of the army ten years ago on account of it Wha at lieutenant was that In our company your Excellency he went out of his mind over the word praiseworthy At first they tried gentle methods then they put him under arrest His commanding officer admonished him in the most fatherly way and he answered praiseworthy praiseworthy And strange to say the officer was a fine looking man over six feet They meant to court martial him but then they perceived that he was mad So a schoolboy A schoolboy s prank need not be taken seriously For my part I am ready to overlook it They held a medical inquiry your Excellency Upon my word but he was alive wasn t he What Did they dissect him A loud and almost universal roar of laughter resounded among the guests who had till then behaved with decorum Ivan Ilyitch was furious Ladies and gentlemen he shouted at first scarcely stammering I am fully capable of apprehending that a man is not dissected alive I imagined that in his derangement he had ceased to be alive that is that he had died that is I mean to say that you don t like me and yet I like you all Yes I like Por Porfiry I am lowering myself by speaking like this At that moment Ivan Ilyitch spluttered so that a great dab of saliva flew on to the tablecloth in a most conspicuous place Pseldonimov flew to wipe it off with a table napkin This last disaster crushed him completely My friends this is too much he cried in despair The man is drunk your Excellency Pseldonimov prompted him again Porfiry I see that you all yes I say that I hope yes I call upon you all to tell me in what way have I lowered myself Ivan Ilyitch was almost crying Your Excellency good heavens Porfiry I appeal to you Tell me when I came yes yes to your wedding I had an object I was aiming at moral elevation I wanted it to be felt I appeal to all am I greatly lowered in your eyes or not A deathlike silence That was just it a deathlike silence and to such a downright question They might at least shout at this minute flashed through his Excellency s head But the guests only looked at one another Akim Petrovitch sat more dead than alive while Pseldonimov numb with terror was repeating to himself the awful question which had occurred to him more than once already What shall I have to pay for all this to morrow At this point the young man on the comic paper who was very drunk but who had hitherto sat in morose silence addressed Ivan Ilyitch directly and with flashing eyes began answering in the name of the whole company Yes he said in a loud voice yes you have lowered yourself Yes you are a reactionary re ac tion ary Young man you are forgetting yourself To whom are you speaking so to express it Ivan Ilyitch cried furiously jumping up from his seat again To you and secondly I am not a young man You ve come to give yourself airs and try to win popularity Pseldonimov what does this mean cried Ivan Ilyitch But Pseldonimov was reduced to such horror that he stood still like a post and was utterly at a loss what to do The guests too sat mute in their seats All but the artist and the schoolboy who applauded and shouted Bravo bravo The young man on the comic paper went on shouting with unrestrained violence Yes you came to show off your humanity You ve hindered the enjoyment of every one You ve been drinking champagne without thinking that it is beyond the means of a clerk at ten roubles a month And I suspect that you are one of those high officials who are a little too fond of the young wives of their clerks What is more I am convinced that you support State monopolies Yes yes yes Pseldonimov Pseldonimov shouted Ivan Ilyitch holding out his hands to him He felt that every word uttered by the comic young man was a fresh dagger at his heart Directly your Excellency please do not disturb yourself Pseldonimov cried energetically rushing up to the comic young man seizing him by the collar and dragging him away from the table Such physical strength could indeed not have been expected from the weakly looking Pseldonimov But the comic young man was very drunk while Pseldonimov was perfectly sober Then he gave him two or three cuffs in the back and thrust him out of the door You are all scoundrels roared the young man of the comic paper I will caricature you all to morrow in the Firebrand They all leapt up from their seats Your Excellency your Excellency cried Pseldonimov his mother and several others crowding round the general your Excellency do not be disturbed No no cried the general I am annihilated I came I meant to bless you so to speak And this is how I am paid for everything everything He sank on to a chair as though unconscious laid both his arms on the table and bowed his head over them straight into a plate of blancmange There is no need to describe the general horror A minute later he got up evidently meaning to go out gave a lurch stumbled against the leg of a chair fell full length on the floor and snored This is what is apt to happen to men who don t drink when they accidentally take a glass too much They preserve their consciousness to the last point to the last minute and then fall to the ground as though struck down Ivan Ilyitch lay on the floor absolutely unconscious Pseldonimov clutched at his hair and sat as though petrified in that position The guests made haste to depart commenting each in his own way on the incident It was about three o clock in the morning The worst of it was that Pseldonimov s circumstances were far worse than could have been imagined in spite of the unattractiveness of his present surroundings And while Ivan Ilyitch is lying on the floor and Pseldonimov is standing over him tearing his hair in despair we will break off the thread of our story and say a few explanatory words about Porfiry Petrovitch Pseldonimov Not more than a month before his wedding he was in a state of hopeless destitution He came from a province where his father had served in some department and where he had died while awaiting his trial on some charge When five months before his wedding Pseldonimov who had been in hopeless misery in Petersburg for a whole year before got his berth at ten roubles a month he revived both physically and mentally but he was soon crushed by circumstances again There were only two Pseldonimovs left in the world himself and his mother who had left the province after her husband s death The mother and son barely existed in the freezing cold and sustained life on the most dubious substances There were days when Pseldonimov himself went with a jug to the Fontanka for water to drink When he got his place he succeeded in settling with his mother in a corner She took in washing while for four months he scraped together every farthing to get himself boots and an overcoat And what troubles he had to endure at his office his superiors approached him with the question How long was it since he had had a bath There was a rumour about him that under the collar of his uniform there were nests of bugs But Pseldonimov was a man of strong character On the surface he was mild and meek he had the merest smattering of education he was practically never heard to talk of anything I do not know for certain whether he thought made plans and theories had dreams But on the other hand there was being formed within him an instinctive furtive unconscious determination to fight his way out of his wretched circumstances He had the persistence of an ant Destroy an ants nest and they will begin at once re erecting it destroy it again and they will begin again without wearying He was a constructive house building animal One could see from his brow that he would make his way would build his nest and perhaps even save for a rainy day His mother was the only creature in the world who loved him and she loved him beyond everything She was a woman of resolute character hard working and indefatigable and at the same time good natured So perhaps they might have lived in their corner for five or six years till their circumstances changed if they had not come across the retired titular councillor Mlekopitaev who had been a clerk in the treasury and had served at one time in the provinces but had latterly settled in Petersburg and had established himself there with his family He knew Pseldonimov and had at one time been under some obligation to his father He had a little money not a large sum of course but there it was how much it was no one knew not his wife nor his elder daughter nor his relations He had two daughters and as he was an awful bully a drunkard a domestic tyrant and in addition to that an invalid he took it into his head one day to marry one of his daughters to Pseldonimov I knew his father he would say he was a good fellow and his son will be a good fellow Mlekopitaev did exactly as he liked his word was law He was a very queer bully For the most part he spent his time sitting in an arm chair having lost the use of his legs from some disease which did not however prevent him from drinking vodka For days together he would be drinking and swearing He was an ill natured man He always wanted to have some one whom he could be continually tormenting And for that purpose he kept several distant relations his sister a sickly and peevish woman two of his wife s sisters also ill natured and very free with their tongues and his old aunt who had through some accident a broken rib he kept another dependent also a Russianised German for the sake of her talent for entertaining him with stories from the Arabian Nights His sole gratification consisted in jeering at all these unfortunate women and abusing them every minute with all his energies though the latter not excepting his wife who had been born with toothache dared not utter a word in his presence He set them at loggerheads at one another inventing and fostering spiteful backbiting and dissensions among them and then laughed and rejoiced seeing how they were ready to tear one another to pieces He was very much delighted when his elder daughter who had lived in great poverty for ten years with her husband an officer of some sort and was at last left a widow came to live with him with three little sickly children He could not endure her children but as her arrival had increased the material upon which he could work his daily experiments the old man was very much pleased All these ill natured women and sickly children together with their tormentor were crowded together in a wooden house on Petersburg Side and did not get enough to eat because the old man was stingy and gave out to them money a farthing at a time though he did not grudge himself vodka they did not get enough sleep because the old man suffered from sleeplessness and insisted on being amused In short they all were in misery and cursed their fate It was at that time that Mlekopitaev s eye fell upon Pseldonimov He was struck by his long nose and submissive air His weakly and unprepossessing younger daughter had just reached the age of seventeen Though she had at one time attended a German school she had acquired scarcely anything but the alphabet Then she grew up rickety and anaemic in fear of her crippled drunken father s crutch in a Bedlam of domestic backbiting eavesdropping and scolding She had never had any friends or any brains She had for a long time been eager to be married In company she sat mute but at home with her mother and the women of the household she was spiteful and cantankerous She was particularly fond of pinching and smacking her sister s children telling tales of their pilfering bread and sugar and this led to endless and implacable strife with her elder sister Her old father himself offered her to Pseldonimov Miserable as the latter s position was he yet asked for a little time to consider His mother and he hesitated for a long time But with the young lady there was to come as dowry a house and though it was a nasty little wooden house of one storey yet it was property of a kind Moreover they would give with her four hundred roubles and how long it would take him to save it up himself What am I taking the man into my house for shouted the drunken bully In the first place because you are all females and I am sick of female society I want Pseldonimov too to dance to my piping For I am his benefactor And in the second place I am doing it because you are all cross and don t want it so I ll do it to spite you What I have said I have said And you beat her Porfiry when she is your wife she has been possessed of seven devils ever since she was born You beat them out of her and I ll get the stick ready Pseldonimov made no answer but he was already decided Before the wedding his mother and he were taken into the house washed clothed provided with boots and money for the wedding The old man took them under his protection possibly just because the whole family was prejudiced against them He positively liked Pseldonimov s mother so that he actually restrained himself and did not jeer at her On the other hand he made Pseldonimov dance the Cossack dance a week before the wedding Well that s enough I only wanted to see whether you remembered your position before me or not he said at the end of the dance He allowed just enough money for the wedding with nothing to spare and invited all his relations and acquaintances On Pseldonimov s side there was no one but the young man who wrote for the Firebrand and Akim Petrovitch the guest of honour Pseldonimov was perfectly aware that his bride cherished an aversion for him and that she was set upon marrying the officer instead of him But he put up with everything he had made a compact with his mother to do so The old father had been drunk and abusive and foul tongued the whole of the wedding day and during the party in the evening The whole family took refuge in the back rooms and were crowded there to suffocation The front rooms were devoted to the dance and the supper At last when the old man fell asleep dead drunk at eleven o clock the bride s mother who had been particularly displeased with Pseldonimov s mother that day made up her mind to lay aside her wrath become gracious and join the company Ivan Ilyitch s arrival had turned everything upside down Madame Mlekopitaev was overcome with embarrassment and began grumbling that she had not been told that the general had been invited She was assured that he had come uninvited but was so stupid as to refuse to believe it Champagne had to be got Pseldonimov s mother had only one rouble while Pseldonimov himself had not one farthing He had to grovel before his ill natured mother in law to beg for the money for one bottle and then for another They pleaded for the sake of his future position in the service for his career they tried to persuade her She did at last give from her own purse but she forced Pseldonimov to swallow such a cupful of gall and bitterness that more than once he ran into the room where the nuptial couch had been prepared and madly clutching at his hair and trembling all over with impotent rage he buried his head in the bed destined for the joys of paradise No indeed Ivan Ilyitch had no notion of the price paid for the two bottles of Jackson he had drunk that evening What was the horror the misery and even the despair of Pseldonimov when Ivan Ilyitch s visit ended in this unexpected way He had a prospect again of no end of misery and perhaps a night of tears and outcries from his peevish bride and upbraidings from her unreasonable relations Even apart from this his head ached already and there was dizziness and mist before his eyes And here Ivan Ilyitch needed looking after at three o clock at night he had to hunt for a doctor or a carriage to take him home and a carriage it must be for it would be impossible to let an ordinary cabby take him home in that condition And where could he get the money even for a carriage Madame Mlekopitaev furious that the general had not addressed two words to her and had not even looked at her at supper declared that she had not a farthing Possibly she really had not a farthing Where could he get it What was he to do Yes indeed he had good cause to tear his hair Meanwhile Ivan Ilyitch was moved to a little leather sofa that stood in the dining room While they were clearing the tables and putting them away Pseldonimov was rushing all over the place to borrow money he even tried to get it from the servants but it appeared that nobody had any He even ventured to trouble Akim Petrovitch who had stayed after the other guests But good natured as he was the latter was reduced to such bewilderment and even alarm at the mention of money that he uttered the most unexpected and foolish phrases Another time with pleasure he muttered but now you really must excuse me And taking his cap he ran as fast as he could out of the house Only the good natured youth who had talked about the dream book was any use at all and even that came to nothing He too stayed after the others showing genuine sympathy with Pseldonimov s misfortunes At last Pseldonimov together with his mother and the young man decided in consultation not to send for a doctor but rather to fetch a carriage and take the invalid home and meantime to try certain domestic remedies till the carriage arrived such as moistening his temples and his head with cold water putting ice on his head and so on Pseldonimov s mother undertook this task The friendly youth flew off in search of a carriage As there were not even ordinary cabs to be found on the Petersburg Side at that hour he went off to some livery stables at a distance to wake up the coachmen They began bargaining and declared that five roubles would be little to ask for a carriage at that time of night They agreed to come however for three When at last just before five o clock the young man arrived at Pseldonimov s with the carriage they had changed their minds It appeared that Ivan Ilyitch who was still unconscious had become so seriously unwell was moaning and tossing so terribly that to move him and take him home in such a condition was impossible and actually unsafe What will it lead to next said Pseldonimov utterly disheartened What was to be done A new problem arose if the invalid remained in the house where should he be moved and where could they put him There were only two bedsteads in the house one large double bed in which old Mlekopitaev and his wife slept and another double bed of imitation walnut which had just been purchased and was destined for the newly married couple All the other inhabitants of the house slept on the floor side by side on feather beds for the most part in bad condition and stuffy anything but presentable in fact and even of these the supply was insufficient there was not one to spare Where could the invalid be put A feather bed might perhaps have been found it might in the last resort have been pulled from under some one but where and on what could a bed have been made up It seemed that the bed must be made up in the drawing room for that room was the furthest from the bosom of the family and had a door into the passage But on what could the bed be made Surely not upon chairs We all know that beds can only be made up on chairs for schoolboys when they come home for the week end and it would be terribly lacking in respect to make up a bed in that way for a personage like Ivan Ilyitch What would be said next morning when he found himself lying on chairs Pseldonimov would not hear of that The only alternative was to put him on the bridal couch This bridal couch as we have mentioned already was in a little room that opened out of the dining room on the bedstead was a double mattress actually newly bought first hand clean sheets four pillows in pink calico covered with frilled muslin cases The quilt was of pink satin and it was quilted in patterns Muslin curtains hung down from a golden ring overhead in fact it was all just as it should be and the guests who had all visited the bridal chamber had admired the decoration of it though the bride could not endure Pseldonimov she had several times in the course of the evening run in to have a look at it on the sly What was her indignation her wrath when she learned that they meant to move an invalid suffering from something not unlike a mild attack of cholera to her bridal couch The bride s mother took her part broke into abuse and vowed she would complain to her husband next day but Pseldonimov asserted himself and insisted Ivan Ilyitch was moved into the bridal chamber and a bed was made up on chairs for the young people The bride whimpered would have liked to pinch him but dared not disobey her papa had a crutch with which she was very familiar and she knew that her papa would call her to account next day To console her they carried the pink satin quilt and the pillows in muslin cases into the drawing room At that moment the youth arrived with the carriage and was horribly alarmed that the carriage was not wanted He was left to pay for it himself and he never had as much as a ten kopeck piece Pseldonimov explained that he was utterly bankrupt They tried to parley with the driver But he began to be noisy and even to batter on the shutters How it ended I don t know exactly I believe the youth was carried off to Peski by way of a hostage to Fourth Rozhdensky Street where he hoped to rouse a student who was spending the night at a friend s and to try whether he had any money It was going on for six o clock in the morning when the young people were left alone and shut up in the drawing room Pseldonimov s mother spent the whole night by the bedside of the sufferer She installed herself on a rug on the floor and covered herself with an old coat but could not sleep because she had to get up every minute Ivan Ilyitch had a terrible attack of colic Madame Pseldonimov a woman of courage and greatness of soul undressed him with her own hands took off all his things looked after him as if he were her own son and spent the whole night carrying basins et cetera from the bedroom across the passage and bringing them back again empty And yet the misfortunes of that night were not yet over Not more than ten minutes after the young people had been shut up alone in the drawing room a piercing shriek was suddenly heard not a cry of joy but a shriek of the most sinister kind The screams were followed by a noise a crash as though of the falling of chairs and instantly there burst into the still dark room a perfect crowd of exclaiming and frightened women attired in every kind of deshabille These women were the bride s mother her elder sister abandoning for the moment the sick children and her three aunts even the one with a broken rib dragged herself in Even the cook was there and the German lady who told stories whose own feather bed the best in the house and her only property had been forcibly dragged from under her for the young couple trailed in together with the others All these respectable and sharp eyed ladies had a quarter of an hour before made their way on tiptoe from the kitchen across the passage and were listening in the ante room devoured by unaccountable curiosity Meanwhile some one lighted a candle and a surprising spectacle met the eyes of all The chairs supporting the broad feather bed only at the sides had parted under the weight and the feather bed had fallen between them on the floor The bride was sobbing with anger this time she was mortally offended Pseldonimov morally shattered stood like a criminal caught in a crime He did not even attempt to defend himself Shrieks and exclamations sounded on all sides Pseldonimov s mother ran up at the noise but the bride s mamma on this occasion got the upper hand She began by showering strange and for the most part quite undeserved reproaches such as A nice husband you are after this What are you good for after such a disgrace and so on and at last carried her daughter away from her husband undertaking to bear the full responsibility for doing so with her ferocious husband who would demand an explanation All the others followed her out exclaiming and shaking their heads No one remained with Pseldonimov except his mother who tried to comfort him But he sent her away at once He was beyond consolation He made his way to the sofa and sat down in the most gloomy confusion of mind just as he was barefooted and in nothing but his night attire His thoughts whirled in a tangled criss cross in his mind At times he mechanically looked about the room where only a little while ago the dancers had been whirling madly and in which the cigarette smoke still lingered Cigarette ends and sweet meat papers still littered the slopped and dirty floor The wreck of the nuptial couch and the overturned chairs bore witness to the transitoriness of the fondest and surest earthly hopes and dreams He sat like this almost an hour The most oppressive thoughts kept coming into his mind such as the doubt What was in store for him in the office now He recognised with painful clearness that he would have at all costs to exchange into another department that he could not possibly remain where he was after all that had happened that evening He thought too of Mlekopitaev who would probably make him dance the Cossack dance next day to test his meekness He reflected too that though Mlekopitaev had given fifty roubles for the wedding festivities every farthing of which had been spent he had not thought of giving him the four hundred roubles yet no mention had been made of it in fact And indeed even the house had not been formally made over to him He thought too of his wife who had left him at the most critical moment of his life of the tall officer who had dropped on one knee before her He had noticed that already he thought of the seven devils which according to the testimony of her own father were in possession of his wife and of the crutch in readiness to drive them out Of course he felt equal to bearing a great deal but destiny had let loose such surprises upon him that he might well have doubts of his fortitude So Pseldonimov mused dolefully Meanwhile the candle end was going out its fading light falling straight upon Pseldonimov s profile threw a colossal shadow of it on the wall with a drawn out neck a hooked nose and with two tufts of hair sticking out on his forehead and the back of his head At last when the air was growing cool with the chill of early morning he got up frozen and spiritually numb crawled to the feather bed that was lying between the chairs and without rearranging anything without putting out the candle end without even laying the pillow under his head fell into a leaden deathlike sleep such as the sleep of men condemned to flogging on the morrow must be On the other hand what could be compared with the agonising night spent by Ivan Ilyitch Pralinsky on the bridal couch of the unlucky Pseldonimov For some time headache vomiting and other most unpleasant symptoms did not leave him for one second He was in the torments of hell The faint glimpses of consciousness that visited his brain lighted up such an abyss of horrors such gloomy and revolting pictures that it would have been better for him not to have returned to consciousness Everything was still in a turmoil in his mind however He recognised Pseldonimov s mother for instance heard her gentle admonitions such as Be patient my dear be patient good sir it won t be so bad presently He recognised her but could give no logical explanation of her presence beside him Revolting phantoms haunted him most frequently of all he was haunted by Semyon Ivanitch but looking more intently he saw that it was not Semyon Ivanitch but Pseldonimov s nose He had visions too of the free and easy artist and the officer and the old lady with her face tied up What interested him most of all was the gilt ring which hung over his head through which the curtains hung He could distinguish it distinctly in the dim light of the candle end which lighted up the room and he kept wondering inwardly What was the object of that ring why was it there what did it mean He questioned the old lady several times about it but apparently did not say what he meant and she evidently did not understand it however much he struggled to explain At last by morning the symptoms had ceased and he fell into a sleep a sound sleep without dreams He slept about an hour and when he woke he was almost completely conscious with an insufferable headache and a disgusting taste in his mouth and on his tongue which seemed turned into a piece of cloth He sat up in the bed looked about him and pondered The pale light of morning peeping through the cracks of the shutters in a narrow streak quivered on the wall It was about seven o clock in the morning But when Ivan Ilyitch suddenly grasped the position and recalled all that had happened to him since the evening when he remembered all his adventures at supper the failure of his magnanimous action his speech at table when he realised all at once with horrifying clearness all that might come of this now all that people would say and think of him when he looked round and saw to what a mournful and hideous condition he had reduced the peaceful bridal couch of his clerk oh then such deadly shame such agony overwhelmed him that he uttered a shriek hid his face in his hands and fell back on the pillow in despair A minute later he jumped out of bed saw his clothes carefully folded and brushed on a chair beside him and seizing them and as quickly as he could in desperate haste began putting them on looking round and seeming terribly frightened at something On another chair close by lay his greatcoat and fur cap and his yellow gloves were in his cap He meant to steal away secretly But suddenly the door opened and the elder Madame Pseldonimov walked in with an earthenware jug and basin A towel was hanging over her shoulder She set down the jug and without further conversation told him that he must wash Come my good sir wash you can t go without washing And at that instant Ivan Ilyitch recognised that if there was one being in the whole world whom he need not fear and before whom he need not feel ashamed it was that old lady He washed And long afterwards at painful moments of his life he recalled among other pangs of remorse all the circumstances of that waking and that earthenware basin and the china jug filled with cold water in which there were still floating icicles and the oval cake of soap at fifteen kopecks in pink paper with letters embossed on it evidently bought for the bridal pair though it fell to Ivan Ilyitch to use it and the old lady with the linen towel over her left shoulder The cold water refreshed him he dried his face and without even thanking his sister of mercy he snatched up his hat flung over his shoulders the coat handed to him by Pseldonimov and crossing the passage and the kitchen where the cat was already mewing and the cook sitting up in her bed staring after him with greedy curiosity ran out into the yard into the street and threw himself into the first sledge he came across It was a frosty morning A chilly yellow fog still hid the house and everything Ivan Ilyitch turned up his collar He thought that every one was looking at him that they were all recognising him all For eight days he did not leave the house or show himself at the office He was ill wretchedly ill but more morally than physically He lived through a perfect hell in those days and they must have been reckoned to his account in the other world There were moments when he thought of becoming a monk and entering a monastery There really were His imagination indeed took special excursions during that period He pictured subdued subterranean singing an open coffin living in a solitary cell forests and caves but when he came to himself he recognised almost at once that all this was dreadful nonsense and exaggeration and was ashamed of this nonsense Then began attacks of moral agony on the theme of his existence manquee Then shame flamed up again in his soul took complete possession of him at once consumed him like fire and re opened his wounds He shuddered as pictures of all sorts rose before his mind What would people say about him what would they think when he walked into his office What a whisper would dog his steps for a whole year ten years his whole life His story would go down to posterity He sometimes fell into such dejection that he was ready to go straight off to Semyon Ivanovitch and ask for his forgiveness and friendship He did not even justify himself there was no limit to his blame of himself He could find no extenuating circumstances and was ashamed of trying to He had thoughts too of resigning his post at once and devoting himself to human happiness as a simple citizen in solitude In any case he would have completely to change his whole circle of acquaintances and so thoroughly as to eradicate all memory of himself Then the thought occurred to him that this too was nonsense and that if he adopted greater severity with his subordinates it might all be set right Then he began to feel hope and courage again At last at the expiration of eight days of hesitation and agonies he felt that he could not endure to be in uncertainty any longer and un beau matin he made up his mind to go to the office He had pictured a thousand times over his return to the office as he sat at home in misery With horror and conviction he told himself that he would certainly hear behind him an ambiguous whisper would see ambiguous faces would intercept ominous smiles What was his surprise when nothing of the sort happened He was greeted with respect he was met with bows every one was grave every one was busy His heart was filled with joy as he made his way to his own room He set to work at once with the utmost gravity he listened to some reports and explanations settled doubtful points He felt as though he had never explained knotty points and given his decisions so intelligently so judiciously as that morning He saw that they were satisfied with him that they respected him that he was treated with respect The most thin skinned sensitiveness could not have discovered anything At last Akim Petrovitch made his appearance with some document The sight of him sent a stab to Ivan Ilyitch s heart but only for an instant He went into the business with Akim Petrovitch talked with dignity explained things and showed him what was to be done The only thing he noticed was that he avoided looking at Akim Petrovitch for any length of time or rather Akim Petrovitch seemed afraid of catching his eye but at last Akim Petrovitch had finished and began to collect his papers And there is one other matter he began as dryly as he could the clerk Pseldonimov s petition to be transferred to another department His Excellency Semyon Ivanovitch Shipulenko has promised him a post He begs your gracious assent your Excellency Oh so he is being transferred said Ivan Ilyitch and he felt as though a heavy weight had rolled off his heart He glanced at Akim Petrovitch and at that instant their eyes met Certainly I for my part I will use answered Ivan Ilyitch I am ready Akim Petrovitch evidently wanted to slip away as quickly as he could But in a rush of generous feeling Ivan Ilyitch determined to speak out Apparently some inspiration had come to him again Tell him he began bending a candid glance full of profound meaning upon Akim Petrovitch tell Pseldonimov that I feel no ill will no I do not That on the contrary I am ready to forget all that is past to forget it all But all at once Ivan Ilyitch broke off looking with wonder at the strange behaviour of Akim Petrovitch who suddenly seemed transformed from a sensible person into a fearful fool Instead of listening and hearing Ivan Ilyitch to the end he suddenly flushed crimson in the silliest way began with positively unseemly haste making strange little bows and at the same time edging towards the door His whole appearance betrayed a desire to sink through the floor or more accurately to get back to his table as quickly as possible Ivan Ilyitch left alone got up from his chair in confusion he looked in the looking glass without noticing his face No severity severity and nothing but severity he whispered almost unconsciously and suddenly a vivid flush over spread his face He felt suddenly more ashamed more weighed down than he had been in the most insufferable moments of his eight days of tribulation I did break down he said to himself and sank helplessly into his chair ANOTHER MAN S WIFE OR THE HUSBAND UNDER THE BED AN EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE I Be so kind sir allow me to ask you The gentleman so addressed started and looked with some alarm at the gentleman in raccoon furs who had accosted him so abruptly at eight o clock in the evening in the street We all know that if a Petersburg gentleman suddenly in the street speaks to another gentleman with whom he is unacquainted the second gentleman is invariably alarmed And so the gentleman addressed started and was somewhat alarmed Excuse me for troubling you said the gentleman in raccoon but I I really don t know you will pardon me no doubt you see I am a little upset Only then the young man in the wadded overcoat observed that this gentleman in the raccoon furs certainly was upset His wrinkled face was rather pale his voice was trembling He was evidently in some confusion of mind his words did not flow easily from his tongue and it could be seen that it cost him a terrible effort to present a very humble request to a personage possibly his inferior in rank or condition in spite of the urgent necessity of addressing his request to somebody And indeed the request was in any case unseemly undignified strange coming from a man who had such a dignified fur coat such a respectable jacket of a superb dark green colour and such distinguished decorations adorning that jacket It was evident that the gentleman in raccoon was himself confused by all this so that at last he could not stand it but made up his mind to suppress his emotion and politely to put an end to the unpleasant position he had himself brought about Excuse me I am not myself but it is true you don t know me forgive me for disturbing you I have changed my mind Here from politeness he raised his hat and hurried off But allow me The little gentleman had however vanished into the darkness leaving the gentleman in the wadded overcoat in a state of stupefaction What a queer fellow thought the gentleman in the wadded overcoat After wondering as was only natural and recovering at last from his stupefaction he bethought him of his own affairs and began walking to and fro staring intently at the gates of a house with an endless number of storeys A fog was beginning to come on and the young man was somewhat relieved at it for his walking up and down was less noticeable in the fog though indeed no one could have noticed him but some cabman who had been waiting all day without a fare Excuse me The young man started again again the gentleman in raccoon was standing before him Excuse me again he began but you you are no doubt an honourable man Take no notice of my social position but I am getting muddled look at it as man to man you see before you sir a man craving a humble favour If I can What do you want You imagine perhaps that I am asking for money said the mysterious gentleman with a wry smile laughing hysterically and turning pale Oh dear no No I see that I am tiresome to you Excuse me I cannot bear myself consider that you are seeing a man in an agitated condition almost of insanity and do not draw any conclusion But to the point to the point responded the young man nodding his head encouragingly and impatiently Now think of that A young man like you reminding me to keep to the point as though I were some heedless boy I must certainly be doting How do I seem to you in my degrading position Tell me frankly The young man was overcome with confusion and said nothing Allow me to ask you openly have you not seen a lady That is all that I have to ask you the gentleman in the raccoon coat said resolutely at last Lady Yes a lady Yes I have seen but I must say lots of them have passed Just so answered the mysterious gentleman with a bitter smile I am muddled I did not mean to ask that excuse me I meant to say haven t you seen a lady in a fox fur cape in a dark velvet hood and a black veil No I haven t noticed one like that no I think I haven t seen one Well in that case excuse me The young man wanted to ask a question but the gentleman in raccoon vanished again again he left his patient listener in a state of stupefaction Well the devil take him thought the young man in the wadded overcoat evidently troubled With annoyance he turned up his beaver collar and began cautiously walking to and fro again before the gates of the house of many storeys He was raging inwardly Why doesn t she come out he thought It will soon be eight o clock The town clock struck eight Oh devil take you Excuse me Excuse me for speaking like that but you came upon me so suddenly that you quite frightened me said the young man frowning and apologising Here I am again I must strike you as tiresome and queer Be so good as to explain at once without more ado I don t know what it is you want You are in a hurry Do you see I will tell you everything openly without wasting words It cannot be helped Circumstances sometimes bring together people of very different characters But I see you are impatient young man So here though I really don t know how to tell you I am looking for a lady I have made up my mind to tell you all about it You see I must know where that lady has gone Who she is I imagine there is no need for you to know her name young man Well well what next What next But what a tone you take with me Excuse me but perhaps I have offended you by calling you young man but I had nothing in short if you are willing to do me a very great service here it is a lady that is I mean a gentlewoman of a very good family of my acquaintance I have been commissioned I have no family you see Oh Put yourself in my position young man ah I ve done it again excuse me I keep calling you young man Every minute is precious Only fancy that lady but cannot you tell me who lives in this house But lots of people live here Yes that is you are perfectly right answered the gentleman in raccoon giving a slight laugh for the sake of good manners I feel I am rather muddled But why do you take that tone You see I admit frankly that I am muddled and however haughty you are you have seen enough of my humiliation to satisfy you I say a lady of honourable conduct that is of light tendencies excuse me I am so confused it is as though I were speaking of literature Paul de Kock is supposed to be of light tendencies and all the trouble comes from him you see The young man looked compassionately at the gentleman in raccoon who seemed in a hopeless muddle and pausing stared at him with a meaningless smile and with a trembling hand for no apparent reason gripped the lappet of his wadded overcoat You ask who lives here said the young man stepping back a little Yes you told me lots of people live here Here I know that Sofya Ostafyevna lives here too the young man brought out in a low and even commiserating tone There you see you see You know something young man I assure you I don t I know nothing I judged from your troubled air I have just learned from the cook that she does come here but you are on the wrong tack that is with Sofya Ostafyevna she does not know her No Oh I beg your pardon then I see this is of no interest to you young man said the queer man with bitter irony Listen said the young man hesitating I really don t understand why you are in such a state but tell me frankly I suppose you are being deceived The young man smiled approvingly We shall understand one another anyway he added and his whole person loftily betrayed an inclination to make a half bow You crush me But I frankly confess that is just it but it happens to every one I am deeply touched by your sympathy To be sure among young men though I am not young but you know habit a bachelor life among bachelors we all know Oh yes we all know we all know But in what way can I be of assistance to you Why look here admitting a visit to Sofya Ostafyevna though I don t know for a fact where the lady has gone I only know that she is in that house but seeing you walking up and down and I am walking up and down on the same side myself I thought you see I am waiting for that lady I know that she is there I should like to meet her and explain to her how shocking and improper it is In fact you understand me H m Well I am not acting for myself don t imagine it it is another man s wife Her husband is standing over there on the Voznesensky Bridge he wants to catch her but he doesn t dare he is still loath to believe it as every husband is Here the gentleman in raccoon made an effort to smile I am a friend of his you can see for yourself I am a person held in some esteem I could not be what you take me for Oh of course Well well So you see I am on the look out for her The task has been entrusted to me the unhappy husband But I know that the young lady is sly Paul de Kock for ever under her pillow I am certain she scurries off somewhere on the sly I must confess the cook told me she comes here I rushed off like a madman as soon as I heard the news I want to catch her I have long had suspicions and so I wanted to ask you you are walking here you you I don t know Come what is it you want Yes I have not the honour of your acquaintance I do not venture to inquire who and what you may be Allow me to introduce myself anyway glad to meet you The gentleman quivering with agitation warmly shook the young man s hand I ought to have done this to begin with he added but I have lost all sense of good manners The gentleman in raccoon could not stand still as he talked he kept looking about him uneasily fidgeted with his feet and like a drowning man clutched at the young man s hand You see he went on I meant to address you in a friendly way Excuse the freedom I meant to ask you to walk along the other side and down the side street where there is a back entrance I too on my side will walk from the front entrance so that we cannot miss her I m afraid of missing her by myself I don t want to miss her When you see her stop her and shout to me But I m mad Only now I see the foolishness and impropriety of my suggestion No why no It s all right Don t make excuses for me I am so upset I have never been in such a state before As though I were being tried for my life I must own indeed I will be straightforward and honourable with you young man I actually thought you might be the lover That is to put it simply you want to know what I am doing here You are an honourable man my dear sir I am far from supposing that you are he I will not insult you with such a suspicion but give me your word of honour that you are not the lover Oh very well I ll give you my word of honour that I am a lover but not of your wife otherwise I shouldn t be here in the street but should be with her now Wife Who told you she was my wife young man I am a bachelor I that is I am a lover myself You told me there is a husband on Voznesensky Bridge Of course of course I am talking too freely but there are other ties And you know young man a certain lightness of character that is Yes yes to be sure to be sure That is I am not her husband at all Oh no doubt But I tell you frankly that in reassuring you now I want to set my own mind at rest and that is why I am candid with you you are upsetting me and in my way I promise that I will call you But I most humbly beg you to move further away and let me alone I am waiting for some one too Certainly certainly I will move further off I respect the passionate impatience of your heart Oh how well I understand you at this moment Oh all right all right Till we meet again But excuse me young man here I am again I don t know how to say it give me your word of honour once more as a gentleman that you are not her lover Oh mercy on us One more question the last do you know the surname of the husband of your that is I mean the lady who is the object of your devotion Of course I do it is not your name and that is all about it Why how do you know my name But I say you had better go you are losing time she might go away a thousand times Why what do you want Your lady s in a fox cape and a hood while mine is wearing a plaid cloak and a pale blue velvet hat What more do you want What else A pale blue velvet hat She has a plaid cloak and a pale blue velvet hat cried the pertinacious man instantly turning back again Oh hang it all Why that may well be And indeed my lady does not come here Where is she then your lady You want to know that What is it to you I must own I am still Tfoo Mercy on us Why you have no sense of decency none at all Well my lady has friends here on the third storey looking into the street Why do you

well then General Polovitsyn You don t say so No that is not the same Oh damnation damnation Not the same No not the same Both were silent looking at each other in perplexity Why are you looking at me like that exclaimed the young man shaking off his stupefaction and air of uncertainty with vexation The gentleman was in a fluster I I must own Come allow me allow me let us talk more sensibly now It concerns us both Explain to me whom do you know there You mean who are my friends Yes your friends Well you see you see I see from your eyes that I have guessed right Hang it all No no hang it all Are you blind Why I am standing here before you I am not with her Oh well I don t care whether you say so or not Twice in his fury the young man turned on his heel with a contemptuous wave of his hand Oh I meant nothing I assure you As an honourable man I will tell you all about it At first my wife used to come here alone They are relatives of hers I had no suspicions yesterday I met his Excellency he told me that he had moved three weeks ago from here to another flat and my wi that is not mine but somebody else s the husband s on the Voznesensky Bridge that lady had told me that she was with them

in alarm Oh hang it What is it to me that you are in terror and in alarm Ah Over there some one flitted by over there Where where You just shout Ivan Andreyitch and I will run All right all right Oh

I ll take you Oh I ll sit on the other side off Now mind you drive quickly The cab drove off Where did they come from Oh dear oh dear Hadn t we better go there Where Why to Bobynitsyn s No that s out

noodle That is do you know who That is you mean to say that I am the husband said the gentleman in raccoon stepping back as though he were scalded with boiling water Hush hold your tongue Do you hear It is she No Tfoo how dark it is There was a hush a sound was audible in Bobynitsyn s flat Why should we quarrel sir whispered the gentleman in raccoon But you took offence yourself damn it all But you drove me out of all patience Hold your tongue You must admit that you are a very young man Hold your tongue Of course I share your idea that a husband in such a position is a noodle Oh will you hold your tongue Oh But why such savage persecution of the unfortunate husband It is she But at that moment the sound ceased Is it she It is it is it is But why are you you worrying about it It is not your trouble My dear sir my dear sir muttered the gentleman in raccoon turning pale and gulping I am of course greatly agitated you can see for yourself my abject position but now it s night of course

it is somebody else s wife Poor fellow I assure you I know him very intimately if you will allow me I will tell you all about it I am a great friend of his as you can see for yourself or I shouldn t

the caprice of coquetry You must see that No I am going to be married he said domestic bliss Here s domestic bliss for you In old days he deceived other husbands now he is drinking the cup you must excuse me but this explanation was absolutely necessary He is an unfortunate man and is drinking the cup now At this point the gentleman in raccoon gave such a gulp that he seemed to be sobbing in earnest Ah damnation take them all There are plenty of fools But who are you The young man ground his teeth in anger Well you must admit after this that I have been gentlemanly and open with you and you take such a tone No excuse me what is your name Why do you want to know my name Ah I cannot tell you my name Do you know Shabrin the young man said quickly Shabrin Yes Shabrin Ah Saying this the gentleman in the wadded overcoat mimicked the gentleman in raccoon Do you understand No what Shabrin answered the gentleman in raccoon in a fluster He s not Shabrin he is a very respectable man I can excuse your discourtesy due to the tortures of jealousy He s a scoundrel a mercenary soul a rogue that takes bribes he steals government money He ll be had up for it before long Excuse me said the gentleman in raccoon turning pale you don t know him I see that you don t know him at all No I don t know him personally but I know him from others who are in close touch with him From what others sir I am agitated as you see A fool A jealous idiot He doesn t look after his wife That s what he is if you like to know Excuse me young man you are grievously mistaken Oh Oh A sound was heard in Bobynitsyn s flat A door was opened voices were heard Oh that s not she I recognise her voice I understand it all now this is not she said the gentleman in raccoon turning as white as a sheet Hush The young man leaned against the wall My dear sir I am off It is not she I am glad to say All right Be off then Why are you staying then What s that to you The door opened and the gentleman in raccoon could not refrain from dashing headlong downstairs A man and a woman walked by the young man and his heart stood still He heard a familiar feminine voice and then a husky male voice utterly unfamiliar Never mind I will order the sledge said the husky voice Oh yes yes very well do It will be here directly The lady was left alone Glafira Where are your vows cried the young man in the wadded overcoat clutching the lady s arm Oh who is it It s you Tvorogov My goodness What are you doing here Who is it you have been with here Why my husband Go away go away he ll be coming out directly from in there from the Polovitsyns Go away for goodness sake go away It s three weeks since the Polovitsyns moved I know all about it Aie The lady dashed downstairs The young man overtook her Who told you asked the lady Your husband madam Ivan Andreyitch he is here before you madam Ivan Andreyitch was indeed standing at the front door Aie it s you cried the gentleman in raccoon Ah C est vous cried Glafira Petrovna rushing up to him with unfeigned delight Oh dear you can t think what has been happening to me I went to see the Polovitsyns only fancy you know they are living now by Izmailovsky Bridge I told you do you remember I took a sledge from there The horses took fright and bolted they broke the sledge and I was thrown out about a hundred yards from here the coachman was taken up I was in despair Fortunately Monsieur Tvorogov What Monsieur Tvorogov was more like a fossil than like Monsieur Tvorogov Monsieur Tvorogov saw me here and undertook to escort me but now you are here and I can only express my warm gratitude to you Ivan Ilyitch The lady gave her hand to the stupefied Ivan Ilyitch and almost pinched instead of pressing it Monsieur Tvorogov an acquaintance of mine it was at the Skorlupovs ball we had the pleasure of meeting I believe I told you don t you remember Koko Oh of course of course Ah I remember said the gentleman in raccoon addressed as Koko Delighted delighted And he warmly pressed the hand of Monsieur Tvorogov Who is it What does it mean I am waiting said a husky voice Before the group stood a gentleman of extraordinary height he took out a lorgnette and looked intently at the gentleman in the raccoon coat Ah Monsieur Bobynitsyn twittered the lady Where have you come from What a meeting Only fancy I have just had an upset in a sledge but here is my husband Jean Monsieur Bobynitsyn at the Karpovs ball Ah delighted very much delighted But I ll take a carriage at once my dear Yes do Jean do I still feel frightened I am all of a tremble I feel quite giddy At the masquerade to night she whispered to Tvorogov Good bye good bye mister Bobynitsyn We shall meet to morrow at the Karpovs ball most likely No excuse me I shall not be there to morrow I don t know about to morrow if it is like this now mister Bobynitsyn muttered something between his teeth made a scrape with his boot got into his sledge and drove away A carriage drove up the lady got into it The gentleman in the raccoon coat stopped seemed incapable of making a movement and gazed blankly at the gentleman in the wadded coat The gentleman in the wadded coat smiled rather foolishly I don t know Excuse me delighted to make your acquaintance answered the young man bowing with curiosity and a little intimidated Delighted delighted I think you have lost your galosh I oh yes thank you thank you I keep meaning to get rubber ones The foot gets so hot in rubbers said the young man apparently with immense interest Jean Are you coming It does make it hot Coming directly darling we are having an interesting conversation Precisely so as you say it does make the foot hot But excuse me I Oh certainly Delighted very much delighted to make your acquaintance The gentleman in raccoon got into the carriage the carriage set off the young man remained standing looking after it in astonishment II The following evening there was a performance of some sort at the Italian opera Ivan Andreyitch burst into the theatre like a bomb Such furore such a passion for music had never been observed in him before It was known for a positive fact anyway that Ivan Andreyitch used to be exceeding fond of a nap for an hour or two at the Italian opera he even declared on several occasions how sweet and pleasant it was Why the prima donna he used to say to his friends mews a lullaby to you like a little white kitten But it was a long time ago last season that he used to say this now alas even at home Ivan Andreyitch did not sleep at nights Nevertheless he burst into the crowded opera house like a bomb Even the conductor started suspiciously at the sight of him and glanced out of the corner of his eye at his side pocket in the full expectation of seeing the hilt of a dagger hidden there in readiness It must be observed that there were at that time two parties each supporting the superior claims of its favourite prima donna They were called the sists and the nists Both parties were so devoted to music that the conductors actually began to be apprehensive of some startling manifestation of the passion for the good and the beautiful embodied in the two prima donnas This was how it was that looking at this youthful dash into the parterre of a grey haired senior though indeed he was not actually grey haired but a man about fifty rather bald and altogether of respectable appearance the conductor could not help recalling the lofty judgment of Hamlet Prince of Denmark upon the evil example set by age to youth and as we have mentioned above looking out of the corner of his eye at the gentleman s side pocket in the expectation of seeing a dagger But there was a pocket book and nothing else there Darting into the theatre Ivan Andreyitch instantly scanned all the boxes of the second tier and oh horror His heart stood still she was here She was sitting in the box General Polovitsyn with his wife and sister in law was there too The general s adjutant an extremely alert young man was there too there was a civilian too Ivan Andreyitch strained his attention and his eyesight but oh horror The civilian treacherously concealed himself behind the adjutant and remained in the darkness of obscurity She was here and yet she had said she would not be here It was this duplicity for some time displayed in every step Glafira Petrovna took which crushed Ivan Andreyitch This civilian youth reduced him at last to utter despair He sank down in his stall utterly overwhelmed Why one may ask It was a very simple matter It must be observed that Ivan Andreyitch s stall was close to the baignoire and to make matters worse the treacherous box in the second tier was exactly above his stall so that to his intense annoyance he was utterly unable to see what was going on over his head At which he raged and got as hot as a samovar The whole of the first act passed unnoticed by him that is he did not hear a single note of it It is maintained that what is good in music is that musical impressions can be made to fit any mood The man who rejoices finds joy in its strains while he who grieves finds sorrow in it a regular tempest was howling in Ivan Andreyitch s ears To add to his vexation such terrible voices were shouting behind him before him and on both sides of him that Ivan Andreyitch s heart was torn At last the act was over But at the instant when the curtain was falling our hero had an adventure such as no pen can describe It sometimes happens that a playbill flies down from the upper boxes When the play is dull and the audience is yawning this is quite an event for them They watch with particular interest the flight of the extremely soft paper from the upper gallery and take pleasure in watching its zigzagging journey down to the very stalls where it infallibly settles on some head which is quite unprepared to receive it It is certainly very interesting to watch the embarrassment of the head for the head is invariably embarrassed I am indeed always in terror over the ladies opera glasses which usually lie on the edge of the boxes I am constantly fancying that they will fly down on some unsuspecting head But I perceive that this tragic observation is out of place here and so I shall send it to the columns of those newspapers which are filled with advice warnings against swindling tricks against unconscientiousness hints for getting rid of beetles if you have them in the house recommendations of the celebrated mister Princhipi sworn foe of all beetles in the world not only Russian but even foreign such as Prussian cockroaches and so on But Ivan Andreyitch had an adventure which has never hitherto been described There flew down on his as already stated somewhat bald head not a playbill I confess I am actually ashamed to say what did fly down upon his head because I am really loath to remark that on the respectable and bare that is partly hairless head of the jealous and irritated Ivan Andreyitch there settled such an immoral object as a scented love letter Poor Ivan Andreyitch utterly unprepared for this unforeseen and hideous occurrence started as though he had caught upon his head a mouse or some other wild beast That the note was a love letter of that there could be no mistake It was written on scented paper just as love letters are written in novels and folded up so as to be treacherously small so that it might be slipped into a lady s glove It had probably fallen by accident at the moment it had been handed to her The playbill might have been asked for for instance and the note deftly folded in the playbill was being put into her hands but an instant perhaps an accidental nudge from the adjutant extremely adroit in his apologies for his awkwardness and the note had slipped from a little hand that trembled with confusion and the civilian youth stretching out his impatient hand received instead of the note the empty playbill and did not know what to do with it A strange and unpleasant incident for him no doubt but you must admit that for Ivan Andreyitch it was still more unpleasant Predestine he murmured breaking into a cold sweat and squeezing the note in his hands predestine The bullet finds the guilty man the thought flashed through his mind No that s not right In what way am I guilty But there is another proverb Once out of luck never out of trouble But it was not enough that there was a ringing in his ears and a dizziness in his head at this sudden incident Ivan Andreyitch sat petrified in his chair as the saying is more dead than alive He was persuaded that his adventure had been observed on all sides although at that moment the whole theatre began to be filled with uproar and calls of encore He sat overwhelmed with confusion flushing crimson and not daring to raise his eyes as though some unpleasant surprise something out of keeping with the brilliant assembly had happened to him At last he ventured to lift his eyes Charmingly sung he observed to a dandy sitting on his left side The dandy who was in the last stage of enthusiasm clapping his hands and still more actively stamping with his feet gave Ivan Andreyitch a cursory and absent minded glance and immediately putting up his hands like a trumpet to his mouth so as to be more audible shouted the prima donna s name Ivan Andreyitch who had never heard such a roar was delighted He has noticed nothing he thought and turned round but the stout gentleman who was sitting behind him had turned round too and with his back to him was scrutinising the boxes through his opera glass He is all right too thought Ivan Andreyitch In front of course nothing had been seen Timidly and with a joyous hope in his heart he stole a glance at the baignoire near which was his stall and started with the most unpleasant sensation A lovely lady was sitting there who holding her handkerchief to her mouth and leaning back in her chair was laughing as though in hysterics Ugh these women murmured Ivan Andreyitch and treading on people s feet he made for the exit Now I ask my readers to decide I beg them to judge between me and Ivan Andreyitch Was he right at that moment The Grand Theatre as we all know contains four tiers of boxes and a fifth row above the gallery Why must he assume that the note had fallen from one particular box from that very box and no other Why not for instance from the gallery where there are often ladies too But passion is an exception to every rule and jealousy is the most exceptional of all passions Ivan Andreyitch rushed into the foyer stood by the lamp broke the seal and read To day immediately after the performance in G Street at the corner of X Lane K buildings on the third floor the first on the right from the stairs The front entrance Be there sans faute for God s sake Ivan Andreyitch did not know the handwriting but he had no doubt it was an assignation To track it out to catch it and nip the mischief in the bud was Ivan Andreyitch s first idea The thought occurred to him to unmask the infamy at once on the spot but how could it be done Ivan Andreyitch even ran up to the second row of boxes but judiciously came back again He was utterly unable to decide where to run Having nothing clear he could do he ran round to the other side and looked through the open door of somebody else s box at the opposite side of the theatre Yes it was so it was Young ladies and young men were sitting in all the seats vertically one above another in all the five tiers The note might have fallen from all tiers at once for Ivan Andreyitch suspected all of them of being in a plot against him But nothing made him any better no probabilities of any sort The whole of the second act he was running up and down all the corridors and could find no peace of mind anywhere He would have dashed into the box office in hope of finding from the attendant there the names of the persons who had taken boxes on all the four tiers but the box office was shut At last there came an outburst of furious shouting and applause The performance was over Calls for the singers began and two voices from the top gallery were particularly deafening the leaders of the opposing factions But they were not what mattered to Ivan Andreyitch Already thoughts of what he was to do next flitted through his mind He put on his overcoat and rushed off to G Street to surprise them there to catch them unawares to unmask them and in general to behave somewhat more energetically than he had done the day before He soon found the house and was just going in at the front door when the figure of a dandy in an overcoat darted forward right in front of him passed him and went up the stairs to the third storey It seemed to Ivan Andreyitch that this was the same dandy though he had not been able at the time to distinguish his features in the theatre His heart stood still The dandy was two flights of stairs ahead of him At last he heard a door opened on the third floor and opened without the ringing of a bell as though the visitor was expected The young man disappeared into the flat Ivan Andreyitch mounted to the third floor before there was time to shut the door He meant to stand at the door to reflect prudently on his next step to be rather cautious and then to determine upon some decisive course of action but at that very minute a carriage rumbled up to the entrance the doors were flung open noisily and heavy footsteps began ascending to the third storey to the sound of coughing and clearing of the throat Ivan Andreyitch could not stand his ground and walked into the flat with all the majesty of an injured husband A servant maid rushed to meet him much agitated then a man servant appeared But to stop Ivan Andreyitch was impossible He flew in like a bomb and crossing two dark rooms suddenly found himself in a bedroom facing a lovely young lady who was trembling all over with alarm and gazing at him in utter horror as though she could not understand what was happening around her At that instant there was a sound in the adjoining room of heavy footsteps coming straight towards the bedroom they were the same footsteps that had been mounting the stairs Goodness It is my husband cried the lady clasping her hands and turning whiter than her dressing gown Ivan Andreyitch felt that he had come to the wrong place that he had made a silly childish blunder that he had acted without due consideration that he had not been sufficiently cautious on the landing But there was no help for it The door was already opening already the heavy husband that is if he could be judged by his footsteps was coming into the room I don t know what Ivan Andreyitch took himself to be at that moment I don t know what prevented him from confronting the husband telling him that he had made a mistake confessing that he had unintentionally behaved in the most unseemly way making his apologies and vanishing not of course with flying colours not of course with glory but at any rate departing in an open and gentlemanly manner But no Ivan Andreyitch again behaved like a boy as though he considered himself a Don Juan or a Lovelace He first hid himself behind the curtain of the bed and finally feeling utterly dejected and hopeless he dropped on the floor and senselessly crept under the bed Terror had more influence on him than reason and Ivan Andreyitch himself an injured husband or at any rate a husband who considered himself such could not face meeting another husband but was afraid to wound him by his presence Be this as it may he found himself under the bed though he had no idea how it had come to pass But what was most surprising the lady made no opposition She did not cry out on seeing an utterly unknown elderly gentleman seek a refuge under her bed Probably she was so alarmed that she was deprived of all power of speech The husband walked in gasping and clearing his throat said good evening to his wife in a singsong elderly voice and flopped into an easy chair as though he had just been carrying up a load of wood There was a sound of a hollow and prolonged cough Ivan Andreyitch transformed from a ferocious tiger to a lamb timid and meek as a mouse before a cat scarcely dared to breathe for terror though he might have known from his own experience that not all injured husbands bite But this idea did not enter his head either from lack of consideration or from agitation of some sort Cautiously softly feeling his way he began to get right under the bed so as to lie more comfortably there What was his amazement when with his hand he felt an object which to his intense amazement stirred and in its turn seized his hand Under the bed there was another person Who s this whispered Ivan Andreyitch Well I am not likely to tell you who I am whispered the strange man Lie still and keep quiet if you have made a mess of things But I say Hold your tongue And the extra gentleman for one was quite enough under the bed the extra gentleman squeezed Ivan Andreyitch s hand in his fist so that the latter almost shrieked with pain My dear sir Sh Then don t pinch me so or I shall scream All right scream away try it on Ivan Andreyitch flushed with shame The unknown gentleman was sulky and ill humoured Perhaps it was a man who had suffered more than once from the persecutions of fate and had more than once been in a tight place but Ivan Andreyitch was a novice and could not breathe in his constricted position The blood rushed to his head However there was no help for it he had to lie on his face Ivan Andreyitch submitted and was silent I have been to see Pavel Ivanitch my love began the husband We sat down to a game of preference Khee khee khee he had a fit of coughing Yes khee So my back khee Bother it khee khee khee And the old gentleman became engrossed in his cough My back he brought out at last with tears in his eyes my spine began to ache A damned haemorrhoid I can t stand nor sit or sit Akkhee khee khee And it seemed as though the cough that followed was destined to last longer than the old gentleman in possession of it The old gentleman grumbled something in its intervals but it was utterly impossible to make out a word Dear sir for goodness sake move a little whispered the unhappy Ivan Andreyitch How can I There s no room But you must admit that it is impossible for me It is the first time that I have found myself in such a nasty position And I in such unpleasant society But young man Hold your tongue Hold my tongue You are very uncivil young man If I am not mistaken you are very young I am your senior Hold your tongue My dear sir You are forgetting yourself You don t know to whom you are talking To a gentleman lying under the bed But I was taken by surprise a mistake while in your case if I am not mistaken immorality That s where you are mistaken My dear sir I am older than you I tell you Sir we are in the same boat you know I beg you not to take hold of my face Sir I can t tell one thing from another Excuse me but I have no room You shouldn t be so fat Heavens I have never been in such a degrading position Yes one couldn t be brought more low Sir sir I don t know who you are I don t understand how this came about but I am here by mistake I am not what you think I shouldn t think about you at all if you didn t shove But hold your tongue do Sir if you don t move a little I shall have a stroke you will have to answer for my death I assure you I am a respectable man I am the father of a family I really cannot be in such a position You thrust yourself into the position Come move a little I ve made room for you I can t do more Noble young man Dear sir I see I was mistaken about you said Ivan Andreyitch in a transport of gratitude for the space allowed him and stretching out his cramped limbs I understand your constricted condition but there s no help for it I see you think ill of me Allow me to redeem my reputation in your eyes allow me to tell you who I am I have come here against my will I assure you I am not here with the object you imagine I am in a terrible fright Oh do shut up Understand that if we are overheard it will be the worse for us Sh He is talking The old gentleman s cough did in fact seem to be over I tell you what my love he wheezed in the most lachrymose chant I tell you what my love khee khee Oh what an affliction Fedosey Ivanovitch said to me You should try drinking yarrow tea he said to me do you hear my love Yes dear Yes that was what he said You should try drinking yarrow tea he said I told him I had put on leeches But he said No Alexandr Demyanovitch yarrow tea is better it s a laxative I tell you Khee khee Oh dear What do you think my love Khee Oh my God Khee khee Had I better try yarrow tea Khee khee khee Oh Khee and so on I think it would be just as well to try that remedy said his wife Yes it would be You may be in consumption he said Khee khee And I told him it was gout and irritability of the stomach Khee khee But he would have it that it might be consumption What do you think khee khee What do you think my love is it consumption My goodness what are you talking about Why consumption You had better undress and go to bed now my love khee khee I ve caught a cold in my head to day Ouf said Ivan Andreyitch For God s sake do move a little I really don t know what is the matter with you can t you lie still You are exasperated against me young man you want to wound me I see that You are I suppose this lady s lover Shut up I will not shut up I won t allow you to order me about You are no doubt her lover If we are discovered I am not to blame in any way I know nothing about it If you don t hold your tongue said the young man grinding his teeth I will say that you brought me here I ll say that you are my uncle who has dissipated his fortune Then they won t imagine I am this lady s lover anyway Sir you are amusing yourself at my expense You are exhausting my patience Hush or I will make you hush You are a curse to me Come tell me what you are here for If you were not here I could lie here somehow till morning and then get away But I can t lie here till morning I am a respectable man I have family ties of course What do you think surely he is not going to spend the night here Who Why this old gentleman Of course he will All husbands aren t like you Some of them spend their nights at home My dear sir my dear sir cried Ivan Andreyitch turning cold with terror I assure you I spend my nights at home too and this is the first time but my God I see you know me Who are you young man Tell me at once I beseech you from disinterested friendship who are you Listen I shall resort to violence But allow me allow me sir to tell you allow me to explain all this horrid business I won t listen to any explanation I don t want to know anything about it Be silent or But I cannot A slight skirmish took place under the bed and Ivan Andreyitch subsided My love it sounds as though there were cats hissing Cats What will you imagine next Evidently the lady did not know what to talk to her husband about She was so upset that she could not pull herself together Now she started and pricked up her ears What cats Cats my love The other day I went into my study and there was the tom cat in my study and hissing shoo shoo shoo I said to him What is it pussy and he went shoo shoo shoo again as though he were whispering I thought Merciful heavens isn t he hissing as a sign of my death What nonsense you are talking to day You ought to be ashamed really Never mind don t be cross my love I see you don t like to think of me dying I didn t mean it But you had better undress and get to bed my love and I ll sit here while you go to bed For goodness sake leave off afterwards Well don t be cross don t be cross but really I think there must be mice here Why first cats and then mice I really don t know what is the matter with you Oh I am all right Khee I khee Never mind khee khee khee khee Oh Lord have mercy on me khee You hear you are making such an upset that he hears you whispers the young man But if you knew what is happening to me My nose is bleeding Let it bleed Shut up Wait till he goes away But young man put yourself in my place Why I don t know with whom I am lying Would you be any better off if you did Why I don t want to know your name By the way what is your name No what do you want with my name I only want to explain the senseless way in which Hush he is speaking again Really my love there is whispering Oh no it s the cotton wool in your ears has got out of place Oh by the way talking of the cotton wool do you know that upstairs khee khee upstairs khee khee and so on Upstairs whispered the young man Oh the devil I thought that this was the top storey can it be the second Young man whispered Ivan Andreyitch what did you say For goodness sake why does it concern you I thought it was the top storey too Tell me for God s sake is there another storey Really some one is stirring said the old man leaving off coughing at last Hush Do you hear whispered the young man squeezing Ivan Andreyitch s hands Sir you are holding my hands by force Let me go Hush A slight struggle followed and then there was a silence again So I met a pretty woman began the old man A pretty woman interrupted his wife Yes I thought I told you before that I met a pretty woman on the stairs or perhaps I did not mention it My memory is weak Yes saint John s wort khee What I must drink saint John s wort they say it does good khee khee khee It does good It was you interrupted him said the young man grinding his teeth again You said you met some pretty woman to day his wife went on Eh Met a pretty woman Who did Why didn t you I When Oh yes At last What a mummy Well whispered the young man inwardly raging at the forgetful old gentleman My dear sir I am trembling with horror My God what do I hear It s like yesterday exactly like yesterday Hush Yes to be sure I remember a sly puss such eyes in a blue hat In a blue hat Aie aie It s she She has a blue hat My God cried Ivan Andreyitch She Who is she whispered the young man squeezing Ivan Andreyitch s hands Hush Ivan Andreyitch exhorted in his turn He is speaking Ah my God my God Though after all who hasn t a blue hat And such a sly little rogue the old gentleman went on She comes here to see friends She is always making eyes And other friends come to see those friends too Foo how tedious the lady interrupted Really how can you take interest in that Oh very well very well don t be cross the old gentleman responded in a wheedling chant I won t talk if you don t care to hear me You seem a little out of humour this evening But how did you get here the young man began Ah you see you see Now you are interested and before you wouldn t listen Oh well I don t care Please don t tell me Oh damnation take it what a mess Don t be cross young man I don t know what I am saying I didn t mean anything I only meant to say that there must be some good reason for your taking such an interest But who are you young man I see you are a stranger but who are you Oh dear I don t know what I am saying Ugh leave off please the young man interrupted as though he were considering something But I will tell you all about it You think perhaps that I will not tell you That I feel resentment against you Oh no Here is my hand I am only feeling depressed nothing more But for God s sake first tell me how you came here yourself Through what chance As for me I feel no ill will no indeed I feel no ill will here is my hand I have made it rather dirty it is so dusty here but that s nothing when the feeling is true Ugh get away with your hand There is no room to turn and he keeps thrusting his hand on me But my dear sir but you treat me if you will allow me to say so as though I were an old shoe said Ivan Andreyitch in a rush of the meekest despair in a voice full of entreaty Treat me a little more civilly just a little more civilly and I will tell you all about it We might be friends I am quite ready to ask you home to dinner We can t lie side by side like this I tell you plainly You are in error young man you do not know When was it he met her the young man muttered evidently in violent emotion Perhaps she is expecting me now I ll certainly get away from here She Who is she My God of whom are you speaking young man You imagine that upstairs My God my God Why am I punished like this Ivan Andreyitch tried to turn on his back in his despair Why do you want to know who she is Oh the devil whether it was she or not I will get out My dear sir What are you thinking about What will become of me whispered Ivan Andreyitch clutching at the tails of his neighbour s dress coat in his despair Well what s that to me You can stop here by yourself And if you won t I ll tell them that you are my uncle who has squandered all his property so that the old gentleman won t think that I am his wife s lover But that is utterly impossible young man it s unnatural I should be your uncle Nobody would believe you Why a baby wouldn t believe it Ivan Andreyitch whispered in despair Well don t babble then but lie as flat as a pancake Most likely you will stay the night here and get out somehow to morrow no one will notice you If one creeps out it is not likely they would think there was another one here There might as well be a dozen Though you are as good as a dozen by yourself Move a little or I ll get out You wound me

bark Oh my God what a stupid dog whispered Ivan Andreyitch it will get us all into trouble Here s another affliction Oh well you are such a coward that it may well be so Ami Ami come here cried the lady ici ici But the dog without heeding her made straight for Ivan Andreyitch Why is it Amishka keeps barking said the old gentleman There must be mice or the cat under there I seem to hear a

us young man it will bite my nose Do you want me to lose my nose A struggle followed and Ivan Andreyitch got his hands free The dog broke into volleys of barking Suddenly it ceased barking and gave a yelp Aie cried the lady Monster what are you doing cried the young man You will be the ruin of us both Why are you holding it Good heavens he is strangling it Let it go Monster You know nothing of the heart of women if you can do that She will betray us both if you strangle the dog But by now Ivan Andreyitch could hear nothing He had succeeded in catching the dog and in a paroxysm of self preservation had squeezed its throat The dog yelled and gave up the ghost We are lost whispered the young man Amishka Amishka cried the lady My God what are they doing with my Amishka Amishka Amishka Ici Oh the monsters Barbarians Oh dear I feel giddy What is it what is it cried the old gentleman jumping up from his easy chair What is the matter with you my darling Amishka here Amishka Amishka

Amishka what have they done to you Good heavens what people Amishka Servants servants come here Who is there who is there cried the old gentleman snatching up a candle and bending down under the bed Who is there Ivan Andreyitch was lying more dead than alive beside the breathless corpse of Amishka but the young man was watching every movement of the old gentleman All at once the old gentleman went to the other side of the bed by the wall and bent down In a flash the young man crept out from under the bed and took to his heels while the husband was looking for his visitors on the other side Good gracious exclaimed the lady staring at the young man Who are you Why I thought That monster s still there whispered the young man He is guilty of Amishka s death Aie shrieked the lady but the young man had already vanished from the room Aie There is some one here Here are somebody s boots cried the husband catching Ivan Andreyitch by the leg Murderer murderer cried the lady Oh Ami Ami Come

cried Ivan Andreyitch creeping out for God s sake your Excellency don t call the servants Your Excellency don t call any one It is quite unnecessary You can t kick me out I am not that sort of person I am a different case Your Excellency it has all been due to a mistake I ll explain directly your Excellency exclaimed Ivan Andreyitch sobbing and gasping It s all my wife that is not my wife but somebody else s wife I am not married I am only It s my comrade a friend of youthful days What friend of youthful days cried the old gentleman stamping You are a thief you have come to steal and not a friend of youthful days No I am not a thief your Excellency I am really a friend of youthful days I have only blundered by accident I came into the wrong place Yes sir yes I see from what place you ve crawled out Your Excellency I am not that sort of man You are mistaken I tell you you are cruelly mistaken your Excellency Only glance at me look at me and by signs and tokens you will see that I can t be a thief Your Excellency Your Excellency cried Ivan Andreyitch folding his hands and appealing to the young lady You are a lady you will understand me It was I who killed Amishka But it was not my fault It was really not my fault It was all my wife s fault I am an unhappy man I am drinking the cup of bitterness But really what has it to do with me that you are drinking the cup of bitterness Perhaps it s not the only cup you ve drunk It seems so to judge from your condition But how did you come here sir cried the old gentleman quivering with excitement though he certainly was convinced by certain signs and tokens that Ivan Andreyitch could not be a thief I ask you how did you come here You break in like a robber Not a robber your Excellency I simply came to the wrong place I am really not a robber It is all because I was jealous I will tell you all about it your Excellency I will confess it all frankly as I would to my own father for at your venerable age I might take you for a father What do you mean by venerable age Your Excellency Perhaps I have offended you Of course such a young lady and your age it is a pleasant sight your Excellency it really is a pleasant sight such a union in the prime of life But don t call the servants for God s sake don t call the servants servants would only laugh I know them that is I don t mean that I am only acquainted with footmen I have a footman of my own your Excellency and they are always laughing the asses Your Highness I believe I am not mistaken I am addressing a prince No I am not a prince sir I am an independent gentleman Please do not flatter me with your Highness How did you get here sir How did you get here Your Highness that is your Excellency Excuse me I thought that you were your Highness I looked I imagined it does happen You are so like Prince Korotkouhov whom I have had the honour of meeting at my friend mister Pusyrev s You see I am acquainted with princes too I have met princes too at the houses of my friends you cannot take me for what you take me for I am not a thief Your Excellency don t call the servants what will be the good of it if you do call them But how did you come here cried the lady Who are you Yes who are you the husband chimed in And my love I thought it was pussy under the bed sneezing And it was he Ah you vagabond Who are you Tell me And the old gentleman stamped on the carpet again I cannot speak your Excellency I am waiting till you are finished I am enjoying your witty jokes As regards me it is an absurd story your Excellency I will tell you all about it It can all be explained without more ado that is I mean don t call the servants your Excellency Treat me in a gentlemanly way It means nothing that I was under the bed I have not sacrificed my dignity by that It is a most comical story your Excellency cried Ivan Andreyitch addressing the lady with a supplicating air You particularly your Excellency will laugh You behold upon the scene a jealous husband You see I abase myself I abase myself of my own free will I did indeed kill Amishka but my God I don t know what I am saying But how how did you get here Under cover of night your Excellency under cover of night I beg your pardon Forgive me your Excellency I humbly beg your pardon I am only an injured husband nothing more Don t imagine your Excellency that I am a lover I am not a lover Your wife is virtue itself if I may venture so to express myself She is pure and innocent What what What did you have the audacity to say cried the old gentleman stamping his foot again Are you out of your mind or not How dare you talk about my wife He is a villain a murderer who has killed Amishka wailed the lady dissolving into tears And then he dares Your Excellency your Excellency I spoke foolishly cried Ivan Andreyitch in a fluster I was talking foolishly that was all Think of me as out of my mind For goodness sake think of me as out of my mind I assure you that you will be doing me the greatest favour I would offer you my hand but I do not venture to I was not alone I was an uncle I mean to say that you cannot take me for the lover Goodness I have put my foot in it again Do not be offended your Excellency cried Ivan Andreyitch to the lady You are a lady you understand what love is it is a delicate feeling But what am I saying I am talking nonsense again that is I mean to say that I am an old man that is a middle aged man not an old man that I cannot be your lover that a lover is a Richardson that is a Lovelace I am talking nonsense but you see your Excellency that I am a well educated man and know something of literature You are laughing your Excellency I am delighted delighted that I have provoked your mirth your Excellency Oh how delighted I am that I have provoked your mirth My goodness what a funny man cried the lady exploding with laughter Yes he is funny and in such a mess said the old man delighted that his wife was laughing He cannot be a thief my love But how did he come here It really is strange it really is strange it is like a novel Why At the dead of night in a great city a man under the bed Strange funny Rinaldo Rinaldini after a fashion But that is no matter no matter your Excellency I will tell you all about it And I will buy you a new lapdog your Excellency A wonderful lapdog Such a long coat such short little legs it can t walk more than a step or two it runs a little gets entangled in its own coat and tumbles over One feeds it on nothing but sugar I will bring you one I will certainly bring you one Ha ha ha ha ha The lady was rolling from side to side with laughter Oh dear I shall have hysterics Oh how funny he is Yes yes Ha ha ha Khee khee khee He is funny and he is in a mess khee khee khee Your Excellency your Excellency I am now perfectly happy I would offer you my hand but I do not venture to your Excellency I feel that I have been in error but now I am opening my eyes I am certain my wife is pure and innocent I was wrong in suspecting her Wife his wife cried the lady with tears in her eyes through laughing He married Impossible I should never have thought it said the old gentleman Your Excellency my wife it is all her fault that is it is my fault I suspected her I knew that an assignation had been arranged here here upstairs I intercepted a letter made a mistake about the storey and got under the bed He he he he Ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha Ivan Andreyitch began laughing at last Oh how happy I am Oh how wonderful to see that we are all so happy and harmonious And my wife is entirely innocent That must be so your Excellency He he he Khee khee Do you know my love who it was said the old man at last recovering from his mirth Who Ha ha ha She must be the pretty woman who makes eyes the one with the dandy It s she I bet that s his wife No your Excellency I am certain it is not she I am perfectly certain But my goodness You are losing time cried the lady leaving off laughing Run go upstairs Perhaps you will find them Certainly your Excellency I will fly But I shall not find any one your Excellency it is not she I am certain of it beforehand She is at home now It is all my fault It is simply my jealousy nothing else What do you think Do you suppose that I shall find them there your Excellency Ha ha ha He he he Khee khee You must go you must go And when you come down come in and tell us cried the lady or better still to morrow morning And do bring her too I should like to make her acquaintance Good bye your Excellency good bye I will certainly bring her I shall be very glad for her to make your acquaintance I am glad and happy that it was all ended so and has turned out for the best And the lapdog Don t forget it be sure to bring the lapdog I will bring it your Excellency I will certainly bring it responded Ivan Andreyitch darting back into the room for he had already made his bows and withdrawn I will certainly bring it It is such a pretty one It is just as though a confectioner had made it of sweet meats And it s such a funny little thing gets entangled in its own coat and falls over It really is a lapdog I said to my wife How is it my love it keeps tumbling over It is such a little thing she said As though it were made of sugar of sugar your Excellency Good bye your Excellency very very glad to make your acquaintance very glad to make your acquaintance Ivan Andreyitch bowed himself out Hey sir Stay come back cried the old gentleman after the retreating Ivan Andreyitch The latter turned back for the third time I still can t find the cat didn t you meet him when you were under the bed No I didn t your Excellency Very glad to make his acquaintance though and I shall look upon it as an honour He has a cold in his head now and keeps sneezing and sneezing He must have a beating Yes your Excellency of course corrective punishment is essential with domestic animals What I say that corrective punishment is necessary your Excellency to enforce obedience in the domestic animals Ah Well good bye good bye that is all I had to say Coming out into the street Ivan Andreyitch stood for a long time in an attitude that suggested that he was expecting to have a fit in another minute He took off his hat wiped the cold sweat from his brow screwed up his eyes thought a minute and set off homewards What was his amazement when he learned at home that Glafira Petrovna had come back from the theatre a long long time before that she had toothache that she had sent for the doctor that she had sent for leeches and that now she was lying in bed and expecting Ivan Andreyitch Ivan Andreyitch slapped himself on the forehead told the servant to help him wash and to brush his clothes and at last ventured to go into his wife s room Where is it you spend your time Look what a sight you are What do you look like Where have you been lost all this time Upon my word sir your wife is dying and you have to be hunted for all over the town Where have you been Surely you have not been tracking me trying to disturb a rendezvous I am supposed to have made though I don t know with whom For shame sir you are a husband People will soon be pointing at you in the street My love responded Ivan Andreyitch But at this point he was so overcome with confusion that he had to feel in his pocket for his handkerchief and to break off in the speech he was beginning because he had neither words thoughts or courage What was his amazement horror and alarm when with his handkerchief fell out of his pocket the corpse of Amishka Ivan Andreyitch had not noticed that when he had been forced to creep out from under the bed in an access of despair and unreasoning terror he had stuffed Amishka into his pocket with a far away idea of burying the traces concealing the evidence of his crime and so avoiding the punishment he deserved What s this cried his spouse a nasty dead dog Goodness where has it come from What have you been up to Where have you been Tell me at once where have you been My love answered Ivan Andreyitch almost as dead as Amishka my love But here we will leave our hero till another time for a new and quite different adventure begins here Some day we will describe all these calamities and misfortunes gentlemen But you will admit that jealousy is an unpardonable passion and what is more it is a positive misfortune THE HEAVENLY CHRISTMAS TREE I am a novelist and I suppose I have made up this story I write I suppose though I know for a fact that I have made it up but yet I keep fancying that it must have happened somewhere at some time that it must have happened on Christmas Eve in some great town in a time of terrible frost I have a vision of a boy a little boy six years old or even younger This boy woke up that morning in a cold damp cellar He was dressed in a sort of little dressing gown and was shivering with cold There was a cloud of white steam from his breath and sitting on a box in the corner he blew the steam out of his mouth and amused himself in his dullness watching it float away But he was terribly hungry Several times that morning he went up to the plank bed where his sick mother was lying on a mattress as thin as a pancake with some sort of bundle under her head for a pillow How had she come here She must have come with her boy from some other town and suddenly fallen ill The landlady who let the corners had been taken two days before to the police station the lodgers were out and about as the holiday was so near and the only one left had been lying for the last twenty four hours dead drunk not having waited for Christmas In another corner of the room a wretched old woman of eighty who had once been a children s nurse but was now left to die friendless was moaning and groaning with rheumatism scolding and grumbling at the boy so that he was afraid to go near her corner He had got a drink of water in the outer room but could not find a crust anywhere and had been on the point of waking his mother a dozen times He felt frightened at last in the darkness it had long been dusk but no light was kindled Touching his mother s face he was surprised that she did not move at all and that she was as cold as the wall It is very cold here he thought He stood a little unconsciously letting his hands rest on the dead woman s shoulders then he breathed on his fingers to warm them and then quietly fumbling for his cap on the bed he went out of the cellar He would have gone earlier but was afraid of the big dog which had been howling all day at the neighbour s door at the top of the stairs But the dog was not there now and he went out into the street Mercy on us what a town He had never seen anything like it before In the town from which he had come it was always such black darkness at night There was one lamp for the whole street the little low pitched wooden houses were closed up with shutters there was no one to be seen in the street after dusk all the people shut themselves up in their houses and there was nothing but the howling of packs of dogs hundreds and thousands of them barking and howling all night But there it was so warm and he was given food while here oh dear if he only had something to eat And what a noise and rattle here what light and what people horses and carriages and what a frost The frozen steam hung in clouds over the horses over their warmly breathing mouths their hoofs clanged against the stones through the powdery snow and every one pushed so and oh dear how he longed for some morsel to eat and how wretched he suddenly felt A policeman walked by and turned away to avoid seeing the boy Here was another street oh what a wide one here he would be run over for certain how everyone was shouting racing and driving along and the light the light And what was this A huge glass window and through the window a tree reaching up to the ceiling it was a fir tree and on it were ever so many lights gold papers and apples and little dolls and horses and there were children clean and dressed in their best running about the room laughing and playing and eating and drinking something And then a little girl began dancing with one of the boys what a pretty little girl And he could hear the music through the window The boy looked and wondered and laughed though his toes were aching with the cold and his fingers were red and stiff so that it hurt him to move them And all at once the boy remembered how his toes and fingers hurt him and began crying and ran on and again through another window pane he saw another Christmas tree and on a table cakes of all sorts almond cakes red cakes and yellow cakes and three grand young ladies were sitting there and they gave the cakes to any one who went up to them and the door kept opening lots of gentlemen and ladies went in from the street The boy crept up suddenly opened the door and went in Oh how they shouted at him and waved him back One lady went up to him hurriedly and slipped a kopeck into his hand and with her own hands opened the door into the street for him How frightened he was And the kopeck rolled away and clinked upon the steps he could not bend his red fingers to hold it tight The boy ran away and went on where he did not know He was ready to cry again but he was afraid and ran on and on and blew his fingers And he was miserable because he felt suddenly so lonely and terrified and all at once mercy on us What was this again People were standing in a crowd admiring Behind a glass window there were three little dolls dressed in red and green dresses and exactly exactly as though they were alive One was a little old man sitting and playing a big violin the two others were standing close by and playing little violins and nodding in time and looking at one another and their lips moved they were speaking actually speaking only one couldn t hear through the glass And at first the boy thought they were alive and when he grasped that they were dolls he laughed He had never seen such dolls before and had no idea there were such dolls And he wanted to cry but he felt amused amused by the dolls All at once he fancied that some one caught at his smock behind a wicked big boy was standing beside him and suddenly hit him on the head snatched off his cap and tripped him up The boy fell down on the ground at once there was a shout he was numb with fright he jumped up and ran away He ran and not knowing where he was going ran in at the gate of some one s courtyard and sat down behind a stack of wood They won t find me here besides it s dark He sat huddled up and was breathless from fright and all at once quite suddenly he felt so happy his hands and feet suddenly left off aching and grew so warm as warm as though he were on a stove then he shivered all over then he gave a start why he must have been asleep How nice to have a sleep here I ll sit here a little and go and look at the dolls again said the boy and smiled thinking of them Just as though they were alive And suddenly he heard his mother singing over him Mammy I am asleep how nice it is to sleep here Come to my Christmas tree little one a soft voice suddenly whispered over his head He thought that this was still his mother but no it was not she Who it was calling him he could not see but some one bent over and embraced him in the darkness and he stretched out his hands to him and and all at once oh what a bright light Oh what a Christmas tree And yet it was not a fir tree he had never seen a tree like that Where was he now Everything was bright and shining and all round him were dolls but no they were not dolls they were little boys and girls only so bright and shining They all came flying round him they all kissed him took him and carried him along with them and he was flying himself and he saw that his mother was looking at him and laughing joyfully Mammy Mammy oh how nice it is here Mammy And again he kissed the children and wanted to tell them at once of those dolls in the shop window Who are you boys Who are you girls he asked laughing and admiring them This is Christ s Christmas tree they answered Christ always has a Christmas tree on this day for the little children who have no tree of their own And he found out that all these little boys and girls were children just like himself that some had been frozen in the baskets in which they had as babies been laid on the doorsteps of well to do Petersburg people others had been boarded out with Finnish women by the Foundling and had been suffocated others had died at their starved mother s breasts in the Samara famine others had died in the third class railway carriages from the foul air and yet they were all here they were all like angels about Christ and He was in the midst of them and held out His hands to them and blessed them and their sinful mothers And the mothers of these children stood on one side weeping each one knew her boy or girl and the children flew up to them and kissed them and wiped away their tears with their little hands and begged them not to weep because they were so happy And down below in the morning the porter found the little dead body of the frozen child on the woodstack they sought out his mother too She had died before him They met before the Lord God in heaven Why have I made up such a story so out of keeping with an ordinary diary and a writer s above all And I promised two stories dealing with real events But that is just it I keep fancying that all this may have happened really that is what took place in the cellar and on the woodstack but as for Christ s Christmas tree I cannot tell you whether that could have happened or not THE PEASANT MAREY 
8011_280922_000000_000000	train-clean-360	It was the second day in Easter week 
8011_280922_000000_000001	train-clean-360	The air was warm the sky was blue the sun was high warm bright but my soul was very gloomy 
8011_280922_000000_000002	train-clean-360	I sauntered behind the prison barracks 
none	none	I stared at the palings of the stout prison fence counting the movers but I had no inclination to count them though it was my habit to do so 
8011_280922_000000_000004	train-clean-360	This was the second day of the holidays in the prison the convicts were not taken out to work there were numbers of men drunk loud abuse and quarrelling was springing up continually in every corner 
none	none	There were hideous disgusting songs and card parties installed beside the platform beds 
8011_280922_000000_000006	train-clean-360	Several of the convicts who had been sentenced by their comrades for special violence to be beaten till they were half dead were lying on the platform bed covered with sheepskins till they should recover and come to themselves again knives had already been drawn several times 
8011_280922_000000_000007	train-clean-360	For these two days of holiday all this had been torturing me till it made me ill 
8011_280922_000000_000008	train-clean-360	And indeed I could never endure without repulsion the noise and disorder of drunken people and especially in this place 
none	none	On these days even the prison officials did not look into the prison made no searches did not look for vodka understanding that they must allow even these outcasts to enjoy themselves once a year and that things would be even worse if they did not 
8011_280922_000000_000010	train-clean-360	At last a sudden fury flamed up in my heart 
8011_280922_000000_000011	train-clean-360	A political prisoner called M met me he looked at me gloomily his eyes flashed and his lips quivered 
none	none	Je hais ces brigands he hissed to me through his teeth and walked on I returned to the prison ward though only a quarter of an hour before I had rushed out of it as though I were crazy when six stalwart fellows had all together flung themselves upon the drunken Tatar Gazin to suppress him and had begun beating him they beat him stupidly a camel might have been killed by such blows but they knew that this Hercules was not easy to kill and so they beat him without uneasiness 
8011_280922_000000_000014	train-clean-360	Now on returning I noticed on the bed in the furthest corner of the room Gazin lying unconscious almost without sign of life 
none	none	He lay covered with a sheepskin and every one walked round him without speaking though they confidently hoped that he would come to himself next morning yet if luck was against him maybe from a beating like that the man would die I made my way to my own place opposite the window with the iron grating and lay on my back with my hands behind my head and my eyes shut I liked to lie like that a sleeping man is not molested and meanwhile one can dream and think But I could not dream my heart was beating uneasily and M s words Je hais ces brigands were echoing in my ears 
8011_280922_000000_000018	train-clean-360	But why describe my impressions I sometimes dream even now of those times at night and I have no dreams more agonising 
none	none	Perhaps it will be noticed that even to this day I have scarcely once spoken in print of my life in prison The House of the Dead I wrote fifteen years ago in the character of an imaginary person a criminal who had killed his wife 
8011_280922_000000_000020	train-clean-360	I may add by the way that since then very many persons have supposed and even now maintain that I was sent to penal servitude for the murder of my wife 
8011_280922_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Gradually I sank into forgetfulness and by degrees was lost in memories During the whole course of my four years in prison I was continually recalling all my past and seemed to live over again the whole of my life in recollection 
8011_280922_000001_000001	train-clean-360	These memories rose up of themselves it was not often that of my own will I summoned them 
8011_280922_000001_000002	train-clean-360	It would begin from some point some little thing at times unnoticed and then by degrees there would rise up a complete picture some vivid and complete impression 
8011_280922_000001_000003	train-clean-360	I used to analyse these impressions give new features to what had happened long ago and best of all I used to correct it correct it continually that was my great amusement 
none	none	On this occasion I suddenly for some reason remembered an unnoticed moment in my early childhood when I was only nine years old a moment which I should have thought I had utterly forgotten but at that time I was particularly fond of memories of my early childhood 
8011_280922_000001_000005	train-clean-360	I remembered the month of August in our country house a dry bright day but rather cold and windy summer was waning and soon we should have to go to Moscow to be bored all the winter over French lessons and I was so sorry to leave the country 
8011_280922_000001_000006	train-clean-360	I walked past the threshing floor and going down the ravine I went up to the dense thicket of bushes that covered the further side of the ravine as far as the copse 
8011_280922_000001_000007	train-clean-360	And I plunged right into the midst of the bushes and heard a peasant ploughing alone on the clearing about thirty paces away 
8011_280922_000001_000008	train-clean-360	I knew that he was ploughing up the steep hill and the horse was moving with effort and from time to time the peasant s call come up floated upwards to me 
8011_280922_000001_000009	train-clean-360	I knew almost all our peasants but I did not know which it was ploughing now and I did not care who it was I was absorbed in my own affairs 
8011_280922_000001_000010	train-clean-360	I was busy too I was breaking off switches from the nut trees to whip the frogs with 
8011_280922_000001_000011	train-clean-360	Nut sticks make such fine whips but they do not last while birch twigs are just the opposite 
8011_280922_000001_000012	train-clean-360	I was interested too in beetles and other insects I used to collect them some were very ornamental 
none	none	I was very fond too of the little nimble red and yellow lizards with black spots on them but I was afraid of snakes Snakes however were much more rare than lizards 
8011_280922_000001_000014	train-clean-360	There were not many mushrooms there 
none	none	To get mushrooms one had to go to the birch wood and I was about to set off there And there was nothing in the world that I loved so much as the wood with its mushrooms and wild berries with its beetles and its birds its hedgehogs and squirrels with its damp smell of dead leaves which I loved so much and even as I write I smell the fragrance of our birch wood these impressions will remain for my whole life Suddenly in the midst of the profound stillness I heard a clear and distinct shout Wolf I shrieked and beside myself with terror calling out at the top of my voice ran out into the clearing and straight to the peasant who was ploughing 
8011_280922_000002_000000	train-clean-360	It was our peasant Marey 
8011_280922_000002_000001	train-clean-360	I don t know if there is such a name but every one called him Marey a thick set rather well grown peasant of fifty with a good many grey hairs in his dark brown spreading beard 
none	none	I knew him but had scarcely ever happened to speak to him till then 
8011_280922_000002_000003	train-clean-360	He stopped his horse on hearing my cry and when breathless I caught with one hand at his plough and with the other at his sleeve he saw how frightened I was 
8011_280922_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 There is a wolf I cried panting 
8011_280922_000004_000000	train-clean-360	He flung up his head and could not help looking round for an instant almost believing me 
8011_280922_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Where is the wolf 
8011_280922_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 A shout some one shouted wolf I faltered out 
8011_280922_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Nonsense nonsense 
none	none	A wolf 
8011_280922_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Why it was your fancy 
8011_280922_000007_000003	train-clean-360	How could there be a wolf he muttered reassuring me 
8011_280922_000007_000004	train-clean-360	But I was trembling all over and still kept tight hold of his smock frock and I must have been quite pale 
8011_280922_000007_000005	train-clean-360	He looked at me with an uneasy smile evidently anxious and troubled over me 
none	none	Why you have had a fright aie aie He shook his head
8011_280922_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 There dear 
none	none	Come little one aie 
8011_280922_000009_000000	train-clean-360	He stretched out his hand and all at once stroked my cheek 
8011_280922_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Come come there Christ be with you 
8011_280922_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Cross yourself 
8011_280922_000011_000000	train-clean-360	But I did not cross myself 
8011_280922_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The corners of my mouth were twitching and I think that struck him particularly 
8011_280922_000011_000002	train-clean-360	He put out his thick black nailed earth stained finger and softly touched my twitching lips 
none	none	Aie there there he said to me with a slow almost motherly smile Dear dear what is the matter 
8011_280922_000012_000001	train-clean-360	There come come 
none	none	I grasped at last that there was no wolf and that the shout that I had heard was my fancy 
8011_280922_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Yet that shout had been so clear and distinct but such shouts not only about wolves I had imagined once or twice before and I was aware of that These hallucinations passed away later as I grew older 
8011_280922_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I will go then I said looking at him timidly and inquiringly 
8011_280922_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Well do and I ll keep watch on you as you go 
none	none	I won t let the wolf get at you he added still smiling at me with the same motherly expression Well Christ be with you 
8011_280922_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Come run along then and he made the sign of the cross over me and then over himself 
8011_280922_000015_000003	train-clean-360	I walked away looking back almost at every tenth step 
none	none	Marey stood still with his mare as I walked away and looked after me and nodded to me every time I looked round I must own I felt a little ashamed at having let him see me so frightened but I was still very much afraid of the wolf as I walked away until I reached the first barn half way up the slope of the ravine there my fright vanished completely and all at once our yard dog Voltchok flew to meet me 
8011_280922_000015_000006	train-clean-360	With Voltchok I felt quite safe and I turned round to Marey for the last time I could not see his face distinctly but I felt that he was still nodding and smiling affectionately to me 
none	none	I waved to him he waved back to me and started his little mare Come up I heard his call in the distance again and the little mare pulled at the plough again 
8011_280922_000016_000000	train-clean-360	All this I recalled all at once I don t know why but with extraordinary minuteness of detail 
8011_280922_000016_000001	train-clean-360	I suddenly roused myself and sat up on the platform bed and I remember found myself still smiling quietly at my memories 
8011_280922_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I brooded over them for another minute 
8011_280922_000017_000000	train-clean-360	When I got home that day I told no one of my adventure with Marey 
8011_280922_000017_000001	train-clean-360	And indeed it was hardly an adventure 
8011_280922_000017_000002	train-clean-360	And in fact I soon forgot Marey 
8011_280922_000017_000003	train-clean-360	When I met him now and then afterwards I never even spoke to him about the wolf or anything else and all at once now twenty years afterwards in Siberia I remembered this meeting with such distinctness to the smallest detail 
none	none	So it must have lain hidden in my soul though I knew nothing of it and rose suddenly to my memory when it was wanted I remembered the soft motherly smile of the poor serf the way he signed me with the cross and shook his head
8011_280922_000017_000005	train-clean-360	 There there you have had a fright little one And I remembered particularly the thick earth stained finger with which he softly and with timid tenderness touched my quivering lips 
8011_280922_000017_000006	train-clean-360	Of course any one would have reassured a child but something quite different seemed to have happened in that solitary meeting and if I had been his own son he could not have looked at me with eyes shining with greater love 
8011_280922_000017_000007	train-clean-360	And what made him like that 
8011_280922_000017_000008	train-clean-360	He was our serf and I was his little master after all 
8011_280922_000017_000009	train-clean-360	No one would know that he had been kind to me and reward him for it 
8011_280922_000017_000010	train-clean-360	Was he perhaps very fond of little children 
8011_280922_000017_000011	train-clean-360	Some people are 
none	none	It was a solitary meeting in the deserted fields and only God perhaps may have seen from above with what deep and humane civilised feeling and with what delicate almost feminine tenderness the heart of a coarse brutally ignorant Russian serf who had as yet no expectation no idea even of his freedom may be filled Was not this perhaps what Konstantin Aksakov meant when he spoke of the high degree of culture of our peasantry And when I got down off the bed and looked around me I remember I suddenly felt that I could look at these unhappy creatures with quite different eyes and that suddenly by some miracle all hatred and anger had vanished utterly from my heart 
8011_280922_000018_000001	train-clean-360	I walked about looking into the faces that I met That shaven peasant branded on his face as a criminal bawling his hoarse drunken song may be that very Marey I cannot look into his heart 
8011_280922_000019_000000	train-clean-360	I met M again that evening 
none	none	Poor fellow he could have no memories of Russian peasants and no other view of these people but Je hais ces brigands Yes the Polish prisoners had more to bear than I THE CROCODILE AN EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENT A true story of how a gentleman of a certain age and of respectable appearance was swallowed alive by the crocodile in the Arcade and of the consequences that followed Ohe Lambert Ou est Lambert As tu vu Lambert I On the thirteenth of January of this present year eighteen sixty five at half past twelve in the day Elena Ivanovna the wife of my cultured friend Ivan Matveitch who is a colleague in the same department and may be said to be a distant relation of mine too expressed the desire to see the crocodile now on view at a fixed charge in the Arcade As Ivan Matveitch had already in his pocket his ticket for a tour abroad not so much for the sake of his health as for the improvement of his mind and was consequently free from his official duties and had nothing whatever to do that morning he offered no objection to his wife s irresistible fancy but was positively aflame with curiosity himself A capital idea he said with the utmost satisfaction We ll have a look at the crocodile On the eve of visiting Europe it is as well to acquaint ourselves on the spot with its indigenous inhabitants And with these words taking his wife s arm he set off with her at once for the Arcade I joined them as I usually do being an intimate friend of the family I have never seen Ivan Matveitch in a more agreeable frame of mind than he was on that memorable morning how true it is that we know not beforehand the fate that awaits us On entering the Arcade he was at once full of admiration for the splendours of the building and when we reached the shop in which the monster lately arrived in Petersburg was being exhibited he volunteered to pay the quarter rouble for me to the crocodile owner a thing which had never happened before Walking into a little room we observed that besides the crocodile there were in it parrots of the species known as cockatoo and also a group of monkeys in a special case in a recess Near the entrance along the left wall stood a big tin tank that looked like a bath covered with a thin iron grating filled with water to the depth of two inches In this shallow pool was kept a huge crocodile which lay like a log absolutely motionless and apparently deprived of all its faculties by our damp climate so inhospitable to foreign visitors This monster at first aroused no special interest in any one of us So this is the crocodile said Elena Ivanovna with a pathetic cadence of regret Why I thought it was something different Most probably she thought it was made of diamonds The owner of the crocodile a German came out and looked at us with an air of extraordinary pride He has a right to be Ivan Matveitch whispered to me he knows he is the only man in Russia exhibiting a crocodile This quite nonsensical observation I ascribe also to the extremely good humoured mood which had overtaken Ivan Matveitch who was on other occasions of rather envious disposition I fancy your crocodile is not alive said Elena Ivanovna piqued by the irresponsive stolidity of the proprietor and addressing him with a charming smile in order to soften his churlishness a manoeuvre so typically feminine Oh no madam the latter replied in broken Russian and instantly moving the grating half off the tank he poked the monster s head with a stick Then the treacherous monster to show that it was alive faintly stirred its paws and tail raised its snout and emitted something like a prolonged snuffle Come don t be cross Karlchen said the German caressingly gratified in his vanity How horrid that crocodile is I am really frightened Elena Ivanovna twittered still more coquettishly I know I shall dream of him now But he won t bite you if you do dream of him the German retorted gallantly and was the first to laugh at his own jest but none of us responded Come Semyon Semyonitch said Elena Ivanovna addressing me exclusively let us go and look at the monkeys I am awfully fond of monkeys they are such darlings and the crocodile is horrid Oh don t be afraid my dear Ivan Matveitch called after us gallantly displaying his manly courage to his wife This drowsy denison of the realms of the Pharaohs will do us no harm And he remained by the tank What is more he took his glove and began tickling the crocodile s nose with it wishing as he said afterwards to induce him to snort The proprietor showed his politeness to a lady by following Elena Ivanovna to the case of monkeys So everything was going well and nothing could have been foreseen Elena Ivanovna was quite skittish in her raptures over the monkeys and seemed completely taken up with them With shrieks of delight she was continually turning to me as though determined not to notice the proprietor and kept gushing with laughter at the resemblance she detected between these monkeys and her intimate friends and acquaintances I too was amused for the resemblance was unmistakable The German did not know whether to laugh or not and so at last was reduced to frowning And it was at that moment that a terrible I may say unnatural scream set the room vibrating Not knowing what to think for the first moment I stood still numb with horror but noticing that Elena Ivanovna was screaming too I quickly turned round and what did I behold I saw oh heavens I saw the luckless Ivan Matveitch in the terrible jaws of the crocodile held by them round the waist lifted horizontally in the air and desperately kicking Then one moment and no trace remained of him But I must describe it in detail for I stood all the while motionless and had time to watch the whole process taking place before me with an attention and interest such as I never remember to have felt before What I thought at that critical moment what if all that had happened to me instead of to Ivan Matveitch how unpleasant it would have been for me But to return to my story The crocodile began by turning the unhappy Ivan Matveitch in his terrible jaws so that he could swallow his legs first then bringing up Ivan Matveitch who kept trying to jump out and clutching at the sides of the tank sucked him down again as far as his waist Then bringing him up again gulped him down and so again and again In this way Ivan Matveitch was visibly disappearing before our eyes At last with a final gulp the crocodile swallowed my cultured friend entirely this time leaving no trace of him From the outside of the crocodile we could see the protuberances of Ivan Matveitch s figure as he passed down the inside of the monster I was on the point of screaming again when destiny played another treacherous trick upon us The crocodile made a tremendous effort probably oppressed by the magnitude of the object he had swallowed once more opened his terrible jaws and with a final hiccup he suddenly let the head of Ivan Matveitch pop out for a second with an expression of despair on his face In that brief instant the spectacles dropped off his nose to the bottom of the tank It seemed as though that despairing countenance had only popped out to cast one last look on the objects around it to take its last farewell of all earthly pleasures But it had not time to carry out its intention the crocodile made another effort gave a gulp and instantly it vanished again this time for ever This appearance and disappearance of a still living human head was so horrible but at the same either from its rapidity and unexpectedness or from the dropping of the spectacles there was something so comic about it that I suddenly quite unexpectedly exploded with laughter But pulling myself together and realising that to laugh at such a moment was not the thing for an old family friend I turned at once to Elena Ivanovna and said with a sympathetic air Now it s all over with our friend Ivan Matveitch I cannot even attempt to describe how violent was the agitation of Elena Ivanovna during the whole process After the first scream she seemed rooted to the spot and stared at the catastrophe with apparent indifference though her eyes looked as though they were starting out of her head then she suddenly went off into a heart rending wail but I seized her hands At this instant the proprietor too who had at first been also petrified by horror suddenly clasped his hands and cried gazing upwards Oh my crocodile Oh mein allerliebster Karlchen Mutter Mutter Mutter A door at the rear of the room opened at this cry and the Mutter a rosy cheeked elderly but dishevelled woman in a cap made her appearance and rushed with a shriek to her German A perfect Bedlam followed Elena Ivanovna kept shrieking out the same phrase as though in a frenzy Flay him flay him apparently entreating them probably in a moment of oblivion to flay somebody for something The proprietor and Mutter took no notice whatever of either of us they were both bellowing like calves over the crocodile He did for himself He will burst himself at once for he did swallow a ganz official cried the proprietor Unser Karlchen unser allerliebster Karlchen wird sterben howled his wife We are bereaved and without bread chimed in the proprietor Flay him flay him flay him clamoured Elena Ivanovna clutching at the German s coat He did tease the crocodile For what did your man tease the crocodile cried the German pulling away from her You will if Karlchen wird burst therefore pay das war mein Sohn das war mein einziger Sohn I must own I was intensely indignant at the sight of such egoism in the German and the cold heartedness of his dishevelled Mutter at the same time Elena Ivanovna s reiterated shriek of Flay him flay him troubled me even more and absorbed at last my whole attention positively alarming me I may as well say straight off that I entirely misunderstood this strange exclamation it seemed to me that Elena Ivanovna had for the moment taken leave of her senses but nevertheless wishing to avenge the loss of her beloved Ivan Matveitch was demanding by way of compensation that the crocodile should be severely thrashed while she was meaning something quite different Looking round at the door not without embarrassment I began to entreat Elena Ivanovna to calm herself and above all not to use the shocking word flay For such a reactionary desire here in the midst of the Arcade and of the most cultured society not two paces from the hall where at this very minute mister Lavrov was perhaps delivering a public lecture was not only impossible but unthinkable and might at any moment bring upon us the hisses of culture and the caricatures of mister Stepanov To my horror I was immediately proved to be correct in my alarmed suspicions the curtain that divided the crocodile room from the little entry where the quarter roubles were taken suddenly parted and in the opening there appeared a figure with moustaches and beard carrying a cap with the upper part of its body bent a long way forward though the feet were scrupulously held beyond the threshold of the crocodile room in order to avoid the necessity of paying the entrance money Such a reactionary desire madam said the stranger trying to avoid falling over in our direction and to remain standing outside the room does no credit to your development and is conditioned by lack of phosphorus in your brain You will be promptly held up to shame in the Chronicle of Progress and in our satirical prints But he could not complete his remarks the proprietor coming to himself and seeing with horror that a man was talking in the crocodile room without having paid entrance money rushed furiously at the progressive stranger and turned him out with a punch from each fist For a moment both vanished from our sight behind a curtain and only then I grasped that the whole uproar was about nothing Elena Ivanovna turned out quite innocent she had as I have mentioned already no idea whatever of subjecting the crocodile to a degrading corporal punishment and had simply expressed the desire that he should be opened and her husband released from his interior What You wish that my crocodile be perished the proprietor yelled running in again No let your husband be perished first before my crocodile Mein Vater showed crocodile mein Grossvater showed crocodile mein Sohn will show crocodile and I will show crocodile All will show crocodile I am known to ganz Europa and you are not known to ganz Europa and you must pay me a strafe Ja ja put in the vindictive German woman we shall not let you go Strafe since Karlchen is burst And indeed it s useless to flay the creature I added calmly anxious to get Elena Ivanovna away home as quickly as possible as our dear Ivan Matveitch is by now probably soaring somewhere in the empyrean My dear we suddenly heard to our intense amazement the voice of Ivan Matveitch my dear my advice is to apply direct to the superintendent s office as without the assistance of the police the German will never be made to see reason These words uttered with firmness and aplomb and expressing an exceptional presence of mind for the first minute so astounded us that we could not believe our ears But of course we ran at once to the crocodile s tank and with equal reverence and incredulity listened to the unhappy captive His voice was muffled thin and even squeaky as though it came from a considerable distance It reminded one of a jocose person who covering his mouth with a pillow shouts from an adjoining room trying to mimic the sound of two peasants calling to one another in a deserted plain or across a wide ravine a performance to which I once had the pleasure of listening in a friend s house at Christmas Ivan Matveitch my dear and so you are alive faltered Elena Ivanovna Alive and well answered Ivan Matveitch and thanks to the Almighty swallowed without any damage whatever I am only uneasy as to the view my superiors may take of the incident for after getting a permit to go abroad I ve got into a crocodile which seems anything but clever But my dear don t trouble your head about being clever first of all we must somehow excavate you from where you are Elena Ivanovna interrupted Excavate cried the proprietor I will not let my crocodile be excavated Now the publicum will come many more and I will funfzig kopecks ask and Karlchen will cease to burst Gott sei dank put in his wife They are right Ivan Matveitch observed tranquilly the principles of economics before everything My dear I will fly at once to the authorities and lodge a complaint for I feel that we cannot settle this mess by ourselves I think so too observed Ivan Matveitch but in our age of industrial crisis it is not easy to rip open the belly of a crocodile without economic compensation and meanwhile the inevitable question presents itself What will the German take for his crocodile And with it another How will it be paid For as you know I have no means Perhaps out of your salary I observed timidly but the proprietor interrupted me at once I will not the crocodile sell I will for three thousand the crocodile sell I will for four thousand the crocodile sell Now the publicum will come very many I will for five thousand the crocodile sell In fact he gave himself insufferable airs Covetousness and a revolting greed gleamed joyfully in his eyes I am going I cried indignantly And I I too I shall go to Andrey Osipitch himself I will soften him with my tears whined Elena Ivanovna Don t do that my dear Ivan Matveitch hastened to interpose He had long been jealous of Andrey Osipitch on his wife s account and he knew she would enjoy going to weep before a gentleman of refinement for tears suited her And I don t advise you to do so either my friend he added addressing me It s no good plunging headlong in that slap dash way there s no knowing what it may lead to You had much better go to day to Timofey Semyonitch as though to pay an ordinary visit he is an old fashioned and by no means brilliant man but he is trustworthy and what matters most of all he is straightforward Give him my greetings and describe the circumstances of the case And since I owe him seven roubles over our last game of cards take the opportunity to pay him the money that will soften the stern old man In any case his advice may serve as a guide for us And meanwhile take Elena Ivanovna home Calm yourself my dear he continued addressing her I am weary of these outcries and feminine squabblings and should like a nap It s soft and warm in here though I have hardly had time to look round in this unexpected haven Look round Why is it light in there cried Elena Ivanovna in a tone of relief I am surrounded by impenetrable night answered the poor captive but I can feel and so to speak have a look round with my hands Good bye set your mind at rest and don t deny yourself recreation and diversion Till to morrow And you Semyon Semyonitch come to me in the evening and as you are absent minded and may forget it tie a knot in your handkerchief I confess I was glad to get away for I was overtired and somewhat bored Hastening to offer my arm to the disconsolate Elena Ivanovna whose charms were only enhanced by her agitation I hurriedly led her out of the crocodile room The charge will be another quarter rouble in the evening the proprietor called after us Oh dear how greedy they are said Elena Ivanovna looking at herself in every mirror on the walls of the Arcade and evidently aware that she was looking prettier than usual The principles of economics I answered with some emotion proud that passers by should see the lady on my arm The principles of economics she drawled in a touching little voice I did not in the least understand what Ivan Matveitch said about those horrid economics just now I will explain to you I answered and began at once telling her of the beneficial effects of the introduction of foreign capital into our country upon which I had read an article in the Petersburg News and the Voice that morning How strange it is she interrupted after listening for some time But do leave off you horrid man What nonsense you are talking Tell me do I look purple You look perfect and not purple I observed seizing the opportunity to pay her a compliment Naughty man she said complacently Poor Ivan Matveitch she added a minute later putting her little head on one side coquettishly I am really sorry for him Oh dear she cried suddenly how is he going to have his dinner and and what will he do if he wants anything An unforeseen question I answered perplexed in my turn To tell the truth it had not entered my head so much more practical are women than we men in the solution of the problems of daily life Poor dear how could he have got into such a mess nothing to amuse him and in the dark How vexing it is that I have no photograph of him And so now I am a sort of widow she added with a seductive smile evidently interested in her new position Hm I am sorry for him though It was in short the expression of the very natural and intelligible grief of a young and interesting wife for the loss of her husband I took her home at last soothed her and after dining with her and drinking a cup of aromatic coffee set off at six o clock to Timofey Semyonitch calculating that at that hour all married people of settled habits would be sitting or lying down at home Having written this first chapter in a style appropriate to the incident recorded I intend to proceed in a language more natural though less elevated and I beg to forewarn the reader of the fact II The venerable Timofey Semyonitch met me rather nervously as though somewhat embarrassed He led me to his tiny study and shut the door carefully that the children may not hinder us he added with evident uneasiness There he made me sit down on a chair by the writing table sat down himself in an easy chair wrapped round him the skirts of his old wadded dressing gown and assumed an official and even severe air in readiness for anything though he was not my chief nor Ivan Matveitch s and had hitherto been reckoned as a colleague and even a friend First of all he said take note that I am not a person in authority but just such a subordinate official as you and Ivan Matveitch I have nothing to do with it and do not intend to mix myself up in the affair I was surprised to find that he apparently knew all about it already In spite of that I told him the whole story over in detail I spoke with positive excitement for I was at that moment fulfilling the obligations of a true friend He listened without special surprise but with evident signs of suspicion Only fancy he said I always believed that this would be sure to happen to him Why Timofey Semyonitch It is a very unusual incident in itself I admit it But Ivan Matveitch s whole career in the service was leading up to this end He was flighty conceited indeed It was always progress and ideas of all sorts and this is what progress brings people to But this is a most unusual incident and cannot possibly serve as a general rule for all progressives Yes indeed it can You see it s the effect of over education I assure you For over education leads people to poke their noses into all sorts of places especially where they are not invited Though perhaps you know best he added as though offended I am an old man and not of much education I began as a soldier s son and this year has been the jubilee of my service Oh no Timofey Semyonitch not at all On the contrary Ivan Matveitch is eager for your advice he is eager for your guidance He implores it so to say with tears So to say with tears Hm Those are crocodile s tears and one cannot quite believe in them Tell me what possessed him to want to go abroad And how could he afford to go Why he has no private means He had saved the money from his last bonus I answered plaintively He only wanted to go for three months to Switzerland to the land of William Tell William Tell Hm He wanted to meet the spring at Naples to see the museums the customs the animals Hm The animals I think it was simply from pride What animals Animals indeed Haven t we animals enough We have museums menageries camels There are bears quite close to Petersburg And here he s got inside a crocodile himself Oh come Timofey Semyonitch The man is in trouble the man appeals to you as to a friend as to an older relation craves for advice and you reproach him Have pity at least on the unfortunate Elena Ivanovna You are speaking of his wife A charming little lady said Timofey Semyonitch visibly softening and taking a pinch of snuff with relish Particularly prepossessing And so plump and always putting her pretty little head on one side Very agreeable Andrey Osipitch was speaking of her only the other day Speaking of her Yes and in very flattering terms Such a bust he said such eyes such hair A sugar plum he said not a lady and then he laughed He is still a young man of course Timofey Semyonitch blew his nose with a loud noise And yet young though he is what a career he is making for himself That s quite a different thing Timofey Semyonitch Of course of course Well what do you say then Timofey Semyonitch Why what can I do Give advice guidance as a man of experience a relative What are we to do What steps are we to take Go to the authorities and To the authorities Certainly not Timofey Semyonitch replied hurriedly If you ask my advice you had better above all hush the matter up and act so to speak as a private person It is a suspicious incident quite unheard of Unheard of above all there is no precedent for it and it is far from creditable And so discretion above all Let him lie there a bit We must wait and see But how can we wait and see Timofey Semyonitch What if he is stifled there Why should he be I think you told me that he made himself fairly comfortable there I told him the whole story over again Timofey Semyonitch pondered Hm he said twisting his snuff box in his hands To my mind it s really a good thing he should lie there a bit instead of going abroad Let him reflect at his leisure Of course he mustn t be stifled and so he must take measures to preserve his health avoiding a cough for instance and so on And as for the German it s my personal opinion he is within his rights and even more so than the other side because it was the other party who got into his crocodile without asking permission and not he who got into Ivan Matveitch s crocodile without asking permission though so far as I recollect the latter has no crocodile And a crocodile is private property and so it is impossible to slit him open without compensation For the saving of human life Timofey Semyonitch Oh well that s a matter for the police You must go to them But Ivan Matveitch may be needed in the department He may be asked for Ivan Matveitch needed Ha ha Besides he is on leave so that we may ignore him let him inspect the countries of Europe It will be a different matter if he doesn t turn up when his leave is over Then we shall ask for him and make inquiries Three months Timofey Semyonitch for pity s sake It s his own fault Nobody thrust him there At this rate we should have to get a nurse to look after him at government expense and that is not allowed for in the regulations But the chief point is that the crocodile is private property so that the principles of economics apply in this question And the principles of economics are paramount Only the other evening at Luka Andreitch s Ignaty Prokofyitch was saying so Do you know Ignaty Prokofyitch A capitalist in a big way of business and he speaks so fluently We need industrial development he said there is very little development among us We must create it We must create capital so we must create a middle class the so called bourgeoisie And as we haven t capital we must attract it from abroad We must in the first place give facilities to foreign companies to buy up lands in Russia as is done now abroad The communal holding of land is poison is ruin And you know he spoke with such heat well that s all right for him a wealthy man and not in the service With the communal system he said there will be no improvement in industrial development or agriculture Foreign companies he said must as far as possible buy up the whole of our land in big lots and then split it up split it up split it up in the smallest parts possible and do you know he pronounced the words split it up with such determination and then sell it as private property Or rather not sell it but simply let it When he said all the land is in the hands of foreign companies they can fix any rent they like And so the peasant will work three times as much for his daily bread and he can be turned out at pleasure So that he will feel it will be submissive and industrious and will work three times as much for the same wages But as it is with the commune what does he care He knows he won t die of hunger so he is lazy and drunken And meanwhile money will be attracted into Russia capital will be created and the bourgeoisie will spring up The English political and literary paper The Times in an article the other day on our finances stated that the reason our financial position was so unsatisfactory was that we had no middle class no big fortunes no accommodating proletariat Ignaty Prokofyitch speaks well He is an orator He wants to lay a report on the subject before the authorities and then to get it published in the News That s something very different from verses like Ivan Matveitch s But how about Ivan Matveitch I put in after letting the old man babble on Timofey Semyonitch was sometimes fond of talking and showing that he was not behind the times but knew all about things How about Ivan Matveitch Why I am coming to that Here we are anxious to bring foreign capital into the country and only consider as soon as the capital of a foreigner who has been attracted to Petersburg has been doubled through Ivan Matveitch instead of protecting the foreign capitalist we are proposing to rip open the belly of his original capital the crocodile Is it consistent To my mind Ivan Matveitch as the true son of his fatherland ought to rejoice and to be proud that through him the value of a foreign crocodile has been doubled and possibly even trebled That s just what is wanted to attract capital If one man succeeds mind you another will come with a crocodile and a third will bring two or three of them at once and capital will grow up about them there you have a bourgeoisie It must be encouraged Upon my word Timofey Semyonitch I cried you are demanding almost supernatural self sacrifice from poor Ivan Matveitch I demand nothing and I beg you before everything as I have said already to remember that I am not a person in authority and so cannot demand anything of any one I am speaking as a son of the fatherland that is not as the Son of the Fatherland but as a son of the fatherland Again what possessed him to get into the crocodile A respectable man a man of good grade in the service lawfully married and then to behave like that Is it consistent But it was an accident Who knows And where is the money to compensate the owner to come from Perhaps out of his salary Timofey Semyonitch Would that be enough No it wouldn t Timofey Semyonitch I answered sadly The proprietor was at first alarmed that the crocodile would burst but as soon as he was sure that it was all right he began to bluster and was delighted to think that he could double the charge for entry Treble and quadruple perhaps The public will simply stampede the place now and crocodile owners are smart people Besides it s not Lent yet and people are keen on diversions and so I say again the great thing is that Ivan Matveitch should preserve his incognito don t let him be in a hurry Let everybody know perhaps that he is in the crocodile but don t let them be officially informed of it Ivan Matveitch is in particularly favourable circumstances for that for he is reckoned to be abroad It will be said he is in the crocodile and we will refuse to believe it That is how it can be managed The great thing is that he should wait and why should he be in a hurry Well but if Don t worry he has a good constitution Well and afterwards when he has waited Well I won t conceal from you that the case is exceptional in the highest degree One doesn t know what to think of it and the worst of it is there is no precedent If we had a precedent we might have something to go by But as it is what is one to say It will certainly take time to settle it A happy thought flashed upon my mind Cannot we arrange I said that if he is destined to remain in the entrails of the monster and it is the will of Providence that he should remain alive that he should send in a petition to be reckoned as still serving Hm Possibly as on leave and without salary But couldn t it be with salary On what grounds As sent on a special commission What commission and where Why into the entrails the entrails of the crocodile So to speak for exploration for investigation of the facts on the spot It would of course be a novelty but that is progressive and would at the same time show zeal for enlightenment Timofey Semyonitch thought a little To send a special official he said at last to the inside of a crocodile to conduct a special inquiry is in my personal opinion an absurdity It is not in the regulations And what sort of special inquiry could there be there The scientific study of nature on the spot in the living subject The natural sciences are all the fashion nowadays botany He could live there and report his observations For instance concerning digestion or simply habits For the sake of accumulating facts You mean as statistics Well I am no great authority on that subject indeed I am no philosopher at all You say facts we are overwhelmed with facts as it is and don t know what to do with them Besides statistics are a danger In what way They are a danger Moreover you will admit he will report facts so to speak lying like a log And can one do one s official duties lying like a log That would be another novelty and a dangerous one and again there is no precedent for it If we had any sort of precedent for it then to my thinking he might have been given the job But no live crocodiles have been brought over hitherto Timofey Semyonitch Hm yes he reflected again Your objection is a just one if you like and might indeed serve as a ground for carrying the matter further but consider again that if with the arrival of living crocodiles government clerks begin to disappear and then on the ground that they are warm and comfortable there expect to receive the official sanction for their position and then take their ease there you must admit it would be a bad example We should have every one trying to go the same way to get a salary for nothing Do your best for him Timofey Semyonitch By the way Ivan Matveitch asked me to give you seven roubles he had lost to you at cards Ah he lost that the other day at Nikifor Nikiforitch s I remember And how gay and amusing he was and now The old man was genuinely touched Intercede for him Timofey Semyonitch I will do my best I will speak in my own name as a private person as though I were asking for information And meanwhile you find out indirectly unofficially how much would the proprietor consent to take for his crocodile Timofey Semyonitch was visibly more friendly Certainly I answered And I will come back to you at once to report And his wife is she alone now Is she depressed You should call on her Timofey Semyonitch I will I thought of doing so before it s a good opportunity And what on earth possessed him to go and look at the crocodile Though indeed I should like to see it myself Go and see the poor fellow Timofey Semyonitch I will Of course I don t want to raise his hopes by doing so I shall go as a private person Well good bye I am going to Nikifor Nikiforitch s again shall you be there No I am going to see the poor prisoner Yes now he is a prisoner Ah that s what comes of thoughtlessness I said good bye to the old man Ideas of all kinds were straying through my mind A good natured and most honest man Timofey Semyonitch yet as I left him I felt pleased at the thought that he had celebrated his fiftieth year of service and that Timofey Semyonitchs are now a rarity among us I flew at once of course to the Arcade to tell poor Ivan Matveitch all the news And indeed I was moved by curiosity to know how he was getting on in the crocodile and how it was possible to live in a crocodile And indeed was it possible to live in a crocodile at all At times it really seemed to me as though it were all an outlandish monstrous dream especially as an outlandish monster was the chief figure in it III And yet it was not a dream but actual indubitable fact Should I be telling the story if it were not But to continue It was late about nine o clock before I reached the Arcade and I had to go into the crocodile room by the back entrance for the German had closed the shop earlier than usual that evening Now in the seclusion of domesticity he was walking about in a greasy old frock coat but he seemed three times as pleased as he had been in the morning It was evidently that he had no apprehensions now and that the public had been coming many more The Mutter came out later evidently to keep an eye on me The German and the Mutter frequently whispered together Although the shop was closed he charged me a quarter rouble What unnecessary exactitude You will every time pay the public will one rouble and you one quarter pay for you are the good friend of your good friend and I a friend respect Are you alive are you alive my cultured friend I cried as I approached the crocodile expecting my words to reach Ivan Matveitch from a distance and to flatter his vanity Alive and well he answered as though from a long way off or from under the bed though I was standing close beside him Alive and well but of that later How are things going As though purposely not hearing the question I was just beginning with sympathetic haste to question him how he was what it was like in the crocodile and what in fact there was inside a crocodile Both friendship and common civility demanded this But with capricious annoyance he interrupted me How are things going he shouted in a shrill and on this occasion particularly revolting voice addressing me peremptorily as usual I described to him my whole conversation with Timofey Semyonitch down to the smallest detail As I told my story I tried to show my resentment in my voice The old man is right Ivan Matveitch pronounced as abruptly as usual in his conversation with me I like practical people and can t endure sentimental milk sops I am ready to admit however that your idea about a special commission is not altogether absurd I certainly have a great deal to report both from a scientific and from an ethical point of view But now all this has taken a new and unexpected aspect and it is not worth while to trouble about mere salary Listen attentively Are you sitting down No I am standing up Sit down on the floor if there is nothing else and listen attentively Resentfully I took a chair and put it down on the floor with a bang in my anger Listen he began dictatorially The public came to day in masses There was no room left in the evening and the police came in to keep order At eight o clock that is earlier than usual the proprietor thought it necessary to close the shop and end the exhibition to count the money he had taken and prepare for to morrow more conveniently So I know there will be a regular fair to morrow So we may assume that all the most cultivated people in the capital the ladies of the best society the foreign ambassadors the leading lawyers and so on will all be present What s more people will be flowing here from the remotest provinces of our vast and interesting empire The upshot of it is that I am the cynosure of all eyes and though hidden to sight I am eminent I shall teach the idle crowd Taught by experience I shall be an example of greatness and resignation to fate I shall be so to say a pulpit from which to instruct mankind The mere biological details I can furnish about the monster I am inhabiting are of priceless value And so far from repining at what has happened I confidently hope for the most brilliant of careers You won t find it wearisome I asked sarcastically What irritated me more than anything was the extreme pomposity of his language Nevertheless it all rather disconcerted me What on earth what can this frivolous blockhead find to be so cocky about I muttered to myself He ought to be crying instead of being cocky No he answered my observation sharply for I am full of great ideas only now can I at leisure ponder over the amelioration of the lot of humanity Truth and light will come forth now from the crocodile I shall certainly develop a new economic theory of my own and I shall be proud of it which I have hitherto been prevented from doing by my official duties and by trivial distractions I shall refute everything and be a new Fourier By the way did you give Timofey Semyonitch the seven roubles Yes out of my own pocket I answered trying to emphasise that fact in my voice We will settle it he answered superciliously I confidently expect my salary to be raised for who should get a raise if not I I am of the utmost service now But to business My wife You are I suppose inquiring after Elena Ivanovna My wife he shouted this time in a positive squeal There was no help for it Meekly though gnashing my teeth I told him how I had left Elena Ivanovna He did not even hear me out I have special plans in regard to her he began impatiently If I am celebrated here I wish her to be celebrated there Savants poets philosophers foreign mineralogists statesmen after conversing in the morning with me will visit her salon in the evening From next week onwards she must have an At Home every evening With my salary doubled we shall have the means for entertaining and as the entertainment must not go beyond tea and hired footmen that s settled Both here and there they will talk of me I have long thirsted for an opportunity for being talked about but could not attain it fettered by my humble position and low grade in the service And now all this has been attained by a simple gulp on the part of the crocodile Every word of mine will be listened to every utterance will be thought over repeated printed And I ll teach them what I am worth They shall understand at last what abilities they have allowed to vanish in the entrails of a monster This man might have been Foreign Minister or might have ruled a kingdom some will say And that man did not rule a kingdom others will say In what way am I inferior to a Garnier Pagesishky or whatever they are called My wife must be a worthy second I have brains she has beauty and charm She is beautiful and that is why she is his wife some will say She is beautiful because she is his wife others will amend To be ready for anything let Elena Ivanovna buy to morrow the Encyclopaedia edited by Andrey Kraevsky that she may be able to converse on any topic Above all let her be sure to read the political leader in the Petersburg News comparing it every day with the Voice I imagine that the proprietor will consent to take me sometimes with the crocodile to my wife s brilliant salon I will be in a tank in the middle of the magnificent drawing room and I will scintillate with witticisms which I will prepare in the morning To the statesmen I will impart my projects to the poet I will speak in rhyme with the ladies I can be amusing and charming without impropriety since I shall be no danger to their husbands peace of mind To all the rest I shall serve as a pattern of resignation to fate and the will of Providence I shall make my wife a brilliant literary lady I shall bring her forward and explain her to the public as my wife she must be full of the most striking virtues and if they are right in calling Andrey Alexandrovitch our Russian Alfred de Musset they will be still more right in calling her our Russian Yevgenia Tour I must confess that although this wild nonsense was rather in Ivan Matveitch s habitual style it did occur to me that he was in a fever and delirious It was the same everyday Ivan Matveitch but magnified twenty times My friend I asked him are you hoping for a long life Tell me in fact are you well How do you eat how do you sleep how do you breathe I am your friend and you must admit that the incident is most unnatural and consequently my curiosity is most natural Idle curiosity and nothing else he pronounced sententiously but you shall be satisfied You ask how I am managing in the entrails of the monster To begin with the crocodile to my amusement turns out to be perfectly empty His inside consists of a sort of huge empty sack made of gutta percha like the elastic goods sold in the Gorohovy Street in the Morskaya and if I am not mistaken in the Voznesensky Prospect Otherwise if you think of it how could I find room Is it possible I cried in a surprise that may well be understood Can the crocodile be perfectly empty Perfectly Ivan Matveitch maintained sternly and impressively And in all probability it is so constructed by the laws of Nature The crocodile possesses nothing but jaws furnished with sharp teeth and besides the jaws a tail of considerable length that is all properly speaking The middle part between these two extremities is an empty space enclosed by something of the nature of gutta percha probably really gutta percha But the ribs the stomach the intestines the liver the heart I interrupted quite angrily There is nothing absolutely nothing of all that and probably there never has been All that is the idle fancy of frivolous travellers As one inflates an air cushion I am now with my person inflating the crocodile He is incredibly elastic Indeed you might as the friend of the family get in with me if you were generous and self sacrificing enough and even with you here there would be room to spare I even think that in the last resort I might send for Elena Ivanovna However this void hollow formation of the crocodile is quite in keeping with the teachings of natural science If for instance one had to construct a new crocodile the question would naturally present itself What is the fundamental characteristic of the crocodile The answer is clear to swallow human beings How is one in constructing the crocodile to secure that he should swallow people The answer is clearer still construct him hollow It was settled by physics long ago that Nature abhors a vacuum Hence the inside of the crocodile must be hollow so that it may abhor the vacuum and consequently swallow and so fill itself with anything it can come across And that is the sole rational cause why every crocodile swallows men It is not the same in the constitution of man the emptier a man s head is for instance the less he feels the thirst to fill it and that is the one exception to the general rule It is all as clear as day to me now I have deduced it by my own observation and experience being so to say in the very bowels of Nature in its retort listening to the throbbing of its pulse Even etymology supports me for the very word crocodile means voracity Crocodile crocodillo is evidently an Italian word dating perhaps from the Egyptian Pharaohs and evidently derived from the French verb croquer which means to eat to devour in general to absorb nourishment All these remarks I intend to deliver as my first lecture in Elena Ivanovna s salon when they take me there in the tank My friend oughtn t you at least to take some purgative I cried involuntarily He is in a fever a fever he is feverish I repeated to myself in alarm Nonsense he answered contemptuously Besides in my present position it would be most inconvenient I knew though you would be sure to talk of taking medicine But my friend how how do you take food now Have you dined to day No but I am not hungry and most likely I shall never take food again And that too is quite natural filling the whole interior of the crocodile I make him feel always full Now he need not be fed for some years On the other hand nourished by me he will naturally impart to me all the vital juices of his body it is the same as with some accomplished coquettes who embed themselves and their whole persons for the night in raw steak and then after their morning bath are fresh supple buxom and fascinating In that way nourishing the crocodile I myself obtain nourishment from him consequently we mutually nourish one another But as it is difficult even for a crocodile to digest a man like me he must no doubt be conscious of a certain weight in his stomach an organ which he does not however possess and that is why to avoid causing the creature suffering I do not often turn over and although I could turn over I do not do so from humanitarian motives This is the one drawback of my present position and in an allegorical sense Timofey Semyonitch was right in saying I was lying like a log But I will prove that even lying like a log nay that only lying like a log one can revolutionise the lot of mankind All the great ideas and movements of our newspapers and magazines have evidently been the work of men who were lying like logs that is why they call them divorced from the realities of life but what does it matter their saying that I am constructing now a complete system of my own and you wouldn t believe how easy it is You have only to creep into a secluded corner or into a crocodile to shut your eyes and you immediately devise a perfect millennium for mankind When you went away this afternoon I set to work at once and have already invented three systems now I am preparing the fourth It is true that at first one must refute everything that has gone before but from the crocodile it is so easy to refute it besides it all becomes clearer seen from the inside of the crocodile There are some drawbacks though small ones in my position however it is somewhat damp here and covered with a sort of slime moreover there is a smell of india rubber like the smell of my old galoshes That is all there are no other drawbacks Ivan Matveitch I interrupted all this is a miracle in which I can scarcely believe And can you can you intend never to dine again What trivial nonsense you are troubling about you thoughtless frivolous creature I talk to you about great ideas and you Understand that I am sufficiently nourished by the great ideas which light up the darkness in which I am enveloped The good natured proprietor has however after consulting the kindly Mutter decided with her that they will every morning insert into the monster s jaws a bent metal tube something like a whistle pipe by means of which I can absorb coffee or broth with bread soaked in it The pipe has already been bespoken in the neighbourhood but I think this is superfluous luxury I hope to live at least a thousand years if it is true that crocodiles live so long which by the way good thing I thought of it you had better look up in some natural history to morrow and tell me for I may have been mistaken and have mixed it up with some excavated monster There is only one reflection rather troubles me as I am dressed in cloth and have boots on the crocodile can obviously not digest me Besides I am alive and so am opposing the process of digestion with my whole will power for you can understand that I do not wish to be turned into what all nourishment turns into for that would be too humiliating for me But there is one thing I am afraid of in a thousand years the cloth of my coat unfortunately of Russian make may decay and then left without clothing I might perhaps in spite of my indignation begin to be digested and though by day nothing would induce me to allow it at night in my sleep when a man s will deserts him I may be overtaken by the humiliating destiny of a potato a pancake or veal Such an idea reduces me to fury This alone is an argument for the revision of the tariff and the encouragement of the importation of English cloth which is stronger and so will withstand Nature longer when one is swallowed by a crocodile At the first opportunity I will impart this idea to some statesman and at the same time to the political writers on our Petersburg dailies Let them publish it abroad I trust this will not be the only idea they will borrow from me I foresee that every morning a regular crowd of them provided with quarter roubles from the editorial office will be flocking round me to seize my ideas on the telegrams of the previous day In brief the future presents itself to me in the rosiest light Fever fever I whispered to myself My friend and freedom I asked wishing to learn his views thoroughly You are so to speak in prison while every man has a right to the enjoyment of freedom You are a fool he answered Savages love independence wise men love order and if there is no order Ivan Matveitch spare me please Hold your tongue and listen he squealed vexed at my interrupting him Never has my spirit soared as now In my narrow refuge there is only one thing that I dread the literary criticisms of the monthlies and the hiss of our satirical papers I am afraid that thoughtless visitors stupid and envious people and nihilists in general may turn me into ridicule But I will take measures I am impatiently awaiting the response of the public to morrow and especially the opinion of the newspapers You must tell me about the papers to morrow Very good to morrow I will bring a perfect pile of papers with me To morrow it is too soon to expect reports in the newspapers for it will take four days for it to be advertised But from to day come to me every evening by the back way through the yard I am intending to employ you as my secretary You shall read the newspapers and magazines to me and I will dictate to you my ideas and give you commissions Be particularly careful not to forget the foreign telegrams Let all the European telegrams be here every day But enough most likely you are sleepy by now Go home and do not think of what I said just now about criticisms I am not afraid of it for the critics themselves are in a critical position One has only to be wise and virtuous and one will certainly get on to a pedestal If not Socrates then Diogenes or perhaps both of them together that is my future role among mankind So frivolously and boastfully did Ivan Matveitch hasten to express himself before me like feverish weak willed women who as we are told by the proverb cannot keep a secret All that he told me about the crocodile struck me as most suspicious How was it possible that the crocodile was absolutely hollow I don t mind betting that he was bragging from vanity and partly to humiliate me It is true that he was an invalid and one must make allowances for invalids but I must frankly confess I never could endure Ivan Matveitch I have been trying all my life from a child up to escape from his tutelage and have not been able to A thousand times over I have been tempted to break with him altogether and every time I have been drawn to him again as though I were still hoping to prove something to him or to revenge myself on him A strange thing this friendship I can positively assert that nine tenths of my friendship for him was made up of malice On this occasion however we parted with genuine feeling Your friend a very clever man the German said to me in an undertone as he moved to see me out he had been listening all the time attentively to our conversation A propos I said while I think of it how much would you ask for your crocodile in case any one wanted to buy it Ivan Matveitch who heard the question was waiting with curiosity for the answer it was evident that he did not want the German to ask too little anyway he cleared his throat in a peculiar way on hearing my question At first the German would not listen was positively angry No one will dare my own crocodile to buy he cried furiously and turned as red as a boiled lobster Me not want to sell the crocodile I would not for the crocodile a million thalers take I took a hundred and thirty thalers from the public to day and I shall to morrow ten thousand take and then a hundred thousand every day I shall take I will not him sell Ivan Matveitch positively chuckled with satisfaction Controlling myself for I felt it was a duty to my friend I hinted coolly and reasonably to the crazy German that his calculations were not quite correct that if he makes a hundred thousand every day all Petersburg will have visited him in four days and then there will be no one left to bring him roubles that life and death are in God s hands that the crocodile may burst or Ivan Matveitch may fall ill and die and so on and so on The German grew pensive I will him drops from the chemist s get he said after pondering and will save your friend that he die not Drops are all very well I answered but consider too that the thing may get into the law courts Ivan Matveitch s wife may demand the restitution of her lawful spouse You are intending to get rich but do you intend to give Elena Ivanovna a pension No me not intend said the German in stern decision No we not intend said the Mutter with positive malignancy And so would it not be better for you to accept something now at once a secure and solid though moderate sum than to leave things to chance I ought to tell you that I am inquiring simply from curiosity The German drew the Mutter aside to consult with her in a corner where there stood a case with the largest and ugliest monkey of his collection Well you will see said Ivan Matveitch As for me I was at that moment burning with the desire first to give the German a thrashing next to give the Mutter an even sounder one and thirdly to give Ivan Matveitch the soundest thrashing of all for his boundless vanity But all this paled beside the answer of the rapacious German After consultation with the Mutter he demanded for his crocodile fifty thousand roubles in bonds of the last Russian loan with lottery voucher attached a brick house in Gorohovy Street with a chemist s shop attached and in addition the rank of Russian colonel You see Ivan Matveitch cried triumphantly I told you so Apart from this last senseless desire for the rank of a colonel he is perfectly right for he fully understands the present value of the monster he is exhibiting The economic principle before everything Upon my word I cried furiously to the German But what should you be made a colonel for What exploit have you performed What service have you done In what way have you gained military glory You are really crazy Crazy cried the German offended No a person very sensible but you very stupid I have a colonel deserved for that I have a crocodile shown and in him a live hofrath sitting And a Russian can a crocodile not show and a live hofrath in him sitting Me extremely clever man and much wish colonel to be Well good bye then Ivan Matveitch I cried shaking with fury and I went out of the crocodile room almost at a run I felt that in another minute I could not have answered for myself The unnatural expectations of these two block heads were insupportable The cold air refreshed me and somewhat moderated my indignation At last after spitting vigorously fifteen times on each side I took a cab got home undressed and flung myself into bed What vexed me more than anything was my having become his secretary Now I was to die of boredom there every evening doing the duty of a true friend I was ready to beat myself for it and I did in fact after putting out the candle and pulling up the bedclothes punch myself several times on the head and various parts of my body That somewhat relieved me and at last I fell asleep fairly soundly in fact for I was very tired All night long I could dream of nothing but monkeys but towards morning I dreamt of Elena Ivanovna IV The monkeys I dreamed about I surmise because they were shut up in the case at the German s but Elena Ivanovna was a different story I may as well say at once I loved the lady but I make haste post haste to make a qualification I loved her as a father neither more nor less I judge that because I often felt an irresistible desire to kiss her little head or her rosy cheek And though I never carried out this inclination I would not have refused even to kiss her lips And not merely her lips but her teeth which always gleamed so charmingly like two rows of pretty well matched pearls when she laughed She laughed extraordinarily often Ivan Matveitch in demonstrative moments used to call her his darling absurdity a name extremely happy and appropriate She was a perfect sugar plum and that was all one could say of her Therefore I am utterly at a loss to understand what possessed Ivan Matveitch to imagine his wife as a Russian Yevgenia Tour Anyway my dream with the exception of the monkeys left a most pleasant impression upon me and going over all the incidents of the previous day as I drank my morning cup of tea I resolved to go and see Elena Ivanovna at once on my way to the office which indeed I was bound to do as the friend of the family In a tiny little room out of the bedroom the so called little drawing room though their big drawing room was little too Elena Ivanovna was sitting in some half transparent morning wrapper on a smart little sofa before a little tea table drinking coffee out of a little cup in which she was dipping a minute biscuit She was ravishingly pretty but struck me as being at the same time rather pensive Ah that s you naughty man she said greeting me with an absent minded smile Sit down feather head have some coffee Well what were you doing yesterday Were you at the masquerade Why were you I don t go you know Besides yesterday I was visiting our captive I sighed and assumed a pious expression as I took the coffee Whom What captive Oh yes Poor fellow Well how is he bored Do you know I wanted to ask you I suppose I can ask for a divorce now A divorce I cried in indignation and almost spilled the coffee It s that swarthy fellow I thought to myself bitterly There was a certain swarthy gentleman with little moustaches who was something in the architectural line and who came far too often to see them and was extremely skilful in amusing Elena Ivanovna I must confess I hated him and there was no doubt that he had succeeded in seeing Elena Ivanovna yesterday either at the masquerade or even here and putting all sorts of nonsense into her head Why Elena Ivanovna rattled off hurriedly as though it were a lesson she had learnt if he is going to stay on in the crocodile perhaps not come back all his life while I sit waiting for him here A husband ought to live at home and not in a crocodile But this was an unforeseen occurrence I was beginning in very comprehensible agitation Oh no don t talk to me I won t listen I won t listen she cried suddenly getting quite cross You are always against me you wretch There s no doing anything with you you will never give me any advice Other people tell me that I can get a divorce because Ivan Matveitch will not get his salary now Elena Ivanovna is it you I hear I exclaimed pathetically What villain could have put such an idea into your head And divorce on such a trivial ground as a salary is quite impossible And poor Ivan Matveitch poor Ivan Matveitch is so to speak burning with love for you even in the bowels of the monster What s more he is melting away with love like a lump of sugar Yesterday while you were enjoying yourself at the masquerade he was saying that he might in the last resort send for you as his lawful spouse to join him in the entrails of the monster especially as it appears the crocodile is exceedingly roomy not only able to accommodate two but even three persons And then I told her all that interesting part of my conversation the night before with Ivan Matveitch What what she cried in surprise You want me to get into the monster too to be with Ivan Matveitch What an idea And how am I to get in there in my hat and crinoline Heavens what foolishness And what should I look like while I was getting into it and very likely there would be some one there to see me It s absurd And what should I have to eat there And and and what should I do there when Oh my goodness what will they think of next And what should I have to amuse me there You say there s a smell of gutta percha And what should I do if we quarrelled should we have to go on staying there side by side Foo how horrid I agree I agree with all those arguments my sweet Elena Ivanovna I interrupted striving to express myself with that natural enthusiasm which always overtakes a man when he feels the truth is on his side But one thing you have not appreciated in all this you have not realised that he cannot live without you if he is inviting you there that is a proof of love passionate faithful ardent love You have thought too little of his love dear Elena Ivanovna I won t I won t I won t hear anything about it waving me off with her pretty little hand with glistening pink nails that had just been washed and polished Horrid man You will reduce me to tears Get into it yourself if you like the prospect You are his friend get in and keep him company and spend your life discussing some tedious science You are wrong to laugh at this suggestion I checked the frivolous woman with dignity Ivan Matveitch has invited me as it is You of course are summoned there by duty for me it would be an act of generosity But when Ivan Matveitch described to me last night the elasticity of the crocodile he hinted very plainly that there would be room not only for you two but for me also as a friend of the family especially if I wished to join you and therefore How so the three of us cried Elena Ivanovna looking at me in surprise Why how should we are we going to be all three there together Ha ha ha How silly you both are Ha ha ha I shall certainly pinch you all the time you wretch Ha ha ha Ha ha ha And falling back on the sofa she laughed till she cried All this the tears and the laughter were so fascinating that I could not resist rushing eagerly to kiss her hand which she did not oppose though she did pinch my ears lightly as a sign of reconciliation Then we both grew very cheerful and I described to her in detail all Ivan Matveitch s plans The thought of her evening receptions and her salon pleased her very much Only I should need a great many new dresses she observed and so Ivan Matveitch must send me as much of his salary as possible and as soon as possible Only only I don t know about that she added thoughtfully How can he be brought here in the tank That s very absurd I don t want my husband to be carried about in a tank I should feel quite ashamed for my visitors to see it I don t want that no I don t By the way while I think of it was Timofey Semyonitch here yesterday Oh yes he was he came to comfort me and do you know we played cards all the time He played for sweet meats and if I lost he was to kiss my hands What a wretch he is And only fancy he almost came to the masquerade with me really He was carried away by his feelings I observed And who would not be with you you charmer Oh get along with your compliments Stay I ll give you a pinch as a parting present I ve learnt to pinch awfully well lately Well what do you say to that By the way you say Ivan Matveitch spoke several times of me yesterday N no not exactly I must say he is thinking more now of the fate of humanity and wants Oh let him You needn t go on I am sure it s fearfully boring I ll go and see him some time I shall certainly go to morrow Only not to day I ve got a headache and besides there will be such a lot of people there to day They ll say That s his wife and I shall feel ashamed Good bye You will be there this evening won t you To see him yes He asked me to go and take him the papers That s capital Go and read to him But don t come and see me to day I am not well and perhaps I may go and see some one Good bye you naughty man It s that swarthy fellow is going to see her this evening I thought At the office of course I gave no sign of being consumed by these cares and anxieties But soon I noticed some of the most progressive papers seemed to be passing particularly rapidly from hand to hand among my colleagues and were being read with an extremely serious expression of face The first one that reached me was the News sheet a paper of no particular party but humanitarian in general for which it was regarded with contempt among us though it was read Not without surprise I read in it the following paragraph Yesterday strange rumours were circulating among the spacious ways and sumptuous buildings of our vast metropolis A certain well known bon vivant of the highest society probably weary of the cuisine at Borel s and at the X Club went into the Arcade into the place where an immense crocodile recently brought to the metropolis is being exhibited and insisted on its being prepared for his dinner After bargaining with the proprietor he at once set to work to devour him that is not the proprietor a very meek and punctilious German but his crocodile cutting juicy morsels with his penknife from the living animal and swallowing them with extraordinary rapidity By degrees the whole crocodile disappeared into the vast recesses of his stomach so that he was even on the point of attacking an ichneumon a constant companion of the crocodile probably imagining that the latter would be as savoury We are by no means opposed to that new article of diet with which foreign gourmands have long been familiar We have indeed predicted that it would come English lords and travellers make up regular parties for catching crocodiles in Egypt and consume the back of the monster cooked like beefsteak with mustard onions and potatoes The French who followed in the train of Lesseps prefer the paws baked in hot ashes which they do however in opposition to the English who laugh at them Probably both ways would be appreciated among us For our part we are delighted at a new branch of industry of which our great and varied fatherland stands pre eminently in need Probably before a year is out crocodiles will be brought in hundreds to replace this first one lost in the stomach of a Petersburg gourmand And why should not the crocodile be acclimatised among us in Russia If the water of the Neva is too cold for these interesting strangers there are ponds in the capital and rivers and lakes outside it Why not breed crocodiles at Pargolovo for instance or at Pavlovsk in the Presnensky Ponds and in Samoteka in Moscow While providing agreeable wholesome nourishment for our fastidious gourmands they might at the same time entertain the ladies who walk about these ponds and instruct the children in natural history The crocodile skin might be used for making jewel cases boxes cigar cases pocket books and possibly more than one thousand saved up in the greasy notes that are peculiarly beloved of merchants might be laid by in crocodile skin We hope to return more than once to this interesting topic Though I had foreseen something of the sort yet the reckless inaccuracy of the paragraph overwhelmed me Finding no one with whom to share my impression I turned to Prohor Savvitch who was sitting opposite to me and noticed that the latter had been watching me for some time while in his hand he held the Voice as though he were on the point of passing it to me Without a word he took the News sheet from me and as he handed me the Voice he drew a line with his nail against an article to which he probably wished to call my attention This Prohor Savvitch was a very queer man a taciturn old bachelor he was not on intimate terms with any of us scarcely spoke to any one in the office always had an opinion of his own about everything but could not bear to import it to any one He lived alone Hardly any one among us had ever been in his lodging This was what I read in the Voice Every one knows that we are progressive and humanitarian and want to be on a level with Europe in this respect But in spite of all our exertions and the efforts of our paper we are still far from maturity as may be judged from the shocking incident which took place yesterday in the Arcade and which we predicted long ago A foreigner arrives in the capital bringing with him a crocodile which he begins exhibiting in the Arcade We immediately hasten to welcome a new branch of useful industry such as our powerful and varied fatherland stands in great need of Suddenly yesterday at four o clock in the afternoon a gentleman of exceptional stoutness enters the foreigner s shop in an intoxicated condition pays his entrance money and immediately without any warning leaps into the jaws of the crocodile who was forced of course to swallow him if only from an instinct of self preservation to avoid being crushed Tumbling into the inside of the crocodile the stranger at once dropped asleep Neither the shouts of the foreign proprietor nor the lamentations of his terrified family nor threats to send for the police made the slightest impression Within the crocodile was heard nothing but laughter and a promise to flay him sic though the poor mammal compelled to swallow such a mass was vainly shedding tears An uninvited guest is worse than a Tartar But in spite of the proverb the insolent visitor would not leave We do not know how to explain such barbarous incidents which prove our lack of culture and disgrace us in the eyes of foreigners The recklessness of the Russian temperament has found a fresh outlet It may be asked what was the object of the uninvited visitor A warm and comfortable abode But there are many excellent houses in the capital with very cheap and comfortable lodgings with the Neva water laid on and a staircase lighted by gas frequently with a hall porter maintained by the proprietor We would call our readers attention to the barbarous treatment of domestic animals it is difficult of course for the crocodile to digest such a mass all at once and now he lies swollen out to the size of a mountain awaiting death in insufferable agonies In Europe persons guilty of inhumanity towards domestic animals have long been punished by law But in spite of our European enlightenment in spite of our European pavements in spite of the European architecture of our houses we are still far from shaking off our time honoured traditions Though the houses are new the conventions are old And indeed the houses are not new at least the staircases in them are not We have more than once in our paper alluded to the fact that in the Petersburg Side in the house of the merchant Lukyanov the steps of the wooden staircase have decayed fallen away and have long been a danger for Afimya Skapidarov a soldier s wife who works in the house and is often obliged to go up the stairs with water or armfuls of wood At last our predictions have come true yesterday evening at half past eight Afimya Skapidarov fell down with a basin of soup and broke her leg We do not know whether Lukyanov will mend his staircase now Russians are often wise after the event but the victim of Russian carelessness has by now been taken to the hospital In the same way we shall never cease to maintain that the house porters who clear away the mud from the wooden pavement in the Viborgsky Side ought not to spatter the legs of passers by but should throw the mud up into heaps as is done in Europe and so on and so on What s this I asked in some perplexity looking at Prohor Savvitch What s the meaning of it How do you mean Why upon my word Instead of pitying Ivan Matveitch they pity the crocodile What of it They have pity even for a beast a mammal We must be up to Europe mustn t we They have a very warm feeling for crocodiles there too He he he Saying this queer old Prohor Savvitch dived into his papers and would not utter another word I stuffed the Voice and the News sheet into my pocket and collected as many old copies of the newspapers as I could find for Ivan Matveitch s diversion in the evening and though the evening was far off yet on this occasion I slipped away from the office early to go to the Arcade and look if only from a distance at what was going on there and to listen to the various remarks and currents of opinion I foresaw that there would be a regular crush there and turned up the collar of my coat to meet it I somehow felt rather shy so unaccustomed are we to publicity But I feel that I have no right to report my own prosaic feelings when faced with this remarkable and original incident BOBOK FROM SOMEBODY S DIARY Semyon Ardalyonovitch said to me all of a sudden the day before yesterday Why will you ever be sober Ivan Ivanovitch 
8328-280925-0000	train-other-500	Tell me that pray A strange requirement I did not resent it I am a timid man but here they have actually made me out mad An artist painted my portrait as it happened
8328-280925-0001	train-other-500	After all you are a literary man he said I submitted he exhibited it I read Go and look at that morbid face suggesting insanity It may be so but
8328-280925-0002	train-other-500	think of putting it so bluntly into print In print everything ought to be decorous there ought to be ideals while instead of that
none	none	 Say it indirectly at least 
8328-280925-0003	train-other-500	that s what you have style for But no he doesn t care to do it indirectly Nowadays humour and a fine style have disappeared and abuse is accepted as wit I do not resent it
8328-280925-0004	train-other-500	but God knows I am not enough of a literary man to go out of my mind
none	none	 I have written a novel it has not been published I have written articles 
8328-280925-0005	train-other-500	they have been refused Those articles I took about from one editor to another everywhere they refused them you have no salt they told me What sort of salt do you want
8328-280925-0006	train-other-500	I asked with a jeer Attic salt They did not even understand For the most part I translate from the French for the booksellers I write advertisements for shopkeepers too
8328-280925-0007	train-other-500	Unique opportunity Fine tea from our own plantations I made a nice little sum over a panegyric on his deceased excellency Pyotr Matveyitch I compiled the
8328-280925-0008	train-other-500	Art of pleasing the ladies a commission from a bookseller
none	none	 I have brought out some six little works of this kind in the course of my life I am thinking of making a collection of the bon mots of Voltaire 
8328-280925-0009	train-other-500	but am afraid it may seem a little flat to our people Voltaire s no good now nowadays we want a cudgel not Voltaire We knock each other s last teeth out nowadays
8328-280925-0010	train-other-500	Well so that s the whole extent of my literary activity
none	none	 Though indeed I do send round letters to the editors gratis and fully signed I give them all sorts of counsels and admonitions criticise and point out the true path 
8328-280925-0011	train-other-500	The letter I sent last week to an editor s office was the fortieth I had sent in the last two years I have wasted four roubles over stamps alone for them My temper is at the bottom of it all I believe
8328-280925-0012	train-other-500	that the artist who painted me did so not for the sake of literature but for the sake of two symmetrical warts on my forehead a natural phenomenon he would say They have no ideas
8328-280925-0013	train-other-500	so now they are out for phenomena And didn t he succeed in getting my warts in his portrait to the life That is what they call realism
8328-280925-0014	train-other-500	And as to madness a great many people were put down as mad among us last year And in such language
none	none	 With such original talent 
8328-280925-0015	train-other-500	and yet after all it appears however one ought to have foreseen it long ago That is rather artful so that from the point of view of pure art one may really commend it Well but after all
8328-280925-0016	train-other-500	these so called madmen have turned out cleverer than ever
none	none	 So it seems the critics can call them mad 
8328-280925-0017	train-other-500	but they cannot produce any one better The wisest of all in my opinion is he who can if only once a month call himself a fool a faculty unheard of nowadays In old days
8328-280925-0018	train-other-500	once a year at any rate a fool would recognise that he was a fool but nowadays not a bit of it And they have so muddled things up that there is no telling a fool from a wise man They have done that on purpose
8328-280925-0019	train-other-500	I remember a witty Spaniard saying when two hundred and fifty years ago the French built their first madhouses They have shut up all their fools in a house apart to make sure that they are wise men themselves
none	none	 Just so you don t show your own wisdom by shutting some one else in a madhouse 
8328-280925-0020	train-other-500	K has gone out of his mind means that we are sane now No it doesn t mean that yet Hang it though why am I maundering on I go on
8328-280925-0021	train-other-500	grumbling and grumbling Even my maidservant is sick of me Yesterday a friend came to see me Your style is changing he said it is choppy you
none	none	 chop and chop and then a parenthesis then a parenthesis in the parenthesis then you stick in something else in brackets 
8328-280925-0022	train-other-500	then you begin chopping and chopping again The friend is right Something strange is happening to me My
none	none	 character is changing and my head aches I am beginning to see and hear strange things 
8328-280925-0023	train-other-500	not voices exactly but as though some one beside me were muttering bobok bobok bobok
8328-280925-0024	train-other-500	What s the meaning of this bobok I must divert my mind I went out in search of diversion I hit upon a funeral A distant relation
8328-280925-0025	train-other-500	a collegiate counsellor however A widow and five daughters all marriageable young ladies What must it come to even to keep them in slippers Their father managed it but now there is only a little pension
8328-280925-0026	train-other-500	They will have to eat humble pie They have always received me ungraciously And indeed I should not have gone to the funeral now had it not been for a peculiar circumstance
8328-280925-0027	train-other-500	I followed the procession to the cemetery with the rest they were stuck up and held aloof from me My uniform was certainly rather shabby It s five and twenty years I believe since I was at the cemetery
8328-280925-0028	train-other-500	what a wretched place To begin with the smell There were fifteen hearses with palls varying in expensiveness there were actually two catafalques
8328-280925-0029	train-other-500	One was a general s and one some lady s There were many mourners a great deal of feigned mourning and a great deal of open gaiety The clergy have nothing to complain of it brings them a good income
8328-280925-0030	train-other-500	But the smell the smell I should not like to be one of the clergy here I kept glancing at the faces of the dead cautiously distrusting my impressionability
8328-280925-0031	train-other-500	Some had a mild expression some looked unpleasant As a rule the smiles were disagreeable and in some cases very much so I don t like them they haunt one s dreams
8328-280925-0032	train-other-500	During the service I went out of the church into the air it was a grey day but dry It was cold too but then it was October I walked about among the tombs
8328-280925-0033	train-other-500	They are of different grades The third grade cost thirty roubles it s decent and not so very dear The first two grades are tombs in the church and under the porch they cost a pretty penny
8328-280925-0034	train-other-500	On this occasion they were burying in tombs of the third grade six persons among them the general and the lady I looked into the graves and it was horrible water and
8328-280925-0035	train-other-500	such water Absolutely green and but there why talk of it The gravedigger was baling it out every minute I went out while the service was going on and strolled outside the gates
8328-280925-0036	train-other-500	Close by was an almshouse and a little further off there was a restaurant It was not a bad little restaurant there was lunch and everything There were lots of the mourners here I noticed a great deal of gaiety and genuine heartiness
8328-280925-0037	train-other-500	I had something to eat and drink Then I took part in the bearing of the coffin from the church to the grave Why is it that corpses in their coffins are so heavy
8328-280925-0038	train-other-500	They say it is due to some sort of inertia that the body is no longer directed by its owner or some nonsense of that sort in opposition to the laws of mechanics and common sense I don t
8328-280925-0039	train-other-500	like to hear people who have nothing but a general education venture to solve the problems that require special knowledge and with us that s done continually Civilians love to pass opinions about subjects that are the province of the soldier
8328-280925-0040	train-other-500	and even of the field marshal while men who have been educated as engineers prefer discussing philosophy and political economy I did not go to the requiem service I have some pride
8328-280925-0041	train-other-500	and if I am only received owing to some special necessity why force myself on their dinners even if it be a funeral dinner The only thing I don t understand is why I stayed at the cemetery
8328-280925-0042	train-other-500	I sat on a tombstone and sank into appropriate reflections I began with the Moscow exhibition and ended with reflecting upon astonishment in the abstract
8328-280925-0043	train-other-500	My deductions about astonishment were these To be surprised at everything is stupid of course and to be astonished at nothing is a great deal more becoming and for some reason accepted as good form
8328-280925-0044	train-other-500	But that is not really true To my mind to be astonished at nothing is much more stupid than to be astonished at everything And moreover to be astonished at nothing is almost the same as feeling respect for nothing
none	none	 And indeed a stupid man is incapable of feeling respect But what I desire most of all is to feel respect I thirst to feel respect one of my acquaintances said to me the other day 
8328-280925-0045	train-other-500	He thirsts to feel respect Goodness I thought what would happen to you if you dared to print that nowadays At that point I sank into forgetfulness
8328-280925-0046	train-other-500	I don t like reading the epitaphs of tombstones they are everlastingly the same An unfinished sandwich was lying on the tombstone near me stupid and inappropriate
8328-280925-0047	train-other-500	I threw it on the ground as it was not bread but only a sandwich Though I believe it is not a sin to throw bread on the earth but only on the floor I must look it up in Suvorin s calendar
8328-280925-0048	train-other-500	I suppose I sat there a long time too long a time in fact I must have lain down on a long stone which was of the shape of a marble coffin And how it happened I don t know
8328-280925-0049	train-other-500	but I began to hear things of all sorts being said At first I did not pay attention to it but treated it with contempt But the conversation went on I heard
8328-280925-0050	train-other-500	muffled sounds as though the speakers mouths were covered with a pillow and at the same time they were distinct and very near I came to myself sat up and began listening attentively
none	none	 Your Excellency it s utterly impossible 
8328-280925-0051	train-other-500	You led hearts I return your lead and here you play the seven of diamonds You ought to have given me a hint about diamonds What play by hard and fast rules Where is the charm of that
none	none	 You must your Excellency 
8328-280925-0052	train-other-500	One can t do anything without something to go upon We must play with dummy let one hand not be turned up Well you won t find a dummy here What conceited words
8328-280925-0053	train-other-500	And it was queer and unexpected One was such a ponderous dignified voice the other softly suave I should not have believed it if I had not heard it myself
8328-280925-0054	train-other-500	I had not been to the requiem dinner I believe And yet how could they be playing preference here and what general was this That the sounds came from under the tombstones of that there could be no doubt
8328-280925-0055	train-other-500	I bent down and read on the tomb Here lies the body of Major General Pervoyedov
none	none	 a cavalier of such and such orders Hm 
8328-280925-0056	train-other-500	Passed away in August of this year fifty seven
none	none	 Rest beloved ashes till the joyful dawn Hm 
8328-280925-0057	train-other-500	dash it it really is a general There was no monument on the grave from which the obsequious voice came there was only a tombstone He must have been a fresh arrival From his voice he was a lower court councillor
none	none	 Oh ho ho ho I heard in a new voice a dozen yards from the general s resting place coming from quite a fresh grave 
8328-280925-0058	train-other-500	The voice belonged to a man and a plebeian mawkish with its affectation of religious fervour
none	none	 Oh ho ho ho 
8328-280925-0059	train-other-500	Oh here he is hiccupping again cried the haughty and disdainful voice of an irritated lady apparently of the highest society It is an affliction to be by this shopkeeper
8328-280925-0060	train-other-500	I didn t hiccup why I ve had nothing to eat It s simply my nature
none	none	 Really madam you don t seem able to get rid of your caprices here 
8328-280925-0061	train-other-500	Then why did you come and lie down here
none	none	 They put me here my wife and little children put me here I did not lie down here of myself 
8328-280925-0062	train-other-500	The mystery of death And I would not have lain down beside you not for any money I lie here as befitting my fortune judging by the price
8328-280925-0063	train-other-500	For we can always do that pay for a tomb of the third grade You made money I suppose You fleeced people
none	none	 Fleece you indeed We haven t seen the colour of your money since January 
8328-280925-0064	train-other-500	There s a little bill against you at the shop Well that s really stupid to try and recover debts here is too stupid to my thinking Go to the surface Ask my niece she is my heiress
none	none	 There s no asking any one now and no going anywhere 
8328-280925-0065	train-other-500	We have both reached our limit and before the judgment seat of God are equal in our sins
none	none	 In our sins 
8328-280925-0066	train-other-500	the lady mimicked him contemptuously Don t dare to speak to me Oh ho ho ho You see the shopkeeper obeys the lady your Excellency
8328-280925-0067	train-other-500	Why shouldn t he Why your Excellency because as we all know things are different here Different How
none	none	 We are 
8328-280925-0068	train-other-500	dead so to speak your Excellency Oh yes But still Well this is an entertainment it is a fine show I must say
8328-280925-0069	train-other-500	If it has come to this down here what can one expect on the surface But what a queer business I went on listening however though with extreme indignation
none	none	 Yes I should like a taste of life Yes you know 
8328-280925-0070	train-other-500	I should like a taste of life I heard a new voice suddenly somewhere in the space between the general and the irritable lady
8328-280925-0071	train-other-500	Do you hear your Excellency our friend is at the same game again For three days at a time he says nothing and then he bursts out with
none	none	 I should like a taste of life yes a taste of life And with such appetite he he 
8328-280925-0072	train-other-500	And such frivolity It gets hold of him your Excellency and do you know he is growing sleepy quite sleepy
none	none	 he has been here since April and then all of a sudden 
8328-280925-0073	train-other-500	I should like a taste of life It is rather dull though observed his Excellency It is your Excellency
none	none	 Shall we tease Avdotya Ignatyevna again he he 
8328-280925-0074	train-other-500	No spare me please I can t endure that quarrelsome virago
none	none	 And I can t endure either of you 
8328-280925-0075	train-other-500	cried the virago disdainfully You are both of you bores and can t tell me anything ideal I know one little story about you your Excellency don t turn up your nose please

8328-280925-0093	train-other-500	There s a complication and I died suddenly before morning Oh oh Well there s no help for it young man the general observed graciously evidently pleased at a new arrival

none	none	 Major General Vassili Vassilitch Pervoyedov at your service Oh no no Certainly not I was at Schultz s I had a complication you know at first it was my chest and a cough and then I caught a cold my lungs and influenza and all of a sudden quite unexpectedly the worst of all was its being so unexpected You say it began with the chest the government clerk put in suavely as though he wished to reassure the new arrival Yes my chest and catarrh and then no catarrh but still the chest 
8328-280925-0095	train-other-500	and I couldn t breathe and you know
none	none	 I know I know But if it was the chest you ought to have gone to Ecke and not to Schultz 
8328-280925-0096	train-other-500	You know I kept meaning to go to Botkin s and all at once Botkin is quite prohibitive observed the general Oh no he is not forbidding at all I ve heard he is so attentive and foretells everything beforehand

none	none	 Oh not at all he only asks three roubles 
8328-280925-0098	train-other-500	and he makes such an examination and gives you a prescription and I was very anxious to see him for I have been told Well gentlemen had I better go to Ecke or to Botkin What To whom
8328-280925-0099	train-other-500	The general s corpse shook with agreeable laughter The government clerk echoed it in falsetto Dear boy dear delightful boy how I love you
8328-280925-0100	train-other-500	Avdotya Ignatyevna squealed ecstatically I wish they had put some one like you next to me No that was too much And these were the dead of our times
8328-280925-0101	train-other-500	Still I ought to listen to more and not be in too great a hurry to draw conclusions That snivelling new arrival I remember him just now in his coffin had the expression of a frightened chicken
8328-280925-0102	train-other-500	the most revolting expression in the world However let us wait and see But what happened next was such a Bedlam that I could not keep it all in my memory For a great many woke up at once
8328-280925-0103	train-other-500	an official a civil councillor woke up and began discussing at once the project of a new sub committee in a government department and of the probable transfer of various functionaries in connection with the sub committee
8328-280925-0104	train-other-500	which very greatly interested the general I must confess I learnt a great deal that was new myself so much so that I marvelled at the channels by which one may sometimes in the metropolis learn government news
8328-280925-0105	train-other-500	Then an engineer half woke up but for a long time muttered absolute nonsense so that our friends left off worrying him and let him lie till he was ready At last the distinguished lady who had been buried in the morning under the catafalque
8328-280925-0106	train-other-500	showed symptoms of the reanimation of the tomb Lebeziatnikov for the obsequious lower court councillor whom I detested and who lay beside General Pervoyedov was called it appears Lebeziatnikov
8328-280925-0107	train-other-500	became much excited and surprised that they were all waking up so soon this time I must own I was surprised too though some of those who woke had been buried for three days as for instance a very young girl of sixteen who kept
8328-280925-0108	train-other-500	giggling giggling in a horrible and predatory way Your Excellency privy councillor Tarasevitch is waking Lebeziatnikov announced with extreme fussiness Eh What
8328-280925-0109	train-other-500	the privy councillor waking up suddenly mumbled with a lisp of disgust There was a note of ill humoured peremptoriness in the sound of his voice I listened with curiosity
8328-280925-0110	train-other-500	for during the last few days I had heard something about Tarasevitch shocking and upsetting in the extreme It s I your Excellency so far only I
none	none	 What is your petition What do you want Merely to inquire after your Excellency s health in these unaccustomed surroundings 
8328-280925-0111	train-other-500	every one feels at first as it were oppressed General Pervoyedov wishes to have the honour of making your Excellency s acquaintance and hopes
none	none	 I ve never heard of him 
8328-280925-0112	train-other-500	Surely your Excellency General Pervoyedov Vassili Vassilitch Are you General Pervoyedov No your Excellency
8328-280925-0113	train-other-500	I am only the lower court councillor Lebeziatnikov at your service but General Pervoyedov Nonsense And I beg you to leave me alone Let him be
8328-280925-0114	train-other-500	General Pervoyedov at last himself checked with dignity the disgusting officiousness of his sycophant in the grave He is not fully awake your Excellency you must consider that
8328-280925-0115	train-other-500	it s the novelty of it all When he is fully awake he will take it differently
none	none	 Let him be 
8328-280925-0116	train-other-500	repeated the general Vassili Vassilitch Hey your Excellency a perfectly new voice shouted loudly and aggressively from close beside Avdotya Ignatyevna
8328-280925-0117	train-other-500	It was a voice of gentlemanly insolence with the languid pronunciation now fashionable and an arrogant drawl I ve been watching you all for the last two hours Do you remember me Vassili Vassilitch
none	none	 My name is Klinevitch we met at the Volokonskys where you too were received as a guest 
8328-280925-0118	train-other-500	I am sure I don t know why What Count Pyotr Petrovitch Can it be really you and at such an early age How sorry I am to hear it
8328-280925-0119	train-other-500	Oh I am sorry myself
none	none	 though I really don t mind 
8328-280925-0120	train-other-500	and I want to amuse myself as far as I can everywhere And I am not a count but a baron only a baron We are only a set of scurvy barons risen from being flunkeys but why I don t know
8328-280925-0121	train-other-500	and I don t care I am only a scoundrel of the pseudo aristocratic society and I am regarded as a charming
none	none	 polis son My father is a wretched little general and my mother was at one time received en haut lieu With the help of the Jew Zifel I forged fifty thousand rouble notes last year and then I informed against him while Julie Charpentier de Lusignan carried off the money to Bordeaux 
8328-280925-0122	train-other-500	And only fancy I was engaged to be married to a girl still at school three months under sixteen with a dowry of ninety thousand Avdotya Ignatyevna
none	none	 do you remember how you seduced me fifteen years ago when I was a boy of fourteen in the Corps des Pages 
8328-280925-0123	train-other-500	Ah that s you you rascal Well you are a godsend anyway for here
none	none	 You were mistaken in suspecting your neighbour the business gentleman of unpleasant fragrance I said nothing but I laughed 
8328-280925-0124	train-other-500	The stench came from me they had to bury me in a nailed up coffin
none	none	 Ugh you horrid creature 
8328-280925-0125	train-other-500	Still I am glad you are here you can t imagine the lack of life and wit here Quite so quite so and I intend to start here something original Your Excellency
8328-280925-0126	train-other-500	I don t mean you Pervoyedov your Excellency the other one Tarasevitch the privy councillor
none	none	 Answer I am Klinevitch who took you to Mlle Furie in Lent do you hear I do Klinevitch and I am delighted and trust me I wouldn t trust you with a halfpenny and I don t care 
8328-280925-0127	train-other-500	I simply want to kiss you dear old man but luckily I can t
none	none	 Do you know gentlemen 
8328-280925-0128	train-other-500	what this grand pere s little game was He died three or four days ago
none	none	 and would you believe it he left a deficit of four hundred thousand government money from the fund for widows and orphans 
8328-280925-0129	train-other-500	He was the sole person in control of it for some reason so that his accounts were not audited for the last eight years I can fancy what long faces they all have now and what they call him
8328-280925-0130	train-other-500	It s a delectable thought isn t it I have been wondering for the last year how a wretched old man of seventy gouty and rheumatic succeeded in preserving the physical energy for his debaucheries
8328-280925-0131	train-other-500	and now the riddle is solved Those widows and orphans the very thought of them must have egged him on I knew about it long ago I was the only one who did know it was Julie told me
8328-280925-0132	train-other-500	and as soon as I discovered it I attacked him in a friendly way at once in Easter week Give me twenty five thousand if you don t they ll look into your accounts to morrow
none	none	 And just fancy 
8328-280925-0133	train-other-500	he had only thirteen thousand left then so it seems it was very apropos his dying now Grand pere grand pere do you hear
none	none	 Cher Klinevitch 
8328-280925-0134	train-other-500	I quite agree with you and there was no need for you to go into such details Life is so full of suffering and torment and so little to make up for it
8328-280925-0135	train-other-500	that I wanted at last to be at rest and so far as I can see I hope to get all I can from here too
none	none	 I bet that he has already sniffed Katiche Berestov 
8328-280925-0136	train-other-500	Who What Katiche There was a rapacious quiver in the old man s voice
none	none	 A ah what Katiche 
8328-280925-0137	train-other-500	Why here on the left five paces from me and ten from you
none	none	 She has been here for five days and if only you knew grand pere what a little wretch she is 
8328-280925-0138	train-other-500	Of good family and breeding and a monster a regular monster I did not introduce her to any one there I was the only one who knew her Katiche
none	none	 answer He he he the girl responded with a jangling laugh in which there was a note of something as sharp as the prick of a needle He he 
8328-280925-0139	train-other-500	he And a little blonde
none	none	 the grand pere faltered drawling out the syllables He he he I have long I have long 
8328-280925-0140	train-other-500	the old man faltered breathlessly cherished the dream of a little fair thing of fifteen and just in such surroundings Ach the monster
8328-280925-0141	train-other-500	cried Avdotya Ignatyevna Enough
none	none	 Klinevitch decided I see there is excellent material We shall soon arrange things better The great thing is to spend the rest of our time cheerfully but what time Hey you government clerk Lebeziatnikov or whatever it is I hear that s your name Semyon Yevseitch Lebeziatnikov lower court councillor at your service very very very much delighted to meet you I don t care whether you are delighted or not but you seem to know everything here Tell me first of all how it is we can talk I ve been wondering ever since yesterday We are dead and yet we are talking and seem to be moving and yet we are not talking and not moving What jugglery is this If you want an explanation baron Platon Nikolaevitch could give you one better than I What Platon Nikolaevitch is that To the point Don t beat about the bush Platon Nikolaevitch is our home grown philosopher scientist and Master of Arts He has brought out several philosophical works but for the last three months he has been getting quite drowsy and there is no stirring him up now Once a week he mutters something utterly irrelevant To the point to the point He explains all this by the simplest fact namely that when we were living on the surface we mistakenly thought that death there was death The body revives as it were here the remains of life are concentrated but only in consciousness I don t know how to express it but life goes on as it were by inertia In his opinion everything is concentrated somewhere in consciousness and goes on for two or three months sometimes even for half a year There is one here for instance who is almost completely decomposed but once every six weeks he suddenly utters one word quite senseless of course about some bobok one Bobok bobok but you see that an imperceptible speck of life is still warm within him Footnote one i e small bean It s rather stupid Well and how is it I have no sense of smell and yet I feel there s a stench That he he Well on that point our philosopher is a bit foggy It s apropos of smell he said that the stench one perceives here is so to speak moral he he It s the stench of the soul he says that in these two or three months it may have time to recover itself and this is so to speak the last mercy Only I think baron that these are mystic ravings very excusable in his position Enough all the rest of it I am sure is nonsense The great thing is that we have two or three months more of life and then bobok I propose to spend these two months as agreeably as possible and so to arrange everything on a new basis Gentlemen I propose to cast aside all shame Ah let us cast aside all shame let us many voices could be heard saying and strange to say several new voices were audible which must have belonged to others newly awakened The engineer now fully awake boomed out his agreement with peculiar delight The girl Katiche giggled gleefully Oh how I long to cast off all shame Avdotya Ignatyevna exclaimed rapturously I say if Avdotya Ignatyevna wants to cast off all shame No no no Klinevitch I was ashamed up there all the same but here I should like to cast off shame I should like it awfully I understand Klinevitch boomed the engineer that you want to rearrange life here on new and rational principles Oh I don t care a hang about that For that we ll wait for Kudeyarov who was brought here yesterday When he wakes he ll tell you all about it He is such a personality such a titanic personality To morrow they ll bring along another natural scientist I believe an officer for certain and three or four days later a journalist and I believe his editor with him But deuce take them all there will be a little group of us anyway and things will arrange themselves Though meanwhile I don t want us to be telling lies That s all I care about for that is one thing that matters One cannot exist on the surface without lying for life and lying are synonymous but here we will amuse ourselves by not lying Hang it all the grave has some value after all We ll all tell our stories aloud and we won t be ashamed of anything First of all I ll tell you about myself I am one of the predatory kind you know All that was bound and held in check by rotten cords up there on the surface Away with cords and let us spend these two months in shameless truthfulness Let us strip and be naked Let us be naked let us be naked cried all the voices I long to be naked I long to be Avdotya Ignatyevna shrilled Ah ah I see we shall have fun here I don t want Ecke after all No I tell you Give me a taste of life He he he giggled Katiche The great thing is that no one can interfere with us and though I see Pervoyedov is in a temper he can t reach me with his hand Grand pere do you agree I fully agree fully and with the utmost satisfaction but on condition that Katiche is the first to give us her biography I protest I protest with all my heart General Pervoyedov brought out firmly Your Excellency the scoundrel Lebeziatnikov persuaded him in a murmur of fussy excitement your Excellency it will be to our advantage to agree Here you see there s this girl s and all their little affairs There s the girl it s true but It s to our advantage your Excellency upon my word it is If only as an experiment let us try it Even in the grave they won t let us rest in peace In the first place General you were playing preference in the grave and in the second we don t care a hang about you drawled Klinevitch Sir I beg you not to forget yourself What Why you can t get at me and I can tease you from here as though you were Julie s lapdog And another thing gentlemen how is he a general here He was a general there but here is mere refuse No not mere refuse Even here Here you will rot in the grave and six brass buttons will be all that will be left of you Bravo Klinevitch ha ha ha roared voices I have served my sovereign I have the sword Your sword is only fit to prick mice and you never drew it even for that That makes no difference I formed a part of the whole There are all sorts of parts in a whole Bravo Klinevitch bravo Ha ha ha I don t understand what the sword stands for boomed the engineer We shall run away from the Prussians like mice they ll crush us to powder cried a voice in the distance that was unfamiliar to me that was positively spluttering with glee The sword sir is an honour the general cried but only I heard him There arose a prolonged and furious roar clamour and hubbub and only the hysterically impatient squeals of Avdotya Ignatyevna were audible But do let us make haste Ah when are we going to begin to cast off all shame Oh ho ho The soul does in truth pass through torments exclaimed the voice of the plebeian and And here I suddenly sneezed It happened suddenly and unintentionally but the effect was striking all became as silent as one expects it to be in a churchyard it all vanished like a dream A real silence of the tomb set in I don t believe they were ashamed on account of my presence they had made up their minds to cast off all shame I waited five minutes not a word not a sound It cannot be supposed that they were afraid of my informing the police for what could the police do to them I must conclude that they had some secret unknown to the living which they carefully concealed from every mortal Well my dears I thought I shall visit you again And with those words I left the cemetery No that I cannot admit no I really cannot The bobok case does not trouble me so that is what that bobok signified Depravity in such a place depravity of the last aspirations depravity of sodden and rotten corpses and not even sparing the last moments of consciousness Those moments have been granted vouchsafed to them and and worst of all in such a place No that I cannot admit I shall go to other tombs I shall listen everywhere Certainly one ought to listen everywhere and not merely at one spot in order to form an idea Perhaps one may come across something reassuring But I shall certainly go back to those They promised their biographies and anecdotes of all sorts Tfoo But I shall go I shall certainly go it is a question of conscience I shall take it to the Citizen the editor there has had his portrait exhibited too Maybe he will print it THE DREAM OF A RIDICULOUS MAN I I am a ridiculous person Now they call me a madman That would be a promotion if it were not that I remain as ridiculous in their eyes as before But now I do not resent it they are all dear to me now even when they laugh at me and indeed it is just then that they are particularly dear to me I could join in their laughter not exactly at myself but through affection for them if I did not feel so sad as I look at them Sad because they do not know the truth and I do know it Oh how hard it is to be the only one who knows the truth But they won t understand that No they won t understand it In old days I used to be miserable at seeming ridiculous Not seeming but being I have always been ridiculous and I have known it perhaps from the hour I was born Perhaps from the time I was seven years old I knew I was ridiculous Afterwards I went to school studied at the university and do you know the more I learned the more thoroughly I understood that I was ridiculous So that it seemed in the end as though all the sciences I studied at the university existed only to prove and make evident to me as I went more deeply into them that I was ridiculous It was the same with life as it was with science With every year the same consciousness of the ridiculous figure I cut in every relation grew and strengthened Every one always laughed at me But not one of them knew or guessed that if there were one man on earth who knew better than anybody else that I was absurd it was myself and what I resented most of all was that they did not know that But that was my own fault I was so proud that nothing would have ever induced me to tell it to any one This pride grew in me with the years and if it had happened that I allowed myself to confess to any one that I was ridiculous I believe that I should have blown out my brains the same evening Oh how I suffered in my early youth from the fear that I might give way and confess it to my schoolfellows But since I grew to manhood I have for some unknown reason become calmer though I realised my awful characteristic more fully every year I say unknown for to this day I cannot tell why it was Perhaps it was owing to the terrible misery that was growing in my soul through something which was of more consequence than anything else about me that something was the conviction that had come upon me that nothing in the world mattered I had long had an inkling of it but the full realisation came last year almost suddenly I suddenly felt that it was all the same to me whether the world existed or whether there had never been anything at all I began to feel with all my being that there was nothing existing At first I fancied that many things had existed in the past but afterwards I guessed that there never had been anything in the past either but that it had only seemed so for some reason Little by little I guessed that there would be nothing in the future either Then I left off being angry with people and almost ceased to notice them Indeed this showed itself even in the pettiest trifles I used for instance to knock against people in the street And not so much from being lost in thought what had I to think about I had almost given up thinking by that time nothing mattered to me If at least I had solved my problems Oh I had not settled one of them and how many they were But I gave up caring about anything and all the problems disappeared And it was after that that I found out the truth I learnt the truth last November on the third of November to be precise and I remember every instant since It was a gloomy evening one of the gloomiest possible evenings I was going home at about eleven o clock and I remember that I thought that the evening could not be gloomier Even physically Rain had been falling all day and it had been a cold gloomy almost menacing rain with I remember an unmistakable spite against mankind Suddenly between ten and eleven it had stopped and was followed by a horrible dampness colder and damper than the rain and a sort of steam was rising from everything from every stone in the street and from every by lane if one looked down it as far as one could A thought suddenly occurred to me that if all the street lamps had been put out it would have been less cheerless that the gas made one s heart sadder because it lighted it all up I had had scarcely any dinner that day and had been spending the evening with an engineer and two other friends had been there also I sat silent I fancy I bored them They talked of something rousing and suddenly they got excited over it But they did not really care I could see that and only made a show of being excited I suddenly said as much to them My friends I said you really do not care one way or the other They were not offended but they all laughed at me That was because I spoke without any note of reproach simply because it did not matter to me They saw it did not and it amused them As I was thinking about the gas lamps in the street I looked up at the sky The sky was horribly dark but one could distinctly see tattered clouds and between them fathomless black patches Suddenly I noticed in one of these patches a star and began watching it intently That was because that star gave me an idea I decided to kill myself that night I had firmly determined to do so two months before and poor as I was I bought a splendid revolver that very day and loaded it But two months had passed and it was still lying in my drawer I was so utterly indifferent that I wanted to seize a moment when I would not be so indifferent why I don t know And so for two months every night that I came home I thought I would shoot myself I kept waiting for the right moment And so now this star gave me a thought I made up my mind that it should certainly be that night And why the star gave me the thought I don t know And just as I was looking at the sky this little girl took me by the elbow The street was empty and there was scarcely any one to be seen A cabman was sleeping in the distance in his cab It was a child of eight with a kerchief on her head wearing nothing but a wretched little dress all soaked with rain but I noticed particularly her wet broken shoes and I recall them now They caught my eye particularly She suddenly pulled me by the elbow and called me She was not weeping but was spasmodically crying out some words which she could not utter properly because she was shivering and shuddering all over She was in terror about something and kept crying Mammy mammy I turned facing her I did not say a word and went on but she ran pulling at me and there was that note in her voice which in frightened children means despair I know that sound Though she did not articulate the words I understood that her mother was dying or that something of the sort was happening to them and that she had run out to call some one to find something to help her mother I did not go with her on the contrary I had an impulse to drive her away I told her first to go to a policeman But clasping her hands she ran beside me sobbing and gasping and would not leave me Then I stamped my foot and shouted at her She called out Sir sir but suddenly abandoned me and rushed headlong across the road Some other passer by appeared there and she evidently flew from me to him I mounted up to my fifth storey I have a room in a flat where there are other lodgers My room is small and poor with a garret window in the shape of a semicircle I have a sofa covered with American leather a table with books on it two chairs and a comfortable arm chair as old as old can be but of the good old fashioned shape I sat down lighted the candle and began thinking In the room next to mine through the partition wall a perfect Bedlam was going on It had been going on for the last three days A retired captain lived there and he had half a dozen visitors gentlemen of doubtful reputation drinking vodka and playing stoss with old cards The night before there had been a fight and I know that two of them had been for a long time engaged in dragging each other about by the hair The landlady wanted to complain but she was in abject terror of the captain There was only one other lodger in the flat a thin little regimental lady on a visit to Petersburg with three little children who had been taken ill since they came into the lodgings Both she and her children were in mortal fear of the captain and lay trembling and crossing themselves all night and the youngest child had a sort of fit from fright That captain I know for a fact sometimes stops people in the Nevsky Prospect and begs They won t take him into the service but strange to say that s why I am telling this all this month that the captain has been here his behaviour has caused me no annoyance I have of course tried to avoid his acquaintance from the very beginning and he too was bored with me from the first but I never care how much they shout the other side of the partition nor how many of them there are in there I sit up all night and forget them so completely that I do not even hear them I stay awake till daybreak and have been going on like that for the last year I sit up all night in my arm chair at the table doing nothing I only read by day I sit don t even think ideas of a sort wander through my mind and I let them come and go as they will A whole candle is burnt every night I sat down quietly at the table took out the revolver and put it down before me When I had put it down I asked myself I remember Is that so and answered with complete conviction It is That is I shall shoot myself I knew that I should shoot myself that night for certain but how much longer I should go on sitting at the table I did not know And no doubt I should have shot myself if it had not been for that little girl II You see though nothing mattered to me I could feel pain for instance If any one had struck me it would have hurt me It was the same morally if anything very pathetic happened I should have felt pity just as I used to do in old days when there were things in life that did matter to me I had felt pity that evening I should have certainly helped a child Why then had I not helped the little girl Because of an idea that occurred to me at the time when she was calling and pulling at me a question suddenly arose before me and I could not settle it The question was an idle one but I was vexed I was vexed at the reflection that if I were going to make an end of myself that night nothing in life ought to have mattered to me Why was it that all at once I did not feel that nothing mattered and was sorry for the little girl I remember that I was very sorry for her so much so that I felt a strange pang quite incongruous in my position Really I do not know better how to convey my fleeting sensation at the moment but the sensation persisted at home when I was sitting at the table and I was very much irritated as I had not been for a long time past One reflection followed another I saw clearly that so long as I was still a human being and not nothingness I was alive and so could suffer be angry and feel shame at my actions So be it But if I am going to kill myself in two hours say what is the little girl to me and what have I to do with shame or with anything else in the world I shall turn into nothing absolutely nothing And can it really be true that the consciousness that I shall completely cease to exist immediately and so everything else will cease to exist does not in the least affect my feeling of pity for the child nor the feeling of shame after a contemptible action I stamped and shouted at the unhappy child as though to say not only I feel no pity but even if I behave inhumanly and contemptibly I am free to for in another two hours everything will be extinguished Do you believe that that was why I shouted that I am almost convinced of it now It seemed clear to me that life and the world somehow depended upon me now I may almost say that the world now seemed created for me alone if I shot myself the world would cease to be at least for me I say nothing of its being likely that nothing will exist for any one when I am gone and that as soon as my consciousness is extinguished the whole world will vanish too and become void like a phantom as a mere appurtenance of my consciousness for possibly all this world and all these people are only me myself I remember that as I sat and reflected I turned all these new questions that swarmed one after another quite the other way and thought of something quite new For instance a strange reflection suddenly occurred to me that if I had lived before on the moon or on Mars and there had committed the most disgraceful and dishonourable action and had there been put to such shame and ignominy as one can only conceive and realise in dreams in nightmares and if finding myself afterwards on earth I were able to retain the memory of what I had done on the other planet and at the same time knew that I should never under any circumstances return there then looking from the earth to the moon should I care or not Should I feel shame for that action or not These were idle and superfluous questions for the revolver was already lying before me and I knew in every fibre of my being that it would happen for certain but they excited me and I raged I could not die now without having first settled something In short the child had saved me for I put off my pistol shot for the sake of these questions Meanwhile the clamour had begun to subside in the captain s room they had finished their game were settling down to sleep and meanwhile were grumbling and languidly winding up their quarrels At that point I suddenly fell asleep in my chair at the table a thing which had never happened to me before I dropped asleep quite unawares Dreams as we all know are very queer things some parts are presented with appalling vividness with details worked up with the elaborate finish of jewellery while others one gallops through as it were without noticing them at all as for instance through space and time Dreams seem to be spurred on not by reason but by desire not by the head but by the heart and yet what complicated tricks my reason has played sometimes in dreams what utterly incomprehensible things happen to it My brother died five years ago for instance I sometimes dream of him he takes part in my affairs we are very much interested and yet all through my dream I quite know and remember that my brother is dead and buried How is it that I am not surprised that though he is dead he is here beside me and working with me Why is it that my reason fully accepts it But enough I will begin about my dream Yes I dreamed a dream my dream of the third of November They tease me now telling me it was only a dream But does it matter whether it was a dream or reality if the dream made known to me the truth If once one has recognised the truth and seen it you know that it is the truth and that there is no other and there cannot be whether you are asleep or awake Let it be a dream so be it but that real life of which you make so much I had meant to extinguish by suicide and my dream my dream oh it revealed to me a different life renewed grand and full of power Listen III I have mentioned that I dropped asleep unawares and even seemed to be still reflecting on the same subjects I suddenly dreamt that I picked up the revolver and aimed it straight at my heart my heart and not my head and I had determined beforehand to fire at my head at my right temple After aiming at my chest I waited a second or two and suddenly my candle my table and the wall in front of me began moving and heaving I made haste to pull the trigger In dreams you sometimes fall from a height or are stabbed or beaten but you never feel pain unless perhaps you really bruise yourself against the bedstead then you feel pain and almost always wake up from it It was the same in my dream I did not feel any pain but it seemed as though with my shot everything within me was shaken and everything was suddenly dimmed and it grew horribly black around me I seemed to be blinded and benumbed and I was lying on something hard stretched on my back I saw nothing and could not make the slightest movement People were walking and shouting around me the captain bawled the landlady shrieked and suddenly another break and I was being carried in a closed coffin And I felt how the coffin was shaking and reflected upon it and for the first time the idea struck me that I was dead utterly dead I knew it and had no doubt of it I could neither see nor move and yet I was feeling and reflecting But I was soon reconciled to the position and as one usually does in a dream accepted the facts without disputing them And now I was buried in the earth They all went away I was left alone utterly alone I did not move Whenever before I had imagined being buried the one sensation I associated with the grave was that of damp and cold So now I felt that I was very cold especially the tips of my toes but I felt nothing else I lay still strange to say I expected nothing accepting without dispute that a dead man had nothing to expect But it was damp I don t know how long a time passed whether an hour or several days or many days But all at once a drop of water fell on my closed left eye making its way through a coffin lid it was followed a minute later by a second then a minute later by a third and so on regularly every minute There was a sudden glow of profound indignation in my heart and I suddenly felt in it a pang of physical pain That s my wound I thought that s the bullet And drop after drop every minute kept falling on my closed eyelid And all at once not with my voice but with my whole being I called upon the power that was responsible for all that was happening to me Whoever you may be if you exist and if anything more rational than what is happening here is possible suffer it to be here now But if you are revenging yourself upon me for my senseless suicide by the hideousness and absurdity of this subsequent existence then let me tell you that no torture could ever equal the contempt which I shall go on dumbly feeling though my martyrdom may last a million years I made this appeal and held my peace There was a full minute of unbroken silence and again another drop fell but I knew with infinite unshakable certainty that everything would change immediately And behold my grave suddenly was rent asunder that is I don t know whether it was opened or dug up but I was caught up by some dark and unknown being and we found ourselves in space I suddenly regained my sight It was the dead of night and never never had there been such darkness We were flying through space far away from the earth I did not question the being who was taking me I was proud and waited I assured myself that I was not afraid and was thrilled with ecstasy at the thought that I was not afraid I do not know how long we were flying I cannot imagine it happened as it always does in dreams when you skip over space and time and the laws of thought and existence and only pause upon the points for which the heart yearns I remember that I suddenly saw in the darkness a star Is that Sirius I asked impulsively though I had not meant to ask any questions No that is the star you saw between the clouds when you were coming home the being who was carrying me replied I knew that it had something like a human face Strange to say I did not like that being in fact I felt an intense aversion for it I had expected complete non existence and that was why I had put a bullet through my heart And here I was in the hands of a creature not human of course but yet living existing And so there is life beyond the grave I thought with the strange frivolity one has in dreams But in its inmost depth my heart remained unchanged And if I have got to exist again I thought and live once more under the control of some irresistible power I won t be vanquished and humiliated You know that I am afraid of you and despise me for that I said suddenly to my companion unable to refrain from the humiliating question which implied a confession and feeling my humiliation stab my heart as with a pin He did not answer my question but all at once I felt that he was not even despising me but was laughing at me and had no compassion for me and that our journey had an unknown and mysterious object that concerned me only Fear was growing in my heart Something was mutely and painfully communicated to me from my silent companion and permeated my whole being We were flying through dark unknown space I had for some time lost sight of the constellations familiar to my eyes I knew that there were stars in the heavenly spaces the light of which took thousands or millions of years to reach the earth Perhaps we were already flying through those spaces I expected something with a terrible anguish that tortured my heart And suddenly I was thrilled by a familiar feeling that stirred me to the depths I suddenly caught sight of our sun I knew that it could not be our sun that gave life to our earth and that we were an infinite distance from our sun but for some reason I knew in my whole being that it was a sun exactly like ours a duplicate of it A sweet thrilling feeling resounded with ecstasy in my heart the kindred power of the same light which had given me light stirred an echo in my heart and awakened it and I had a sensation of life the old life of the past for the first time since I had been in the grave But if that is the sun if that is exactly the same as our sun I cried where is the earth And my companion pointed to a star twinkling in the distance with an emerald light We were flying straight towards it And are such repetitions possible in the universe Can that be the law of Nature And if that is an earth there can it be just the same earth as ours just the same as poor as unhappy but precious and beloved for ever arousing in the most ungrateful of her children the same poignant love for her that we feel for our earth I cried out shaken by irresistible ecstatic love for the old familiar earth which I had left The image of the poor child whom I had repulsed flashed through my mind You shall see it all answered my companion and there was a note of sorrow in his voice But we were rapidly approaching the planet It was growing before my eyes I could already distinguish the ocean the outline of Europe and suddenly a feeling of a great and holy jealousy glowed in my heart How can it be repeated and what for I love and can love only that earth which I have left stained with my blood when in my ingratitude I quenched my life with a bullet in my heart But I have never never ceased to love that earth and perhaps on the very night I parted from it I loved it more than ever Is there suffering upon this new earth On our earth we can only love with suffering and through suffering We cannot love otherwise and we know of no other sort of love I want suffering in order to love I long I thirst this very instant to kiss with tears the earth that I have left and I don t want I won t accept life on any other But my companion had already left me I suddenly quite without noticing how found myself on this other earth in the bright light of a sunny day fair as paradise I believe I was standing on one of the islands that make up on our globe the Greek archipelago or on the coast of the mainland facing that archipelago Oh everything was exactly as it is with us only everything seemed to have a festive radiance the splendour of some great holy triumph attained at last The caressing sea green as emerald splashed softly upon the shore and kissed it with manifest almost conscious love The tall lovely trees stood in all the glory of their blossom and their innumerable leaves greeted me I am certain with their soft caressing rustle and seemed to articulate words of love The grass glowed with bright and fragrant flowers Birds were flying in flocks in the air and perched fearlessly on my shoulders and arms and joyfully struck me with their darling fluttering wings And at last I saw and knew the people of this happy land They came to me of themselves they surrounded me kissed me The children of the sun the children of their sun oh how beautiful they were Never had I seen on our own earth such beauty in mankind Only perhaps in our children in their earliest years one might find some remote faint reflection of this beauty The eyes of these happy people shone with a clear brightness Their faces were radiant with the light of reason and fullness of a serenity that comes of perfect understanding but those faces were gay in their words and voices there was a note of childlike joy Oh from the first moment from the first glance at them I understood it all It was the earth untarnished by the Fall on it lived people who had not sinned They lived just in such a paradise as that in which according to all the legends of mankind our first parents lived before they sinned the only difference was that all this earth was the same paradise These people laughing joyfully thronged round me and caressed me they took me home with them and each of them tried to reassure me Oh they asked me no questions but they seemed I fancied to know everything without asking and they wanted to make haste and smoothe away the signs of suffering from my face IV And do you know what Well granted that it was only a dream yet the sensation of the love of those innocent and beautiful people has remained with me for ever and I feel as though their love is still flowing out to me from over there I have seen them myself have known them and been convinced I loved them I suffered for them afterwards Oh I understood at once even at the time that in many things I could not understand them at all as an up to date Russian progressive and contemptible Petersburger it struck me as inexplicable that knowing so much they had for instance no science like ours But I soon realised that their knowledge was gained and fostered by intuitions different from those of us on earth and that their aspirations too were quite different They desired nothing and were at peace they did not aspire to knowledge of life as we aspire to understand it because their lives were full But their knowledge was higher and deeper than ours for our science seeks to explain what life is aspires to understand it in order to teach others how to live while they without science knew how to live and that I understood but I could not understand their knowledge They showed me their trees and I could not understand the intense love with which they looked at them it was as though they were talking with creatures like themselves And perhaps I shall not be mistaken if I say that they conversed with them Yes they had found their language and I am convinced that the trees understood them They looked at all Nature like that at the animals who lived in peace with them and did not attack them but loved them conquered by their love They pointed to the stars and told me something about them which I could not understand but I am convinced that they were somehow in touch with the stars not only in thought but by some living channel Oh these people did not persist in trying to make me understand them they loved me without that but I knew that they would never understand me and so I hardly spoke to them about our earth I only kissed in their presence the earth on which they lived and mutely worshipped them themselves And they saw that and let me worship them without being abashed at my adoration for they themselves loved much They were not unhappy on my account when at times I kissed their feet with tears joyfully conscious of the love with which they would respond to mine At times I asked myself with wonder how it was they were able never to offend a creature like me and never once to arouse a feeling of jealousy or envy in me Often I wondered how it could be that boastful and untruthful as I was I never talked to them of what I knew of which of course they had no notion that I was never tempted to do so by a desire to astonish or even to benefit them They were as gay and sportive as children They wandered about their lovely woods and copses they sang their lovely songs their fare was light the fruits of their trees the honey from their woods and the milk of the animals who loved them The work they did for food and raiment was brief and not laborious They loved and begot children but I never noticed in them the impulse of that cruel sensuality which overcomes almost every man on this earth all and each and is the source of almost every sin of mankind on earth They rejoiced at the arrival of children as new beings to share their happiness There was no quarrelling no jealousy among them and they did not even know what the words meant Their children were the children of all for they all made up one family There was scarcely any illness among them though there was death but their old people died peacefully as though falling asleep giving blessings and smiles to those who surrounded them to take their last farewell with bright and loving smiles I never saw grief or tears on those occasions but only love which reached the point of ecstasy but a calm ecstasy made perfect and contemplative One might think that they were still in contact with the departed after death and that their earthly union was not cut short by death They scarcely understood me when I questioned them about immortality but evidently they were so convinced of it without reasoning that it was not for them a question at all They had no temples but they had a real living and uninterrupted sense of oneness with the whole of the universe they had no creed but they had a certain knowledge that when their earthly joy had reached the limits of earthly nature then there would come for them for the living and for the dead a still greater fullness of contact with the whole of the universe They looked forward to that moment with joy but without haste not pining for it but seeming to have a foretaste of it in their hearts of which they talked to one another In the evening before going to sleep they liked singing in musical and harmonious chorus In those songs they expressed all the sensations that the parting day had given them sang its glories and took leave of it They sang the praises of nature of the sea of the woods They liked making songs about one another and praised each other like children they were the simplest songs but they sprang from their hearts and went to one s heart And not only in their songs but in all their lives they seemed to do nothing but admire one another It was like being in love with each other but an all embracing universal feeling Some of their songs solemn and rapturous I scarcely understood at all Though I understood the words I could never fathom their full significance It remained as it were beyond the grasp of my mind yet my heart unconsciously absorbed it more and more I often told them that I had had a presentiment of it long before that this joy and glory had come to me on our earth in the form of a yearning melancholy that at times approached insufferable sorrow that I had had a foreknowledge of them all and of their glory in the dreams of my heart and the visions of my mind that often on our earth I could not look at the setting sun without tears that in my hatred for the men of our earth there was always a yearning anguish why could I not hate them without loving them why could I not help forgiving them and in my love for them there was a yearning grief why could I not love them without hating them They listened to me and I saw they could not conceive what I was saying but I did not regret that I had spoken to them of it I knew that they understood the intensity of my yearning anguish over those whom I had left But when they looked at me with their sweet eyes full of love when I felt that in their presence my heart too became as innocent and just as theirs the feeling of the fullness of life took my breath away and I worshipped them in silence Oh every one laughs in my face now and assures me that one cannot dream of such details as I am telling now that I only dreamed or felt one sensation that arose in my heart in delirium and made up the details myself when I woke up And when I told them that perhaps it really was so my God how they shouted with laughter in my face and what mirth I caused Oh yes of course I was overcome by the mere sensation of my dream and that was all that was preserved in my cruelly wounded heart but the actual forms and images of my dream that is the very ones I really saw at the very time of my dream were filled with such harmony were so lovely and enchanting and were so actual that on awakening I was of course incapable of clothing them in our poor language so that they were bound to become blurred in my mind and so perhaps I really was forced afterwards to make up the details and so of course to distort them in my passionate desire to convey some at least of them as quickly as I could But on the other hand how can I help believing that it was all true It was perhaps a thousand times brighter happier and more joyful than I describe it Granted that I dreamed it yet it must have been real You know I will tell you a secret perhaps it was not a dream at all For then something happened so awful something so horribly true that it could not have been imagined in a dream My heart may have originated the dream but would my heart alone have been capable of originating the awful event which happened to me afterwards How could I alone have invented it or imagined it in my dream Could my petty heart and my fickle trivial mind have risen to such a revelation of truth Oh judge for yourselves hitherto I have concealed it but now I will tell the truth The fact is that I corrupted them all V Yes yes it ended in my corrupting them all How it could come to pass I do not know but I remember it clearly The dream embraced thousands of years and left in me only a sense of the whole I only know that I was the cause of their sin and downfall Like a vile trichina like a germ of the plague infecting whole kingdoms so I contaminated all this earth so happy and sinless before my coming They learnt to lie grew fond of lying and discovered the charm of falsehood Oh at first perhaps it began innocently with a jest coquetry with amorous play perhaps indeed with a germ but that germ of falsity made its way into their hearts and pleased them Then sensuality was soon begotten sensuality begot jealousy jealousy cruelty Oh I don t know I don t remember but soon very soon the first blood was shed They marvelled and were horrified and began to be split up and divided They formed into unions but it was against one another Reproaches upbraidings followed They came to know shame and shame brought them to virtue The conception of honour sprang up and every union began waving its flags They began torturing animals and the animals withdrew from them into the forests and became hostile to them They began to struggle for separation for isolation for individuality for mine and thine They began to talk in different languages They became acquainted with sorrow and loved sorrow they thirsted for suffering and said that truth could only be attained through suffering Then science appeared As they became wicked they began talking of brotherhood and humanitarianism and understood those ideas As they became criminal they invented justice and drew up whole legal codes in order to observe it and to ensure their being kept set up a guillotine They hardly remembered what they had lost in fact refused to believe that they had ever been happy and innocent They even laughed at the possibility of this happiness in the past and called it a dream They could not even imagine it in definite form and shape but strange and wonderful to relate though they lost all faith in their past happiness and called it a legend they so longed to be happy and innocent once more that they succumbed to this desire like children made an idol of it set up temples and worshipped their own idea their own desire though at the same time they fully believed that it was unattainable and could not be realised yet they bowed down to it and adored it with tears Nevertheless if it could have happened that they had returned to the innocent and happy condition which they had lost and if some one had shown it to them again and had asked them whether they wanted to go back to it they would certainly have refused They answered me We may be deceitful wicked and unjust we know it and weep over it we grieve over it we torment and punish ourselves more perhaps than that merciful Judge Who will judge us and whose Name we know not But we have science and by means of it we shall find the truth and we shall arrive at it consciously Knowledge is higher than feeling the consciousness of life is higher than life Science will give us wisdom wisdom will reveal the laws and the knowledge of the laws of happiness is higher than happiness That is what they said and after saying such things every one began to love himself better than any one else and indeed they could not do otherwise All became so jealous of the rights of their own personality that they did their very utmost to curtail and destroy them in others and made that the chief thing in their lives Slavery followed even voluntary slavery the weak eagerly submitted to the strong on condition that the latter aided them to subdue the still weaker Then there were saints who came to these people weeping and talked to them of their pride of their loss of harmony and due proportion of their loss of shame They were laughed at or pelted with stones Holy blood was shed on the threshold of the temples Then there arose men who began to think how to bring all people together again so that everybody while still loving himself best of all might not interfere with others and all might live together in something like a harmonious society Regular wars sprang up over this idea All the combatants at the same time firmly believed that science wisdom and the instinct of self preservation would force men at last to unite into a harmonious and rational society and so meanwhile to hasten matters the wise endeavoured to exterminate as rapidly as possible all who were not wise and did not understand their idea that the latter might not hinder its triumph But the instinct of self preservation grew rapidly weaker there arose men haughty and sensual who demanded all or nothing In order to obtain everything they resorted to crime and if they did not succeed to suicide There arose religions with a cult of non existence and self destruction for the sake of the everlasting peace of annihilation At last these people grew weary of their meaningless toil and signs of suffering came into their faces and then they proclaimed that suffering was a beauty for in suffering alone was there meaning They glorified suffering in their songs I moved about among them wringing my hands and weeping over them but I loved them perhaps more than in old days when there was no suffering in their faces and when they were innocent and so lovely I loved the earth they had polluted even more than when it had been a paradise if only because sorrow had come to it Alas I always loved sorrow and tribulation but only for myself for myself but I wept over them pitying them I stretched out my hands to them in despair blaming cursing and despising myself I told them that all this was my doing mine alone that it was I had brought them corruption contamination and falsity I besought them to crucify me I taught them how to make a cross I could not kill myself I had not the strength but I wanted to suffer at their hands I yearned for suffering I longed that my blood should be drained to the last drop in these agonies But they only laughed at me and began at last to look upon me as crazy They justified me they declared that they had only got what they wanted themselves and that all that now was could not have been otherwise At last they declared to me that I was becoming dangerous and that they should lock me up in a madhouse if I did not hold my tongue Then such grief took possession of my soul that my heart was wrung and I felt as though I were dying and then then I awoke It was morning that is it was not yet daylight but about six o clock I woke up in the same arm chair my candle had burnt out every one was asleep in the captain s room and there was a stillness all round rare in our flat First of all I leapt up in great amazement nothing like this had ever happened to me before not even in the most trivial detail I had never for instance fallen asleep like this in my arm chair While I was standing and coming to myself I suddenly caught sight of my revolver lying loaded ready but instantly I thrust it away Oh now life life I lifted up my hands and called upon eternal truth not with words but with tears ecstasy immeasurable ecstasy flooded my soul Yes life and spreading the good tidings Oh I at that moment resolved to spread the tidings and resolved it of course for my whole life I go to spread the tidings I want to spread the tidings of what Of the truth for I have seen it have seen it with my own eyes have seen it in all its glory And since then I have been preaching Moreover I love all those who laugh at me more than any of the rest Why that is so I do not know and cannot explain but so be it I am told that I am vague and confused and if I am vague and confused now what shall I be later on It is true indeed I am vague and confused and perhaps as time goes on I shall be more so And of course I shall make many blunders before I find out how to preach that is find out what words to say what things to do for it is a very difficult task I see all that as clear as daylight but listen who does not make mistakes And yet you know all are making for the same goal all are striving in the same direction anyway from the sage to the lowest robber only by different roads It is an old truth but this is what is new I cannot go far wrong For I have seen the truth I have seen and I know that people can be beautiful and happy without losing the power of living on earth I will not and cannot believe that evil is the normal condition of mankind And it is just this faith of mine that they laugh at But how can I help believing it I have seen the truth it is not as though I had invented it with my mind I have seen it seen it and the living image of it has filled my soul for ever I have seen it in such full perfection that I cannot believe that it is impossible for people to have it And so how can I go wrong I shall make some slips no doubt and shall perhaps talk in second hand language but not for long the living image of what I saw will always be with me and will always correct and guide me Oh I am full of courage and freshness and I will go on and on if it were for a thousand years Do you know at first I meant to conceal the fact that I corrupted them but that was a mistake that was my first mistake But truth whispered to me that I was lying and preserved me and corrected me But how establish paradise I don t know because I do not know how to put it into words After my dream I lost command of words All the chief words anyway the most necessary ones But never mind I shall go and I shall keep talking I won t leave off for anyway I have seen it with my own eyes though I cannot describe what I saw But the scoffers do not understand that It was a dream they say delirium hallucination Oh As though that meant so much And they are so proud A dream What is a dream And is not our life a dream I will say more Suppose that this paradise will never come to pass that I understand yet I shall go on preaching it And yet how simple it is in one day in one hour everything could be arranged at once The chief thing is to love others like yourself that s the great thing and that s everything nothing else is wanted you will find out at once how to arrange it all And yet it s an old truth which has been told and retold a billion times but it has not formed part of our lives The consciousness of life is higher than life the knowledge of the laws of happiness is higher than happiness that is what one must contend against And I shall If only every one wants it it can all be arranged at once And I tracked out that little girl and I shall go on and on THE END End of the
