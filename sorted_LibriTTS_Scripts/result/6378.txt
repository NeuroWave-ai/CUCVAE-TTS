ELEVEN CHAPTER TWELVE CHAPTER THIRTEEN CHAPTER FOURTEEN NOTE TO THE FIRST EDITION The last word of this novel was written on twenty nine May nineteen fourteen And that last word was the single word of the title Those were the times of peace Now that the moment of publication approaches I have been considering the discretion of altering the title page The word Victory the shining and tragic goal of noble effort appeared too great too august to stand at the head of a mere novel There was also the possibility of falling under the suspicion of commercial astuteness deceiving the public into the belief that the book had something to do with war Of that however I was not afraid very much What influenced my decision most were the obscure promptings of that pagan residuum of awe and wonder which lurks still at the bottom of our old humanity Victory was the last word I had written in peace time It was the last literary thought which had occurred to me before the doors of the Temple of Janus flying open with a crash shook the minds the hearts the consciences of men all over the world Such coincidence could not be treated lightly And I made up my mind to let the word stand in the same hopeful spirit in which some simple citizen of Old Rome would have accepted the Omen The second point on which I wish to offer a remark is the existence in the novel of a person named Schomberg That I believe him to be true goes without saying I am not likely to offer pinchbeck wares to my public consciously Schomberg is an old member of my company A very subordinate personage in Lord Jim as far back as the year eighteen ninety nine he became notably active in a certain short story of mine published in nineteen oh two Here he appears in a still larger part true to life I hope but also true to himself Only in this instance his deeper passions come into play and thus his grotesque psychology is completed at last I don t pretend to say that this is the entire Teutonic psychology but it is indubitably the psychology of a Teuton My object in mentioning him here is to bring out the fact that far from being the incarnation of recent animosities he is the creature of my old deep seated and as it were impartial conviction J C AUTHOR S NOTE On approaching the task of writing this Note for Victory the first thing I am conscious of is the actual nearness of the book its nearness to me personally to the vanished mood in which it was written and to the mixed feelings aroused by the critical notices the book obtained when first published almost exactly a year after the beginning of the war The writing of it was finished in nineteen fourteen long before the murder of an Austrian Archduke sounded the first note of warning for a world already full of doubts and fears The contemporaneous very short Author s Note which is preserved in this edition bears sufficient witness to the feelings with which I consented to the publication of the book The fact of the book having been published in the United States early in the year made it difficult to delay its appearance in England any longer It came out in the thirteenth month of the war and my conscience was troubled by the awful incongruity of throwing this bit of imagined drama into the welter of reality tragic enough in all conscience but even more cruel than tragic and more inspiring than cruel It seemed awfully presumptuous to think there would be eyes to spare for those pages in a community which in the crash of the big guns and in the din of brave words expressing the truth of an indomitable faith could not but feel the edge of a sharp knife at its throat The unchanging Man of history is wonderfully adaptable both by his power of endurance and in his capacity for detachment The fact seems to be that the play of his destiny is too great for his fears and too mysterious for his understanding Were the trump of the Last Judgement to sound suddenly on a working day the musician at his piano would go on with his performance of Beethoven s sonata and the cobbler at his stall stick to his last in undisturbed confidence in the virtues of the leather And with perfect propriety For what are we to let ourselves be disturbed by an angel s vengeful music too mighty for our ears and too awful for our terrors Thus it happens to us to be struck suddenly by the lightning of wrath The reader will go on reading if the book pleases him and the critic will go on criticizing with that faculty of detachment born perhaps from a sense of infinite littleness and which is yet the only faculty that seems to assimilate man to the immortal gods It is only when the catastrophe matches the natural obscurity of our fate that even the best representative of the race is liable to lose his detachment It is very obvious that on the arrival of the gentlemanly mister Jones the single minded Ricardo and the faithful Pedro Heyst the man of universal detachment loses his mental self possession that fine attitude before the universally irremediable which wears the name of stoicism It is all a matter of proportion There should have been a remedy for that sort of thing And yet there is no remedy Behind this minute instance of life s hazards Heyst sees the power of blind destiny Besides Heyst in his fine detachment had lost the habit of asserting himself I don t mean the courage of self assertion either moral or physical but the mere way of it the trick of the thing the readiness of mind and the turn of the hand that come without reflection and lead the man to excellence in life in art in crime in virtue and for the matter of that even in love Thinking is the great enemy of perfection The habit of profound reflection I am compelled to say is the most pernicious of all the habits formed by the civilized man But I wouldn t be suspected even remotely of making fun of Axel Heyst I have always liked him The flesh and blood individual who stands behind the infinitely more familiar figure of the book I remember as a mysterious Swede right enough Whether he was a baron too I am not so certain He himself never laid claim to that distinction His detachment was too great to make any claims big or small on one s credulity I will not say where I met him because I fear to give my readers a wrong impression since a marked incongruity between a man and his surroundings is often a very misleading circumstance We became very friendly for a time and I would not like to expose him to unpleasant suspicions though personally I am sure he would have been indifferent to suspicions as he was indifferent to all the other disadvantages of life He was not the whole Heyst of course he is only the physical and moral foundation of my Heyst laid on the ground of a short acquaintance That it was short was certainly not my fault for he had charmed me by the mere amenity of his detachment which in this case I cannot help thinking he had carried to excess He went away from his rooms without leaving a trace I wondered where he had gone to but now I know He vanished from my ken only to drift into this adventure that unavoidable waited for him in a world which he persisted in looking upon as a malevolent shadow spinning in the sunlight Often in the course of years an expressed sentiment the particular sense of a phrase heard casually would recall him to my mind so that I have fastened on to him many words heard on other men s lips and belonging to other men s less perfect less pathetic moods The same observation will apply mutatis mutandis to mister Jones who is built on a much slenderer connection mister Jones or whatever his name was did not drift away from me He turned his back on me and walked out of the room It was in a little hotel in the island of saint Thomas in the West Indies in the year seventy five where we found him one hot afternoon extended on three chairs all alone in the loud buzzing of flies to which his immobility and his cadaverous aspect gave a most gruesome significance Our invasion must have displeased him because he got off the chairs brusquely and walked out leaving with me an indelibly weird impression of his thin shanks One of the men with me said that the fellow was the most desperate gambler he had ever come across I said A professional sharper and got for an answer He s a terror but I must say that up to a certain point he will play fair I wonder what the point was I never saw him again because I believe he went straight on board a mail boat which left within the hour for other ports of call in the direction of Aspinall mister Jones s characteristic insolence belongs to another man of a quite different type I will say nothing as to the origins of his mentality because I don t intend to make any damaging admissions It so happened that the very same year Ricardo the physical Ricardo was a fellow passenger of mine on board an extremely small and extremely dirty little schooner during a four days passage between two places in the Gulf of Mexico whose names don t matter For the most part he lay on deck aft as it were at my feet and raising himself from time to time on his elbow would talk about himself and go on talking not exactly to me or even at me he would not even look up but kept his eyes fixed on the deck but more as if communing in a low voice with his familiar devil Now and then he would give me a glance and make the hairs of his stiff little moustache stir quaintly His eyes were green and every cat I see to this day reminds me of the exact contour of his face What he was travelling for or what was his business in life he never confided to me Truth to say the only passenger on board that schooner who could have talked openly about his activities and purposes was a very snuffy and conversationally delightful friar the superior of a convent attended by a very young lay brother of a particularly ferocious countenance We had with us also lying prostrate in the dark and unspeakable cuddy of that schooner an old Spanish gentleman owner of much luggage and as Ricardo assured me very ill indeed Ricardo seemed to be either a servant or the confidant of that aged and distinguished looking invalid who early on the passage held a long murmured conversation with the friar and after that did nothing but groan feebly smoke cigarettes and now and then call for Martin in a voice full of pain Then he who had become Ricardo in the book would go below into that beastly and noisome hole remain there mysteriously and coming up on deck again with a face on which nothing could be read would as likely as not resume for my edification the exposition of his moral attitude towards life illustrated by striking particular instances of the most atrocious complexion Did he mean to frighten me Or seduce me Or astonish me Or arouse my admiration All he did was to arouse my amused incredulity As scoundrels go he was far from being a bore For the rest my innocence was so great then that I could not take his philosophy seriously All the time he kept one ear turned to the cuddy in the manner of a devoted servant but I had the idea that in some way or other he had imposed the connection on the invalid for some end of his own The reader therefore won t be surprised to hear that one morning I was told without any particular emotion by the padrone of the schooner that the rich man down there was dead He had died in the night I don t remember ever being so moved by the desolate end of a complete stranger I looked down the skylight and there was the devoted Martin busy cording cowhide trunks belonging to the deceased whose white beard and hooked nose were the only parts I could make out in the dark depths of a horrible stuffy bunk As it fell calm in the course of the afternoon and continued calm during all that night and the terrible flaming day the late rich man had to be thrown overboard at sunset though as a matter of fact we were in sight of the low pestilential mangrove lined coast of our destination The excellent Father Superior mentioned to me with an air of immense commiseration The poor man has left a young daughter Who was to look after her I don t know but I saw the devoted Martin taking the trunks ashore with great care just before I landed myself I would perhaps have tracked the ways of that man of immense sincerity for a little while but I had some of my own very pressing business to attend to which in the end got mixed up with an earthquake and so I had no time to give to Ricardo The reader need not be told that I have not forgotten him though My contact with the faithful Pedro was much shorter and my observation of him was less complete but incomparably more anxious It ended in a sudden inspiration to get out of his way It was in a hovel of sticks and mats by the side of a path As I went in there only to ask for a bottle of lemonade I have not to this day the slightest idea what in my appearance or actions could have roused his terrible ire It became manifest to me less than two minutes after I had set eyes on him for the first time and though immensely surprised of course I didn t stop to think it out I took the nearest short cut through the wall This bestial apparition and a certain enormous buck nigger encountered in Haiti only a couple of months afterwards have fixed my conception of blind furious unreasoning rage as manifested in the human animal to the end of my days Of the nigger I used to dream for years afterwards Of Pedro never The impression was less vivid I got away from him too quickly It seems to me but natural that those three buried in a corner of my memory should suddenly get out into the light of the world so natural that I offer no excuse for their existence They were there they had to come out and this is a sufficient excuse for a writer of tales who had taken to his trade without preparation or premeditation and without any moral intention but that which pervades the whole scheme of this world of senses Since this Note is mostly concerned with personal contacts and the origins of the persons in the tale I am bound also to speak of Lena because if I were to leave her out it would look like a slight and nothing would be further from my thoughts than putting a slight on Lena If of all the personages involved in the mystery of Samburan I have lived longest with Heyst or with him I call Heyst it was at her whom I call Lena that I have looked the longest and with a most sustained attention This attention originated in idleness for which I have a natural talent One evening I wandered into a cafe in a town not of the tropics but of the South of France It was filled with tobacco smoke the hum of voices the rattling of dominoes and the sounds of strident music The orchestra was rather smaller than the one that performed at Schomberg s hotel had the air more of a family party than of an enlisted band and I must confess seemed rather more respectable than the Zangiacomo musical enterprise It was less pretentious also more homely and familiar so to speak insomuch that in the intervals when all the performers left the platform one of them went amongst the marble tables collecting offerings of sous and francs in a battered tin receptacle recalling the shape of a sauceboat It was a girl Her detachment from her task seems to me now to have equalled or even surpassed Heyst s aloofness from all the mental degradations to which a man s intelligence is exposed in its way through life Silent and wide eyed she went from table to table with the air of a sleep walker and with no other sound but the slight rattle of the coins to attract attention It was long after the sea chapter of my life had been closed but it is difficult to discard completely the characteristics of half a lifetime and it was in something of the Jack ashore spirit that I dropped a five franc piece into the sauceboat whereupon the sleep walker turned her head to gaze at me and said Merci Monsieur in a tone in which there was no gratitude but only surprise I must have been idle indeed to take the trouble to remark on such slight evidence that the voice was very charming and when the performers resumed their seats I shifted my position slightly in order not to have that particular performer hidden from me by the little man with the beard who conducted and who might for all I know have been her father but whose real mission in life was to be a model for the Zangiacomo of Victory Having got a clear line of sight I naturally being idle continued to look at the girl through all the second part of the programme The shape of her dark head inclined over the violin was fascinating and while resting between the pieces of that interminable programme she was in her white dress and with her brown hands reposing in her lap the very image of dreamy innocence The mature bad tempered woman at the piano might have been her mother though there was not the slightest resemblance between them All I am certain of in their personal relation to each other is that cruel pinch on the upper part of the arm That I am sure I have seen There could be no mistake I was in too idle a mood to imagine such a gratuitous barbarity It may have been playfulness yet the girl jumped up as if she had been stung by a wasp It may have been playfulness Yet I saw plainly poor dreamy innocence rub gently the affected place as she filed off with the other performers down the middle aisle between the marble tables in the uproar of voices the rattling of dominoes through a blue atmosphere of tobacco smoke I believe that those people left the town next day Or perhaps they had only migrated to the other big cafe on the other side of the Place de la Comedie It is very possible I did not go across to find out It was my perfect idleness that had invested the girl with a peculiar charm and I did not want to destroy it by any superfluous exertion The receptivity of my indolence made the impression so permanent that when the moment came for her meeting with Heyst I felt that she would be heroically equal to every demand of the risky and uncertain future I was so convinced of it that I let her go with Heyst I won t say without a pang but certainly without misgivings And in view of her triumphant end what more could I have done for her rehabilitation and her happiness nineteen twenty J C VICTORY AN ISLAND TALE PART ONE CHAPTER ONE There is as every schoolboy knows in this scientific age a very close chemical relation between coal and diamonds It is the reason I believe why some people allude to coal as black diamonds Both these commodities represent wealth but coal is a much less portable form of property There is from that point of view a deplorable lack of concentration in coal Now if a coal mine could be put into one s waistcoat pocket but it can t At the same time there is a fascination in coal the supreme commodity of the age in which we are camped like bewildered travellers in a garish unrestful hotel And I suppose those two considerations the practical and the mystical prevented Heyst Axel Heyst from going away The Tropical Belt Coal Company went into liquidation The world of finance is a mysterious world in which incredible as the fact may appear evaporation precedes liquidation First the capital evaporates and then the company goes into liquidation These are very unnatural physics but they account for the persistent inertia of Heyst at which we out there used to laugh among ourselves but not inimically An inert body can do no harm to anyone provokes no hostility is scarcely worth derision It may indeed be in the way sometimes but this could not be said of Axel Heyst He was out of everybody s way as if he were perched on the highest peak of the Himalayas and in a sense as conspicuous Everyone in that part of the world knew of him dwelling on his little island An island is but the top of a mountain Axel Heyst perched on it immovably was surrounded instead of the imponderable stormy and transparent ocean of air merging into infinity by a tepid shallow sea a passionless offshoot of the great waters which embrace the continents of this globe His most frequent visitors were shadows the shadows of clouds relieving the monotony of the inanimate brooding sunshine of the tropics His nearest neighbour I am speaking now of things showing some sort of animation was an indolent volcano which smoked faintly all day with its head just above the northern horizon and at night levelled at him from amongst the clear stars a dull red glow expanding and collapsing spasmodically like the end of a gigantic cigar puffed at intermittently in the dark Axel Heyst was also a smoker and when he lounged out on his veranda with his cheroot the last thing before going to bed he made in the night the same sort of glow and of the same size as that other one so many miles away In a sense the volcano was company to him in the shades of the night which were often too thick one would think to let a breath of air through There was seldom enough wind to blow a feather along On most evenings of the year Heyst could have sat outside with a naked candle to read one of the books left him by his late father It was not a mean store But he never did that Afraid of mosquitoes very likely Neither was he ever tempted by the silence to address any casual remarks to the companion glow of the volcano He was not mad Queer chap yes that may have been said and in fact was said but there is a tremendous difference between the two you will allow On the nights of full moon the silence around Samburan the Round Island of the charts was dazzling and in the flood of cold light Heyst could see his immediate surroundings which had the aspect of an abandoned settlement invaded by the jungle vague roofs above low vegetation broken shadows of bamboo fences in the sheen of long grass something like an overgrown bit of road slanting among ragged thickets towards the shore only a couple of hundred yards away with a black jetty and a mound of some sort quite inky on its unlighted side But the most conspicuous object was a gigantic blackboard raised on two posts and presenting to Heyst when the moon got over that side the white letters T B C company in a row at least two feet high These were the initials of the Tropical Belt Coal Company his employers his late employers to be precise According to the unnatural mysteries of the financial world the T B C Company s capital having evaporated in the course of two years the company went into liquidation forced I believe not voluntary There was nothing forcible in the process however It was slow and while the liquidation in London and Amsterdam pursued its languid course Axel Heyst styled in the prospectus manager in the tropics remained at his post on Samburan the No one coaling station of the company And it was not merely a coaling station There was a coal mine there with an outcrop in the hillside less than five hundred yards from the rickety wharf and the imposing blackboard The company s object had been to get hold of all the outcrops on tropical islands and exploit them locally And Lord knows there were any amount of outcrops It was Heyst who had located most of them in this part of the tropical belt during his rather aimless wanderings and being a ready letter writer had written pages and pages about them to his friends in Europe At least so it was said We doubted whether he had any visions of wealth for himself at any rate What he seemed mostly concerned for was the stride forward as he expressed it in the general organization of the universe apparently He was heard by more than a hundred persons in the islands talking of a great stride forward for these regions The convinced wave of the hand which accompanied the phrase suggested tropical distances being impelled onward In connection with the finished courtesy of his manner it was persuasive or at any rate silencing for a time at least Nobody cared to argue with him when he talked in this strain His earnestness could do no harm to anybody There was no danger of anyone taking seriously his dream of tropical coal so what was the use of hurting his feelings Thus reasoned men in reputable business offices where he had his entree as a person who came out East with letters of introduction and modest letters of credit too some years before these coal outcrops began to crop up in his playfully courteous talk From the first there was some difficulty in making him out He was not a traveller A traveller arrives and departs goes on somewhere Heyst did not depart I met a man once the manager of the branch of the Oriental Banking Corporation in Malacca to whom Heyst exclaimed in no connection with anything in particular it was in the billiard room of the club I am enchanted with these islands He shot it out suddenly a propos des bottes as the French say and while chalking his cue And perhaps it was some sort of enchantment There are more spells than your commonplace magicians ever dreamed of Roughly speaking a circle with a radius of eight hundred miles drawn round a point in North Borneo was in Heyst s case a magic circle It just touched Manila and he had been seen there It just touched Saigon and he was likewise seen there once Perhaps these were his attempts to break out If so they were failures The enchantment must have been an unbreakable one The manager the man who heard the exclamation had been so impressed by the tone fervour rapture what you will or perhaps by the incongruity of it that he had related the experience to more than one person Queer chap that Swede was his only comment but this is the origin of the name Enchanted Heyst which some fellows fastened on our man He also had other names In his early years long before he got so becomingly bald on the top he went to present a letter of introduction to mister Tesman of Tesman Brothers a Sourabaya firm tip top house Well mister Tesman was a kindly benevolent old gentleman He did not know what to make of that caller After telling him that they wished to render his stay among the islands as pleasant as possible and that they were ready to assist him in his plans and so on and after receiving Heyst s thanks you know the usual kind of conversation he proceeded to query in a slow paternal tone And you are interested in Facts broke in Heyst in his courtly voice There s nothing worth knowing but facts Hard facts Facts alone mister Tesman I don t know if old Tesman agreed with him or not but he must have spoken about it because for a time our man got the name of Hard Facts He had the singular good fortune that his sayings stuck to him and became part of his name Thereafter he mooned about the Java Sea in some of the Tesmans trading schooners and then vanished on board an Arab ship in the direction of New Guinea He remained so long in that outlying part of his enchanted circle that he was nearly forgotten before he swam into view again in a native proa full of Goram vagabonds burnt black by the sun very lean his hair much thinned and a portfolio of sketches under his arm He showed these willingly but was very reserved as to anything else He had had an amusing time he said A man who will go to New Guinea for fun well Later years afterwards when the last vestiges of youth had gone off his face and all the hair off the top of his head and his red gold pair of horizontal moustaches had grown to really noble proportions a certain disreputable white man fastened upon him an epithet Putting down with a shaking hand a long glass emptied of its contents paid for by Heyst he said with that deliberate sagacity which no mere water drinker ever attained Heyst s a puffect g n lman Puffect But he s a ut uto utopist Heyst had just gone out of the place of public refreshment where this pronouncement was voiced Utopist eh Upon my word the only thing I heard him say which might have had a bearing on the point was his invitation to old McNab himself Turning with that finished courtesy of attitude movement voice which was his obvious characteristic he had said with delicate playfulness Come along and quench your thirst with us mister McNab Perhaps that was it A man who could propose even playfully to quench old McNab s thirst must have been a utopist a pursuer of chimeras for of downright irony Heyst was not prodigal And may be this was the reason why he was generally liked At that epoch in his life in the fulness of his physical development of a broad martial presence with his bald head and long moustaches he resembled the portraits of Charles XII of adventurous memory However there was no reason to think that Heyst was in any way a fighting man CHAPTER TWO It was about this time that Heyst became associated with Morrison on terms about which people were in doubt Some said he was a partner others said he was a sort of paying guest but the real truth of the matter was more complex One day Heyst turned up in Timor Why in Timor of all places in the world no one knows Well he was mooning about Delli that highly pestilential place possibly in search of some undiscovered facts when he came in the street upon Morrison who in his way was also an enchanted man When you spoke to Morrison of going home he was from Dorsetshire he shuddered He said it was dark and wet there that it was like living with your head and shoulders in a moist gunny bag That was only his exaggerated style of talking Morrison was one of us He was owner and master of the Capricorn trading brig and was understood to be doing well with her except for the drawback of too much altruism He was the dearly beloved friend of a quantity of God forsaken villages up dark creeks and obscure bays where he traded for produce He would often sail through awfully dangerous channels up to some miserable settlement only to find a very hungry population clamorous for rice and without so much produce between them as would have filled Morrison s suitcase Amid general rejoicings he would land the rice all the same explain to the people that it was an advance that they were in debt to him now would preach to them energy and industry and make an elaborate note in a pocket diary which he always carried and this would be the end of that transaction I don t know if Morrison thought so but the villagers had no doubt whatever about it Whenever a coast village sighted the brig it would begin to beat all its gongs and hoist all its streamers and all its girls would put flowers in their hair and the crowd would line the river bank and Morrison would beam and glitter at all this excitement through his single eyeglass with an air of intense gratification He was tall and lantern jawed and clean shaven and looked like a barrister who had thrown his wig to the dogs We used to remonstrate with him You will never see any of your advances if you go on like this Morrison He would put on a knowing air I shall squeeze them yet some day never you fear And that reminds me pulling out his inseparable pocketbook there s that So and So village They are pretty well off again I may just as well squeeze them to begin with He would make a ferocious entry in the pocketbook Memo Squeeze the So and So village at the first time of calling Then he would stick the pencil back and snap the elastic on with inflexible finality but he never began the squeezing Some men grumbled at him He was spoiling the trade Well perhaps to a certain extent not much Most of the places he traded with were unknown not only to geography but also to the traders special lore which is transmitted by word of mouth without ostentation and forms the stock of mysterious local knowledge It was hinted also that Morrison had a wife in each and every one of them but the majority of us repulsed these innuendoes with indignation He was a true humanitarian and rather ascetic than otherwise When Heyst met him in Delli Morrison was walking along the street his eyeglass tossed over his shoulder his head down with the hopeless aspect of those hardened tramps one sees on our roads trudging from workhouse to workhouse Being hailed on the street he looked up with a wild worried expression He was really in trouble He had come the week before into Delli and the Portuguese authorities on some pretence of irregularity in his papers had inflicted a fine upon him and had arrested his brig Morrison never had any spare cash in hand With his system of trading it would have been strange if he had and all these debts entered in the pocketbook weren t good enough to raise a millrei on let alone a shilling The Portuguese officials begged him not to distress himself They gave him a week s grace and then proposed to sell the brig at auction This meant ruin for Morrison and when Heyst hailed him across the street in his usual courtly tone the week was nearly out Heyst crossed over and said with a slight bow and in the manner of a prince addressing another prince on a private occasion What an unexpected pleasure Would you have any objection to drink something with me in that infamous wine shop over there The sun is really too strong to talk in the street The haggard Morrison followed obediently into a sombre cool hovel which he would have distained to enter at any other time He was distracted He did not know what he was doing You could have led him over the edge of a precipice just as easily as into that wine shop He sat down like an automaton He was speechless but he saw a glass full of rough red wine before him and emptied it Heyst meantime politely watchful had taken a seat opposite You are in for a bout of fever I fear he said sympathetically Poor Morrison s tongue was loosened at that Fever he cried Give me fever Give me plague They are diseases One gets over them But I am being murdered I am being murdered by the Portuguese The gang here downed me at last among them I am to have my throat cut the day after tomorrow In the face of this passion Heyst made with his eyebrows a slight motion of surprise which would not have been misplaced in a drawing room Morrison s despairing reserve had broken down He had been wandering with a dry throat all over that miserable town of mud hovels silent with no soul to turn to in his distress and positively maddened by his thoughts and suddenly he had stumbled on a white man figuratively and actually white for Morrison refused to accept the racial whiteness of the Portuguese officials He let himself go for the mere relief of violent speech his elbows planted on the table his eyes blood shot his voice nearly gone the brim of his round pith hat shading an unshaven livid face His white clothes which he had not taken off for three days were dingy He had already gone to the bad past redemption The sight was shocking to Heyst but he let nothing of it appear in his bearing concealing his impression under that consummate good society manner of his Polite attention what s due from one gentleman listening to another was what he showed and as usual it was catching so that Morrison pulled himself together and finished his narrative in a conversational tone with a man of the world air It s a villainous plot Unluckily one is helpless That scoundrel Cousinho Andreas you know has been coveting the brig for years Naturally I would never sell She is not only my livelihood she s my life So he has hatched this pretty little plot with the chief of the customs The sale of course will be a farce There s no one here to bid He will get the brig for a song no not even that a line of a song You have been some years now in the islands Heyst You know us all you have seen how we live Now you shall have the opportunity to see how some of us end for it is the end for me I can t deceive myself any longer You see it don t you Morrison had pulled himself together but one felt the snapping strain on his recovered self possession Heyst was beginning to say that he could very well see all the bearings of this unfortunate when Morrison interrupted him jerkily Upon my word I don t know why I have been telling you all this I suppose seeing a thoroughly white man made it impossible to keep my trouble to myself Words can t do it justice but since I ve told you so much I may as well tell you more Listen This morning on board in my cabin I went down on my knees and prayed for help I went down on my knees You are a believer Morrison asked Heyst with a distinct note of respect Surely I am not an infidel Morrison was swiftly reproachful in his answer and there came a pause Morrison perhaps interrogating his conscience and Heyst preserving a mien of unperturbed polite interest I prayed like a child of course I believe in children praying well women too but I rather think God expects men to be more self reliant I don t hold with a man everlastingly bothering the Almighty with his silly troubles It seems such cheek Anyhow this morning I I have never done any harm to any God s creature knowingly I prayed A sudden impulse I went flop on my knees so you may judge They were gazing earnestly into each other s eyes Poor Morrison added as a discouraging afterthought Only this is such a God forsaken spot Heyst inquired with a delicate intonation whether he might know the amount for which the brig was seized Morrison suppressed an oath and named curtly a sum which was in itself so insignificant that any other person than Heyst would have exclaimed at it And even Heyst could hardly keep incredulity out of his politely modulated voice as he asked if it was a fact that Morrison had not that amount in hand Morrison hadn t He had only a little English gold a few sovereigns on board He had left all his spare cash with the Tesmans in Samarang to meet certain bills which would fall due while he was away on his cruise Anyhow that money would not have been any more good to him than if it had been in the innermost depths of the infernal regions He said all this brusquely He looked with sudden disfavour at that noble forehead at those great martial moustaches at the tired eyes of the man sitting opposite him Who the devil was he What was he Morrison doing there talking like this Morrison knew no more of Heyst than the rest of us trading in the Archipelago did Had the Swede suddenly risen and hit him on the nose he could not have been taken more aback than when this stranger this nondescript wanderer said with a little bow across the table Oh If that s the case I would be very happy if you d allow me to be of use Morrison didn t understand This was one of those things that don t happen unheard of things He had no real inkling of what it meant till Heyst said definitely I can lend you the amount You have the money whispered Morrison Do you mean here in your pocket Yes on me Glad to be of use Morrison staring open mouthed groped over his shoulder for the cord of the eyeglass hanging down his back When he found it he stuck it in his eye hastily It was as if he expected Heyst s usual white suit of the tropics to change into a shining garment flowing down to his toes and a pair of great dazzling wings to sprout out on the Swede s shoulders and didn t want to miss a single detail of the transformation But if Heyst was an angel from on high sent in answer to prayer he did not betray his heavenly origin by outward signs So instead of going on his knees as he felt inclined to do Morrison stretched out his hand which Heyst grasped with formal alacrity and a polite murmur in which Trifle delighted of service could just be distinguished Miracles do happen thought the awestruck Morrison To him as to all of us in the Islands this wandering Heyst who didn t toil or spin visibly seemed the very last person to be the agent of Providence in an affair concerned with money The fact of his turning up in Timor or anywhere else was no more wonderful than the settling of a sparrow on one s window sill at any given moment But that he should carry a sum of money in his pocket seemed somehow inconceivable So inconceivable that as they were trudging together through the sand of the roadway to the custom house another mud hovel to pay the fine Morrison broke into a cold sweat stopped short and exclaimed in faltering accents I say You aren t joking Heyst Joking Heyst s blue eyes went hard as he turned them on the discomposed Morrison In what way may I ask he continued with austere politeness Morrison was abashed Forgive me Heyst You must have been sent by God in answer to my prayer But I have been nearly off my chump for three days with worry and it suddenly struck me What if it s the Devil who has sent him I have no connection with the supernatural said Heyst graciously moving on Nobody has sent me I just happened along I know better contradicted Morrison I may be unworthy but I have been heard I know it I feel it For why should you offer Heyst inclined his head as from respect for a conviction in which he could not share But he stuck to his point by muttering that in the presence of an odious fact like this it was natural Later in the day the fine paid and the two of them on board the brig from which the guard had been removed Morrison who besides being a gentleman was also an honest fellow began to talk about repayment He knew very well his inability to lay by any sum of money It was partly the fault of circumstances and partly of his temperament and it would have been very difficult to apportion the responsibility between the two Even Morrison himself could not say while confessing to the fact With a worried air he ascribed it to fatality I don t know how it is that I ve never been able to save It s some sort of curse There s always a bill or two to meet He plunged his hand into his pocket for the famous notebook so well known in the islands the fetish of his hopes and fluttered the pages feverishly And yet look he went on There it is more than five thousand dollars owing Surely that s something He ceased suddenly Heyst who had been all the time trying to look as unconcerned as he could made reassuring noises in his throat But Morrison was not only honest He was honourable too and on this stressful day before this amazing emissary of Providence and in the revulsion of his feelings he made his great renunciation He cast off the abiding illusion of his existence No No They are not good I ll never be able to squeeze them Never I ve been saying for years I would but I give it up I never really believed I could Don t reckon on that Heyst I have robbed you Poor Morrison actually laid his head on the cabin table and remained in that crushed attitude while Heyst talked to him soothingly with the utmost courtesy The Swede was as much distressed as Morrison for he understood the other s feelings perfectly No decent feeling was ever scorned by Heyst But he was incapable of outward cordiality of manner and he felt acutely his defect Consummate politeness is not the right tonic for an emotional collapse They must have had both of them a fairly painful time of it in the cabin of the brig In the end Morrison casting desperately for an idea in the blackness of his despondency hit upon the notion of inviting Heyst to travel with him in his brig and have a share in his trading ventures up to the amount of his loan It is characteristic of Heyst s unattached floating existence that he was in a position to accept this proposal There is no reason to think that he wanted particularly just then to go poking aboard the brig into all the holes and corners of the Archipelago where Morrison picked up most of his trade Far from it but he would have consented to almost any arrangement in order to put an end to the harrowing scene in the cabin There was at once a great transformation act Morrison raising his diminished head and sticking the glass in his eye to look affectionately at Heyst a bottle being uncorked and so on It was agreed that nothing should be said to anyone of this transaction Morrison you understand was not proud of the episode and he was afraid of being unmercifully chaffed An old bird like me To let myself be trapped by those damned Portuguese rascals I should never hear the last of it We must keep it dark From quite other motives among which his native delicacy was the principal Heyst was even more anxious to bind himself to silence A gentleman would naturally shrink from the part of heavenly messenger that Morrison would force upon him It made Heyst uncomfortable as it was And perhaps he did not care that it should be known that he had some means whatever they might have been sufficient at any rate to enable him to lend money to people These two had a duet down there like conspirators in a comic opera of Sh ssh shssh Secrecy Secrecy It must have been funny because they were very serious about it And for a time the conspiracy was successful in so far that we all concluded that Heyst was boarding with the good natured some said sponging on the imbecile Morrison in his brig But you know how it is with all such mysteries There is always a leak somewhere Morrison himself not a perfect vessel by any means was bursting with gratitude and under the stress he must have let out something vague enough to give the island gossip a chance And you know how kindly the world is in its comments on what it does not understand A rumour sprang out that Heyst having obtained some mysterious hold on Morrison had fastened himself on him and was sucking him dry Those who had traced these mutters back to their origin were very careful not to believe them The originator it seems was a certain Schomberg a big manly bearded creature of the Teutonic persuasion with an ungovernable tongue which surely must have worked on a pivot Whether he was a Lieutenant of the Reserve as he declared I don t know Out there he was by profession a hotel keeper first in Bangkok then somewhere else and ultimately in Sourabaya He dragged after him up and down that section of the tropical belt a silent frightened little woman with long ringlets who smiled at one stupidly showing a blue tooth I don t know why so many of us patronized his various establishments He was a noxious ass and he satisfied his lust for silly gossip at the cost of his customers It was he who one evening as Morrison and Heyst went past the hotel they were not his regular patrons whispered mysteriously to the mixed company assembled on the veranda The spider and the fly just gone by gentlemen Then very important and confidential his thick paw at the side of his mouth We are among ourselves well gentlemen all I can say is don t you ever get mixed up with that Swede Don t you ever get caught in his web CHAPTER THREE Human nature being what it is having a silly side to it as well as a mean side there were not a few who pretended to be indignant on no better authority than a general propensity to believe every evil report and a good many others who found it simply funny to call Heyst the Spider behind his back of course He was as serenely unconscious of this as of his several other nicknames But soon people found other things to say of Heyst not long afterwards he came very much to the fore in larger affairs He blossomed out into something definite He filled the public eye as the manager on the spot of the Tropical Belt Coal Company with offices in London and Amsterdam and other things about it that sounded and looked grandiose The offices in the two capitals may have consisted and probably did of one room in each but at that distance out East there all this had an air We were more puzzled than dazzled it is true but even the most sober minded among us began to think that there was something in it The Tesmans appointed agents a contract for government mail boats secured the era of steam beginning for the islands a great stride forward Heyst s stride And all this sprang from the meeting of the cornered Morrison and of the wandering Heyst which may or may not have been the direct outcome of a prayer Morrison was not an imbecile but he seemed to have got himself into a state of remarkable haziness as to his exact position towards Heyst For if Heyst had been sent with money in his pocket by a direct decree of the Almighty in answer to Morrison s prayer then there was no reason for special gratitude since obviously he could not help himself But Morrison believed both in the efficacy of prayer and in the infinite goodness of Heyst He thanked God with awed sincerity for his mercy and could not thank Heyst enough for the service rendered as between man and man In this highly creditable tangle of strong feelings Morrison s gratitude insisted on Heyst s partnership in the great discovery Ultimately we heard that Morrison had gone home through the Suez Canal in order to push the magnificent coal idea personally in London He parted from his brig and disappeared from our ken but we heard that he had written a letter or letters to Heyst saying that London was cold and gloomy that he did not like either the men or things that he was as lonely as a crow in a strange country In truth he pined after the Capricorn I don t mean only the tropic I mean the ship too Finally he went into Dorsetshire to see his people caught a bad cold and died with extraordinary precipitation in the bosom of his appalled family Whether his exertions in the City of London had enfeebled his vitality I don t know but I believe it was this visit which put life into the coal idea Be it as it may the Tropical Belt Coal Company was born very shortly after Morrison the victim of gratitude and his native climate had gone to join his forefathers in a Dorsetshire churchyard Heyst was immensely shocked He got the news in the Moluccas through the Tesmans and then disappeared for a time It appears that he stayed with a Dutch government doctor in Amboyna a friend of his who looked after him for a bit in his bungalow He became visible again rather suddenly his eyes sunk in his head and with a sort of guarded attitude as if afraid someone would reproach him with the death of Morrison Naive Heyst As if anybody would Nobody amongst us had any interest in men who went home They were all right they did not count any more Going to Europe was nearly as final as going to Heaven It removed a man from the world of hazard and adventure As a matter of fact many of us did not hear of this death till months afterwards from Schomberg who disliked Heyst gratuitously and made up a piece of sinister whispered gossip That s what comes of having anything to do with that fellow He squeezes you dry like a lemon then chucks you out sends you home to die Take warning by Morrison Of course we laughed at the innkeeper s suggestions of black mystery Several of us heard that Heyst was prepared to go to Europe himself to push on his coal enterprise personally but he never went It wasn t necessary The company was formed without him and his nomination of manager in the tropics came out to him by post From the first he had selected Samburan or Round Island for the central station Some copies of the prospectus issued in Europe having found their way out East were passed from hand to hand We greatly admired the map which accompanied them for the edification of the shareholders On it Samburan was represented as the central spot of the Eastern Hemisphere with its name engraved in enormous capitals Heavy lines radiated from it in all directions through the tropics figuring a mysterious and effective star lines of influence or lines of distance or something of that sort Company promoters have an imagination of their own There s no more romantic temperament on earth than the temperament of a company promoter Engineers came out coolies were imported bungalows were put up on Samburan a gallery driven into the hillside and actually some coal got out These manifestations shook the soberest minds For a time everybody in the islands was talking of the Tropical Belt Coal and even those who smiled quietly to themselves were only hiding their uneasiness Oh yes it had come and anybody could see what would be the consequences the end of the individual trader smothered under a great invasion of steamers We could not afford to buy steamers Not we And Heyst was the manager You know Heyst enchanted Heyst Oh come He has been no better than a loafer around here as far back as any of us can remember Yes he said he was looking for facts Well he s got hold of one that will do for all of us commented a bitter voice That s what they call development and be hanged to it muttered another Never was Heyst talked about so much in the tropical belt before Isn t he a Swedish baron or something He a baron Get along with you For my part I haven t the slightest doubt that he was While he was still drifting amongst the islands enigmatical and disregarded like an insignificant ghost he told me so himself on a certain occasion It was a long time before he materialized in this alarming way into the destroyer of our little industry Heyst the Enemy It became the fashion with a good many to speak of Heyst as the Enemy He was very concrete very visible now He was rushing all over the Archipelago jumping in and out of local mail packets as if they had been tram cars here there and everywhere organizing with all his might This was no mooning about This was business And this sudden display of purposeful energy shook the incredulity of the most sceptical more than any scientific demonstration of the value of these coal outcrops could have done It was impressive Schomberg was the only one who resisted the infection Big manly in a portly style and profusely bearded with a glass of beer in his thick paw he would approach some table where the topic of the hour was being discussed would listen for a moment and then come out with his invariable declaration All this is very well gentlemen but he can t throw any of his coal dust in my eyes There s nothing in it Why there can t be anything in it A fellow like that for manager Phoo Was it the clairvoyance of imbecile hatred or mere stupid tenacity of opinion which ends sometimes by scoring against the world in a most astonishing manner Most of us can remember instances of triumphant folly and that ass Schomberg triumphed The T B C Company went into liquidation as I began by telling you The Tesmans washed their hands of it The Government cancelled those famous contracts the talk died out and presently it was remarked here and there that Heyst had faded completely away He had become invisible as in those early days when he used to make a bolt clear out of sight in his attempts to break away from the enchantment of these isles either in the direction of New Guinea or in the direction of Saigon to cannibals or to cafes The enchanted Heyst Had he at last broken the spell Had he died We were too indifferent to wonder overmuch You see we had on the whole liked him well enough And liking is not sufficient to keep going the interest one takes in a human being With hatred apparently it is otherwise Schomberg couldn t forget Heyst The keen manly Teutonic creature was a good hater A fool often is Good evening gentlemen Have you got everything you want So Good You see What was I always telling you Aha There was nothing in it I knew it But what I would like to know is what became of that Swede He put a stress on the word Swede as if it meant scoundrel He detested Scandinavians generally Why Goodness only knows A fool like that is unfathomable He continued It s five months or more since I have spoken to anybody who has seen him As I have said we were not much interested but Schomberg of course could not understand that He was grotesquely dense Whenever three people came together in his hotel he took good care that Heyst should be with them I hope the fellow did not go and drown himself he would add with a comical earnestness that ought to have made us shudder only our crowd was superficial and did not apprehend the psychology of this pious hope Why Heyst isn t in debt to you for drinks is he somebody asked him once with shallow scorn Drinks Oh dear no The innkeeper was not mercenary Teutonic temperament seldom is But he put on a sinister expression to tell us that Heyst had not paid perhaps three visits altogether to his establishment This was Heyst s crime for which Schomberg wished him nothing less than a long and tormented existence Observe the Teutonic sense of proportion and nice forgiving temper At last one afternoon Schomberg was seen approaching a group of his customers He was obviously in high glee He squared his manly chest with great importance Gentlemen I have news of him Who why that Swede He is still on Samburan He s never been away from it The company is gone the engineers are gone the clerks are gone the coolies are gone everything s gone but there he sticks Captain Davidson coming by from the westward saw him with his own eyes Something white on the wharf so he steamed in and went ashore in a small boat Heyst right enough Put a book into his pocket always very polite Been strolling on the wharf and reading I remain in possession here he told Captain Davidson What I want to know is what he gets to eat there A piece of dried fish now and then what That s coming down pretty low for a man who turned up his nose at my table d hote He winked with immense malice A bell started ringing and he led the way to the dining room as if into a temple very grave with the air of a benefactor of mankind His ambition was to feed it at a profitable price and his delight was to talk of it behind its back It was very characteristic of him to gloat over the idea of Heyst having nothing decent to eat CHAPTER FOUR A few of us who were sufficiently interested went to Davidson for details These were not many He told us that he passed to the north of Samburan on purpose to see what was going on At first it looked as if that side of the island had been altogether abandoned This was what he expected Presently above the dense mass of vegetation that Samburan presents to view he saw the head of the flagstaff without a flag Then while steaming across the slight indentation which for a time was known officially as Black Diamond Bay he made out with his glass the white figure on the coaling wharf It could be no one but Heyst I thought for certain he wanted to be taken off so I steamed in He made no signs However I lowered a boat I could not see another living being anywhere Yes He had a book in his hand He looked exactly as we have always seen him very neat white shoes cork helmet He explained to me that he had always had a taste for solitude It was the first I ever heard of it I told him He only smiled What could I say He isn t the sort of man one can speak familiarly to There s something in him One doesn t care to But what s the object Are you thinking of keeping possession of the mine I asked him Something of the sort he says I am keeping hold But all this is as dead as Julius Caesar I cried In fact you have nothing worth holding on to Heyst Oh I am done with facts says he putting his hand to his helmet sharply with one of his short bows Thus dismissed Davidson went on board his ship swung her out and as he was steaming away he watched from the bridge Heyst walking shoreward along the wharf He marched into the long grass and vanished all but the top of his white cork helmet which seemed to swim in a green sea Then that too disappeared as if it had sunk into the living depths of the tropical vegetation which is more jealous of men s conquests than the ocean and which was about to close over the last vestiges of the liquidated Tropical Belt Coal Company A Heyst manager in the East Davidson a good simple fellow in his way was strangely affected It is to be noted that he knew very little of Heyst He was one of those whom Heyst s finished courtesy of attitude and intonation most strongly disconcerted He himself was a fellow of fine feeling I think though of course he had no more polish than the rest of us We were naturally a hail fellow well met crowd with standards of our own no worse I daresay than other people s but polish was not one of them Davidson s fineness was real enough to alter the course of the steamer he commanded Instead of passing to the south of Samburan he made it his practice to take the passage along the north shore within about a mile of the wharf He can see us if he likes to see us remarked Davidson Then he had an afterthought I say I hope he won t think I am intruding eh We reassured him on the point of correct behaviour The sea is open to all This slight deviation added some ten miles to Davidson s round trip but as that was sixteen hundred miles it did not matter much I have told my owner of it said the conscientious commander of the Sissie His owner had a face like an ancient lemon He was small and wizened which was strange because generally a Chinaman as he grows in prosperity puts on inches of girth and stature To serve a Chinese firm is not so bad Once they become convinced you deal straight by them their confidence becomes unlimited You can do no wrong So Davidson s old Chinaman squeaked hurriedly All right all right all right You do what you like captain And there was an end of the matter not altogether though From time to time the Chinaman used to ask Davidson about the white man He was still there eh I never see him Davidson had to confess to his owner who would peer at him silently through round horn rimmed spectacles several sizes too large for his little old face I never see him To me on occasions he would say I haven t a doubt he s there He hides It s very unpleasant Davidson was a little vexed with Heyst Funny thing he went on Of all the people I speak to nobody ever asks after him but that Chinaman of mine and Schomberg he added after a while Yes Schomberg of course He was asking everybody about everything and arranging the information into the most scandalous shape his imagination could invent From time to time he would step up his blinking cushioned eyes his thick lips his very chestnut beard looking full of malice Evening gentlemen Have you got all you want So Good Well I am told the jungle has choked the very sheds in Black Diamond Bay Fact He s a hermit in the wilderness now But what can this manager get to eat there It beats me Sometimes a stranger would inquire with natural curiosity Who What manager Oh a certain Swede with a sinister emphasis as if he were saying a certain brigand Well known here He s turned hermit from shame That s what the devil does when he s found out Hermit This was the latest of the more or less witty labels applied to Heyst during his aimless pilgrimage in this section of the tropical belt where the inane clacking of Schomberg s tongue vexed our ears But apparently Heyst was not a hermit by temperament The sight of his land was not invincibly odious to him We must believe this since for some reason or other he did come out from his retreat for a while Perhaps it was only to see whether there were any letters for him at the Tesmans I don t know No one knows But this reappearance shows that his detachment from the world was not complete And incompleteness of any sort leads to trouble Axel Heyst ought not to have cared for his letters or whatever it was that brought him out after something more than a year and a half in Samburan But it was of no use He had not the hermit s vocation That was the trouble it seems Be this as it may he suddenly reappeared in the world broad chest bald forehead long moustaches polite manner and all the complete Heyst even to the kindly sunken eyes on which there still rested the shadow of Morrison s death Naturally it was Davidson who had given him a lift out of his forsaken island There were no other opportunities unless some native craft were passing by a very remote and unsatisfactory chance to wait for Yes he came out with Davidson to whom he volunteered the statement that it was only for a short time a few days no more He meant to go back to Samburan Davidson expressing his horror and incredulity of such foolishness Heyst explained that when the company came into being he had his few belongings sent out from Europe To Davidson as to any of us the idea of Heyst the wandering drifting unattached Heyst having any belongings of the sort that can furnish a house was startlingly novel It was grotesquely fantastic It was like a bird owning real property Belongings Do you mean chairs and tables Davidson asked with unconcealed astonishment Heyst did mean that My poor father died in London It has been all stored there ever since he explained For all these years exclaimed Davidson thinking how long we all had known Heyst flitting from tree to tree in a wilderness Even longer said Heyst who had understood very well This seemed to imply that he had been wandering before he came under our observation In what regions And what early age Mystery Perhaps he was a bird that had never had a nest I left school early he remarked once to Davidson on the passage It was in England A very good school I was not a shining success there The confessions of Heyst Not one of us with the probable exception of Morrison who was dead had ever heard so much of his history It looks as if the experience of hermit life had the power to loosen one s tongue doesn t it During that memorable passage in the Sissie which took about two days he volunteered other hints for you could not call it information about his history And Davidson was interested He was interested not because the hints were exciting but because of that innate curiosity about our fellows which is a trait of human nature Davidson s existence too running the Sissie along the Java Sea and back again was distinctly monotonous and in a sense lonely He never had any sort of company on board Native deck passengers in plenty of course but never a white man so the presence of Heyst for two days must have been a godsend Davidson was telling us all about it afterwards Heyst said that his father had written a lot of books He was a philosopher Seems to me he must have been something of a crank too was Davidson s comment Apparently he had quarrelled with his people in Sweden Just the sort of father you would expect Heyst to have Isn t he a bit of a crank himself He told me that directly his father died he lit out into the wide world on his own and had been on the move till he fetched up against this famous coal business Fits the son of the father somehow don t you think For the rest Heyst was as polite as ever He offered to pay for his passage but when Davidson refused to hear of it he seized him heartily by the hand gave one of his courtly bows and declared that he was touched by his friendly proceedings I am not alluding to this trifling amount which you decline to take he went on giving a shake to Davidson s hand But I am touched by your humanity Another shake Believe me I am profoundly aware of having been an object of it Final shake of the hand All this meant that Heyst understood in a proper sense the little Sissie s periodic appearance in sight of his hermitage He s a genuine gentleman Davidson said to us I was really sorry when he went ashore We asked him where he had left Heyst Why in Sourabaya where else The Tesmans had their principal counting house in Sourabaya There had long existed a connection between Heyst and the Tesmans The incongruity of a hermit having agents did not strike us nor yet the absurdity of a forgotten cast off derelict manager of a wrecked collapsed vanished enterprise having business to attend to We said Sourabaya of course and took it for granted that he would stay with one of the Tesmans One of us even wondered what sort of reception he would get for it was known that Julius Tesman was unreasonably bitter about the Tropical Belt Coal fiasco But Davidson set us right It was nothing of the kind Heyst went to stay in Schomberg s hotel going ashore in the hotel launch Not that Schomberg would think of sending his launch alongside a mere trader like the Sissie But she had been meeting a coasting mail packet and had been signalled to Schomberg himself was steering her You should have seen Schomberg s eyes bulge out when Heyst jumped in with an ancient brown leather bag said Davidson He pretended not to know who it was at first anyway I didn t go ashore with them We didn t stay more than a couple of hours altogether Landed two thousand coconuts and cleared out I have agreed to pick him up again on my next trip in twenty days time CHAPTER FIVE Davidson happened to be two days late on his return trip no great matter certainly but he made a point of going ashore at once during the hottest hour of the afternoon to look for Heyst Schomberg s hotel stood back in an extensive enclosure containing a garden some large trees and under their spreading boughs a detached hall available for concerts and other performances as Schomberg worded it in his advertisements Torn and fluttering bills intimating in heavy red capitals CONCERTS EVERY NIGHT were stuck on the brick pillars on each side of the gateway The walk had been long and confoundedly sunny Davidson stood wiping his wet neck and face on what Schomberg called the piazza Several doors opened on to it but all the screens were down Not a soul was in sight not even a China boy nothing but a lot of painted iron chairs and tables Solitude shade and gloomy silence and a faint treacherous breeze which came from under the trees and quite unexpectedly caused the melting Davidson to shiver slightly the little shiver of the tropics which in Sourabaya especially often means fever and the hospital to the incautious white man The prudent Davidson sought shelter in the nearest darkened room In the artificial dusk beyond the levels of shrouded billiard tables a white form heaved up from two chairs on which it had been extended The middle of the day table d hote tiffin once over was Schomberg s easy time He lounged out portly deliberate on the defensive the great fair beard like a cuirass over his manly chest He did not like Davidson never a very faithful client of his He hit a bell on one of the tables as he went by and asked in a distant Officer in Reserve manner You desire The good Davidson still sponging his wet neck declared with simplicity that he had come to fetch away Heyst as agreed Not here A Chinaman appeared in response to the bell Schomberg turned to him very severely Take the gentleman s order Davidson had to be going Couldn t wait only begged that Heyst should be informed that the Sissie would leave at midnight Not here I am telling you Davidson slapped his thigh in concern Dear me Hospital I suppose A natural enough surmise in a very feverish locality The Lieutenant of the Reserve only pursed up his mouth and raised his eyebrows without looking at him It might have meant anything but Davidson dismissed the hospital idea with confidence However he had to get hold of Heyst between this and midnight He has been staying here he asked Yes he was staying here Can you tell me where he is now Davidson went on placidly Within himself he was beginning to grow anxious having developed the affection of a self appointed protector towards Heyst The answer he got was Can t tell It s none of my business accompanied by majestic oscillations of the hotel keeper s head hinting at some awful mystery Davidson was placidity itself It was his nature He did not betray his sentiments which were not favourable to Schomberg I am sure to find out at the Tesmans office he thought But it was a very hot hour and if Heyst was down at the port he would have learned already that the Sissie was in It was even possible that Heyst had already gone on board where he could enjoy a coolness denied to the town Davidson being stout was much preoccupied with coolness and inclined to immobility He lingered awhile as if irresolute Schomberg at the door looking out affected perfect indifference He could not keep it up though Suddenly he turned inward and asked with brusque rage You wanted to see him Why yes said Davidson We agreed to meet Don t you bother He doesn t care about that now Doesn t he Well you can judge for yourself He isn t here is he You take my word for it Don t you bother about him I am advising you as a friend Thank you said Davidson inwardly startled at the savage tone I think I will sit down for a moment and have a drink after all This was not what Schomberg had expected to hear He called brutally Boy The Chinaman approached and after referring him to the white man by a nod the hotel keeper departed muttering to himself Davidson heard him gnash his teeth as he went Davidson sat alone with the billiard tables as if there had been not a soul staying in the hotel His placidity was so genuine that he was not unduly fretting himself over the absence of Heyst or the mysterious manners Schomberg had treated him to He was considering these things in his own fairly shrewd way Something had happened and he was loath to go away to investigate being restrained by a presentiment that somehow enlightenment would come to him there A poster of CONCERTS EVERY EVENING like those on the gate but in a good state of preservation hung on the wall fronting him He looked at it idly and was struck by the fact then not so very common that it was a ladies orchestra Zangiacomo s eastern tour eighteen performers The poster stated that they had had the honour of playing their select repertoire before various colonial excellencies also before pashas sheiks chiefs H H the Sultan of Mascate et cetera et cetera Davidson felt sorry for the eighteen lady performers He knew what that sort of life was like the sordid conditions and brutal incidents of such tours led by such Zangiacomos who often were anything but musicians by profession While he was staring at the poster a door somewhere at his back opened and a woman came in who was looked upon as Schomberg s wife no doubt with truth As somebody remarked cynically once she was too unattractive to be anything else The opinion that he treated her abominably was based on her frightened expression Davidson lifted his hat to her missus Schomberg gave him an inclination of her sallow head and incontinently sat down behind a sort of raised counter facing the door with a mirror and rows of bottles at her back Her hair was very elaborately done with two ringlets on the left side of her scraggy neck her dress was of silk and she had come on duty for the afternoon For some reason or other Schomberg exacted this from her though she added nothing to the fascinations of the place She sat there in the smoke and noise like an enthroned idol smiling stupidly over the billiards from time to time speaking to no one and no one speaking to her Schomberg himself took no more interest in her than may be implied in a sudden and totally unmotived scowl Otherwise the very Chinamen ignored her existence She had interrupted Davidson in his reflections Being alone with her her silence and open eyed immobility made him uncomfortable He was easily sorry for people It seemed rude not to take any notice of her He said in allusion to the poster Are you having these people in the house She was so unused to being addressed by customers that at the sound of his voice she jumped in her seat Davidson was telling us afterwards that she jumped exactly like a figure made of wood without losing her rigid immobility She did not even move her eyes but she answered him freely though her very lips seemed made of wood They stayed here over a month They are gone now They played every evening Pretty good were they To this she said nothing and as she kept on staring fixedly in front of her her silence disconcerted Davidson It looked as if she had not heard him which was impossible Perhaps she drew the line of speech at the expression of opinions Schomberg might have trained her for domestic reasons to keep them to herself But Davidson felt in honour obliged to converse so he said putting his own interpretation on this surprising silence I see not much account Such bands hardly ever are An Italian lot missus Schomberg to judge by the name of the boss She shook her head negatively No He is a German really only he dyes his hair and beard black for business Zangiacomo is his business name That s a curious fact said Davidson His head being full of Heyst it occurred to him that she might be aware of other facts This was a very amazing discovery to anyone who looked at missus Schomberg Nobody had ever suspected her of having a mind I mean even a little of it I mean any at all One was inclined to think of her as an It an automaton a very plain dummy with an arrangement for bowing the head at times and smiling stupidly now and then Davidson viewed her profile with a flattened nose a hollow cheek and one staring unwinking goggle eye He asked himself Did that speak just now Will it speak again It was as exciting for the mere wonder of it as trying to converse with a mechanism A smile played about the fat features of Davidson the smile of a man making an amusing experiment He spoke again to her But the other members of that orchestra were real Italians were they not Of course he didn t care He wanted to see whether the mechanism would work again It did It said they were not They were of all sorts apparently It paused with the one goggle eye immovably gazing down the whole length of the room and through the door opening on to the piazza It paused then went on in the same low pitch There was even one English girl Poor devil said Davidson I suppose these women are not much better than slaves really Was that fellow with the dyed beard decent in his way The mechanism remained silent The sympathetic soul of Davidson drew its own conclusions Beastly life for these women he said When you say an English girl missus Schomberg do you really mean a young girl Some of these orchestra girls are no chicks Young enough came the low voice out of missus Schomberg s unmoved physiognomy Davidson encouraged remarked that he was sorry for her He was easily sorry for people Where did they go to from here he asked She did not go with them She ran away This was the pronouncement Davidson obtained next It introduced a new sort of interest Well Well he exclaimed placidly and then with the air of a man who knows life Who with he inquired with assurance missus Schomberg s immobility gave her an appearance of listening intently Perhaps she was really listening but Schomberg must have been finishing his sleep in some distant part of the house The silence was profound and lasted long enough to become startling Then enthroned above Davidson she whispered at last That friend of yours Oh you know I am here looking for a friend said Davidson hopefully Won t you tell me I ve told you Eh A mist seemed to roll away from before Davidson s eyes disclosing something he could not believe You can t mean it he cried He s not the man for it But the last words came out in a faint voice missus Schomberg never moved her head the least bit Davidson after the shock which made him sit up went slack all over Heyst Such a perfect gentleman he exclaimed weakly missus Schomberg did not seem to have heard him This startling fact did not tally somehow with the idea Davidson had of Heyst He never talked of women he never seemed to think of them or to remember that they existed and then all at once like this Running off with a casual orchestra girl You might have knocked me down with a feather Davidson told us some time afterwards By then he was taking an indulgent view of both the parties to that amazing transaction First of all on reflection he was by no means certain that it prevented Heyst from being a perfect gentleman as before He confronted our open grins or quiet smiles with a serious round face Heyst had taken the girl away to Samburan and that was no joking matter The loneliness the ruins of the spot had impressed Davidson s simple soul They were incompatible with the frivolous comments of people who had not seen it That black jetty sticking out of the jungle into the empty sea these roof ridges of deserted houses peeping dismally above the long grass Ough The gigantic and funereal blackboard sign of the Tropical Belt Coal Company still emerging from a wild growth of bushes like an inscription stuck above a grave figured by the tall heap of unsold coal at the shore end of the wharf added to the general desolation Thus was the sensitive Davidson The girl must have been miserable indeed to follow such a strange man to such a spot Heyst had no doubt told her the truth He was a gentleman But no words could do justice to the conditions of life on Samburan A desert island was nothing to it Moreover when you were cast away on a desert island why you could not help yourself but to expect a fiddle playing girl out of an ambulant ladies orchestra to remain content there for a day for one single day was inconceivable She would be frightened at the first sight of it She would scream The capacity for sympathy in these stout placid men Davidson was stirred to the depths and it was easy to see that it was about Heyst that he was concerned We asked him if he had passed that way lately Oh yes I always do about half a mile off Seen anybody about No not a soul Not a shadow Did you blow your whistle Blow the whistle You think I would do such a thing He rejected the mere possibility of such an unwarrantable intrusion Wonderfully delicate fellow Davidson Well but how do you know that they are there he was naturally asked Heyst had entrusted missus Schomberg with a message for Davidson a few lines in pencil on a scrap of crumpled paper It was to the effect that an unforeseen necessity was driving him away before the appointed time He begged Davidson s indulgence for the apparent discourtesy The woman of the house meaning missus Schomberg would give him the facts though unable to explain them of course What was there to explain wondered Davidson dubiously He took a fancy to that fiddle playing girl and And she to him apparently I suggested Wonderfully quick work reflected Davidson What do you think will come of it Repentance I should say But how is it that missus Schomberg has been selected for a confidante For indeed a waxwork figure would have seemed more useful than that woman whom we all were accustomed to see sitting elevated above the two billiard tables without expression without movement without voice without sight Why she helped the girl to bolt said Davidson turning at me his innocent eyes rounded by the state of constant amazement in which this affair had left him like those shocks of terror or sorrow which sometimes leave their victim afflicted by nervous trembling It looked as though he would never get over it missus Schomberg jerked Heyst s note twisted like a pipe light into my lap while I sat there unsuspecting Davidson went on Directly I had recovered my senses I asked her what on earth she had to do with it that Heyst should leave it with her And then behaving like a painted image rather than a live woman she whispered just loud enough for me to hear I helped them I got her things together tied them up in my own shawl and threw them into the compound out of a back window I did it That woman that you would say hadn t the pluck to lift her little finger marvelled Davidson in his quiet slightly panting voice What do you think of that I thought she must have had some interest of her own to serve She was too lifeless to be suspected of impulsive compassion It was impossible to think that Heyst had bribed her Whatever means he had he had not the means to do that Or could it be that she was moved by that disinterested passion for delivering a woman to a man which in respectable spheres is called matchmaking a highly irregular example of it It must have been a very small bundle remarked Davidson further I imagine the girl must have been specially attractive I said I don t know She was miserable I don t suppose it was more than a little linen and a couple of those white frocks they wear on the platform Davidson pursued his own train of thought He supposed that such a thing had never been heard of in the history of the tropics For where could you find anyone to steal a girl out of an orchestra No doubt fellows here and there took a fancy to some pretty one but it was not for running away with her Oh dear no It needed a lunatic like Heyst Only think what it means wheezed Davidson imaginative under his invincible placidity Just only try to think Brooding alone on Samburan has upset his brain He never stopped to consider or he couldn t have done it No sane man How is a thing like that to go on What s he going to do with her in the end It s madness You say that he s mad Schomberg tells us that he must be starving on his island so he may end yet by eating her I suggested missus Schomberg had had no time to enter into details Davidson told us Indeed the wonder was that they had been left alone so long The drowsy afternoon was slipping by Footsteps and voices resounded on the veranda I beg pardon the piazza the scraping of chairs the ping of a smitten bell Customers were turning up missus Schomberg was begging Davidson hurriedly but without looking at him to say nothing to anyone when on a half uttered word her nervous whisper was cut short Through a small inner door Schomberg came in his hair brushed his beard combed neatly but his eyelids still heavy from his nap He looked with suspicion at Davidson and even glanced at his wife but he was baffled by the natural placidity of the one and the acquired habit of immobility in the other Have you sent out the drinks he asked surlily She did not open her lips because just then the head boy appeared with a loaded tray on his way out Schomberg went to the door and greeted the customers outside but did not join them He remained blocking half the doorway with his back to the room and was still there when Davidson after sitting still for a while rose to go At the noise he made Schomberg turned his head watched him lift his hat to missus Schomberg and receive her wooden bow accompanied by a stupid grin and then looked away He was loftily dignified Davidson stopped at the door deep in his simplicity I am sorry you won t tell me anything about my friend s absence he said My friend Heyst you know I suppose the only course for me now is to make inquiries down at the port I shall hear something there I don t doubt Make inquiries of the devil replied Schomberg in a hoarse mutter Davidson s purpose in addressing the hotel keeper had been mainly to make missus Schomberg safe from suspicion but he would fain have heard something more of Heyst s exploit from another point of view It was a shrewd try It was successful in a rather startling way because the hotel keeper s point of view was horribly abusive All of a sudden in the same hoarse sinister tone he proceeded to call Heyst many names of which pig dog was not the worst with such vehemence that he actually choked himself Profiting from the pause Davidson whose temperament could withstand worse shocks remonstrated in an undertone It s unreasonable to get so angry as that Even if he had run off with your cash box The big hotel keeper bent down and put his infuriated face close to Davidson s My cash box My he look here Captain Davidson He ran off with a girl What do I care for the girl The girl is nothing to me He shot out an infamous word which made Davidson start That s what the girl was and he reiterated the assertion that she was nothing to him What he was concerned for was the good name of his house Wherever he had been established he had always had artist parties staying in his house One recommended him to the others but what would happen now when it got about that leaders ran the risk in his house his house of losing members of their troupe And just now when he had spent seven hundred and thirty four guilders in building a concert hall in his compound Was that a thing to do in a respectable hotel The cheek the indecency the impudence the atrocity Vagabond impostor swindler ruffian schwein hund He had seized Davidson by a button of his coat detaining him in the doorway and exactly in the line of missus Schomberg s stony gaze Davidson stole a glance in that direction and thought of making some sort of reassuring sign to her but she looked so bereft of senses and almost of life perched up there that it seemed not worth while He disengaged his button with firm placidity Thereupon with a last stifled curse Schomberg vanished somewhere within to try and compose his spirits in solitude Davidson stepped out on the veranda The party of customers there had become aware of the explosive interlude in the doorway Davidson knew one of these men and nodded to him in passing but his acquaintance called out Isn t he in a filthy temper He s been like that ever since The speaker laughed aloud while all the others sat smiling Davidson stopped Yes rather His feelings were he told us those of bewildered resignation but of course that was no more visible to the others than the emotions of a turtle when it withdraws into its shell It seems unreasonable he murmured thoughtfully Oh but they had a scrap the other said What do you mean Was there a fight a fight with Heyst asked Davidson much perturbed if somewhat incredulous Heyst No these two the bandmaster the fellow who s taking these women about and our Schomberg Signor Zangiacomo ran amuck in the morning and went for our worthy friend I tell you they were rolling on the floor together on this very veranda after chasing each other all over the house doors slamming women screaming seventeen of them in the dining room Chinamen up the trees Hey John You climb tree to see the fight eh The boy almond eyed and impassive emitted a scornful grunt finished wiping the table and withdrew That s what it was a real go as you please scrap And Zangiacomo began it Oh here s Schomberg Say Schomberg didn t he fly at you when the girl was missed because it was you who insisted that the artists should go about the audience during the interval Schomberg had reappeared in the doorway He advanced His bearing was stately but his nostrils were extraordinarily expanded and he controlled his voice with apparent effort Certainly That was only business I quoted him special terms and all for your sake gentlemen I was thinking of my regular customers There s nothing to do in the evenings in this town I think gentlemen you were all pleased at the opportunity of hearing a little good music and where s the harm of offering a grenadine or what not to a lady artist But that fellow that Swede he got round the girl He got round all the people out here I ve been watching him for years You remember how he got round Morrison He changed front abruptly as if on parade and marched off The customers at the table exchanged glances silently Davidson s attitude was that of a spectator Schomberg s moody pacing of the billiard room could be heard on the veranda And the funniest part is resumed the man who had been speaking before an English clerk in a Dutch house the funniest part is that before nine o clock that same morning those two were driving together in a gharry down to the port to look for Heyst and the girl I saw them rushing around making inquiries I don t know what they would have done to the girl but they seemed quite ready to fall upon your Heyst Davidson and kill him on the quay He had never he said seen anything so queer Those two investigators working feverishly to the same end were glaring at each other with surprising ferocity In hatred and mistrust they entered a steam launch and went flying from ship to ship all over the harbour causing no end of sensation The captains of vessels coming on shore later in the day brought tales of a strange invasion and wanted to know who were the two offensive lunatics in a steam launch apparently after a man and a girl and telling a story of which one could make neither head nor tail Their reception by the roadstead was generally unsympathetic even to the point of the mate of an American ship bundling them out over the rail with unseemly precipitation Meantime Heyst and the girl were a good few miles away having gone in the night on board one of the Tesman schooners bound to the eastward This was known afterwards from the Javanese boatmen whom Heyst hired for the purpose at three o clock in the morning The Tesman schooner had sailed at daylight with the usual land breeze and was probably still in sight in the offing at the time However the two pursuers after their experience with the American mate made for the shore On landing they had another violent row in the German language But there was no second fight and finally with looks of fierce animosity they got together into a gharry obviously with the frugal view of sharing expenses and drove away leaving an astonished little crowd of Europeans and natives on the quay After hearing this wondrous tale Davidson went away from the hotel veranda which was filling with Schomberg s regular customers Heyst s escapade was the general topic of conversation Never before had that unaccountable individual been the cause of so much gossip he judged No Not even in the beginnings of the Tropical Belt Coal Company when becoming for a moment a public character was he the object of a silly criticism and unintelligent envy for every vagabond and adventurer in the islands Davidson concluded that people liked to discuss that sort of scandal better than any other I asked him if he believed that this was such a great scandal after all Heavens no said that excellent man who himself was incapable of any impropriety of conduct But it isn t a thing I would have done myself I mean even if I had not been married There was no implied condemnation in the statement rather something like regret Davidson shared my suspicion that this was in its essence the rescue of a distressed human being Not that we were two romantics tingeing the world to the hue of our temperament but that both of us had been acute enough to discover a long time ago that Heyst was I shouldn t have had the pluck he continued I see a thing all round as it were but Heyst doesn t or else he would have been scared You don t take a woman into a desert jungle without being made sorry for it sooner or later in one way or another and Heyst being a gentleman only makes it worse CHAPTER SIX We said no more about Heyst on that occasion and it so happened that I did not meet Davidson again for some three months When we did come together almost the first thing he said to me was I ve seen him Before I could exclaim he assured me that he had taken no liberty that he had not intruded He was called in Otherwise he would not have dreamed of breaking in upon Heyst s privacy I am certain you wouldn t I assured him concealing my amusement at his wonderful delicacy He was the most delicate man that ever took a small steamer to and fro among the islands But his humanity which was not less strong and praiseworthy had induced him to take his steamer past Samburan wharf at an average distance of a mile every twenty three days exactly Davidson was delicate humane and regular Heyst called you in I asked interested Yes Heyst had called him in as he was going by on his usual date Davidson was examining the shore through his glasses with his unwearied and punctual humanity as he steamed past Samburan I saw a man in white It could only have been Heyst He had fastened some sort of enormous flag to a bamboo pole and was waving it at the end of the old wharf Davidson didn t like to take his steamer alongside for fear of being indiscreet I suppose but he steered close inshore stopped his engines and lowered a boat He went himself in that boat which was manned of course by his Malay seamen Heyst when he saw the boat pulling towards him dropped his signalling pole and when Davidson arrived he was kneeling down engaged busily in unfastening the flag from it Was there anything wrong I inquired Davidson having paused in his narrative and my curiosity being naturally aroused You must remember that Heyst as the Archipelago knew him was not what shall I say was not a signalling sort of man The very words that came out of my mouth said Davidson before I laid the boat against the piles I could not help it Heyst got up from his knees and began carefully folding up the flag thing which struck Davidson as having the dimensions of a blanket No nothing wrong he cried His white teeth flashed agreeably below the coppery horizontal bar of his long moustaches I don t know whether it was his delicacy or his obesity which prevented Davidson from clambering upon the wharf He stood up in the boat and above him Heyst stooped low with urbane smiles thanking him and apologizing for the liberty exactly in his usual manner Davidson had expected some change in the man but there was none Nothing in him betrayed the momentous fact that within that jungle there was a girl a performer in a ladies orchestra whom he had carried straight off the concert platform into the wilderness He was not ashamed or defiant or abashed about it He might have been a shade confidential when addressing Davidson And his words were enigmatical I took this course of signalling to you he said to Davidson because to preserve appearances might be of the utmost importance Not to me of course I don t care what people may say and of course no one can hurt me I suppose I have done a certain amount of harm since I allowed myself to be tempted into action It seemed innocent enough but all action is bound to be harmful It is devilish That is why this world is evil upon the whole But I have done with it I shall never lift a little finger again At one time I thought that intelligent observation of facts was the best way of cheating the time which is allotted to us whether we want it or not but now I have done with observation too Imagine poor simple Davidson being addressed in such terms alongside an abandoned decaying wharf jutting out of tropical bush He had never heard anybody speak like this before certainly not Heyst whose conversation was concise polite with a faint ring of playfulness in the cultivated tones of his voice He s gone mad Davidson thought to himself But looking at the physiognomy above him on the wharf he was obliged to dismiss the notion of common crude lunacy It was truly most unusual talk Then he remembered in his surprise he had lost sight of it that Heyst now had a girl there This bizarre discourse was probably the effect of the girl Davidson shook off the absurd feeling and asked wishing to make clear his friendliness and not knowing what else to say You haven t run short of stores or anything like that Heyst smiled and shook his head No no Nothing of the kind We are fairly well off here Thanks all the same If I have taken the liberty to detain you it is not from any uneasiness for myself and my companion The person I was thinking of when I made up my mind to invoke your assistance is missus Schomberg I have talked with her interjected Davidson Oh You Yes I hoped she would find means to But she didn t tell me much interrupted Davidson who was not averse from hearing something he hardly knew what H m Yes But that note of mine Yes She found an opportunity to give it to you That s good very good She s more resourceful than one would give her credit for Women often are remarked Davidson The strangeness from which he had suffered merely because his interlocutor had carried off a girl wore off as the minutes went by There s a lot of unexpectedness about women he generalized with a didactic aim which seemed to miss its mark for the next thing Heyst said was This is missus Schomberg s shawl He touched the stuff hanging over his arm An Indian thing I believe he added glancing at his arm sideways It isn t of particular value said Davidson truthfully Very likely The point is that it belongs to Schomberg s wife That Schomberg seems to be an unconscionable ruffian don t you think so Davidson smiled faintly We out here have got used to him he said as if excusing a universal and guilty toleration of a manifest nuisance I d hardly call him that I only know him as a hotel keeper I never knew him even as that not till this time when you were so obliging as to take me to Sourabaya I went to stay there from economy The Netherlands House is very expensive and they expect you to bring your own servant with you It s a nuisance Of course of course protested Davidson hastily After a short silence Heyst returned to the matter of the shawl He wanted to send it back to missus Schomberg He said that it might be very awkward for her if she were unable if asked to produce it This had given him Heyst much uneasiness She was terrified of Schomberg Apparently she had reason to be Davidson had remarked that too Which did not prevent her he pointed out from making a fool of him in a way for the sake of a stranger Oh You know said Heyst Yes she helped me us She told me so I had quite a talk with her Davidson informed him Fancy anyone having a talk with missus Schomberg If I were to tell the fellows they wouldn t believe me How did you get round her Heyst How did you think of it Why she looks too stupid to understand human speech and too scared to shoo a chicken away Oh the women the women You don t know what there may be in the quietest of them She was engaged in the task of defending her position in life said Heyst It s a very respectable task Is that it I had some idea it was that confessed Davidson He then imparted to Heyst the story of the violent proceedings following on the discovery of his flight Heyst s polite attention to the tale took on a sombre cast but he manifested no surprise and offered no comment When Davidson had finished he handed down the shawl into the boat and Davidson promised to do his best to return it to missus Schomberg in some secret fashion Heyst expressed his thanks in a few simple words set off by his manner of finished courtesy Davidson prepared to depart They were not looking at each other Suddenly Heyst spoke You understand that this was a case of odious persecution don t you I became aware of it and It was a view which the sympathetic Davidson was capable of appreciating I am not surprised to hear it he said placidly Odious enough I dare say And you of course not being a married man were free to step in Ah well He sat down in the stern sheets and already had the steering lines in his hands when Heyst observed abruptly The world is a bad dog It will bite you if you give it a chance but I think that here we can safely defy the fates When relating all this to me Davidson s only comment was Funny notion of defying the fates to take a woman in tow CHAPTER SEVEN Some considerable time afterwards we did not meet very often I asked Davidson how he had managed about the shawl and heard that he had tackled his mission in a direct way and had found it easy enough At the very first call he made in Samarang he rolled the shawl as tightly as he could into the smallest possible brown paper parcel which he carried ashore with him His business in the town being transacted he got into a gharry with the parcel and drove to the hotel With his precious experience he timed his arrival accurately for the hour of Schomberg s siesta Finding the place empty as on the former occasion he marched into the billiard room took a seat at the back near the sort of dais which missus Schomberg would in due course come to occupy and broke the slumbering silence of the house by thumping a bell vigorously Of course a Chinaman appeared promptly Davidson ordered a drink and sat tight I would have ordered twenty drinks one after another if necessary he said Davidson s a very abstemious man rather than take that parcel out of the house again Couldn t leave it in a corner without letting the woman know it was there It might have turned out worse for her than not bringing the thing back at all And so he waited ringing the bell again and again and swallowing two or three iced drinks which he did not want Presently as he hoped it would happen missus Schomberg came in silk dress long neck ringlets scared eyes and silly grin all complete Probably that lazy beast had sent her out to see who was the thirsty customer waking up the echoes of the house at this quiet hour Bow nod and she clambered up to her post behind the raised counter looking so helpless so inane as she sat there that if it hadn t been for the parcel Davidson declared he would have thought he had merely dreamed all that had passed between them He ordered another drink to get the Chinaman out of the room and then seized the parcel which was reposing on a chair near him and with no more than a mutter this is something of yours he rammed it swiftly into a recess in the counter at her feet There The rest was her affair And just in time too Schomberg turned up yawning affectedly almost before Davidson had regained his seat He cast about suspicious and irate glances An invincible placidity of expression helped Davidson wonderfully at the moment and the other of course could have no grounds for the slightest suspicion of any sort of understanding between his wife and this customer As to missus Schomberg she sat there like a joss Davidson was lost in admiration He believed now that the woman had been putting it on for years She never even winked It was immense The insight he had obtained almost frightened him he couldn t get over his wonder at knowing more of the real missus Schomberg than anybody in the Islands including Schomberg himself She was a miracle of dissimulation No wonder Heyst got the girl away from under two men s noses if he had her to help with the job The greatest wonder after all was Heyst getting mixed up with petticoats The fellow s life had been open to us for years and nothing could have been more detached from feminine associations Except that he stood drinks to people on suitable occasions like any other man this observer of facts seemed to have no connection with earthly affairs and passions The very courtesy of his manner the flavour of playfulness in the voice set him apart He was like a feather floating lightly in the workaday atmosphere which was the breath of our nostrils For this reason whenever this looker on took contact with things he attracted attention First it was the Morrison partnership of mystery then came the great sensation of the Tropical Belt Coal where indeed varied interests were involved a real business matter And then came this elopement this incongruous phenomenon of self assertion the greatest wonder of all astonishing and amusing Davidson admitted to me that the hubbub was subsiding and the affair would have been already forgotten perhaps if that ass Schomberg had not kept on gnashing his teeth publicly about it It was really provoking that Davidson should not be able to give one some idea of the girl Was she pretty He didn t know He had stayed the whole afternoon in Schomberg s hotel mainly for the purpose of finding out something about her But the story was growing stale The parties at the tables on the veranda had other fresher events to talk about and Davidson shrank from making direct inquiries He sat placidly there content to be disregarded and hoping for some chance word to turn up I shouldn t wonder if the good fellow hadn t been dozing It s difficult to give you an adequate idea of Davidson s placidity Presently Schomberg wandering about joined a party that had taken the table next to Davidson s A man like that Swede gentlemen is a public danger he began I remember him for years I won t say anything of his spying well he used to say himself he was looking for out of the way facts and what is that if not spying He was spying into everybody s business He got hold of Captain Morrison squeezed him dry like you would an orange and scared him off to Europe to die there Everybody knows that Captain Morrison had a weak chest Robbed first and murdered afterwards I don t mince words not I Next he gets up that swindle of the Belt Coal You know all about it And now after lining his pockets with other people s money he kidnaps a white girl belonging to an orchestra which is performing in my public room for the benefit of my patrons and goes off to live like a prince on that island where nobody can get at him A damn silly girl It s disgusting tfui He spat He choked with rage for he saw visions no doubt He jumped up from his chair and went away to flee from them perhaps He went into the room where missus Schomberg sat Her aspect could not have been very soothing to the sort of torment from which he was suffering Davidson did not feel called upon to defend Heyst His proceeding was to enter into conversation with one and another casually and showing no particular knowledge of the affair in order to discover something about the girl Was she anything out of the way Was she pretty She couldn t have been markedly so She had not attracted special notice She was young on that everybody agreed The English clerk of Tesmans remembered that she had a sallow face He was respectable and highly proper He was not the sort to associate with such people Most of these women were fairly battered specimens Schomberg had them housed in what he called the Pavilion in the grounds where they were hard at it mending and washing their white dresses and could be seen hanging them out to dry between the trees like a lot of washerwomen They looked very much like middle aged washerwomen on the platform too But the girl had been living in the main building along with the boss the director the fellow with the black beard and a hard bitten oldish woman who took the piano and was understood to be the fellow s wife This was not a very satisfactory result Davidson stayed on and even joined the table d hote dinner without gleaning any more information He was resigned I suppose he wheezed placidly I am bound to see her some day He meant to take the Samburan channel every trip as before of course Yes I said No doubt you will Some day Heyst will be signalling to you again and I wonder what it will be for Davidson made no reply He had his own ideas about that and his silence concealed a good deal of thought We spoke no more of Heyst s girl Before we separated he gave me a piece of unrelated observation It s funny he said but I fancy there s some gambling going on in the evening at Schomberg s place on the quiet I ve noticed men strolling away in twos and threes towards that hall where the orchestra used to play The windows must be specially well shuttered because I could not spy the smallest gleam of light from that direction but I can t believe that those beggars would go in there only to sit and think of their sins in the dark That s strange It s incredible that Schomberg should risk that sort of thing I said PART TWO CHAPTER ONE As we know Heyst had gone to stay in Schomberg s hotel in complete ignorance that his person was odious to that worthy When he arrived Zangiacomo s Ladies Orchestra had been established there for some time The business which had called him out from his seclusion in his lost corner of the Eastern seas was with the Tesmans and it had something to do with money He transacted it quickly and then found himself with nothing to do while he awaited Davidson who was to take him back to his solitude for back to his solitude Heyst meant to go He whom we used to refer to as the Enchanted Heyst was suffering from thorough disenchantment Not with the islands however The Archipelago has a lasting fascination It is not easy to shake off the spell of island life Heyst was disenchanted with life as a whole His scornful temperament beguiled into action suffered from failure in a subtle way unknown to men accustomed to grapple with the realities of common human enterprise It was like the gnawing pain of useless apostasy a sort of shame before his own betrayed nature and in addition he also suffered from plain downright remorse He deemed himself guilty of Morrison s death A rather absurd feeling since no one could possibly have foreseen the horrors of the cold wet summer lying in wait for poor Morrison at home It was not in Heyst s character to turn morose but his mental state was not compatible with a sociable mood He spent his evenings sitting apart on the veranda of Schomberg s hotel The lamentations of string instruments issued from the building in the hotel compound the approaches to which were decorated with Japanese paper lanterns strung up between the trunks of several big trees Scraps of tunes more or less plaintive reached his ears They pursued him even into his bedroom which opened into an upstairs veranda The fragmentary and rasping character of these sounds made their intrusion inexpressibly tedious in the long run Like most dreamers to whom it is given sometimes to hear the music of the spheres Heyst the wanderer of the Archipelago had a taste for silence which he had been able to gratify for years The islands are very quiet One sees them lying about clothed in their dark garments of leaves in a great hush of silver and azure where the sea without murmurs meets the sky in a ring of magic stillness A sort of smiling somnolence broods over them the very voices of their people are soft and subdued as if afraid to break some protecting spell Perhaps this was the very spell which had enchanted Heyst in the early days For him however that was broken He was no longer enchanted though he was still a captive of the islands He had no intention to leave them ever Where could he have gone to after all these years Not a single soul belonging to him lived anywhere on earth Of this fact not such a remote one after all he had only lately become aware for it is failure that makes a man enter into himself and reckon up his resources And though he had made up his mind to retire from the world in hermit fashion yet he was irrationally moved by this sense of loneliness which had come to him in the hour of renunciation It hurt him Nothing is more painful than the shock of sharp contradictions that lacerate our intelligence and our feelings Meantime Schomberg watched Heyst out of the corner of his eye Towards the unconscious object of his enmity he preserved a distant lieutenant of the Reserve demeanour Nudging certain of his customers with his elbow he begged them to observe what airs that Swede was giving himself I really don t know why he has come to stay in my house This place isn t good enough for him I wish to goodness he had gone somewhere else to show off his superiority Here I have got up this series of concerts for you gentlemen just to make things a little brighter generally and do you think he ll condescend to step in and listen to a piece or two of an evening Not he I know him of old There he sits at the dark end of the piazza all the evening long planning some new swindle no doubt For two pence I would ask him to go and look for quarters somewhere else only one doesn t like to treat a white man like that out in the tropics I don t know how long he means to stay but I m willing to bet a trifle that he ll never work himself up to the point of spending the fifty cents of entrance money for the sake of a little good music Nobody cared to bet or the hotel keeper would have lost One evening Heyst was driven to desperation by the rasped squeaked scraped snatches of tunes pursuing him even to his hard couch with a mattress as thin as a pancake and a diaphanous mosquito net He descended among the trees where the soft glow of Japanese lanterns picked out parts of their great rugged trunks here and there in the great mass of darkness under the lofty foliage More lanterns of the shape of cylindrical concertinas hanging in a row from a slack string decorated the doorway of what Schomberg called grandiloquently my concert hall In his desperate mood Heyst ascended three steps lifted a calico curtain and went in The uproar in that small barn like structure built of imported pine boards and raised clear of the ground was simply stunning An instrumental uproar screaming grunting whining sobbing scraping squeaking some kind of lively air while a grand piano operated upon by a bony red faced woman with bad tempered nostrils rained hard notes like hail through the tempest of fiddles The small platform was filled with white muslin dresses and crimson sashes slanting from shoulders provided with bare arms which sawed away without respite Zangiacomo conducted He wore a white mess jacket a black dress waistcoat and white trousers His longish tousled hair and his great beard were purple black He was horrible The heat was terrific There were perhaps thirty people having drinks at several little tables Heyst quite overcome by the volume of noise dropped into a chair In the quick time of that music in the varied piercing clamour of the strings in the movements of the bare arms in the low dresses the coarse faces the stony eyes of the executants there was a suggestion of brutality something cruel sensual and repulsive This is awful Heyst murmured to himself But there is an unholy fascination in systematic noise He did not flee from it incontinently as one might have expected him to do He remained astonished at himself for remaining since nothing could have been more repulsive to his tastes more painful to his senses and so to speak more contrary to his genius than this rude exhibition of vigour The Zangiacomo band was not making music it was simply murdering silence with a vulgar ferocious energy One felt as if witnessing a deed of violence and that impression was so strong that it seemed marvellous to see the people sitting so quietly on their chairs drinking so calmly out of their glasses and giving no signs of distress anger or fear Heyst averted his gaze from the unnatural spectacle of their indifference When the piece of music came to an end the relief was so great that he felt slightly dizzy as if a chasm of silence had yawned at his feet When he raised his eyes the audience most perversely was exhibiting signs of animation and interest in their faces and the women in white muslin dresses were coming down in pairs from the platform into the body of Schomberg s concert hall They dispersed themselves all over the place The male creature with the hooked nose and purple black beard disappeared somewhere This was the interval during which as the astute Schomberg had stipulated the members of the orchestra were encouraged to favour the members of the audience with their company that is such members as seemed inclined to fraternize with the arts in a familiar and generous manner the symbol of familiarity and generosity consisting in offers of refreshment The procedure struck Heyst as highly incorrect However the impropriety of Schomberg s ingenious scheme was defeated by the circumstance that most of the women were no longer young and that none of them had ever been beautiful Their more or less worn cheeks were slightly rouged but apart from that fact which might have been simply a matter of routine they did not seem to take the success of the scheme unduly to heart The impulse to fraternize with the arts being obviously weak in the audience some of the musicians sat down listlessly at unoccupied tables while others went on perambulating the central passage arm in arm glad enough no doubt to stretch their legs while resting their arms Their crimson sashes gave a factitious touch of gaiety to the smoky atmosphere of the concert hall and Heyst felt a sudden pity for these beings exploited hopeless devoid of charm and grace whose fate of cheerless dependence invested their coarse and joyless features with a touch of pathos Heyst was temperamentally sympathetic To have them passing and repassing close to his little table was painful to him He was preparing to rise and go out when he noticed that two white muslin dresses and crimson sashes had not yet left the platform One of these dresses concealed the raw boned frame of the woman with the bad tempered curve to her nostrils She was no less a personage than missus Zangiacomo She had left the piano and with her back to the hall was preparing the parts for the second half of the concert with a brusque impatient action of her ugly elbow This task done she turned and perceiving the other white muslin dress motionless on a chair in the second row she strode towards it between the music stands with an aggressive and masterful gait On the lap of that dress there lay unclasped and idle a pair of small hands not very white attached to well formed arms The next detail Heyst was led to observe was the arrangement of the hair two thick brown tresses rolled round an attractively shaped head A girl by Jove he exclaimed mentally It was evident that she was a girl It was evident in the outline of the shoulders in the slender white bust springing up barred slantwise by the crimson sash from the bell shaped spread of muslin skirt hiding the chair on which she sat averted a little from the body of the hall Her feet in low white shoes were crossed prettily She had captured Heyst s awakened faculty of observation he had the sensation of a new experience That was because his faculty of observation had never before been captured by any feminine creature in that marked and exclusive fashion He looked at her anxiously as no man ever looks at another man and he positively forgot where he was He had lost touch with his surroundings The big woman advancing concealed the girl from his sight for a moment She bent over the seated youthful figure in passing it very close as if to drop a word into its ear Her lips did certainly move But what sort of word could it have been to make the girl jump up so swiftly Heyst at his table was surprised into a sympathetic start He glanced quickly round Nobody was looking towards the platform and when his eyes swept back there again the girl with the big woman treading at her heels was coming down the three steps from the platform to the floor of the hall There she paused stumbled one pace forward and stood still again while the other the escort the dragoon the coarse big woman of the piano passed her roughly and marching truculently down the centre aisle between the chairs and tables went out to rejoin the hook nosed Zangiacomo somewhere outside During her extraordinary transit as if everything in the hall were dirt under her feet her scornful eyes met the upward glance of Heyst who looked away at once towards the girl She had not moved Her arms hung down her eyelids were lowered Heyst laid down his half smoked cigar and compressed his lips Then he got up It was the same sort of impulse which years ago had made him cross the sandy street of the abominable town of Delli in the island of Timor and accost Morrison practically a stranger to him then a man in trouble expressively harassed dejected lonely It was the same impulse But he did not recognize it He was not thinking of Morrison then It may be said that for the first time since the final abandonment of the Samburan coal mine he had completely forgotten the late Morrison It is true that to a certain extent he had forgotten also where he was Thus unchecked by any sort of self consciousness Heyst walked up the central passage Several of the women by this time had found anchorage here and there among the occupied tables They talked to the men leaning on their elbows and suggesting funnily if it hadn t been for the crimson sashes in their white dresses an assembly of middle aged brides with free and easy manners and hoarse voices The murmuring noise of conversations carried on with some spirit filled Schomberg s concert room Nobody remarked Heyst s movements for indeed he was not the only man on his legs there He had been confronting the girl for some time before she became aware of his presence She was looking down very still without colour without glances without voice without movement It was only when Heyst addressed her in his courteous tone that she raised her eyes Excuse me he said in English but that horrible female has done something to you She has pinched you hasn t she I am sure she pinched you just now when she stood by your chair The girl received this overture with the wide motionless stare of profound astonishment Heyst vexed with himself suspected that she did not understand what he said One could not tell what nationality these women were except that they were of all sorts But she was astonished almost more by the near presence of the man himself by his largely bald head by the white brow the sunburnt cheeks the long horizontal moustaches of crinkly bronze hair by the kindly expression of the man s blue eyes looking into her own He saw the stony amazement in hers give way to a momentary alarm which was succeeded by an expression of resignation I am sure she pinched your arm most cruelly he murmured rather disconcerted now at what he had done It was a great comfort to hear her say It wouldn t have been the first time And suppose she did what are you going to do about it I don t know he said with a faint remote playfulness in his tone which had not been heard in it lately and which seemed to catch her ear pleasantly I am grieved to say that I don t know But can I do anything What would you wish me to do Pray command me Again the greatest astonishment became visible in her face for she now perceived how different he was from the other men in the room He was as different from them as she was different from the other members of the ladies orchestra Command you she breathed after a time in a bewildered tone Who are you she asked a little louder I am staying in this hotel for a few days I just dropped in casually here This outrage Don t you try to interfere she said so earnestly that Heyst asked in his faintly playful tone Is it your wish that I should leave you I haven t said that the girl answered She pinched me because I didn t get down here quick enough I can t tell you how indignant I am said Heyst But since you are down here now he went on with the ease of a man of the world speaking to a young lady in a drawing room hadn t we better sit down She obeyed his inviting gesture and they sat down on the nearest chairs They looked at each other across a little round table with a surprised open gaze self consciousness growing on them so slowly that it was a long time before they averted their eyes and very soon they met again temporarily only to rebound as it were At last they steadied in contact but by that time say some fifteen minutes from the moment when they sat down the interval came to an end So much for their eyes As to the conversation it had been perfectly insignificant because naturally they had nothing to say to each other Heyst had been interested by the girl s physiognomy Its expression was neither simple nor yet very clear It was not distinguished that could not be expected but the features had more fineness than those of any other feminine countenance he had ever had the opportunity to observe so closely There was in it something indefinably audacious and infinitely miserable because the temperament and the existence of that girl were reflected in it But her voice It seduced Heyst by its amazing quality It was a voice fit to utter the most exquisite things a voice which would have made silly chatter supportable and the roughest talk fascinating Heyst drank in its charm as one listens to the tone of some instrument without heeding the tune Do you sing as well as play he asked her abruptly Never sang a note in my life she said obviously surprised by the irrelevant question for they had not been discoursing of sweet sounds She was clearly unaware of her voice I don t remember that I ever had much reason to sing since I was little she added That inelegant phrase by the mere vibrating warm nobility of the sound found its way into Heyst s heart His mind cool alert watched it sink there with a sort of vague concern at the absurdity of the occupation till it rested at the bottom deep down where our unexpressed longings lie You are English of course he said What do you think she answered in the most charming accents Then as if thinking that it was her turn to place a question Why do you always smile when you speak It was enough to make anyone look grave but her good faith was so evident that Heyst recovered himself at once It s my unfortunate manner he said with his delicate polished playfulness Is is very objectionable to you She was very serious No I only noticed it I haven t come across so many pleasant people as all that in my life It s certain that this woman who plays the piano is infinitely more disagreeable than any cannibal I have ever had to do with I believe you She shuddered How did you come to have anything to do with cannibals It would be too long a tale said Heyst with a faint smile Heyst s smiles were rather melancholy and accorded badly with his great moustaches under which his mere playfulness lurked as comfortable as a shy bird in its native thicket Much too long How did you get amongst this lot here Bad luck she answered briefly No doubt no doubt Heyst assented with slight nods Then still indignant at the pinch which he had divined rather than actually seen inflicted I say couldn t you defend yourself somehow She had risen already The ladies of the orchestra were slowly regaining their places Some were already seated idle stony eyed before the music stands Heyst was standing up too They are too many for me she said These few words came out of the common experience of mankind yet by virtue of her voice they thrilled Heyst like a revelation His feelings were in a state of confusion but his mind was clear That s bad But it isn t actual ill usage that this girl is complaining of he thought lucidly after she left him CHAPTER TWO That was how it began How it was that it ended as we know it did end is not so easy to state precisely It is very clear that Heyst was not indifferent I won t say to the girl but to the girl s fate He was the same man who had plunged after the submerged Morrison whom he hardly knew otherwise than by sight and through the usual gossip of the islands But this was another sort of plunge altogether and likely to lead to a very different kind of partnership Did he reflect at all Probably He was sufficiently reflective But if he did it was with insufficient knowledge For there is no evidence that he paused at any time between the date of that evening and the morning of the flight Truth to say Heyst was not one of those men who pause much Those dreamy spectators of the world s agitation are terrible once the desire to act gets hold of them They lower their heads and charge a wall with an amazing serenity which nothing but an indisciplined imagination can give He was not a fool I suppose he knew or at least he felt where this was leading him But his complete inexperience gave him the necessary audacity The girl s voice was charming when she spoke to him of her miserable past in simple terms with a sort of unconscious cynicism inherent in the truth of the ugly conditions of poverty And whether because he was humane or because her voice included all the modulations of pathos cheerfulness and courage in its compass it was not disgust that the tale awakened in him but the sense of an immense sadness On a later evening during the interval between the two parts of the concert the girl told Heyst about herself She was almost a child of the streets Her father was a musician in the orchestras of small theatres Her mother ran away from him while she was little and the landladies of various poor lodging houses had attended casually to her abandoned childhood It was never positive starvation and absolute rags but it was the hopeless grip of poverty all the time It was her father who taught her to play the violin It seemed that he used to get drunk sometimes but without pleasure and only because he was unable to forget his fugitive wife After he had a paralytic stroke falling over with a crash in the well of a music hall orchestra during the performance she had joined the Zangiacomo company He was now in a home for incurables And I am here she finished with no one to care if I make a hole in the water the next chance I get or not Heyst told her that he thought she could do a little better than that if it was only a question of getting out of the world She looked at him with special attention and with a puzzled expression which gave to her face an air of innocence This was during one of the intervals between the two parts of the concert She had come down that time without being incited thereto by a pinch from the awful Zangiacomo woman It is difficult to suppose that she was seduced by the uncovered intellectual forehead and the long reddish moustaches of her new friend New is not the right word She had never had a friend before and the sensation of this friendliness going out to her was exciting by its novelty alone Besides any man who did not resemble Schomberg appeared for that very reason attractive She was afraid of the hotel keeper who in the daytime taking advantage of the fact that she lived in the hotel itself and not in the Pavilion with the other artists prowled round her mute hungry portentous behind his great beard or else assailed her in quiet corners and empty passages with deep mysterious murmurs from behind which not withstanding their clear import sounded horribly insane somehow The contrast of Heyst s quiet polished manner gave her special delight and filled her with admiration She had never seen anything like that before If she had perhaps known kindness in her life she had never met the forms of simple courtesy She was interested by it as a very novel experience not very intelligible but distinctly pleasurable I tell you they are too many for me she repeated sometimes recklessly but more often shaking her head with ominous dejection She had of course no money at all The quantities of black men all about frightened her She really had no definite idea where she was on the surface of the globe The orchestra was generally taken from the steamer to some hotel and kept shut up there till it was time to go on board another steamer She could not remember the names she heard How do you call this place again she used to ask Heyst Sourabaya he would say distinctly and would watch the discouragement at the outlandish sound coming into her eyes which were fastened on his face He could not defend himself from compassion He suggested that she might go to the consul but it was his conscience that dictated this advice not his conviction She had never heard of the animal or of its uses A consul What was it Who was he What could he do And when she learned that perhaps he could be induced to send her home her head dropped on her breast What am I to do when I get there she murmured with an intonation so just with an accent so penetrating the charm of her voice did not fail her even in whispering that Heyst seemed to see the illusion of human fellowship on earth vanish before the naked truth of her existence and leave them both face to face in a moral desert as arid as the sands of Sahara without restful shade without refreshing water She leaned slightly over the little table the same little table at which they had sat when they first met each other and with no other memories but of the stones in the streets her childhood had known in the distress of the incoherent confused rudimentary impressions of her travels inspiring her with a vague terror of the world she said rapidly as one speaks in desperation You do something You are a gentleman It wasn t I who spoke to you first was it I didn t begin did I It was you who came along and spoke to me when I was standing over there What did you want to speak to me for I don t care what it is but you must do something Her attitude was fierce and entreating at the same time clamorous in fact though her voice had hardly risen above a breath It was clamorous enough to be noticed Heyst on purpose laughed aloud She nearly choked with indignation at this brutal heartlessness What did you mean then by saying command me she almost hissed Something hard in his mirthless stare and a quiet final All right steadied her I am not rich enough to buy you out he went on speaking with an extraordinary detached grin even if it were to be done but I can always steal you She looked at him profoundly as though these words had a hidden and very complicated meaning Get away now he said rapidly and try to smile as you go She obeyed with unexpected readiness and as she had a set of very good white teeth the effect of the mechanical ordered smile was joyous radiant It astonished Heyst No wonder it flashed through his mind women can deceive men so completely The faculty was inherent in them they seemed to be created with a special aptitude Here was a smile the origin of which was well known to him and yet it had conveyed a sensation of warmth had given him a sort of ardour to live which was very new to his experience By this time she was gone from the table and had joined the other ladies of the orchestra They trooped towards the platform driven in truculently by the haughty mate of Zangiacomo who looked as though she were restraining herself with difficulty from punching their backs Zangiacomo followed with his great pendulous dyed beard and short mess jacket with an aspect of hang dog concentration imparted by his drooping head and the uneasiness of his eyes which were set very close together He climbed the steps last of all turned about displaying his purple beard to the hall and tapped with his bow Heyst winced in anticipation of the horrible racket It burst out immediately unabashed and awful At the end of the platform the woman at the piano presenting her cruel profile her head tilted back banged the keys without looking at the music Heyst could not stand the uproar for more than a minute He went out his brain racked by the rhythm of some more or less Hungarian dance music The forests inhabited by the New Guinea cannibals where he had encountered the most exciting of his earlier futile adventures were silent And this adventure not in its execution perhaps but in its nature required even more nerve than anything he had faced before Walking among the paper lanterns suspended to trees he remembered with regret the gloom and the dead stillness of the forests at the back of Geelvink Bay perhaps the wildest the unsafest the most deadly spot on earth from which the sea can be seen Oppressed by his thoughts he sought the obscurity and peace of his bedroom but they were not complete The distant sounds of the concert reached his ear faint indeed but still disturbing Neither did he feel very safe in there for that sentiment depends not on extraneous circumstances but on our inward conviction He did not attempt to go to sleep he did not even unbutton the top button of his tunic He sat in a chair and mused Formerly in solitude and in silence he had been used to think clearly and sometimes even profoundly seeing life outside the flattering optical delusion of everlasting hope of conventional self deceptions of an ever expected happiness But now he was troubled a light veil seemed to hang before his mental vision the awakening of a tenderness indistinct and confused as yet towards an unknown woman Gradually silence a real silence had established itself round him The concert was over the audience had gone the concert hall was dark and even the Pavilion where the ladies orchestra slept after its noisy labours showed not a gleam of light Heyst suddenly felt restless in all his limbs as this reaction from the long immobility would not be denied he humoured it by passing quietly along the back veranda and out into the grounds at the side of the house into the black shadows under the trees where the extinguished paper lanterns were gently swinging their globes like withered fruit He paced there to and fro for a long time a calm meditative ghost in his white drill suit revolving in his head thoughts absolutely novel disquieting and seductive accustoming his mind to the contemplation of his purpose in order that by being faced steadily it should appear praiseworthy and wise For the use of reason is to justify the obscure desires that move our conduct impulses passions prejudices and follies and also our fears He felt that he had engaged himself by a rash promise to an action big with incalculable consequences And then he asked himself if the girl had understood what he meant Who could tell He was assailed by all sorts of doubts Raising his head he perceived something white flitting between the trees It vanished almost at once but there could be no mistake He was vexed at being detected roaming like this in the middle of the night Who could that be It never occurred to him that perhaps the girl too would not be able to sleep He advanced prudently Then he saw the white phantom like apparition again and the next moment all his doubts as to the state of her mind were laid at rest because he felt her clinging to him after the manner of supplicants all the world over Her whispers were so incoherent that he could not understand anything but this did not prevent him from being profoundly moved He had no illusions about her but his sceptical mind was dominated by the fulness of his heart Calm yourself calm yourself he murmured in her ear returning her clasp at first mechanically and afterwards with a growing appreciation of her distressed humanity The heaving of her breast and the trembling of all her limbs in the closeness of his embrace seemed to enter his body to infect his very heart While she was growing quieter in his arms he was becoming more agitated as if there were only a fixed quantity of violent emotion on this earth The very night seemed more dumb more still and the immobility of the vague black shapes surrounding him more perfect It will be all right he tried to reassure her with a tone of conviction speaking into her ear and of necessity clasping her more closely than before Either the words or the action had a very good effect He heard a light sigh of relief She spoke with a calmed ardour Oh I knew it would be all right from the first time you spoke to me Yes indeed I knew directly you came up to me that evening I knew it would be all right if you only cared to make it so but of course I could not tell if you meant it Command me you said Funny thing for a man like you to say Did you really mean it You weren t making fun of me He protested that he had been a serious person all his life I believe you she said ardently He was touched by this declaration It s the way you have of speaking as if you were amused with people she went on But I wasn t deceived I could see you were angry with that beast of a woman And you are clever You spotted something at once You saw it in my face eh It isn t a bad face say You ll never be sorry Listen I m not twenty yet It s the truth and I can t be so bad looking or else I will tell you straight that I have been worried and pestered by fellows like this before I don t know what comes to them She was speaking hurriedly She choked and then exclaimed with an accent of despair What is it What s the matter Heyst had removed his arms from her suddenly and had recoiled a little Is it my fault I didn t even look at them I tell you straight Never Have I looked at you Tell me It was you that began it In truth Heyst had shrunk from the idea of competition with fellows unknown with Schomberg the hotel keeper The vaporous white figure before him swayed pitifully in the darkness He felt ashamed of his fastidiousness I am afraid we have been detected he murmured I think I saw somebody on the path between the house and the bushes behind you He had seen no one It was a compassionate lie if there ever was one His compassion was as genuine as his shrinking had been and in his judgement more honourable She didn t turn her head She was obviously relieved Would it be that brute she breathed out meaning Schomberg of course He s getting too forward with me now What can you expect Only this evening after supper he but I slipped away You don t mind him do you Why I could face him myself now that I know you care for me A girl can always put up a fight You believe me Only it isn t easy to stand up for yourself when you feel there s nothing and nobody at your back There s nothing so lonely in the world as a girl who has got to look after herself When I left poor dad in that home it was in the country near a village I came out of the gates with seven shillings and threepence in my old purse and my railway ticket I tramped a mile and got into a train She broke off and was silent for a moment Don t you throw me over now she went on If you did what should I do I should have to live to be sure because I d be afraid to kill myself but you would have done a thousand times worse than killing a body You told me you had been always alone you had never had a dog even Well then I won t be in anybody s way if I live with you not even a dog s And what else did you mean when you came up and looked at me so close Close Did I he murmured unstirring before her in the profound darkness So close as that She had an outbreak of anger and despair in subdued tones Have you forgotten then What did you expect to find I know what sort of girl I am but all the same I am not the sort that men turn their backs on and you ought to know it unless you aren t made like the others Oh forgive me You aren t like the others you are like no one in the world I ever spoke to Don t you care for me Don t you see What he saw was that white and spectral she was putting out her arms to him out of the black shadows like an appealing ghost He took her hands and was affected almost surprised to find them so warm so real so firm so living in his grasp He drew her to him and she dropped her head on his shoulder with a deep sigh I am dead tired she whispered plaintively He put his arms around her and only by the convulsive movements of her body became aware that she was sobbing without a sound Sustaining her he lost himself in the profound silence of the night After a while she became still and cried quietly Then suddenly as if waking up she asked You haven t seen any more of that somebody you thought was spying about He started at her quick sharp whisper and answered that very likely he had been mistaken If it was anybody at all she reflected aloud it wouldn t have been anyone but that hotel woman the landlord s wife missus Schomberg Heyst said surprised Yes Another one that can t sleep o nights Why Don t you see why Because of course she sees what s going on That beast doesn t even try to keep it from her If she had only the least bit of spirit She knows how I feel too only she s too frightened even to look him in the face let alone open her mouth He would tell her to go hang herself For some time Heyst said nothing A public active contest with the hotel keeper was not to be thought of The idea was horrible Whispering gently to the girl he tried to explain to her that as things stood an open withdrawal from the company would be probably opposed She listened to his explanation anxiously from time to time pressing the hand she had sought and got hold of in the dark As I told you I am not rich enough to buy you out so I shall steal you as soon as I can arrange some means of getting away from here Meantime it would be fatal to be seen together at night We mustn t give ourselves away We had better part at once I think I was mistaken just now but if as you say that poor missus Schomberg can t sleep of nights we must be more careful She would tell the fellow The girl had disengaged herself from his loose hold while he talked and now stood free of him but still clasping his hand firmly Oh no she said with perfect assurance I tell you she daren t open her mouth to him And she isn t as silly as she looks She wouldn t give us away She knows a trick worth two of that She ll help that s what she ll do if she dares do anything at all You seem to have a very clear view of the situation said Heyst and received a warm lingering kiss for this commendation He discovered that to part from her was not such an easy matter as he had supposed it would be Upon my word he said before they separated I don t even know your name Don t you They call me Alma I don t know why Silly name Magdalen too It doesn t matter you can call me by whatever name you choose Yes you give me a name Think of one you would like the sound of something quite new How I should like to forget everything that has gone before as one forgets a dream that s done with fright and all I would try Would you really he asked in a murmur But that s not forbidden I understand that women easily forget whatever in their past diminishes them in their eyes It s your eyes that I was thinking of for I m sure I ve never wished to forget anything till you came up to me that night and looked me through and through I know I m not much account but I know how to stand by a man I stood by father ever since I could understand He wasn t a bad chap Now that I can t be of any use to him I would just as soon forget all that and make a fresh start But these aren t things that I could talk to you about What could I ever talk to you about Don t let it trouble you Heyst said Your voice is enough I am in love with it whatever it says She remained silent for a while as if rendered breathless by this quiet statement Oh I wanted to ask you He remembered that she probably did not know his name and expected the question to be put to him now but after a moment of hesitation she went on Why was it that you told me to smile this evening in the concert room there you remember I thought we were being observed A smile is the best of masks Schomberg was at a table next but one to us drinking with some Dutch clerks from the town No doubt he was watching us watching you at least That s why I asked you to smile Ah that s why It never came into my head And you did it very well too very readily as if you had understood my intention Readily she repeated Oh I was ready enough to smile then That s the truth It was the first time for years I may say that I felt disposed to smile I ve not had many chances to smile in my life I can tell you especially of late But you do it most charmingly in a perfectly fascinating way He paused She stood still waiting for more with the stillness of extreme delight wishing to prolong the sensation It astonished me he added It went as straight to my heart as though you had smiled for the purpose of dazzling me I felt as if I had never seen a smile before in my life I thought of it after I left you It made me restless It did all that came her voice unsteady gentle and incredulous If you had not smiled as you did perhaps I should not have come out here tonight he said with his playful earnestness of tone It was your triumph He felt her lips touch his lightly and the next moment she was gone Her white dress gleamed in the distance and then the opaque darkness of the house seemed to swallow it Heyst waited a little before he went the same way round the corner up the steps of the veranda and into his room where he lay down at last not to sleep but to go over in his mind all that had been said at their meeting It s exactly true about that smile he thought There he had spoken the truth to her and about her voice too For the rest what must be must be A great wave of heat passed over him He turned on his back flung his arms crosswise on the broad hard bed and lay still open eyed under the mosquito net till daylight entered his room brightened swiftly and turned to unfailing sunlight He got up then went to a small looking glass hanging on the wall and stared at himself steadily It was not a new born vanity which induced this long survey He felt so strange that he could not resist the suspicion of his personal appearance having changed during the night What he saw in the glass however was the man he knew before It was almost a disappointment a belittling of his recent experience And then he smiled at his naiveness for being over five and thirty years of age he ought to have known that in most cases the body is the unalterable mask of the soul which even death itself changes but little till it is put out of sight where no changes matter any more either to our friends or to our enemies Heyst was not conscious of either friends or of enemies It was the very essence of his life to be a solitary achievement accomplished not by hermit like withdrawal with its silence and immobility but by a system of restless wandering by the detachment of an impermanent dweller amongst changing scenes In this scheme he had perceived the means of passing through life without suffering and almost without a single care in the world invulnerable because elusive CHAPTER THREE For fifteen years Heyst had wandered invariably courteous and unapproachable and in return was generally considered a queer chap He had started off on these travels of his after the death of his father an expatriated Swede who died in London dissatisfied with his country and angry with all the world which had instinctively rejected his wisdom Thinker stylist and man of the world in his time the elder Heyst had begun by coveting all the joys those of the great and those of the humble those of the fools and those of the sages For more than sixty years he had dragged on this painful earth of ours the most weary the most uneasy soul that civilization had ever fashioned to its ends of disillusion and regret One could not refuse him a measure of greatness for he was unhappy in a way unknown to mediocre souls His mother Heyst had never known but he kept his father s pale distinguished face in affectionate memory He remembered him mainly in an ample blue dressing gown in a large house of a quiet London suburb For three years after leaving school at the age of eighteen he had lived with the elder Heyst who was then writing his last book In this work at the end of his life he claimed for mankind that right to absolute moral and intellectual liberty of which he no longer believed them worthy Three years of such companionship at that plastic and impressionable age were bound to leave in the boy a profound mistrust of life The young man learned to reflect which is a destructive process a reckoning of the cost It is not the clear sighted who lead the world Great achievements are accomplished in a blessed warm mental fog which the pitiless cold blasts of the father s analysis had blown away from the son I ll drift Heyst had said to himself deliberately He did not mean intellectually or sentimentally or morally He meant to drift altogether and literally body and soul like a detached leaf drifting in the wind currents under the immovable trees of a forest glade to drift without ever catching on to anything This shall be my defence against life he had said to himself with a sort of inward consciousness that for the son of his father there was no other worthy alternative He became a waif and stray austerely from conviction as others do through drink from vice from some weakness of character with deliberation as others do in despair This stripped of its facts had been Heyst s life up to that disturbing night Next day when he saw the girl called Alma she managed to give him a glance of frank tenderness quick as lightning and leaving a profound impression a secret touch on the heart It was in the grounds of the hotel about tiffin time while the Ladies of the orchestra were strolling back to their pavilion after rehearsal or practice or whatever they called their morning musical exercises in the hall Heyst returning from the town where he had discovered that there would be difficulties in the way of getting away at once was crossing the compound disappointed and worried He had walked almost unwittingly into the straggling group of Zangiacomo s performers It was a shock to him on coming out of his brown study to find the girl so near to him as if one waking suddenly should see the figure of his dream turned into flesh and blood She did not raise her shapely head but her glance was no dream thing It was real the most real impression of his detached existence so far Heyst had not acknowledged it in any way though it seemed to him impossible that its effect on him should not be visible to anyone who happened to be looking on And there were several men on the veranda steady customers of Schomberg s table d hote gazing in his direction at the ladies of the orchestra in fact Heyst s dread arose not out of shame or timidity but from his fastidiousness On getting amongst them however he noticed no signs of interest or astonishment in their faces any more than if they had been blind men Even Schomberg himself who had to make way for him at the top of the stairs was completely unperturbed and continued the conversation he was carrying on with a client Schomberg indeed had observed that Swede talking with the girl in the intervals A crony of his had nudged him and he had thought that it was so much the better the silly fellow would keep everybody else off He was rather pleased than otherwise and watched them out of the corner of his eye with a malicious enjoyment of the situation a sort of Satanic glee For he had little doubt of his personal fascination and still less of his power to get hold of the girl who seemed too ignorant to know how to help herself and who was worse than friendless since she had for some reason incurred the animosity of missus Zangiacomo a woman with no conscience The aversion she showed him as far as she dared for it is not always safe for the helpless to display the delicacy of their sentiments Schomberg pardoned on the score of feminine conventional silliness He had told Alma as an argument that she was a clever enough girl to see that she could do no better than to put her trust in a man of substance in the prime of life who knew his way about But for the excited trembling of his voice and the extraordinary way in which his eyes seemed to be starting out of his crimson hirsute countenance such speeches had every character of calm unselfish advice which after the manner of lovers passed easily into sanguine plans for the future We ll soon get rid of the old woman he whispered to her hurriedly with panting ferocity Hang her I ve never cared for her The climate don t suit her I shall tell her to go to her people in Europe She will have to go too I will see to it Eins zwei march And then we shall sell this hotel and start another somewhere else He assured her that he didn t care what he did for her sake and it was true Forty five is the age of recklessness for many men as if in defiance of the decay and death waiting with open arms in the sinister valley at the bottom of the inevitable hill Her shrinking form her downcast eyes when she had to listen to him cornered at the end of an empty corridor he regarded as signs of submission to the overpowering force of his will the recognition of his personal fascinations For every age is fed on illusions lest men should renounce life early and the human race come to an end It s easy to imagine Schomberg s humiliation his shocked fury when he discovered that the girl who had for weeks resisted his attacks his prayers and his fiercest protestations had been snatched from under his nose by that Swede apparently without any trouble worth speaking of He refused to believe the fact He would have it at first that the Zangiacomos for some unfathomable reason had played him a scurvy trick but when no further doubt was possible he changed his view of Heyst The despised Swede became for Schomberg the deepest the most dangerous the most hateful of scoundrels He could not believe that the creature he had coveted with so much force and with so little effect was in reality tender docile to her impulse and had almost offered herself to Heyst without a sense of guilt in a desire of safety and from a profound need of placing her trust where her woman s instinct guided her ignorance Nothing would serve Schomberg but that she must have been circumvented by some occult exercise of force or craft by the laying of some subtle trap His wounded vanity wondered ceaselessly at the means that Swede had employed to seduce her away from a man like him Schomberg as though those means were bound to have been extraordinary unheard of inconceivable He slapped his forehead openly before his customers he would sit brooding in silence or else would burst out unexpectedly declaiming against Heyst without measure discretion or prudence with swollen features and an affectation of outraged virtue which could not have deceived the most childlike of moralists for a moment and greatly amused his audience It became a recognized entertainment to go and hear his abuse of Heyst while sipping iced drinks on the veranda of the hotel It was in a manner a more successful draw than the Zangiacomo concerts had ever been intervals and all There was never any difficulty in starting the performer off Anybody could do it by almost any distant allusion As likely as not he would start his endless denunciations in the very billiard room where missus Schomberg sat enthroned as usual swallowing her sobs concealing her tortures of abject humiliation and terror under her stupid set everlasting grin which having been provided for her by nature was an excellent mask in as much as nothing not even death itself perhaps could tear it away But nothing lasts in this world at least without changing its physiognomy So after a few weeks Schomberg regained his outward calm as if his indignation had dried up within him And it was time He was becoming a bore with his inability to talk of anything else but Heyst s unfitness to be at large Heyst s wickedness his wiles his astuteness and his criminality Schomberg no longer pretended to despise him He could not have done it After what had happened he could not pretend even to himself But his bottled up indignation was fermenting venomously At the time of his immoderate loquacity one of his customers an elderly man had remarked one evening If that ass keeps on like this he will end by going crazy And this belief was less than half wrong Schomberg had Heyst on the brain Even the unsatisfactory state of his affairs which had never been so unpromising since he came out East directly after the Franco Prussian War he referred to some subtly noxious influence of Heyst It seemed to him that he could never be himself again till he had got even with that artful Swede He was ready to swear that Heyst had ruined his life The girl so unfairly craftily basely decoyed away would have inspired him to success in a new start Obviously missus Schomberg whom he terrified by savagely silent moods combined with underhand poisoned glances could give him no inspiration He had grown generally neglectful but with a partiality for reckless expedients as if he did not care when and how his career as a hotel keeper was to be brought to an end This demoralized state accounted for what Davidson had observed on his last visit to the Schomberg establishment some two months after Heyst s secret departure with the girl to the solitude of Samburan The Schomberg of a few years ago the Schomberg of the Bangkok days for instance when he started the first of his famed table d hote dinners would never have risked anything of the sort His genius ran to catering white man for white men and to the inventing elaborating and retailing of scandalous gossip with asinine unction and impudent delight But now his mind was perverted by the pangs of wounded vanity and of thwarted passion In this state of moral weakness Schomberg allowed himself to be corrupted CHAPTER FOUR The business was done by a guest who arrived one fine morning by mail boat immediately from Celebes having boarded her in Macassar but generally Schomberg understood from up China Sea way a wanderer clearly even as Heyst was but not alone and of quite another kind Schomberg looking up from the stern sheets of his steam launch which he used for boarding passenger ships on arrival discovered a dark sunken stare plunging down on him over the rail of the first class part of the deck He was no great judge of physiognomy Human beings for him were either the objects of scandalous gossip or else recipients of narrow strips of paper with proper bill heads stating the name of his hotel W Schomberg proprietor accounts settled weekly So in the clean shaven extremely thin face hanging over the mail boat s rail Schomberg saw only the face of a possible account The steam launches of other hotels were also alongside but he obtained the preference You are mister Schomberg aren t you the face asked quite unexpectedly I am at your service he answered from below for business is business and its forms and formulas must be observed even if one s manly bosom is tortured by that dull rage which succeeds the fury of baffled passion like the glow of embers after a fierce blaze Presently the possessor of the handsome but emaciated face was seated beside Schomberg in the stern sheets of the launch His body was long and loose jointed his slender fingers intertwined clasped the leg resting on the knee as he lolled back in a careless yet tense attitude On the other side of Schomberg sat another passenger who was introduced by the clean shaven man as My secretary He must have the room next to mine We can manage that easily for you Schomberg steered with dignity staring straight ahead but very much interested by these two promising accounts Their belongings a couple of large leather trunks browned by age and a few smaller packages were piled up in the bows A third individual a nondescript hairy creature had modestly made his way forward and had perched himself on the luggage The lower part of his physiognomy was over developed his narrow and low forehead unintelligently furrowed by horizontal wrinkles surmounted wildly hirsute cheeks and a flat nose with wide baboon like nostrils There was something equivocal in the appearance of his shaggy hair smothered humanity He too seemed to be a follower of the clean shaven man and apparently had travelled on deck with native passengers sleeping under the awnings His broad squat frame denoted great strength Grasping the gunwales of the launch he displayed a pair of remarkably long arms terminating in thick brown hairy paws of simian aspect What shall we do with the fellow of mine the chief of the party asked Schomberg There must be a boarding house somewhere near the port some grog shop where they could let him have a mat to sleep on Schomberg said there was a place kept by a Portuguese half caste A servant of yours he asked Well he hangs on to me He is an alligator hunter I picked him up in Colombia you know Ever been in Colombia No said Schomberg very much surprised An alligator hunter Funny trade Are you coming from Colombia then Yes but I have been coming for a long time I come from a good many places I am travelling west you see For sport perhaps suggested Schomberg Yes Sort of sport What do you say to chasing the sun I see a gentleman at large said Schomberg watching a sailing canoe about to cross his bow and ready to clear it by a touch of the helm The other passenger made himself heard suddenly Hang these native craft They always get in the way He was a muscular short man with eyes that gleamed and blinked a harsh voice and a round toneless pock marked face ornamented by a thin dishevelled moustache sticking out quaintly under the tip of a rigid nose Schomberg made the reflection that there was nothing secretarial about him Both he and his long lank principal wore the usual white suit of the tropics cork helmets pipe clayed white shoes all correct The hairy nondescript creature perched on their luggage in the bow had a check shirt and blue dungaree trousers He gazed in their direction from forward in an expectant trained animal manner You spoke to me first said Schomberg in his manly tones You were acquainted with my name Where did you hear of me gentlemen may I ask In Manila answered the gentleman at large readily From a man with whom I had a game of cards one evening in the Hotel Castille What man I ve no friends in Manila that I know of wondered Schomberg with a severe frown I can t tell you his name I ve clean forgotten it but don t you worry He was anything but a friend of yours He called you all the names he could think of He said you set a lot of scandal going about him once somewhere in Bangkok I think Yes that s it You were running a table d hote in Bangkok at one time weren t you Schomberg astounded by the turn of the information could only throw out his chest more and exaggerate his austere Lieutenant of the Reserve manner A table d hote Yes certainly He always for the sake of white men And here in this place too Yes in this place too That s all right then The stranger turned his black cavernous mesmerizing glance away from the bearded Schomberg who sat gripping the brass tiller in a sweating palm Many people in the evening at your place Schomberg had recovered somewhat Twenty covers or so take one day with another he answered feelingly as befitted a subject on which he was sensitive Ought to be more if only people would see that it s for their own good Precious little profit I get out of it You are partial to tables d hote gentlemen The new guest made answer that he liked a hotel where one could find some local people in the evening It was infernally dull otherwise The secretary in sign of approval emitted a grunt of astonishing ferocity as if proposing to himself to eat the local people All this sounded like a longish stay thought Schomberg satisfied under his grave air till remembering the girl snatched away from him by the last guest who had made a prolonged stay in his hotel he ground his teeth so audibly that the other two looked at him in wonder The momentary convulsion of his florid physiognomy seemed to strike them dumb They exchanged a quick glance Presently the clean shaven man fired out another question in his curt unceremonious manner You have no women in your hotel eh Women Schomberg exclaimed indignantly but also as if a little frightened What on earth do you mean by women What women There s missus Schomberg of course he added suddenly appeased with lofty indifference If she knows how to keep her place then it will do I can t stand women near me They give me the horrors declared the other They are a perfect curse During this outburst the secretary wore a savage grin The chief guest closed his sunken eyes as if exhausted and leaned the back of his head against the stanchion of the awning In this pose his long feminine eyelashes were very noticeable and his regular features sharp line of the jaw and well cut chin were brought into prominence giving him a used up weary depraved distinction He did not open his eyes till the steam launch touched the quay Then he and the other man got ashore quickly entered a carriage and drove away to the hotel leaving Schomberg to look after their luggage and take care of their strange companion The latter looking more like a performing bear abandoned by his show men than a human being followed all Schomberg s movements step by step close behind his back muttering to himself in a language that sounded like some sort of uncouth Spanish The hotel keeper felt uncomfortable till at last he got rid of him at an obscure den where a very clean portly Portuguese half caste standing serenely in the doorway seemed to understand exactly how to deal with clients of every kind He took from the creature the strapped bundle it had been hugging closely through all its peregrinations in that strange town and cut short Schomberg s attempts at explanation by a most confident I comprehend very well sir It s more than I do thought Schomberg going away thankful at being relieved of the alligator hunter s company He wondered what these fellows were without being able to form a guess of sufficient probability Their names he learned that very day by direct inquiry to enter in my books he explained in his formal military manner chest thrown out beard very much in evidence The shaven man sprawling in a long chair with his air of withered youth raised his eyes languidly My name Oh plain mister Jones put that down a gentleman at large And this is Ricardo The pock marked man lying prostrate in another long chair made a grimace as if something had tickled the end of his nose but did not come out of his supineness Martin Ricardo secretary You don t want any more of our history do you Eh what Occupation Put down well tourists We ve been called harder names before now it won t hurt our feelings And that fellow of mine where did you tuck him away Oh he will be all right When he wants anything he ll take it He s Peter Citizen of Colombia Peter Pedro I don t know that he ever had any other name Pedro alligator hunter Oh yes I ll pay his board with the half caste Can t help myself He s so confoundedly devoted to me that if I were to give him the sack he would fly at my throat Shall I tell you how I killed his brother in the wilds of Colombia Well perhaps some other time it s a rather long story What I shall always regret is that I didn t kill him too I could have done it without any extra trouble then now it s too late Great nuisance but he s useful sometimes I hope you are not going to put all this in your book The offhand hard manner and the contemptuous tone of plain mister Jones disconcerted Schomberg utterly He had never been spoken to like this in his life He shook his head in silence and withdrew not exactly scared though he was in reality of a timid disposition under his manly exterior but distinctly mystified and impressed CHAPTER FIVE Three weeks later after putting his cash box away in the safe which filled with its iron bulk a corner of their room Schomberg turned towards his wife but without looking at her exactly and said I must get rid of these two It won t do missus Schomberg had entertained that very opinion from the first but she had been broken years ago into keeping her opinions to herself Sitting in her night attire in the light of a single candle she was careful not to make a sound knowing from experience that her very assent would be resented With her eyes she followed the figure of Schomberg clad in his sleeping suit and moving restlessly about the room He never glanced her way for the reason that missus Schomberg in her night attire looked the most unattractive object in existence miserable insignificant faded crushed old And the contrast with the feminine form he had ever in his mind s eye made his wife s appearance painful to his aesthetic sense Schomberg walked about swearing and fuming for the purpose of screwing his courage up to the sticking point Hang me if I ought not to go now at once this minute into his bedroom and tell him to be off him and that secretary of his early in the morning I don t mind a round game of cards but to make a decoy of my table d hote my blood boils He came here because some lying rascal in Manila told him I kept a table d hote He said these things not for missus Schomberg s information but simply thinking aloud and trying to work his fury up to a point where it would give him courage enough to face plain mister Jones Impudent overbearing swindling sharper he went on I have a good mind to He was beside himself in his lurid heavy Teutonic manner so unlike the picturesque lively rage of the Latin races and though his eyes strayed about irresolutely yet his swollen angry features awakened in the miserable woman over whom he had been tyrannizing for years a fear for his precious carcass since the poor creature had nothing else but that to hold on to in the world She knew him well but she did not know him altogether The last thing a woman will consent to discover in a man whom she loves or on whom she simply depends is want of courage And timid in her corner she ventured to say pressingly Be careful Wilhelm Remember the knives and revolvers in their trunks In guise of thanks for that anxious reminder he swore horribly in the direction of her shrinking person In her scanty nightdress and barefooted she recalled a mediaeval penitent being reproved for her sins in blasphemous terms Those lethal weapons were always present to Schomberg s mind Personally he had never seen them His part ten days after his guests arrival had been to lounge in manly careless attitudes on the veranda keeping watch while missus Schomberg provided with a bunch of assorted keys her discoloured teeth chattering and her globular eyes absolutely idiotic with fright was going through the luggage of these strange clients Her terrible Wilhelm had insisted on it I ll be on the look out I tell you he said I shall give you a whistle when I see them coming back You couldn t whistle And if he were to catch you at it and chuck you out by the scruff of the neck it wouldn t hurt you much but he won t touch a woman Not he He has told me so Affected beast I must find out something about their little game and so there s an end of it Go in Go now Quick march It had been an awful job but she did go in because she was much more afraid of Schomberg than of any possible consequences of the act Her greatest concern was lest no key of the bunch he had provided her with should fit the locks It would have been such a disappointment for Wilhelm However the trunks she found had been left open but her investigation did not last long She was frightened of firearms and generally of all weapons not from personal cowardice but as some women are almost superstitiously from an abstract horror of violence and murder She was out again on the veranda long before Wilhelm had any occasion for a warning whistle The instinctive motiveless fear being the most difficult to overcome nothing could induce her to return to her investigations neither threatening growls nor ferocious hisses nor yet a poke or two in the ribs Stupid female muttered the hotel keeper perturbed by the notion of that armoury in one of his bedrooms This was from no abstract sentiment with him it was constitutional Get out of my sight he snarled Go and dress yourself for the table d hote Left to himself Schomberg had meditated What the devil did this mean His thinking processes were sluggish and spasmodic but suddenly the truth came to him By heavens they are desperadoes he thought Just then he beheld plain mister Jones and his secretary with the ambiguous name of Ricardo entering the grounds of the hotel They had been down to the port on some business and now were returning mister Jones lank spare opening his long legs with angular regularity like a pair of compasses the other stepping out briskly by his side Conviction entered Schomberg s heart They were two desperadoes no doubt about it But as the funk which he experienced was merely a general sensation he managed to put on his most severe Officer of the Reserve manner long before they had closed with him Good morning gentlemen Being answered with derisive civility he became confirmed in his sudden conviction of their desperate character The way mister Jones turned his hollow eyes on one like an incurious spectre and the way the other when addressed suddenly retracted his lips and exhibited his teeth without looking round here was evidence enough to settle that point Desperadoes They passed through the billiard room inscrutably mysterious to the back of the house to join their violated trunks Tiffin bell will ring in five minutes gentlemen Schomberg called after them exaggerating the deep manliness of his tone He had managed to upset himself very much He expected to see them come back infuriated and begin to bully him with an odious lack of restraint Desperadoes However they didn t they had not noticed anything unusual about their trunks and Schomberg recovered his composure and said to himself that he must get rid of this deadly incubus as soon as practicable They couldn t possibly want to stay very long this was not the town the colony for desperate characters He shrank from action He dreaded any kind of disturbance fracas he called it in his hotel Such things were not good for business Of course sometimes one had to have a fracas but it had been a comparatively trifling task to seize the frail Zangiacomo whose bones were no larger than a chicken s round the ribs lift him up bodily dash him to the ground and fall on him It had been easy The wretched hook nosed creature lay without movement buried under its purple beard Suddenly remembering the occasion of that fracas Schomberg groaned with the pain as of a hot coal under his breastbone and gave himself up to desolation Ah if he only had that girl with him he would have been masterful and resolute and fearless fight twenty desperadoes care for nobody on earth Whereas the possession of missus Schomberg was no incitement to a display of manly virtues Instead of caring for no one he felt that he cared for nothing Life was a hollow sham he wasn t going to risk a shot through his lungs or his liver in order to preserve its integrity It had no savour damn it In his state of moral decomposition Schomberg master as he was of the art of hotel keeping and careful of giving no occasion for criticism to the powers regulating that branch of human activity let things take their course though he saw very well where that course was tending It began first with a game or two after dinner for the drinks apparently with some lingering customer at one of the little tables ranged against the walls of the billiard room Schomberg detected the meaning of it at once That s what it was This was what they were And moving about restlessly at that time his morose silent period had set in he cast sidelong looks at the game but he said nothing It was not worth while having a row with men who were so overbearing Even when money appeared in connection with these postprandial games into which more and more people were being drawn he still refrained from raising the question he was reluctant to draw unduly the attention of plain mister Jones and of the equivocal Ricardo to his person One evening however after the public rooms of the hotel had become empty Schomberg made an attempt to grapple with the problem in an indirect way In a distant corner the tired China boy dozed on his heels his back against the wall missus Schomberg had disappeared as usual between ten and eleven Schomberg walked about slowly in and out of the room and the veranda thoughtful waiting for his two guests to go to bed Then suddenly he approached them militarily his chest thrown out his voice curt and soldierly Hot night gentlemen mister Jones lolling back idly in a chair looked up Ricardo as idle but more upright made no sign Won t you have a drink with me before retiring went on Schomberg sitting down by the little table By all means said mister Jones lazily Ricardo showed his teeth in a strange quick grin Schomberg felt painfully how difficult it was to get in touch with these men both so quiet so deliberate so menacingly unceremonious He ordered the Chinaman to bring in the drinks His purpose was to discover how long these guests intended to stay Ricardo displayed no conversational vein but mister Jones appeared communicative enough His voice somehow matched his sunken eyes It was hollow without being in the least mournful it sounded distant uninterested as though he were speaking from the bottom of a well Schomberg learned that he would have the privilege of lodging and boarding these gentlemen for at least a month more He could not conceal his discomfiture at this piece of news What s the matter Don t you like to have people in your house asked plain mister Jones languidly I should have thought the owner of a hotel would be pleased He lifted his delicate and beautifully pencilled eyebrows Schomberg muttered something about the locality being dull and uninteresting to travellers nothing going on too quiet altogether but he only provoked the declaration that quiet had its charm sometimes and even dullness was welcome as a change We haven t had time to be dull for the last three years added plain mister Jones his eyes fixed darkly on Schomberg whom he further more invited to have another drink this time with him and not to worry himself about things he did not understand and especially not to be inhospitable which in a hotel keeper is highly unprofessional I don t understand grumbled Schomberg Oh yes I understand perfectly well I You are frightened interrupted mister Jones What is the matter I don t want any scandal in my place That s what s the matter Schomberg tried to face the situation bravely but that steady black stare affected him And when he glanced aside uncomfortably he met Ricardo s grin uncovering a lot of teeth though the man seemed absorbed in his thoughts all the time And moreover went on mister Jones in that distant tone of his you can t help yourself Here we are and here we stay Would you try to put us out I dare say you could do it but you couldn t do it without getting hurt very badly hurt We can promise him that can t we Martin The secretary retracted his lips and looked up sharply at Schomberg as if only too anxious to leap upon him with teeth and claws Schomberg managed to produce a deep laugh Ha Ha Ha mister Jones closed his eyes wearily as if the light hurt them and looked remarkably like a corpse for a moment This was bad enough but when he opened them again it was almost a worse trial for Schomberg s nerves The spectral intensity of that glance fixed on the hotel keeper and this was most frightful without any definite expression seemed to dissolve the last grain of resolution in his character You don t think by any chance that you have to do with ordinary people do you inquired mister Jones in his lifeless manner which seemed to imply some sort of menace from beyond the grave He s a gentleman testified Martin Ricardo with a sudden snap of the lips after which his moustaches stirred by themselves in an odd feline manner Oh I wasn t thinking of that said plain mister Jones while Schomberg dumb and planted heavily in his chair looked from one to the other leaning forward a little Of course I am that but Ricardo attaches too much importance to a social advantage What I mean for instance is that he quiet and inoffensive as you see him sitting here would think nothing of setting fire to this house of entertainment of yours It would blaze like a box of matches Think of that It wouldn t advance your affairs much would it whatever happened to us Come come gentlemen remonstrated Schomberg in a murmur This is very wild talk And you have been used to deal with tame people haven t you But we aren t tame We once kept a whole angry town at bay for two days and then we got away with our plunder It was in Venezuela Ask Martin here he can tell you Instinctively Schomberg looked at Ricardo who only passed the tip of his tongue over his lips with an uncanny sort of gusto but did not offer to begin Well perhaps it would be a rather long story mister Jones conceded after a short silence I have no desire to hear it I am sure said Schomberg This isn t Venezuela You wouldn t get away from here like that But all this is silly talk of the worst sort Do you mean to say you would make deadly trouble for the sake of a few guilders that you and that other eyeing Ricardo suspiciously as one would look at a strange animal gentleman can win of an evening Isn t as if my customers were a lot of rich men with pockets full of cash I wonder you take so much trouble and risk for so little money Schomberg s argument was met by mister Jones s statement that one must do something to kill time Killing time was not forbidden For the rest being in a communicative mood mister Jones said languidly and in a voice indifferent as if issuing from a tomb that he depended on himself as if the world were still one great wild jungle without law Martin was something like that too for reasons of his own All these statements Ricardo confirmed by short inhuman grins Schomberg lowered his eyes for the sight of these two men intimidated him but he was losing patience Of course I could see at once that you were two desperate characters something like what you say But what would you think if I told you that I am pretty near as desperate as you two gentlemen Here s that Schomberg has an easy time running his hotel people think and yet it seems to me I would just as soon let you rip me open and burn the whole show as not There A low whistle was heard It came from Ricardo and was derisive Schomberg breathing heavily looked on the floor He was really desperate mister Jones remained languidly sceptical Tut tut You have a tolerable business You are perfectly tame you He paused then added in a tone of disgust You have a wife Schomberg tapped the floor angrily with his foot and uttered an indistinct laughing curse What do you mean by flinging that damned trouble at my head he cried I wish you would carry her off with you some where to the devil I wouldn t run after you The unexpected outburst affected mister Jones strangely He had a horrified recoil chair and all as if Schomberg had thrust a wriggling viper in his face What s this infernal nonsense he muttered thickly What do you mean How dare you Ricardo chuckled audibly I tell you I am desperate Schomberg repeated I am as desperate as any man ever was I don t care a hang what happens to me Well then mister Jones began to speak with a quietly threatening effect as if the common words of daily use had some other deadly meaning to his mind well then why should you make yourself ridiculously disagreeable to us If you don t care as you say you might just as well let us have the key of that music shed of yours for a quiet game a modest bank a dozen candles or so It would be greatly appreciated by your clients as far as I can judge from the way they betted on a game of ecarte I had with that fair baby faced man what s his name They just yearn for a modest bank And I am afraid Martin here would take it badly if you objected but of course you won t Think of the calls for drinks Schomberg raising his eyes at last met the gleams in two dark caverns under mister Jones s devilish eyebrows directed upon him impenetrably He shuddered as if horrors worse than murder had been lurking there and said nodding towards Ricardo I dare say he wouldn t think twice about sticking me if he had you at his back I wish I had sunk my launch and gone to the bottom myself in her before I boarded the steamer you came by Ah well I ve been already living in hell for weeks so you don t make much difference I ll let you have the concert room and hang the consequences But what about the boy on late duty If he sees the cards and actual money passing he will be sure to blab and it will be all over the town in no time A ghastly smile stirred the lips of mister Jones Ah I see you want to make a success of it Very good That s the way to get on Don t let it disturb you You chase all the Chinamen to bed early and we ll get Pedro here every evening He isn t the conventional waiter s cut but he will do to run to and fro with the tray while you sit here from nine to eleven serving out drinks and gathering the money There will be three of them now thought the unlucky Schomberg But Pedro at any rate was just a simple straightforward brute if a murderous one There was no mystery about him nothing uncanny no suggestion of a stealthy deliberate wildcat turned into a man or of an insolent spectre on leave from Hades endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror Pedro with his fangs his tangled beard and queer stare of his little bear s eyes was by comparison delightfully natural Besides Schomberg could no longer help himself That will do very well he asserted mournfully But if you gentlemen if you had turned up here only three months ago ay less than three months ago you would have found somebody very different from what I am now to talk to you It s true What do you think of that I scarcely know what to think I should think it was a lie You were probably as tame three months ago as you are now You were born tame like most people in the world mister Jones got up spectrally and Ricardo imitated him with a snarl and a stretch Schomberg in a brown study went on as if to himself There has been an orchestra here eighteen women mister Jones let out an exclamation of dismay and looked about as if the walls around him and the whole house had been infected with plague Then he became very angry and swore violently at Schomberg for daring to bring up such subjects The hotel keeper was too much surprised to get up He gazed from his chair at mister Jones s anger which had nothing spectral in it but was not the more comprehensible for that What s the matter he stammered out What subject Didn t you hear me say it was an orchestra There s nothing wrong in that Well there was a girl amongst them Schomberg s eyes went stony he clasped his hands in front of his breast with such force that his knuckles came out white Such a girl Tame am I I would have kicked everything to pieces about me for her And she of course I am in the prime of life then a fellow bewitched her a vagabond a false lying swindling underhand stick at nothing brute Ah His entwined fingers cracked as he tore his hands apart flung out his arms and leaned his forehead on them in a passion of fury The other two looked at his shaking back the attenuated mister Jones with mingled scorn and a sort of fear Ricardo with the expression of a cat which sees a piece of fish in the pantry out of reach Schomberg flung himself backwards He was dry eyed but he gulped as if swallowing sobs No wonder you can do with me what you like You have no idea just let me tell you of my trouble I don t want to know anything of your beastly trouble said mister Jones in his most lifelessly positive voice He stretched forth an arresting hand and as Schomberg remained open mouthed he walked out of the billiard room in all the uncanniness of his thin shanks Ricardo followed at his leader s heels but he showed his teeth to Schomberg over his shoulder CHAPTER SIX From that evening dated those mysterious but significant phenomena in Schomberg s establishment which attracted Captain Davidson s casual notice when he dropped in placid yet astute in order to return missus Schomberg s Indian shawl And strangely enough they lasted some considerable time It argued either honesty and bad luck or extraordinary restraint on the part of plain mister Jones and company in their discreet operations with cards It was a curious and impressive sight the inside of Schomberg s concert hall encumbered at one end by a great stack of chairs piled up on and about the musicians platform and lighted at the other by two dozen candles disposed about a long trestle table covered with green cloth In the middle mister Jones a starved spectre turned into a banker faced Ricardo a rather nasty slow moving cat turned into a croupier By contrast the other faces round that table anything between twenty and thirty must have looked like collected samples of intensely artless helpless humanity pathetic in their innocent watch for the small turns of luck which indeed might have been serious enough for them They had no notice to spare for the hairy Pedro carrying a tray with the clumsiness of a creature caught in the woods and taught to walk on its hind legs As to Schomberg he kept out of the way He remained in the billiard room serving out drinks to the unspeakable Pedro with an air of not seeing the growling monster of not knowing where the drinks went of ignoring that there was such a thing as a music room over there under the trees within fifty yards of the hotel He submitted himself to the situation with a low spirited stoicism compounded of fear and resignation Directly the party had broken up he could see dark shapes of the men drifting singly and in knots through the gate of the compound he would withdraw out of sight behind a door not quite closed in order to avoid meeting his two extraordinary guests but he would watch through the crack their contrasted forms pass through the billiard room and disappear on their way to bed Then he would hear doors being slammed upstairs and a profound silence would fall upon the whole house upon his hotel appropriated haunted by those insolently outspoken men provided with a whole armoury of weapons in their trunks A profound silence Schomberg sometimes could not resist the notion that he must be dreaming Shuddering he would pull himself together and creep out with movements strangely inappropriate to the Lieutenant of the Reserve bearing by which he tried to keep up his self respect before the world A great loneliness oppressed him One after another he would extinguish the lamps and move softly towards his bedroom where missus Schomberg waited for him no fit companion for a man of his ability and in the prime of life But that life alas was blighted He felt it and never with such force as when on opening the door he perceived that woman sitting patiently in a chair her toes peeping out under the edge of her night dress an amazingly small amount of hair on her head drooping on the long stalk of scraggy neck with that everlasting scared grin showing a blue tooth and meaning nothing not even real fear For she was used to him Sometimes he was tempted to screw the head off the stalk He imagined himself doing it with one hand a twisting movement Not seriously of course Just a simple indulgence for his exasperated feelings He wasn t capable of murder He was certain of that And remembering suddenly the plain speeches of mister Jones he would think I suppose I am too tame for that quite unaware that he had murdered the poor woman morally years ago He was too unintelligent to have the notion of such a crime Her bodily presence was bitterly offensive because of its contrast with a very different feminine image And it was no use getting rid of her She was a habit of years and there would be nothing to put in her place At any rate he could talk to that idiot half the night if he chose That night he had been vapouring before her as to his intention to face his two guests and instead of that inspiration he needed had merely received the usual warning Be careful Wilhelm He did not want to be told to be careful by an imbecile female What he needed was a pair of woman s arms which flung round his neck would brace him up for the encounter Inspire him he called it to himself He lay awake a long time and his slumbers when they came were unsatisfactory and short The morning light had no joy for his eyes He listened dismally to the movements in the house The Chinamen were unlocking and flinging wide the doors of the public rooms which opened on the veranda Horrors Another poisoned day to get through somehow The recollection of his resolve made him feel actually sick for a moment First of all the lordly abandoned attitudes of mister Jones disconcerted him Then there was his contemptuous silence mister Jones never addressed himself to Schomberg with any general remarks never opened his lips to him unless to say Good morning two simple words which uttered by that man seemed a mockery of a threatening character And lastly it was not a frank physical fear he inspired for as to that even a cornered rat will fight but a superstitious shrinking awe something like an invincible repugnance to seek speech with a wicked ghost That it was a daylight ghost surprisingly angular in his attitudes and for the most part spread out on three chairs did not make it any easier Daylight only made him a more weird a more disturbing and unlawful apparition Strangely enough in the evening when he came out of his mute supineness this unearthly side of him was less obtrusive At the gaming table when actually handling the cards it was probably sunk quite out of sight but Schomberg having made up his mind in ostrich like fashion to ignore what was going on never entered the desecrated music room He had never seen mister Jones in the exercise of his vocation or perhaps it was only his trade I will speak to him tonight Schomberg said to himself while he drank his morning tea in pyjamas on the veranda before the rising sun had topped the trees of the compound and while the undried dew still lay silvery on the grass sparkled on the blossoms of the central flower bed and darkened the yellow gravel of the drive That s what I ll do I won t keep out of sight tonight I shall come out and catch him as he goes to bed carrying the cash box After all what was the fellow but a common desperado Murderous Oh yes murderous enough perhaps and the muscles of Schomberg s stomach had a quivering contraction under his airy attire But even a common desperado would think twice or more likely a hundred times before openly murdering an inoffensive citizen in a civilized European ruled town He jerked his shoulders Of course He shuddered again and paddled back to his room to dress himself His mind was made up and he would think no more about it but still he had his doubts They grew and unfolded themselves with the progress of the day as some plants do At times they made him perspire more than usual and they did away with the possibility of his afternoon siesta After turning over on his couch more than a dozen times he gave up this mockery of repose got up and went downstairs It was between three and four o clock the hour of profound peace The very flowers seemed to doze on their stalks set with sleepy leaves Not even the air stirred for the sea breeze was not due till later The servants were out of sight catching naps in the shade somewhere behind the house missus Schomberg in a dim up stair room with closed jalousies was elaborating those two long pendant ringlets which were such a feature of her hairdressing for her afternoon duties At that time no customers ever troubled the repose of the establishment Wandering about his premises in profound solitude Schomberg recoiled at the door of the billiard room as if he had seen a snake in his path All alone with the billiards the bare little tables and a lot of untenanted chairs mister Secretary Ricardo sat near the wall performing with lightning rapidity something that looked like tricks with his own personal pack of cards which he always carried about in his pocket Schomberg would have backed out quietly if Ricardo had not turned his head Having been seen the hotel keeper elected to walk in as the lesser risk of the two The consciousness of his inwardly abject attitude towards these men caused him always to throw his chest out and assume a severe expression Ricardo watched his approach clasping the pack of cards in both hands You want something perhaps suggested Schomberg in his lieutenant of the Reserve voice Ricardo shook his head in silence and looked expectant With him Schomberg exchanged at least twenty words every day He was infinitely more communicative than his patron At times he looked very much like an ordinary human being of his class and he seemed to be in an amiable mood at that moment Suddenly spreading some ten cards face downward in the form of a fan he thrust them towards Schomberg Come man take one quick Schomberg was so surprised that he took one hurriedly after a very perceptible start The eyes of Martin Ricardo gleamed phosphorescent in the half light of the room screened from the heat and glare of the tropics That s the king of hearts you ve got he chuckled showing his teeth in a quick flash Schomberg after looking at the card admitted that it was and laid it down on the table I can make you take any card I like nine times out of ten exulted the secretary with a strange curl of his lips and a green flicker in his raised eyes Schomberg looked down at him dumbly For a few seconds neither of them stirred then Ricardo lowered his glance and opening his fingers let the whole pack fall on the table Schomberg sat down He sat down because of the faintness in his legs and for no other reason His mouth was dry Having sat down he felt that he must speak He squared his shoulders in parade style You are pretty good at that sort of thing he said Practice makes perfect replied the secretary His precarious amiability made it impossible for Schomberg to get away Thus from his very timidity the hotel keeper found himself engaged in a conversation the thought of which filled him with apprehension It must be said in justice to Schomberg that he concealed his funk very creditably The habit of throwing out his chest and speaking in a severe voice stood him in good stead With him too practice made perfect and he would probably have kept it up to the end to the very last moment to the ultimate instant of breaking strain which would leave him grovelling on the floor To add to his secret trouble he was at a loss what to say He found nothing else but the remark I suppose you are fond of cards What would you expect asked Ricardo in a simple philosophical tone It is likely I should not be Then with sudden fire Fond of cards Ay passionately The effect of this outburst was augmented by the quiet lowering of the eyelids by a reserved pause as though this had been a confession of another kind of love Schomberg cudgelled his brains for a new topic but he could not find one His usual scandalous gossip would not serve this turn That desperado did not know anyone anywhere within a thousand miles Schomberg was almost compelled to keep to the subject I suppose you ve always been so from your early youth Ricardo s eyes remained cast down His fingers toyed absently with the pack on the table I don t know that it was so early I first got in the way of it playing for tobacco in forecastles of ships you know common sailor games We used to spend whole watches below at it round a chest under a slush lamp We would hardly spare the time to get a bite of salt horse neither eat nor sleep We could hardly stand when the watches were mustered on deck Talk of gambling He dropped the reminiscent tone to add the information I was bred to the sea from a boy you know Schomberg had fallen into a reverie but without losing the sense of impending calamity The next words he heard were I got on all right at sea too Worked up to be mate I was mate of a schooner a yacht you might call her a special good berth too in the Gulf of Mexico a soft job that you don t run across more than once in a lifetime Yes I was mate of her when I left the sea to follow him Ricardo tossed up his chin to indicate the room above from which Schomberg his wits painfully aroused by this reminder of mister Jones s existence concluded that the latter had withdrawn into his bedroom Ricardo observing him from under lowered eyelids went on It so happened that we were shipmates mister Jones you mean Is he a sailor too Ricardo raised his eyelids at that He s no more mister Jones than you are he said with obvious pride He a sailor That just shows your ignorance But there A foreigner can t be expected to know any better I am an Englishman and I know a gentleman at sight I should know one drunk in the gutter in jail under the gallows There s a something it isn t exactly the appearance it s a no use me trying to tell you You ain t an Englishman and if you were you wouldn t need to be told An unsuspected stream of loquacity had broken its dam somewhere deep within the man had diluted his fiery blood and softened his pitiless fibre Schomberg experienced mingled relief and apprehension as if suddenly an enormous savage cat had begun to wind itself about his legs in inexplicable friendliness No prudent man under such circumstances would dare to stir Schomberg didn t stir Ricardo assumed an easy attitude with an elbow on the table Schomberg squared his shoulders afresh I was employed in that there yacht schooner whatever you call it by ten gentlemen at once That surprises you eh Yes yes ten Leastwise there were nine of them gents good enough in their way and one downright gentleman and that was Ricardo gave another upward jerk of his chin as much as to say He The only one And no mistake he went on I spotted him from the first day How Why Ay you may ask Hadn t seen that many gentlemen in my life Well somehow I did If you were an Englishman you would What was your yacht Schomberg interrupted as impatiently as he dared for this harping on nationality jarred on his already tried nerves What was the game You have a headpiece on you Game Xactly That s what it was the sort of silliness gentlemen will get up among themselves to play at adventure A treasure hunting expedition Each of them put down so much money you understand to buy the schooner Their agent in the city engaged me and the skipper The greatest secrecy and all that I reckon he had a twinkle in his eye all the time and no mistake But that wasn t our business Let them bust their money as they like The pity of it was that so little of it came our way Just fair pay and no more And damn any pay much or little anyhow that s what I say He blinked his eyes greenishly in the dim light The heat seemed to have stilled everything in the world but his voice He swore at large abundantly in snarling undertones it was impossible to say why then calmed down as inexplicably and went on as a sailor yarns At first there were only nine of them adventurous sparks then just a day or two before the sailing date he turned up Heard of it somehow somewhere I would say from some woman if I didn t know him as I do He would give any woman a ten mile berth He can t stand them Or maybe in a flash bar Or maybe in one of them grand clubs in Pall Mall Anyway the agent netted him in all right cash down and only about four and twenty hours for him to get ready but he didn t miss his ship Not he You might have called it a pier head jump for a gentleman I saw him come along Know the West India Docks eh Schomberg did not know the West India Docks Ricardo looked at him pensively for a while and then continued as if such ignorance had to be disregarded Our tug was already alongside Two loafers were carrying his dunnage behind him I told the dockman at our moorings to keep all fast for a minute The gangway was down already but he made nothing of it Up he jumps one leap swings his long legs over the rail and there he is on board They pass up his swell dunnage and he puts his hand in his trousers pocket and throws all his small change on the wharf for them chaps to pick up They were still promenading that wharf on all fours when we cast off It was only then that he looked at me quietly you know in a slow way He wasn t so thin then as he is now but I noticed he wasn t so young as he looked not by a long chalk He seemed to touch me inside somewhere I went away pretty quick from there I was wanted forward anyhow I wasn t frightened What should I be frightened for I only felt touched on the very spot But Jee miny if anybody had told me we should be partners before the year was out well I would have He swore a variety of strange oaths some common others quaintly horrible to Schomberg s ears and all mere innocent exclamations of wonder at the shifts and changes of human fortune Schomberg moved slightly in his chair But the admirer and partner of plain mister Jones seemed to have forgotten Schomberg s existence for the moment The stream of ingenuous blasphemy some of it in bad Spanish had run dry and Martin Ricardo connoisseur in gentlemen sat dumb with a stony gaze as if still marvelling inwardly at the amazing elections conjunctions and associations of events which influence man s pilgrimage on this earth At last Schomberg spoke tentatively And so the the gentleman up there talked you over into leaving a good berth Ricardo started Talked me over Didn t need to talk me over Just beckoned to me and that was enough By that time we were in the Gulf of Mexico One night we were lying at anchor close to a dry sandbank to this day I am not sure where it was off the Colombian coast or thereabouts We were to start digging the next morning and all hands had turned in early expecting a hard day with the shovels Up he comes and in his quiet tired way of speaking you can tell a gentleman by that as much as by anything else almost up he comes behind me and says just like that into my ear in a manner Well what do you think of our treasure hunt now I didn t even turn my head xactly as I stood I remained and I spoke no louder than himself If you want to know sir it s nothing but just damned tom foolery We had of course been having short talks together at one time or another during the passage I dare say he had read me like a book There ain t much to me except that I have never been tame even when walking the pavement and cracking jokes and standing drinks to chums ay and to strangers too I would watch them lifting their elbows at my expense or splitting their side at my fun I can be funny when I like you bet A pause for self complacent contemplation of his own fun and generosity checked the flow of Ricardo s speech Schomberg was concerned to keep within bounds the enlargement of his eyes which he seemed to feel growing bigger in his head Yes yes he whispered hastily I would watch them and think You boys don t know who I am If you did With girls too Once I was courting a girl I used to kiss her behind the ear and say to myself If you only knew who s kissing you my dear you would scream and bolt Ha ha Not that I wanted to do them any harm but I felt the power in myself Now here we sit friendly like and that s all right You aren t in my way But I am not friendly to you I just don t care Some men do say that but I really don t You are no more to me one way or another than that fly there Just so I d squash you or leave you alone I don t care what I do If real force of character consists in overcoming our sudden weaknesses Schomberg displayed plenty of that quality At the mention of the fly he re enforced the severe dignity of his attitude as one inflates a collapsing toy balloon with a great effort of breath The easy going relaxed attitude of Ricardo was really appalling That s so he went on I am that sort of fellow You wouldn t think it would you No You have to be told So I am telling you and I dare say you only half believe it But you can t say to yourself that I am drunk stare at me as you may I haven t had anything stronger than a glass of iced water all day Takes a real gentleman to see through a fellow Oh yes he spotted me I told you we had a few talks at sea about one thing or another And I used to watch him down the skylight playing cards in the cuddy with the others They had to pass the time away somehow By the same token he caught me at it once and it was then that I told him I was fond of cards and generally lucky in gambling too Yes he had sized me up Why not A gentleman s just like any other man and something more It flashed through Schomberg s mind that these two were indeed well matched in their enormous dissimilarity identical souls in different disguises Says he to me Ricardo started again in a gossiping manner I m packed up It s about time to go Martin It was the first time he called me Martin Says I Is that it sir You didn t think I was after that sort of treasure did you I wanted to clear out from home quietly It s a pretty expensive way of getting a passage across but it has served my turn I let him know very soon that I was game for anything from pitch and toss to wilful murder in his company Wilful murder says he in his quiet way What the deuce is that What are you talking about People do get killed sometimes when they get in one s way but that s self defence you understand I told him I did And then I said I would run below for a minute to ram a few of my things into a sailor s bag I had I ve never cared for a lot of dunnage I believed in going about flying light when I was at sea I came back and found him strolling up and down the deck as if he were taking a breath of fresh air before turning in like any other evening Ready Yes sir He didn t even look at me We had had a boat in the water astern ever since we came to anchor in the afternoon He throws the stump of his cigar overboard Can you get the captain out on deck he asks That was the last thing in the world I should have thought of doing I lost my tongue for a moment I can try says I Well then I am going below You get him up and keep him with you till I come back on deck Mind Don t let him go below till I return I could not help asking why he told me to rouse a sleeping man when we wanted everybody on board to sleep sweetly till we got clear of the schooner He laughs a little and says that I didn t see all the bearings of this business Mind he says don t let him leave you till you see me come up again He puts his eyes close to mine Keep him with you at all costs And that means says I All costs to him by every possible or impossible means I don t want to be interrupted in my business down below He would give me lots of trouble I take you with me to save myself trouble in various circumstances and you ve got to enter on your work right away Just so sir says I and he slips down the companion With a gentleman you know at once where you are but it was a ticklish job The skipper was nothing to me one way or another any more than you are at this moment mister Schomberg You may light your cigar or blow your brains out this minute and I don t care a hang which you do both or neither To bring the skipper up was easy enough I had only to stamp on the deck a few times over his head I stamped hard But how to keep him up when he got there Anything the matter mister Ricardo I heard his voice behind me There he was and I hadn t thought of anything to say to him so I didn t turn round The moonlight was brighter than many a day I could remember in the North Sea Why did you call me What are you staring at out there mister Ricardo He was deceived by my keeping my back to him I wasn t staring at anything but his mistake gave me a notion I am staring at something that looks like a canoe over there I said very slowly The skipper got concerned at once It wasn t any danger from the inhabitants whoever they were Oh hang it says he That s very unfortunate He had hoped that the schooner being on the coast would not get known so very soon Dashed awkward with the business we ve got in hand to have a lot of niggers watching operations But are you certain this is a canoe It may be a drift log I said but I thought you had better have a look with your own eyes You may make it out better than I can His eyes weren t anything as good as mine But he says Certainly Certainly You did quite right And it s a fact I had seen some drift logs at sunset I saw what they were then and didn t trouble my head about them forgot all about it till that very moment Nothing strange in seeing drift logs off a coast like that and I m hanged if the skipper didn t make one out in the wake of the moon Strange what a little thing a man s life hangs on sometimes a single word Here you are sitting unsuspicious before me and you may let out something unbeknown to you that would settle your hash Not that I have any ill feeling I have no feelings If the skipper had said O bosh and had turned his back on me he would not have gone three steps towards his bed but he stood there and stared And now the job was to get him off the deck when he was no longer wanted there We are just trying to make out if that object there is a canoe or a log says he to mister Jones mister Jones had come up lounging as carelessly as when he went below While the skipper was jawing about boats and drifting logs I asked by signs from behind if I hadn t better knock him on the head and drop him quietly overboard The night was slipping by and we had to go It couldn t be put off till next night no more No No more And do you know why Schomberg made a slight negative sign with his head This direct appeal annoyed him jarred on the induced quietude of a great talker forced into the part of a listener and sunk in it as a man sinks into slumber mister Ricardo struck a note of scorn Don t know why Can t you guess No Because the boss had got hold of the skipper s cash box by then See CHAPTER SEVEN A common thief Schomberg bit his tongue just too late and woke up completely as he saw Ricardo retract his lips in a cat like grin but the companion of plain mister Jones didn t alter his comfortable gossiping attitude Garn What if he did want to see his money back like any tame shopkeeper hash seller gin slinger or ink spewer does Fancy a mud turtle like you trying to pass an opinion on a gentleman A gentleman isn t to be sized up so easily Even I ain t up to it sometimes For instance that night all he did was to waggle his finger at me The skipper stops his silly chatter surprised Eh What s the matter asks he The matter It was his reprieve that s what was the matter O nothing nothing says my gentleman You are perfectly right A log nothing but a log Ha ha Reprieve I call it because if the skipper had gone on with his silly argument much longer he would have had to be knocked out of the way I could hardly hold myself in on account of the precious minutes However his guardian angel put it into his head to shut up and go back to his bed I was ramping mad about the lost time Why didn t you let me give him one on his silly coconut sir I asks No ferocity no ferocity he says raising his finger at me as calm as you please You can t tell how a gentleman takes that sort of thing They don t lose their temper It s bad form You ll never see him lose his temper not for anybody to see anyhow Ferocity ain t good form either that much I ve learned by this time and more too I ve had that schooling that you couldn t tell by my face if I meant to rip you up the next minute as of course I could do in less than a jiffy I have a knife up the leg of my trousers You haven t exclaimed Schomberg incredulously mister Ricardo was as quick as lightning in changing his lounging idle attitude for a stooping position and exhibiting the weapon with one jerk at the left leg of his trousers Schomberg had just a view of it strapped to a very hairy limb when mister Ricardo jumping up stamped his foot to get the trouser leg down and resumed his careless pose with one elbow on the table It s a more handy way to carry a tool than you would think he went on gazing abstractedly into Schomberg s wide open eyes Suppose some little difference comes up during a game Well you stoop to pick up a dropped card and when you come up there you are ready to strike or with the thing up you sleeve ready to throw Or you just dodge under the table when there s some shooting coming You wouldn t believe the damage a fellow with a knife under the table can do to ill conditioned skunks that want to raise trouble before they begin to understand what the screaming s about and make a bolt those that can that is The roses of Schomberg s cheek at the root of his chestnut beard faded perceptibly Ricardo chuckled faintly But no ferocity no ferocity A gentleman knows What s the good of getting yourself into a state And no shirking necessity either No gentleman ever shirks What I learn I don t forget Why We gambled on the plains with a damn lot of cattlemen in ranches played fair mind and then had to fight for our winnings afterwards as often as not We ve gambled on the hills and in the valleys and on the sea shore and out of sight of land mostly fair Generally it s good enough We began in Nicaragua first after we left that schooner and her fool errand There were one hundred and twenty seven sovereigns and some Mexican dollars in that skipper s cash box Hardly enough to knock a man on the head for from behind I must confess but that the skipper had a narrow escape the governor himself could not deny afterwards Do you want me to understand sir that you mind there being one life more or less on this earth I asked him a few hours after we got away Certainly not says he Well then why did you stop me There s a proper way of doing things You ll have to learn to be correct There s also unnecessary exertion That must be avoided too if only for the look of the thing A gentleman s way of putting things to you and no mistake At sunrise we got into a creek to lie hidden in case the treasure hunt party had a mind to take a spell hunting for us And dash me if they didn t We saw the schooner away out running to leeward with ten pairs of binoculars sweeping the sea no doubt on all sides I advised the governor to give her time to beat back again before we made a start So we stayed up that creek something like ten days as snug as can be On the seventh day we had to kill a man though the brother of this Pedro here They were alligator hunters right enough We got our lodgings in their hut Neither the boss nor I could habla Espanol speak Spanish you know much then Dry bank nice shade jolly hammocks fresh fish good game everything lovely The governor chucked them a few dollars to begin with but it was like boarding with a pair of savage apes anyhow By and by we noticed them talking a lot together They had twigged the cash box and the leather portmanteaus and my bag a jolly lot of plunder to look at They must have been saying to each other No one s ever likely to come looking for these two fellows who seem to have fallen from the moon Let s cut their throats Why of course Clear as daylight I didn t need to spy one of them sharpening a devilish long knife behind some bushes while glancing right and left with his wild eyes to know what was in the wind Pedro was standing by trying the edge of another long knife They thought we were away on our lookout at the mouth of the river as was usual with us during the day Not that we expected to see much of the schooner but it was just as well to make certain if possible and then it was cooler out of the woods in the breeze Well the governor was there right enough lying comfortable on a rug where he could watch the offing but I had gone back to the hut to get a chew of tobacco out of my bag I had not broken myself of the habit then and I couldn t be happy unless I had a lump as big as a baby s fist in my cheek At the cannibalistic comparison Schomberg muttered a faint sickly don t Ricardo hitched himself up in his seat and glanced down his outstretched legs complacently I am tolerably light on my feet as a general thing he went on Dash me if I don t think I could drop a pinch of salt on a sparrow s tail if I tried Anyhow they didn t hear me I watched them two brown hairy brutes not ten yards off All they had on was white linen drawers rolled up on their thighs Not a word they said to each other Antonio was down on his thick hams busy rubbing a knife on a flat stone Pedro was leaning against a small tree and passing his thumb along the edge of his blade I got away quieter than a mouse you bet I didn t say anything to the boss then He was leaning on his elbow on his rug and didn t seem to want to be spoken to He s like that sometimes that familiar you might think he would eat out of your hand and at others he would snub you sharper than a devil but always quiet Perfect gentleman I tell you I didn t bother him then but I wasn t likely to forget them two fellows so businesslike with their knives At that time we had only one revolver between us two the governor s six shooter but loaded only in five chambers and we had no more cartridges He had left the box behind in a drawer in his cabin Awkward I had nothing but an old clasp knife no good at all for anything serious In the evening we four sat round a bit of fire outside the sleeping shed eating broiled fish off plantain leaves with roast yams for bread the usual thing The governor and I were on one side and these two beauties cross legged on the other grunting a word or two to each other now and then hardly human speech at all and their eyes down fast on the ground For the last three days we couldn t get them to look us in the face Presently I began to talk to the boss quietly just as I am talking to you now careless like and I told him all I had observed He goes on picking up pieces of fish and putting them into his mouth as calm as anything It s a pleasure to have anything to do with a gentleman Never looked across at them once And now says I yawning on purpose we ve got to stand watch at night turn about and keep our eyes skinned all day too and mind we don t get jumped upon suddenly It s perfectly intolerable says the governor And you with no weapon of any sort I mean to stick pretty close to you sir from this on if you don t mind says I He just nods the least bit wipes his fingers on the plantain leaf puts his hand behind his back as if to help himself to rise from the ground snatches his revolver from under his jacket and plugs a bullet plumb centre into mister Antonio s chest See what it is to have to do with a gentleman No confounded fuss and things done out of hand But he might have tipped me a wink or something I nearly jumped out of my skin Scared ain t in it I didn t even know who had fired Everything had been so still just before that the bang of the shot seemed the loudest noise I had ever heard The honourable Antonio pitches forward they always do towards the shot you must have noticed that yourself yes he pitches forward on to the embers and all that lot of hair on his face and head flashes up like a pinch of gunpowder Greasy I expect always scraping the fat off them alligators hides Look here exclaimed Schomberg violently as if trying to burst some invisible bonds do you mean to say that all this happened No said Ricardo coolly I am making it all up as I go along just to help you through the hottest part of the afternoon So down he pitches his nose on the red embers and up jumps our handsome Pedro and I at the same time like two Jacks in the box He starts to bolt away with his head over his shoulder and I hardly knowing what I was doing spring on his back I had the sense to get my hands round his neck at once and it s about all I could do to lock my fingers tight under his jaw You saw the beauty s neck didn t you Hard as iron too Down we both went Seeing this the governor puts his revolver in his pocket Tie his legs together sir I yell I m trying to strangle him There was a lot of their fibre lines lying about I gave him a last squeeze and then got up I might have shot you says the governor quite concerned But you are glad to have saved a cartridge sir I tell him My jump did save it It wouldn t have done to let him get away in the dark like that and have the beauty dodging around in the bushes perhaps with the rusty flint lock gun they had The governor owned up that the jump was the correct thing But he isn t dead says he bending over him Might as well hope to strangle an ox We made haste to tie his elbows back and then before he came to himself we dragged him to a small tree sat him up and bound him to it not by the waist but by the neck some twenty turns of small line round his throat and the trunk finished off with a reef knot under his ear Next thing we did was to attend to the honourable Antonio who was making a great smell frizzling his face on the red coals We pushed and rolled him into the creek and left the rest to the alligators I was tired That little scrap took it out of me something awful The governor hadn t turned a hair That s where a gentleman has the pull of you He don t get excited No gentleman does or hardly ever I fell asleep all of a sudden and left him smoking by the fire I had made up his railway rug round his legs as calm as if he were sitting in a first class carriage We hardly spoke ten words to each other after it was over and from that day to this we have never talked of the business I wouldn t have known he remembered it if he hadn t alluded to it when talking with you the other day you know with regard to Pedro It surprised you didn t it That s why I am giving you this yarn of how he came to be with us like a sort of dog dashed sight more useful though You know how he can trot around with trays Well he could bring down an ox with his fist at a word from the boss just as cleverly And fond of the governor Oh my word More than any dog is of any man Schomberg squared his chest Oh and that s one of the things I wanted to mention to mister Jones he said It s unpleasant to have that fellow round the house so early He sits on the stairs at the back for hours before he is needed here and frightens people so that the service suffers The Chinamen Ricardo nodded and raised his hand When I first saw him he was fit to frighten a grizzly bear let alone a Chinaman He s become civilized now to what he once was Well that morning first thing on opening my eyes I saw him sitting there tied up by the neck to the tree He was blinking We spent the day watching the sea and we actually made out the schooner working to windward which showed that she had given us up Good When the sun rose again I took a squint at our Pedro He wasn t blinking He was rolling his eyes all white one minute and black the next and his tongue was hanging out a yard Being tied up short by the neck like this would daunt the arch devil himself in time in time mind I don t know but that even a real gentleman would find it difficult to keep a stiff lip to the end Presently we went to work getting our boat ready I was busying myself setting up the mast when the governor passes the remark I think he wants to say something I had heard a sort of croaking going on for some time only I wouldn t take any notice but then I got out of the boat and went up to him with some water His eyes were red red and black and half out of his head He drank all the water I gave him but he hadn t much to say for himself I walked back to the governor He asks for a bullet in his head before we go I said I wasn t at all pleased Oh that s out of the question altogether says the governor He was right there Only four shots left and ninety miles of wild coast to put behind us before coming to the first place where you could expect to buy revolver cartridges Anyhow I tells him he wants to be killed some way or other as a favour And then I go on setting up the boat s mast I didn t care much for the notion of butchering a man bound hand and foot and fastened by the neck besides I had a knife then the honourable Antonio s knife and that knife is this knife Ricardo gave his leg a resounding slap First spoil in my new life he went on with harsh joviality The dodge of carrying it down there I learned later I carried it stuck in my belt that day No I hadn t much stomach for the job but when you work with a gentleman of the real right sort you may depend on your feelings being seen through your skin Says the governor suddenly It may even be looked upon as his right you hear a gentleman speaking there but what do you think of taking him with us in the boat And the governor starts arguing that the beggar would be useful in working our way along the coast We could get rid of him before coming to the first place that was a little civilized I didn t want much talking over Out I scrambled from the boat Ay but will he be manageable sir Oh yes He s daunted Go on cut him loose I take the responsibility Right you are sir He sees me come along smartly with his brother s knife in my hand I wasn t thinking how it looked from his side of the fence you know and jiminy it nearly killed him He stared like a crazed bullock and began to sweat and twitch all over something amazing I was so surprised that I stopped to look at him The drops were pouring over his eyebrows down his beard off his nose and he gurgled Then it struck me that he couldn t see what was in my mind By favour or by right he didn t like to die when it came to it not in that way anyhow When I stepped round to get at the lashing he let out a sort of soft bellow Thought I was going to stick him from behind I guess I cut all the turns with one slash and he went over on his side flop and started kicking with his tied legs Laugh I don t know what there was so funny about it but I fairly shouted What between my laughing and his wriggling I had a job in cutting him free As soon as he could feel his limbs he makes for the bank where the governor was standing crawls up to him on his hands and knees and embraces his legs Gratitude eh You could see that being allowed to live suited that chap down to the ground The governor gets his legs away from him gently and just mutters to me Let s be off Get him into the boat It was not difficult continued Ricardo after eyeing Schomberg fixedly for a moment He was ready enough to get into the boat and here he is He would let himself be chopped into small pieces with a smile mind with a smile for the governor I don t know about him doing that much for me but pretty near pretty near I did the tying up and the untying but he could see who was the boss And then he knows a gentleman A dog knows a gentleman any dog It s only some foreigners that don t know and nothing can teach them either And you mean to say asked Schomberg disregarding what might have been annoying for himself in the emphasis of the final remark you mean to say that you left steady employment at good wages for a life like this There began Ricardo quietly That s just what a man like you would say You are that tame I follow a gentleman That ain t the same thing as to serve an employer They give you wages as they d fling a bone to a dog and they expect you to be grateful It s worse than slavery You don t expect a slave that s bought for money to be grateful And if you sell your work what is it but selling your own self You ve got so many days to live and you sell them one after another Hey Who can pay me enough for my life Ay But they throw at you your week s money and expect you to say thank you before you pick it up He mumbled some curses directed at employers generally as it seemed then blazed out Work be damned I ain t a dog walking on its hind legs for a bone I am a man who s following a gentleman There s a difference which you will never understand mister Tame Schomberg He yawned slightly Schomberg preserving a military stiffness reinforced by a slight frown had allowed his thoughts to stray away They were busy detailing the image of a young girl absent gone stolen from him He became enraged There was that rascal looking at him insolently If the girl had not been shamefully decoyed away from him he would not have allowed anyone to look at him insolently He would have made nothing of hitting that rogue between the eyes Afterwards he would have kicked the other without hesitation He saw himself doing it and in sympathy with this glorious vision Schomberg s right foot and arm moved convulsively At this moment he came out of his sudden reverie to note with alarm the wide awake curiosity of mister Ricardo s stare And so you go like this about the world gambling he remarked inanely to cover his confusion But Ricardo s stare did not change its character and he continued vaguely Here and there and everywhere He pulled himself together squared his shoulders Isn t it very precarious he said firmly The word precarious seemed to be effective because Ricardo s eyes lost their dangerously interested expression No not so bad Ricardo said with indifference It s my opinion that men will gamble as long as they have anything to put on a card Gamble That s nature What s life itself You never know what may turn up The worst of it is that you never can tell exactly what sort of cards you are holding yourself What s trumps that is the question See Any man will gamble if only he s given a chance for anything or everything You too I haven t touched a card now for twenty years said Schomberg in an austere tone Well if you got your living that way you would be no worse than you are now selling drinks to people beastly beer and spirits rotten stuff fit to make an old he goat yell if you poured it down its throat Pooh I can t stand the confounded liquor Never could A whiff of neat brandy in a glass makes me feel sick Always did If everybody was like me liquor would be going a begging You think it s funny in a man don t you Schomberg made a vague gesture of toleration Ricardo hitched up his chair and settled his elbow afresh on the table French siros I must say I do like Saigon s the place for them I see you have siros in the bar Hang me if I ain t getting dry conversing like this with you Come mister Schomberg be hospitable as the governor says Schomberg rose and walked with dignity to the counter His footsteps echoed loudly on the floor of polished boards He took down a bottle labelled Sirop de Groseille The little sounds he made the clink of glass the gurgling of the liquid the pop of the soda water cork had a preternatural sharpness He came back carrying a pink and glistening tumbler mister Ricardo had followed his movements with oblique coyly expectant yellow eyes like a cat watching the preparation of a saucer of milk and the satisfied sound after he had drunk might have been a slightly modified form of purring very soft and deep in his throat It affected Schomberg unpleasantly as another example of something inhuman in those men wherein lay the difficulty of dealing with them A spectre a cat an ape there was a pretty association for a mere man to remonstrate with he reflected with an inward shudder for Schomberg had been overpowered as it were by his imagination and his reason could not react against that fanciful view of his guests And it was not only their appearance The morals of mister Ricardo seemed to him to be pretty much the morals of a cat Too much What sort of argument could a mere man offer to a or to a spectre either What the morals of a spectre could be Schomberg had no idea Something dreadful no doubt Compassion certainly had no place in them As to the ape well everybody knew what an ape was It had no morals Nothing could be more hopeless Outwardly however having picked up the cigar which he had laid aside to get the drink with his thick fingers one of them ornamented by a gold ring Schomberg smoked with moody composure Facing him Ricardo blinked slowly for a time then closed his eyes altogether with the placidity of the domestic cat dozing on the hearth rug In another moment he opened them very wide and seemed surprised to see Schomberg there You re having a very slack time today aren t you he observed But then this whole town is confoundedly slack anyhow and I ve never faced such a slack party at a table before Come eleven o clock they begin to talk of breaking up What s the matter with them Want to go to bed so early or what I reckon you don t lose a fortune by their wanting to go to bed said Schomberg with sombre sarcasm No admitted Ricardo with a grin that stretched his thin mouth from ear to ear giving a sudden glimpse of his white teeth Only you see when I once start I would play for nuts for parched peas for any rubbish I would play them for their souls But these Dutchmen aren t any good They never seem to get warmed up properly win or lose I ve tried them both ways too Hang them for a beggarly bloodless lot of animated cucumbers And if anything out of the way was to happen they would be just as cool in locking you and your gentleman up Schomberg snarled unpleasantly Indeed said Ricardo slowly taking Schomberg s measure with his eyes And what about you You talk mighty big burst out the hotel keeper You talk of ranging all over the world and doing great things and taking fortune by the scruff of the neck but here you stick at this miserable business It isn t much of a lay that s a fact admitted Ricardo unexpectedly Schomberg was red in the face with audacity I call it paltry he spluttered That s how it looks Can t call it anything else Ricardo seemed to be in an accommodating mood I should be ashamed of it myself only you see the governor is subject to fits Fits Schomberg cried out but in a low tone You don t say so He exulted inwardly as if this disclosure had in some way diminished the difficulty of the situation Fits That s a serious thing isn t it You ought to take him to the civil hospital a lovely place Ricardo nodded slightly with a faint grin Serious enough Regular fits of laziness I call them Now and then he lays down on me like this and there s no moving him If you think I like it you re a long way out Generally speaking I can talk him over I know how to deal with a gentleman I am no daily bread slave But when he has said Martin I am bored then look out There s nothing to do but to shut up confound it Schomberg very much cast down had listened open mouthed What s the cause of it he asked Why is he like this I don t understand I think I do said Ricardo A gentleman you know is not such a simple person as you or I and not so easy to manage either If only I had something to lever him out with What do you mean to lever him out with muttered Schomberg hopelessly Ricardo was impatient with this denseness Don t you understand English Look here I couldn t make this billiard table move an inch if I talked to it from now till the end of days could I Well the governor is like that too when the fits are on him He s bored Nothing s worthwhile nothing s good enough that s mere sense But if I saw a capstan bar lying about here I would soon manage to shift that billiard table of yours a good many inches And that s all there is to it He rose noiselessly stretched himself supple and stealthy with curious sideways movements of his head and unexpected elongations of his thick body glanced out of the corners of his eyes in the direction of the door and finally leaned back against the table folding his arms on his breast comfortably in a completely human attitude That s another thing you can tell a gentleman by his freakishness A gentleman ain t accountable to nobody any more than a tramp on the roads He ain t got to keep time The governor got like this once in a one horse Mexican pueblo on the uplands away from everywhere He lay all day long in a dark room Drunk This word escaped Schomberg by inadvertence at which he became frightened But the devoted secretary seemed to find it natural No that never comes on together with this kind of fit He just lay there full length on a mat while a ragged bare legged boy that he had picked up in the street sat in the patio between two oleanders near the open door of his room strumming on a guitar and singing tristes to him from morning to night You know tristes twang twang twang aouh hoo Chroo yah Schomberg uplifted his hands in distress This tribute seemed to flatter Ricardo His mouth twitched grimly Like that enough to give colic to an ostrich eh Awful Well there was a cook there who loved me an old fat Negro woman with spectacles I used to hide in the kitchen and turn her to to make me dulces sweet things you know mostly eggs and sugar to pass the time away I am like a kid for sweet things And by the way why don t you ever have a pudding at your tablydott mister Schomberg Nothing but fruit morning noon and night Sickening What do you think a fellow is a wasp Schomberg disregarded the injured tone And how long did that fit as you call it last he asked anxiously Weeks months years centuries it seemed to me returned mister Ricardo with feeling Of an evening the governor would stroll out into the sala and fritter his life away playing cards with the juez of the place a little Dago with a pair of black whiskers ekarty you know a quick French game for small change And the comandante a one eyed half Indian flat nosed ruffian and I we had to stand around and bet on their hands It was awful Awful echoed Schomberg in a Teutonic throaty tone of despair Look here I need your rooms To be sure I have been thinking that for some time past said Ricardo indifferently I was mad when I listened to you This must end I think you are mad yet said Ricardo not even unfolding his arms or shifting his attitude an inch He lowered his voice to add And if I thought you had been to the police I would tell Pedro to catch you round the waist and break your fat neck by jerking your head backward snap I saw him do it to a big buck nigger who was flourishing a razor in front of the governor It can be done You hear a low crack that s all and the man drops down like a limp rag Not even Ricardo s head slightly inclined on the left shoulder had moved but when he ceased the greenish irises which had been staring out of doors glided into the corners of his eyes nearest to Schomberg and stayed there with a coyly voluptuous expression CHAPTER EIGHT Schomberg felt desperation that lamentable substitute for courage ooze out of him It was not so much the threat of death as the weirdly circumstantial manner of its declaration which affected him A mere I ll murder you however ferocious in tone and earnest in purpose he could have faced but before this novel mode of speech and procedure his imagination being very sensitive to the unusual he collapsed as if indeed his moral neck had been broken snap Go to the police Of course not Never dreamed of it Too late now I ve let myself be mixed up in this You got my consent while I wasn t myself I explained it to you at the time Ricardo s eye glided gently off Schomberg to stare far away Ay Some trouble with a girl But that s nothing to us Naturally What I say is what s the good of all that savage talk to me A bright argument occurred to him It s out of proportion for even if I were fool enough to go to the police now there s nothing serious to complain about It would only mean deportation for you They would put you on board the first west bound steamer to Singapore He had become animated Out of this to the devil he added between his teeth for his own private satisfaction Ricardo made no comment and gave no sign of having heard a single word This discouraged Schomberg who had looked up hopefully Why do you want to stick here he cried It can t pay you people to fool around like this Didn t you worry just now about moving your governor Well the police would move him for you and from Singapore you can go on to the east coast of Africa I ll be hanged if the fellow isn t up to that silly trick was Ricardo s comment spoken in an ominous tone which recalled Schomberg to the realities of his position No No he protested It s a manner of speaking Of course I wouldn t I think that trouble about the girl has really muddled your brains mister Schomberg Believe me you had better part friends with us for deportation or no deportation you ll be seeing one of us turning up before long to pay you off for any nasty dodge you may be hatching in that fat head of yours Gott im Himmel groaned Schomberg Will nothing move him out Will he stop here immer I mean always Suppose I were to make it worth your while couldn t you No Ricardo interrupted I couldn t unless I had something to lever him out with I ve told you that before An inducement muttered Schomberg Ay The east coast of Africa isn t good enough He told me the other day that it will have to wait till he is ready for it and he may not be ready for a long time because the east coast can t run away and no one is likely to run off with it These remarks whether considered as truisms or as depicting mister Jones s mental state were distinctly discouraging to the long suffering Schomberg but there is truth in the well known saying that places the darkest hour before the dawn The sound of words apart from the context has its power and these two words run off had a special affinity to the hotel keeper s haunting idea It was always present in his brain and now it came forward evoked by a purely fortuitous expression No nobody could run off with a continent but Heyst had run off with the girl Ricardo could have had no conception of the cause of Schomberg s changed expression Yet it was noticeable enough to interest him so much that he stopped the careless swinging of his leg and said looking at the hotel keeper There s not much use arguing against that sort of talk is there Schomberg was not listening I could put you on another track he said slowly and stopped as if suddenly choked by an unholy emotion of intense eagerness combined with fear of failure Ricardo waited attentive yet not without a certain contempt On the track of a man Schomberg uttered convulsively and paused again consulting his rage and his conscience The man in the moon eh suggested Ricardo in a jeering murmur Schomberg shook his head It would be nearly as safe to rook him as if he were the Man in the moon You go and try It isn t so very far He reflected These men were thieves and murderers as well as gamblers Their fitness for purposes of vengeance was appallingly complete But he preferred not to think of it in detail He put it to himself summarily that he would be paying Heyst out and would at the same time relieve himself of these men s oppression He had only to let loose his natural gift for talking scandalously about his fellow creatures And in this case his great practice in it was assisted by hate which like love has an eloquence of its own With the utmost ease he portrayed for Ricardo now seriously attentive a Heyst fattened by years of private and public rapines the murderer of Morrison the swindler of many shareholders a wonderful mixture of craft and impudence of deep purposes and simple wiles of mystery and futility In this exercise of his natural function Schomberg revived the colour coming back to his face loquacious florid eager his manliness set off by the military bearing That s the exact story He was seen hanging about this part of the world for years spying into everybody s business but I am the only one who has seen through him from the first contemptible double faced stick at nothing dangerous fellow Dangerous is he Schomberg came to himself at the sound of Ricardo s voice Well you know what I mean he said uneasily A lying circumventing soft spoken polite stuck up rascal Nothing open about him mister Ricardo had slipped off the table and was prowling about the room in an oblique noiseless manner He flashed a grin at Schomberg in passing and a snarling Ah H m Well what more dangerous do you want argued Schomberg He s in no way a fighting man I believe he added negligently And you say he has been living alone there Like the man in the moon answered Schomberg readily There s no one that cares a rap what becomes of him He has been lying low you understand after bagging all that plunder Plunder eh Why didn t he go home with it inquired Ricardo The henchman of plain mister Jones was beginning to think that this was something worth looking into And he was pursuing truth in the manner of men of sounder morality and purer intentions than his own that is he pursued it in the light of his own experience and prejudices For facts whatever their origin and God only knows where they come from can be only tested by our own particular suspicions Ricardo was suspicious all round Schomberg such is the tonic of recovered self esteem Schomberg retorted fearlessly Go home Why don t you go home To hear your talk you must have made a pretty considerable pile going round winning people s money You ought to be ready by this time Ricardo stopped to look at Schomberg with surprise You think yourself very clever don t you he said Schomberg just then was so conscious of being clever that the snarling irony left him unmoved There was positively a smile in his noble Teutonic beard the first smile for weeks He was in a felicitous vein How do you know that he wasn t thinking of going home As a matter of fact he was on his way home And how do I know that you are not amusing yourself by spinning out a blamed fairy tale interrupted Ricardo roughly I wonder at myself listening to the silly rot Schomberg received this turn of temper unmoved He did not require to be very subtly observant to notice that he had managed to arouse some sort of feeling perhaps of greed in Ricardo s breast You won t believe me Well You can ask anybody that comes here if that that Swede hadn t got as far as this house on his way home Why should he turn up here if not for that You ask anybody Ask indeed returned the other Catch me asking at large about a man I mean to drop on Such jobs must be done on the quiet or not at all The peculiar intonation of the last phrase touched the nape of Schomberg s neck with a chill He cleared his throat slightly and looked away as though he had heard something indelicate Then with a jump as it were Of course he didn t tell me Is it likely But haven t I got eyes Haven t I got my common sense to tell me I can see through people By the same token he called on the Tesmans Why did he call on the Tesmans two days running eh You don t know You can t tell He waited complacently till Ricardo had finished swearing quite openly at him for a confounded chatterer and then went on A fellow doesn t go to a counting house in business hours for a chat about the weather two days running Then why To close his account with them one day and to get his money out the next Clear what Ricardo with his trick of looking one way and moving another approached Schomberg slowly To get his money he purred Gewiss snapped Schomberg with impatient superiority What else That is only the money he had with the Tesmans What he has buried or put away on the island devil only knows When you think of the lot of hard cash that passed through that man s hands for wages and stores and all that and he s just a cunning thief I tell you Ricardo s hard stare discomposed the hotel keeper and he added in an embarrassed tone I mean a common sneaking thief no account at all And he calls himself a Swedish baron too Tfui He s a baron is he That foreign nobility ain t much commented mister Ricardo seriously And then what He hung about here Yes he hung about said Schomberg making a wry mouth He hung about That s it Hung His voice died out Curiosity was depicted in Ricardo s countenance Just like that for nothing And then turned about and went back to that island again And went back to that island again Schomberg echoed lifelessly fixing his gaze on the floor What s the matter with you asked Ricardo with genuine surprise What is it Schomberg without looking up made an impatient gesture His face was crimson and he kept it lowered Ricardo went back to the point Well but how do you account for it What was his reason What did he go back to the island for Honeymoon spat out Schomberg viciously Perfectly still his eyes downcast he suddenly with no preliminary stir hit the table with his fist a blow which caused the utterly unprepared Ricardo to leap aside And only then did Schomberg look up with a dull resentful expression Ricardo stared hard for a moment spun on his heel walked to the end of the room came back smartly and muttered a profound Ay Ay above Schomberg s rigid head That the hotel keeper was capable of a great moral effort was proved by a gradual return of his severe Lieutenant of the Reserve manner Ay ay repeated Ricardo more deliberately than before and as if after a further survey of the circumstances I wish I hadn t asked you or that you had told me a lie It don t suit me to know that there s a woman mixed up in this affair What s she like It s the girl you Leave off muttered Schomberg utterly pitiful behind his stiff military front Ay ay Ricardo ejaculated for the third time more and more enlightened and perplexed Can t bear to talk about it so bad as that And yet I would bet she isn t a miracle to look at Schomberg made a gesture as if he didn t know as if he didn t care Then he squared his shoulders and frowned at vacancy Swedish baron h m Ricardo continued meditatively I believe the governor would think that business worth looking up quite if I put it to him properly The governor likes a duel if you will call it so but I don t know a man that can stand up to him on the square Have you ever seen a cat play with a mouse It s a pretty sight Ricardo with his voluptuously gleaming eyes and the coy expression looked so much like a cat that Schomberg would have felt all the alarm of a mouse if other feelings had not had complete possession of his breast There are no lies between you and me he said more steadily than he thought he could speak What s the good now He funks women In that Mexican pueblo where we lay grounded on our beef bones so to speak I used to go to dances of an evening The girls there would ask me if the English caballero in the posada was a monk in disguise or if he had taken a vow to the sancissima madre not to speak to a woman or whether You can imagine what fairly free spoken girls will ask when they come to the point of not caring what they say and it used to vex me Yes the governor funks facing women One woman interjected Schomberg in guttural tones One may be more awkward to deal with than two or two hundred for that matter In a place that s full of women you needn t look at them unless you like but if you go into a room where there is only one woman young or old pretty or ugly you have got to face her And unless you are after her then the governor is right enough she s in the way Why notice them muttered Schomberg What can they do Make a noise if nothing else opined mister Ricardo curtly with the distaste of a man whose path is a path of silence for indeed nothing is more odious than a noise when one is engaged in a weighty and absorbing card game Noise noise my friend he went on forcibly confounded screeching about something or other and I like it no more than the governor does But with the governor there s something else besides He can t stand them at all He paused to reflect on this psychological phenomenon and as no philosopher was at hand to tell him that there is no strong sentiment without some terror as there is no real religion without a little fetishism he emitted his own conclusion which surely could not go to the root of the matter I m hanged if I don t think they are to him what liquor is to me Brandy pah He made a disgusted face and produced a genuine shudder Schomberg listened to him in wonder It looked as if the very scoundrelism of that that Swede would protect him the spoil of his iniquity standing between the thief and the retribution That s so old buck Ricardo broke the silence after contemplating Schomberg s mute dejection with a sort of sympathy I don t think this trick will work But that s silly whispered the man deprived of the vengeance which he had seemed already to hold in his hand by a mysterious and exasperating idiosyncrasy Don t you set yourself to judge a gentleman Ricardo without anger administered a moody rebuke Even I can t understand the governor thoroughly And I am an Englishman and his follower No I don t think I care to put it before him sick as I am of staying here Ricardo could not be more sick of staying than Schomberg was of seeing him stay Schomberg believed so firmly in the reality of Heyst as created by his own power of false inferences of his hate of his love of scandal that he could not contain a stifled cry of conviction as sincere as most of our convictions the disguised servants of our passions can appear at a supreme moment It would have been like going to pick up a nugget of a thousand pounds or two or three times as much for all I know No trouble no The petticoat s the trouble Ricardo struck in He had resumed his noiseless feline oblique prowling in which an observer would have detected a new character of excitement such as a wild animal of the cat species anxious to make a spring might betray Schomberg saw nothing It would probably have cheered his drooping spirits but in a general way he preferred not to look at Ricardo Ricardo however with one of his slanting gliding restless glances observed the bitter smile on Schomberg s bearded lips the unmistakable smile of ruined hopes You are a pretty unforgiving sort of chap he said stopping for a moment with an air of interest Hang me if I ever saw anybody look so disappointed I bet you would send black plague to that island if you only knew how eh what Plague too good for them Ha ha ha He bent down to stare at Schomberg who sat unstirring with stony eyes and set features and apparently deaf to the rasping derision of that laughter so close to his red fleshy ear Black plague too good for them ha ha Ricardo pressed the point on the tormented hotel keeper Schomberg kept his eyes down obstinately I don t wish any harm to the girl he muttered But did she bolt from you A fair bilk Come Devil only knows what that villainous Swede had done to her what he promised her how he frightened her She couldn t have cared for him I know Schomberg s vanity clung to the belief in some atrocious extraordinary means of seduction employed by Heyst Look how he bewitched that poor Morrison he murmured Ah Morrison got all his money what Yes and his life Terrible fellow that Swedish baron How is one to get at him Schomberg exploded Three against one Are you shy Do you want me to give you a letter of introduction You ought to look at yourself in a glass Ricardo said quietly Dash me if you don t get a stroke of some kind presently And this is the fellow who says women can do nothing That one will do for you unless you manage to forget her I wish I could Schomberg admitted earnestly And it s all the doing of that Swede I don t get enough sleep mister Ricardo And then to finish me off you gentlemen turn up as if I hadn t enough worry That s done you good suggested the secretary with ironic seriousness Takes your mind off that silly trouble At your age too He checked himself as if in pity and changing his tone I would really like to oblige you while doing a stroke of business at the same time A good stroke insisted Schomberg as if it were mechanically In his simplicity he was not able to give up the idea which had entered his head An idea must be driven out by another idea and with Schomberg ideas were rare and therefore tenacious Minted gold he murmured with a sort of anguish Such an expressive combination of words was not without effect upon Ricardo Both these men were amenable to the influence of verbal suggestions The secretary of plain mister Jones sighed and murmured Yes But how is one to get at it Being three to one said Schomberg I suppose you could get it for the asking One would think the fellow lived next door Ricardo growled impatiently Hang it all can t you understand a plain question I have asked you the way Schomberg seemed to revive The way The torpor of deceived hopes underlying his superficial changes of mood had been pricked by these words which seemed pointed with purpose The way is over the water of course said the hotel keeper For people like you three days in a good big boat is nothing It s no more than a little outing a bit of a change At this season the Java Sea is a pond I have an excellent safe boat a ship s life boat carry thirty let alone three and a child could handle her You wouldn t get a wet face at this time of the year You might call it a pleasure trip And yet having this boat you didn t go after her yourself or after him Well you are a fine fellow for a disappointed lover Schomberg gave a start at the suggestion I am not three men he said sulkily as the shortest answer of the several he could have given Oh I know your sort Ricardo let fall negligently You are like most people or perhaps just a little more peaceable than the rest of the buying and selling gang that bosses this rotten show Well well you respectable citizen he went on let us go thoroughly into the matter When Schomberg had been made to understand that mister Jones s henchman was ready to discuss in his own words this boat of yours with courses and distances and such concrete matters of no good augury to that villainous Swede he recovered his soldierly bearing squared his shoulders and asked in his military manner You wish then to proceed with the business Ricardo nodded He had a great mind to he said A gentleman had to be humoured as much as possible but he must be managed too on occasions for his own good And it was the business of the right sort of follower to know the proper time and the proper methods of that delicate part of his duty Having exposed this theory Ricardo proceeded to the application I ve never actually lied to him he said and I ain t going to now I shall just say nothing about the girl He will have to get over the shock the best he can Hang it all Too much humouring won t do here Funny thing Schomberg observed crisply Is it Ay you wouldn t mind taking a woman by the throat in some dark corner and nobody by I bet Ricardo s dreadful vicious cat like readiness to get his claws out at any moment startled Schomberg as usual But it was provoking too And you he defended himself Don t you want me to believe you are up to anything I my boy Oh yes I am not that gentleman neither are you Take em by the throat or chuck em under the chin is all one to me almost affirmed Ricardo with something obscurely ironical in his complacency Now as to this business A three days jaunt in a good boat isn t a thing to frighten people like us You are right so far but there are other details Schomberg was ready enough to enter into details He explained that he had a small plantation with a fairly habitable hut on it on Madura He proposed that his guest should start from town in his boat as if going for an excursion to that rural spot The custom house people on the quay were used to see his boat go off on such trips From Madura after some repose and on a convenient day mister Jones and party would make the real start It would all be plain sailing Schomberg undertook to provision the boat The greatest hardship the voyagers need apprehend would be a mild shower of rain At that season of the year there were no serious thunderstorms Schomberg s heart began to thump as he saw himself nearing his vengeance His speech was thick but persuasive No risk at all none whatever Ricardo dismissed these assurances of safety with an impatient gesture He was thinking of other risks The getting away from here is all right but we may be sighted at sea and that may bring awkwardness later on A ship s boat with three white men in her knocking about out of sight of land is bound to make talk Are we likely to be seen on our way No unless by native craft said Schomberg Ricardo nodded satisfied Both these white men looked on native life as a mere play of shadows A play of shadows the dominant race could walk through unaffected and disregarded in the pursuit of its incomprehensible aims and needs No Native craft did not count of course It was an empty solitary part of the sea Schomberg expounded further Only the Ternate mail boat crossed that region about the eighth of every month regularly nowhere near the island though Rigid his voice hoarse his heart thumping his mind concentrated on the success of his plan the hotel keeper multiplied words as if to keep as many of them as possible between himself and the murderous aspect of his purpose So if you gentlemen depart from my plantation quietly at sunset on the eighth always best to make a start at night with a land breeze it s a hundred to one What am I saying it s a thousand to one that no human eye will see you on the passage All you ve got to do is keep her heading north east for say fifty hours perhaps not quite so long There will always be draft enough to keep a boat moving you may reckon on that and then The muscles about his waist quivered under his clothes with eagerness with impatience and with something like apprehension the true nature of which was not clear to him And he did not want to investigate it Ricardo regarded him steadily with those dry eyes of his shining more like polished stones than living tissue And then what he asked And then why you will astonish der herr baron ha ha Schomberg seemed to force the words and the laugh out of himself in a hoarse bass And you believe he has all that plunder by him asked Ricardo rather perfunctorily because the fact seemed to him extremely probable when looked at all round by his acute mind Schomberg raised his hands and lowered them slowly How can it be otherwise He was going home he was on his way in this hotel Ask people Was it likely he would leave it behind him Ricardo was thoughtful Then suddenly raising his head he remarked Steer north east for fifty hours eh That s not much of a sailing direction I ve heard of a port being missed before on better information Can t you say what sort of landfall a fellow may expect But I suppose you have never seen that island yourself Schomberg admitted that he had not seen it in a tone in which a man congratulates himself on having escaped the contamination of an unsavoury experience No certainly not He had never had any business to call there But what of that He could give mister Ricardo as good a sea mark as anybody need wish for He laughed nervously Miss it He defied anyone that came within forty miles of it to miss the retreat of that villainous Swede What do you think of a pillar of smoke by day and a loom of fire at night There s a volcano in full blast near that island enough to guide almost a blind man What more do you want An active volcano to steer by These last words he roared out exultingly then jumped up and glared The door to the left of the bar had swung open and missus Schomberg dressed for duty stood facing him down the whole length of the room She clung to the handle for a moment then came in and glided to her place where she sat down to stare straight before her as usual PART THREE CHAPTER ONE Tropical nature had been kind to the failure of the commercial enterprise The desolation of the headquarters of the Tropical Belt Coal Company had been screened from the side of the sea from the side where prying eyes if any were sufficiently interested either in malice or in sorrow could have noted the decaying bones of that once sanguine enterprise Heyst had been sitting among the bones buried so kindly in the grass of two wet seasons growth The silence of his surroundings broken only by such sounds as a distant roll of thunder the lash of rain through the foliage of some big trees the noise of the wind tossing the leaves of the forest and of the short seas breaking against the shore favoured rather than hindered his solitary meditation A meditation is always in a white man at least more or less an interrogative exercise Heyst meditated in simple terms on the mystery of his actions and he answered himself with the honest reflection There must be a lot of the original Adam in me after all He reflected too with the sense of making a discovery that this primeval ancestor is not easily suppressed The oldest voice in the world is just the one that never ceases to speak If anybody could have silenced its imperative echoes it should have been Heyst s father with his contemptuous inflexible negation of all effort but apparently he could not There was in the son a lot of that first ancestor who as soon as he could uplift his muddy frame from the celestial mould started inspecting and naming the animals of that paradise which he was so soon to lose Action the first thought or perhaps the first impulse on earth The barbed hook baited with the illusions of progress to bring out of the lightless void the shoals of unnumbered generations And I the son of my father have been caught too like the silliest fish of them all Heyst said to himself He suffered He was hurt by the sight of his own life which ought to have been a masterpiece of aloofness He remembered always his last evening with his father He remembered the thin features the great mass of white hair and the ivory complexion A five branched candlestick stood on a little table by the side of the easy chair They had been talking a long time The noises of the street had died out one by one till at last in the moonlight the London houses began to look like the tombs of an unvisited unhonoured cemetery of hopes He had listened Then after a silence he had asked for he was really young then Is there no guidance His father was in an unexpectedly soft mood on that night when the moon swam in a cloudless sky over the begrimed shadows of the town You still believe in something then he said in a clear voice which had been growing feeble of late You believe in flesh and blood perhaps A full and equable contempt would soon do away with that too But since you have not attained to it I advise you to cultivate that form of contempt which is called pity It is perhaps the least difficult always remembering that you too if you are anything are as pitiful as the rest yet never expecting any pity for yourself What is one to do then sighed the young man regarding his father rigid in the high backed chair Look on make no sound were the last words of the man who had spent his life in blowing blasts upon a terrible trumpet which filled heaven and earth with ruins while mankind went on its way unheeding That very night he died in his bed so quietly that they found him in his usual attitude of sleep lying on his side one hand under his cheek and his knees slightly bent He had not even straightened his legs His son buried the silenced destroyer of systems of hopes of beliefs He observed that the death of that bitter contemner of life did not trouble the flow of life s stream where men and women go by thick as dust revolving and jostling one another like figures cut out of cork and weighted with lead just sufficiently to keep them in their proudly upright posture After the funeral Heyst sat alone in the dusk and his meditation took the form of a definite vision of the stream of the fatuously jostling nodding spinning figures hurried irresistibly along and giving no sign of being aware that the voice on the bank had been suddenly silenced Yes A few obituary notices generally insignificant and some grossly abusive The son had read them all with mournful detachment This is the hate and rage of their fear he thought to himself and also of wounded vanity They shriek their little shriek as they fly past I suppose I ought to hate him too He became aware of his eyes being wet It was not that the man was his father For him it was purely a matter of hearsay which could not in itself cause this emotion No It was because he had looked at him so long that he missed him so much The dead man had kept him on the bank by his side And now Heyst felt acutely that he was alone on the bank of the stream In his pride he determined not to enter it A few slow tears rolled down his face The rooms filling with shadows seemed haunted by a melancholy uneasy presence which could not express itself The young man got up with a strange sense of making way for something impalpable that claimed possession went out of the house and locked the door A fortnight later he started on his travels to look on and never make a sound The elder Heyst had left behind him a little money and a certain quantity of movable objects such as books tables chairs and pictures which might have complained of heartless desertion after many years of faithful service for there is a soul in things Heyst our Heyst had often thought of them reproachful and mute shrouded and locked up in those rooms far away in London with the sounds of the street reaching them faintly and sometimes a little sunshine when the blinds were pulled up and the windows opened from time to time in pursuance of his original instructions and later reminders It seemed as if in his conception of a world not worth touching and perhaps not substantial enough to grasp these objects familiar to his childhood and his youth and associated with the memory of an old man were the only realities something having an absolute existence He would never have them sold or even moved from the places they occupied when he looked upon them last When he was advised from London that his lease had expired and that the house with some others as like it as two peas was to be demolished he was surprisingly distressed He had entered by then the broad human path of inconsistencies Already the Tropical Belt Coal Company was in existence He sent instructions to have some of the things sent out to him at Samburan just as any ordinary credulous person would have done They came torn out from their long repose a lot of books some chairs and tables his father s portrait in oils which surprised Heyst by its air of youth because he remembered his father as a much older man a lot of small objects such as candlesticks inkstands and statuettes from his father s study which surprised him because they looked so old and so much worn The manager of the Tropical Belt Coal Company unpacking them on the veranda in the shade besieged by a fierce sunshine must have felt like a remorseful apostate before these relics He handled them tenderly and it was perhaps their presence there which attached him to the island when he woke up to the failure of his apostasy Whatever the decisive reason Heyst had remained where another would have been glad to be off The excellent Davidson had discovered the fact without discovering the reason and took a humane interest in Heyst s strange existence while at the same time his native delicacy kept him from intruding on the other s whim of solitude He could not possibly guess that Heyst alone on the island felt neither more nor less lonely than in any other place desert or populous Davidson s concern was if one may express it so the danger of spiritual starvation but this was a spirit which had renounced all outside nourishment and was sustaining itself proudly on its own contempt of the usual coarse ailments which life offers to the common appetites of men Neither was Heyst s body in danger of starvation as Schomberg had so confidently asserted At the beginning of the company s operations the island had been provisioned in a manner which had outlasted the need Heyst did not need to fear hunger and his very loneliness had not been without some alleviation Of the crowd of imported Chinese labourers one at least had remained in Samburan solitary and strange like a swallow left behind at the migrating season of his tribe Wang was not a common coolie He had been a servant to white men before The agreement between him and Heyst consisted in the exchange of a few words on the day when the last batch of the mine coolies was leaving Samburan Heyst leaning over the balustrade of the veranda was looking on as calm in appearance as though he had never departed from the doctrine that this world for the wise is nothing but an amusing spectacle Wang came round the house and standing below raised up his yellow thin face All finished he asked Heyst nodded slightly from above glancing towards the jetty A crowd of blue clad figures with yellow faces and calves was being hustled down into the boats of the chartered steamer lying well out like a painted ship on a painted sea painted in crude colours without shadows without feeling with brutal precision You had better hurry up if you don t want to be left behind But the Chinaman did not move We stop he declared Heyst looked down at him for the first time You want to stop here Yes What were you What was your work here Mess loom boy Do you want to stay with me here as my boy inquired Heyst surprised The Chinaman unexpectedly put on a deprecatory expression and said after a marked pause Can do You needn t said Heyst unless you like I propose to stay on here it may be for a very long time I have no power to make you go if you wish to remain but I don t see why you should Catchee one piecee wife remarked Wang unemotionally and marched off turning his back on the wharf and the great world beyond represented by the steamer waiting for her boats Heyst learned presently that Wang had persuaded one of the women of Alfuro village on the west shore of the island beyond the central ridge to come over to live with him in a remote part of the company s clearing It was a curious case inasmuch as the Alfuros having been frightened by the sudden invasion of Chinamen had blocked the path over the ridge by felling a few trees and had kept strictly on their own side The coolies as a body mistrusting the manifest mildness of these harmless fisher folk had kept to their lines without attempting to cross the island Wang was the brilliant exception He must have been uncommonly fascinating in a way that was not apparent to Heyst or else uncommonly persuasive The woman s services to Heyst were limited to the fact that she had anchored Wang to the spot by her charms which remained unknown to the white man because she never came near the houses The couple lived at the edge of the forest and she could sometimes be seen gazing towards the bungalow shading her eyes with her hand Even from a distance she appeared to be a shy wild creature and Heyst anxious not to try her primitive nerves unduly scrupulously avoided that side of the clearing in his strolls The day or rather the first night after his hermit life began he was aware of vague sounds of revelry in that direction Emboldened by the departure of the invading strangers some Alfuros the woman s friends and relations had ventured over the ridge to attend something in the nature of a wedding feast Wang had invited them But this was the only occasion when any sound louder than the buzzing of insects had troubled the profound silence of the clearing The natives were never invited again Wang not only knew how to live according to conventional proprieties but had strong personal views as to the manner of arranging his domestic existence After a time Heyst perceived that Wang had annexed all the keys Any keys left lying about vanished after Wang had passed that way Subsequently some of them those that did not belong to the store rooms and the empty bungalows and could not be regarded as the common property of this community of two were returned to Heyst tied in a bunch with a piece of string He found them one morning lying by the side of his plate He had not been inconvenienced by their absence because he never locked up anything in the way of drawers and boxes Heyst said nothing Wang also said nothing Perhaps he had always been a taciturn man perhaps he was influenced by the genius of the locality which was certainly that of silence Till Heyst and Morrison had landed in Black Diamond Bay and named it that side of Samburan had hardly ever heard the sound of human speech It was easy to be taciturn with Heyst who had plunged himself into an abyss of meditation over books and remained in it till the shadow of Wang falling across the page and the sound of a rough low voice uttering the Malay word makan would force him to climb out to a meal Wang in his native province in China might have been an aggressively sensitively genial person but in Samburan he had clothed himself in a mysterious stolidity and did not seem to resent not being spoken to except in single words at a rate which did not average half a dozen per day And he gave no more than he got It is to be presumed that if he suffered he made up for it with the Alfuro woman He always went back to her at the first fall of dusk vanishing from the bungalow suddenly at this hour like a sort of topsy turvy day hunting Chinese ghost with a white jacket and a pigtail Presently giving way to a Chinaman s ruling passion he could be observed breaking the ground near his hut between the mighty stumps of felled trees with a miner s pickaxe After a time he discovered a rusty but serviceable spade in one of the empty store rooms and it is to be supposed that he got on famously but nothing of it could be seen because he went to the trouble of pulling to pieces one of the company s sheds in order to get materials for making a high and very close fence round his patch as if the growing of vegetables were a patented process or an awful and holy mystery entrusted to the keeping of his race Heyst following from a distance the progress of Wang s gardening and of these precautions there was nothing else to look at was amused at the thought that he in his own person represented the market for its produce The Chinaman had found several packets of seeds in the store rooms and had surrendered to an irresistible impulse to put them into the ground He would make his master pay for the vegetables which he was raising to satisfy his instinct And looking silently at the silent Wang going about his work in the bungalow in his unhasty steady way Heyst envied the Chinaman s obedience to his instincts the powerful simplicity of purpose which made his existence appear almost automatic in the mysterious precision of its facts CHAPTER TWO During his master s absence at Sourabaya Wang had busied himself with the ground immediately in front of the principal bungalow Emerging from the fringe of grass growing across the shore end of the coal jetty Heyst beheld a broad clear space black and level with only one or two clumps of charred twigs where the flame had swept from the front of his house to the nearest trees of the forest You took the risk of firing the grass Heyst asked Wang nodded Hanging on the arm of the white man before whom he stood was the girl called Alma but neither from the Chinaman s eyes nor from his expression could anyone have guessed that he was in the slightest degree aware of the fact He has been tidying the place in his labour saving way explained Heyst without looking at the girl whose hand rested on his forearm He s the whole establishment you see I told you I hadn t even a dog to keep me company here Wang had marched off towards the wharf He s like those waiters in that place she said That place was Schomberg s hotel One Chinaman looks very much like another Heyst remarked We shall find it useful to have him here This is the house They faced at some distance the six shallow steps leading up to the veranda The girl had abandoned Heyst s arm This is the house he repeated She did not offer to budge away from his side but stood staring fixedly at the steps as if they had been something unique and impracticable He waited a little but she did not move Don t you want to go in he asked without turning his head to look at her The sun s too heavy to stand about here He tried to overcome a sort of fear a sort of impatient faintness and his voice sounded rough You had better go in he concluded They both moved then but at the foot of the stairs Heyst stopped while the girl went on rapidly as if nothing could stop her now She crossed the veranda swiftly and entered the twilight of the big central room opening upon it and then the deeper twilight of the room beyond She stood still in the dusk in which her dazzled eyes could scarcely make out the forms of objects and sighed a sigh of relief The impression of the sunlight of sea and sky remained with her like a memory of a painful trial gone through done with at last Meanwhile Heyst had walked back slowly towards the jetty but he did not get so far as that The practical and automatic Wang had got hold of one of the little trucks that had been used for running baskets of coal alongside ships He appeared pushing it before him loaded lightly with Heyst s bag and the bundle of the girl s belongings wrapped in missus Schomberg s shawl Heyst turned about and walked by the side of the rusty rails on which the truck ran Opposite the house Wang stopped lifted the bag to his shoulder balanced it carefully and then took the bundle in his hand Leave those things on the table in the big room understand Me savee grunted Wang moving off Heyst watched the Chinaman disappear from the veranda It was not till he had seen Wang come out that he himself entered the twilight of the big room By that time Wang was out of sight at the back of the house but by no means out of hearing The Chinaman could hear the voice of him who when there were many people there was generally referred to as Number One Wang was not able to understand the words but the tone interested him Where are you cried Number One Then Wang heard much more faint a voice he had never heard before a novel impression which he acknowledged by cocking his head slightly to one side I am here out of the sun The new voice sounded remote and uncertain Wang heard nothing more though he waited for some time very still the top of his shaven poll exactly level with the floor of the back veranda His face meanwhile preserved an inscrutable immobility Suddenly he stooped to pick up the lid of a deal candle box which was lying on the ground by his foot Breaking it up with his fingers he directed his steps towards the cook shed where squatting on his heels he proceeded to kindle a small fire under a very sooty kettle possibly to make tea Wang had some knowledge of the more superficial rites and ceremonies of white men s existence otherwise so enigmatically remote to his mind and containing unexpected possibilities of good and evil which had to be watched for with prudence and care CHAPTER THREE That morning as on all the others of the full tale of mornings since his return with the girl to Samburan Heyst came out on the veranda and spread his elbows on the railing in an easy attitude of proprietorship The bulk of the central ridge of the island cut off the bungalow from sunrises whether glorious or cloudy angry or serene The dwellers therein were debarred from reading early the fortune of the new born day It sprang upon them in its fulness with a swift retreat of the great shadow when the sun clearing the ridge looked down hot and dry with a devouring glare like the eye of an enemy But Heyst once the Number One of this locality while it was comparatively teeming with mankind appreciated the prolongation of early coolness the subdued lingering half light the faint ghost of the departed night the fragrance of its dewy dark soul captured for a moment longer between the great glow of the sky and the intense blaze of the uncovered sea It was naturally difficult for Heyst to keep his mind from dwelling on the nature and consequences of this his latest departure from the part of an unconcerned spectator Yet he had retained enough of his wrecked philosophy to prevent him from asking himself consciously how it would end But at the same time he could not help being temperamentally from long habit and from set purpose a spectator still perhaps a little less naive but as he discovered with some surprise not much more far sighted than the common run of men Like the rest of us who act all he could say to himself with a somewhat affected grimness was We shall see This mood of grim doubt intruded on him only when he was alone There were not many such moments in his day now and he did not like them when they came On this morning he had no time to grow uneasy Alma came out to join him long before the sun rising above the Samburan ridge swept the cool shadow of the early morning and the remnant of the night s coolness clear off the roof under which they had dwelt for more than three months already She came out as on other mornings He had heard her light footsteps in the big room the room where he had unpacked the cases from London the room now lined with the backs of books halfway up on its three sides Above the cases the fine matting met the ceiling of tightly stretched white calico In the dusk and coolness nothing gleamed except the gilt frame of the portrait of Heyst s father signed by a famous painter lonely in the middle of a wall Heyst did not turn round Do you know what I was thinking of he asked No she said Her tone betrayed always a shade of anxiety as though she were never certain how a conversation with him would end She leaned on the guard rail by his side No she repeated What was it She waited Then rather with reluctance than shyness she asked Were you thinking of me I was wondering when you would come out said Heyst still without looking at the girl to whom after several experimental essays in combining detached letters and loose syllables he had given the name of Lena She remarked after a pause I was not very far from you Apparently you were not near enough for me You could have called if you wanted me she said And I wasn t so long doing my hair Apparently it was too long for me Well you were thinking of me anyhow I am glad of it Do you know it seems to me somehow that if you were to stop thinking of me I shouldn t be in the world at all He turned round and looked at her She often said things which surprised him A vague smile faded away on her lips before his scrutiny What is it he asked Is it a reproach A reproach Why how could it be she defended herself Well what did it mean he insisted What I said just what I said Why aren t you fair Ah this is at least a reproach She coloured to the roots of her hair It looks as if you were trying to make out that I am disagreeable she murmured Am I You will make me afraid to open my mouth presently I shall end by believing I am no good Her head drooped a little He looked at her smooth low brow the faintly coloured cheeks and the red lips parted slightly with the gleam of her teeth within And then I won t be any good she added with conviction That I won t I can only be what you think I am He made a slight movement She put her hand on his arm without raising her head and went on her voice animated in the stillness of her body It is so It couldn t be any other way with a girl like me and a man like you Here we are we two alone and I can t even tell where we are A very well known spot of the globe Heyst uttered gently There must have been at least fifty thousand circulars issued at the time a hundred and fifty thousand more likely My friend was looking after that and his ideas were large and his belief very strong Of us two it was he who had the faith A hundred and fifty thousand certainly What is it you mean she asked in a low tone What should I find fault with you for Heyst went on For being amiable good gracious and pretty A silence fell Then she said It s all right that you should think that of me There s no one here to think anything of us good or bad The rare timbre of her voice gave a special value to what she uttered The indefinable emotion which certain intonations gave him he was aware was more physical than moral Every time she spoke to him she seemed to abandon to him something of herself something excessively subtle and inexpressible to which he was infinitely sensible which he would have missed horribly if she were to go away While he was looking into her eyes she raised her bare forearm out of the short sleeve and held it in the air till he noticed it and hastened to pose his great bronze moustaches on the whiteness of the skin Then they went in Wang immediately appeared in front and squatting on his heels began to potter mysteriously about some plants at the foot of the veranda When Heyst and the girl came out again the Chinaman had gone in his peculiar manner which suggested vanishing out of existence rather than out of sight a process of evaporation rather than of movement They descended the steps looking at each other and started off smartly across the cleared ground but they were not ten yards away when without perceptible stir or sound Wang materialized inside the empty room The Chinaman stood still with roaming eyes examining the walls as if for signs for inscriptions exploring the floor as if for pitfalls for dropped coins Then he cocked his head slightly at the profile of Heyst s father pen in hand above a white sheet of paper on a crimson tablecloth and moving forward noiselessly began to clear away the breakfast things Though he proceeded without haste the unerring precision of his movements the absolute soundlessness of the operation gave it something of the quality of a conjuring trick And the trick having been performed Wang vanished from the scene to materialize presently in front of the house He materialized walking away from it with no visible or guessable intention but at the end of some ten paces he stopped made a half turn and put his hand up to shade his eyes The sun had topped the grey ridge of Samburan The great morning shadow was gone and far away in the devouring sunshine Wang was in time to see Number One and the woman two remote white specks against the sombre line of the forest In a moment they vanished With the smallest display of action Wang also vanished from the sunlight of the clearing Heyst and Lena entered the shade of the forest path which crossed the island and which near its highest point had been blocked by felled trees But their intention was not to go so far After keeping to the path for some distance they left it at a point where the forest was bare of undergrowth and the trees festooned with creepers stood clear of one another in the gloom of their own making Here and there great splashes of light lay on the ground They moved silent in the great stillness breathing the calmness the infinite isolation the repose of a slumber without dreams They emerged at the upper limit of vegetation among some rocks and in a depression of the sharp slope like a small platform they turned about and looked from on high over the sea lonely its colour effaced by sunshine its horizon a heat mist a mere unsubstantial shimmer in the pale and blinding infinity overhung by the darker blaze of the sky It makes my head swim the girl murmured shutting her eyes and putting her hand on his shoulder Heyst gazing fixedly to the southward exclaimed Sail ho A moment of silence ensued It must be very far away he went on I don t think you could see it Some native craft making for the Moluccas probably Come we mustn t stay here With his arm round her waist he led her down a little distance and they settled themselves in the shade she seated on the ground he a little lower reclining at her feet You don t like to look at the sea from up there he said after a time She shook her head That empty space was to her the abomination of desolation But she only said again It makes my head swim Too big he inquired Too lonely It makes my heart sink too she added in a low voice as if confessing a secret I m afraid said Heyst that you would be justified in reproaching me for these sensations But what would you have His tone was playful but his eyes directed at her face were serious She protested I am not feeling lonely with you not a bit It is only when we come up to that place and I look at all that water and all that light We will never come here again then he interrupted her She remained silent for a while returning his gaze till he removed it It seems as if everything that there is had gone under she said Reminds you of the story of the deluge muttered the man stretched at her feet and looking at them Are you frightened at it I should be rather frightened to be left behind alone When I say I of course I mean we Do you Heyst remained silent for a while The vision of a world destroyed he mused aloud Would you be sorry for it I should be sorry for the happy people in it she said simply His gaze travelled up her figure and reached her face where he seemed to detect the veiled glow of intelligence as one gets a glimpse of the sun through the clouds I should have thought it s they specially who ought to have been congratulated Don t you Oh yes I understand what you mean but there were forty days before it was all over You seem to be in possession of all the details Heyst spoke just to say something rather than to gaze at her in silence She was not looking at him Sunday school she murmured I went regularly from the time I was eight till I was thirteen We lodged in the north of London off Kingsland Road It wasn t a bad time Father was earning good money then The woman of the house used to pack me off in the afternoon with her own girls She was a good woman Her husband was in the post office Sorter or something Such a quiet man He used to go off after supper for night duty sometimes Then one day they had a row and broke up the home I remember I cried when we had to pack up all of a sudden and go into other lodgings I never knew what it was though The deluge muttered Heyst absently He felt intensely aware of her personality as if this were the first moment of leisure he had found to look at her since they had come together The peculiar timbre of her voice with its modulations of audacity and sadness would have given interest to the most inane chatter But she was no chatterer She was rather silent with a capacity for immobility an upright stillness as when resting on the concert platform between the musical numbers her feet crossed her hands reposing on her lap But in the intimacy of their life her grey unabashed gaze forced upon him the sensation of something inexplicable reposing within her stupidity or inspiration weakness or force or simply an abysmal emptiness reserving itself even in the moments of complete surrender During a long pause she did not look at him Then suddenly as if the word deluge had stuck in her mind she asked looking up at the cloudless sky Does it ever rain here There is a season when it rains almost every day said Heyst surprised There are also thunderstorms We once had a mud shower Mud shower Our neighbour there was shooting up ashes He sometimes clears his red hot gullet like that and a thunderstorm came along at the same time It was very messy but our neighbour is generally well behaved just smokes quietly as he did that day when I first showed you the smudge in the sky from the schooner s deck He s a good natured lazy fellow of a volcano I saw a mountain smoking like that before she said staring at the slender stem of a tree fern some dozen feet in front of her It wasn t very long after we left England some few days though I was so ill at first that I lost count of days A smoking mountain I can t think how they called it Vesuvius perhaps suggested Heyst That s the name I saw it too years ages ago said Heyst On your way here No long before I ever thought of coming into this part of the world I was yet a boy She turned and looked at him attentively as if seeking to discover some trace of that boyhood in the mature face of the man with the hair thin at the top and the long thick moustaches Heyst stood the frank examination with a playful smile hiding the profound effect these veiled grey eyes produced whether on his heart or on his nerves whether sensuous or spiritual tender or irritating he was unable to say Well princess of Samburan he said at last have I found favour in your sight She seemed to wake up and shook her head I was thinking she murmured very low Thought action so many snares If you begin to think you will be unhappy I wasn t thinking of myself she declared with a simplicity which took Heyst aback somewhat On the lips of a moralist this would sound like a rebuke he said half seriously but I won t suspect you of being one Moralists and I haven t been friends for many years She had listened with an air of attention I understood you had no friends she said I am pleased that there s nobody to find fault with you for what you have done I like to think that I am in no one s way Heyst would have said something but she did not give him time Unconscious of the movement he made she went on What I was thinking to myself was why are you here Heyst let himself sink on his elbow again If by you you mean we well you know why we are here She bent her gaze down at him No it isn t that I meant before all that time before you came across me and guessed at once that I was in trouble with no one to turn to And you know it was desperate trouble too Her voice fell on the last words as if she would end there but there was something so expectant in Heyst s attitude as he sat at her feet looking up at her steadily that she continued after drawing a short quick breath It was really I told you I had been worried before by bad fellows It made me unhappy disturbed angry too But oh how I hated hated hated that man That man was the florid Schomberg with the military bearing benefactor of white men decent food to eat in decent company mature victim of belated passion The girl shuddered The characteristic harmoniousness of her face became as it were decomposed for an instant Heyst was startled Why think of it now he cried It s because I was cornered that time It wasn t as before It was worse ever so much I wished I could die of my fright and yet it s only now that I begin to understand what a horror it might have been Yes only now since we Heyst stirred a little Came here he finished Her tenseness relaxed her flushed face went gradually back to its normal tint Yes she said indifferently but at the same time she gave him a stealthy glance of passionate appreciation and then her face took on a melancholy cast her whole figure drooped imperceptibly But you were coming back here anyhow she asked Yes I was only waiting for Davidson Yes I was coming back here to these ruins to Wang who perhaps did not expect to see me again It s impossible to guess at the way that Chinaman draws his conclusions and how he looks upon one Don t talk about him He makes me feel uncomfortable Talk about yourself About myself I see you are still busy with the mystery of my existence here but it isn t at all mysterious Primarily the man with the quill pen in his hand in that picture you so often look at is responsible for my existence He is also responsible for what my existence is or rather has been He was a great man in his way I don t know much of his history I suppose he began like other people took fine words for good ringing coin and noble ideals for valuable banknotes He was a great master of both himself by the way Later he discovered how am I to explain it to you Suppose the world were a factory and all mankind workmen in it Well he discovered that the wages were not good enough That they were paid in counterfeit money I see the girl said slowly Do you Heyst who had been speaking as if to himself looked up curiously It wasn t a new discovery but he brought his capacity for scorn to bear on it It was immense It ought to have withered this globe I don t know how many minds he convinced But my mind was very young then and youth I suppose can be easily seduced even by a negation He was very ruthless and yet he was not without pity He dominated me without difficulty A heartless man could not have done so Even to fools he was not utterly merciless He could be indignant but he was too great for flouts and jeers What he said was not meant for the crowd it could not be and I was flattered to find myself among the elect They read his books but I have heard his living word It was irresistible It was as if that mind were taking me into its confidence giving me a special insight into its mastery of despair Mistake no doubt There is something of my father in every man who lives long enough But they don t say anything They can t They wouldn t know how or perhaps they wouldn t speak if they could Man on this earth is an unforeseen accident which does not stand close investigation However that particular man died as quietly as a child goes to sleep But after listening to him I could not take my soul down into the street to fight there I started off to wander about an independent spectator if that is possible For a long time the girl s grey eyes had been watching his face She discovered that addressing her he was really talking to himself Heyst looked up caught sight of her as it were and caught himself up with a low laugh and a change of tone All this does not tell you why I ever came here Why indeed It s like prying into inscrutable mysteries which are not worth scrutinizing A man drifts The most successful men have drifted into their successes I don t want to tell you that this is a success You wouldn t believe me if I did It isn t neither is it the ruinous failure it looks It proves nothing unless perhaps some hidden weakness in my character and even that is not certain He looked fixedly at her and with such grave eyes that she felt obliged to smile faintly at him since she did not understand what he meant Her smile was reflected still fainter on his lips This does not advance you much in your inquiry he went on And in truth your question is unanswerable but facts have a certain positive value and I will tell you a fact One day I met a cornered man I use the word because it expresses the man s situation exactly and because you just used it yourself You know what that means What do you say she whispered astounded A man Heyst laughed at her wondering eyes No No I mean in his own way I knew very well it couldn t be anything like that she observed under her breath I won t bother you with the story It was a custom house affair strange as it may sound to you He would have preferred to be killed outright that is to have his soul dispatched to another world rather than to be robbed of his substance his very insignificant substance in this I saw that he believed in another world because being cornered as I have told you he went down on his knees and prayed What do you think of that Heyst paused She looked at him earnestly You didn t make fun of him for that she said Heyst made a brusque movement of protest My dear girl I am not a ruffian he cried Then returning to his usual tone I didn t even have to conceal a smile Somehow it didn t look a smiling matter No it was not funny it was rather pathetic he was so representative of all the past victims of the Great Joke But it is by folly alone that the world moves and so it is a respectable thing upon the whole And besides he was what one would call a good man I don t mean especially because he had offered up a prayer No He was really a decent fellow he was quite unfitted for this world he was a failure a good man cornered a sight for the gods for no decent mortal cares to look at that sort A thought seemed to occur to him He turned his face to the girl And you who have been cornered too did you think of offering a prayer Neither her eyes nor a single one of her features moved the least bit She only let fall the words I am not what they call a good girl That sounds evasive said Heyst after a short silence Well the good fellow did pray and after he had confessed to it I was struck by the comicality of the situation No don t misunderstand me I am not alluding to his act of course And even the idea of Eternity Infinity Omnipotence being called upon to defeat the conspiracy of two miserable Portuguese half castes did not move my mirth From the point of view of the supplicant the danger to be conjured was something like the end of the world or worse No What captivated my fancy was that I Axel Heyst the most detached of creatures in this earthly captivity the veriest tramp on this earth an indifferent stroller going through the world s bustle that I should have been there to step into the situation of an agent of Providence I a man of universal scorn and unbelief You are putting it on she interrupted in her seductive voice with a coaxing intonation No I am not like that born or fashioned or both I am not for nothing the son of my father of that man in the painting I am he all but the genius And there is even less in me than I make out because the very scorn is falling away from me year after year I have never been so amused as by that episode in which I was suddenly called to act such an incredible part For a moment I enjoyed it greatly It got him out of his corner you know You saved a man for fun is that what you mean Just for fun Why this tone of suspicion remonstrated Heyst I suppose the sight of this particular distress was disagreeable to me What you call fun came afterwards when it dawned on me that I was for him a walking breathing incarnate proof of the efficacy of prayer I was a little fascinated by it and then could I have argued with him You don t argue against such evidence and besides it would have looked as if I had wanted to claim all the merit Already his gratitude was simply frightful Funny position wasn t it The boredom came later when we lived together on board his ship I had in a moment of inadvertence created for myself a tie How to define it precisely I don t know One gets attached in a way to people one has done something for But is that friendship I am not sure what it was I only know that he who forms a tie is lost The germ of corruption has entered into his soul Heyst s tone was light with the flavour of playfulness which seasoned all his speeches and seemed to be of the very essence of his thoughts The girl he had come across of whom he had possessed himself to whose presence he was not yet accustomed with whom he did not yet know how to live that human being so near and still so strange gave him a greater sense of his own reality than he had ever known in all his life CHAPTER FOUR With her knees drawn up Lena rested her elbows on them and held her head in both her hands Are you tired of sitting here Heyst asked An almost imperceptible negative movement of the head was all the answer she made Why are you looking so serious he pursued and immediately thought that habitual seriousness in the long run was much more bearable than constant gaiety However this expression suits you exceedingly he added not diplomatically but because by the tendency of his taste it was a true statement And as long as I can be certain that it is not boredom which gives you this severe air I am willing to sit here and look at you till you are ready to go And this was true He was still under the fresh sortilege of their common life the surprise of novelty the flattered vanity of his possession of this woman for a man must feel that unless he has ceased to be masculine Her eyes moved in his direction rested on him then returned to their stare into the deeper gloom at the foot of the straight tree trunks whose spreading crowns were slowly withdrawing their shade The warm air stirred slightly about her motionless head She would not look at him from some obscure fear of betraying herself She felt in her innermost depths an irresistible desire to give herself up to him more completely by some act of absolute sacrifice This was something of which he did not seem to have an idea He was a strange being without needs She felt his eyes fixed upon her and as he kept silent she said uneasily for she didn t know what his silences might mean And so you lived with that friend that good man Excellent fellow Heyst responded with a readiness that she did not expect But it was a weakness on my part I really didn t want to only he wouldn t let me off and I couldn t explain He was the sort of man to whom you can t explain anything He was extremely sensitive and it would have been a tigerish thing to do to mangle his delicate feelings by the sort of plain speaking that would have been necessary His mind was like a white walled pure chamber furnished with say six straw bottomed chairs and he was always placing and displacing them in various combinations But they were always the same chairs He was extremely easy to live with but then he got hold of this coal idea or rather the idea got hold of him it entered into that scantily furnished chamber of which I have just spoken and sat on all the chairs There was no dislodging it you know It was going to make his fortune my fortune everybody s fortune In past years in moments of doubt that will come to a man determined to remain free from absurdities of existence I often asked myself with a momentary dread in what way would life try to get hold of me And this was the way He got it into his head that he could do nothing without me And was I now he asked me to spurn and ruin him Well one morning I wonder if he had gone down on his knees to pray that night one morning I gave in Heyst tugged violently at a tuft of dried grass and cast it away from him with a nervous gesture I gave in he repeated Looking towards him with a movement of her eyes only the girl noticed the strong feeling on his face with that intense interest which his person awakened in her mind and in her heart But it soon passed away leaving only a moody expression It s difficult to resist where nothing matters he observed And perhaps there is a grain of freakishness in my nature It amused me to go about uttering silly commonplace phrases I was never so well thought of in the islands till I began to jabber commercial gibberish like the veriest idiot Upon my word I believe that I was actually respected for a time I was as grave as an owl over it I had to be loyal to the man I have been from first to last completely utterly loyal to the best of my ability I thought he understood something about coal And if I had been aware that he knew nothing of it as in fact he didn t well I don t know what I could have done to stop him In one way or another I should have had to be loyal Truth work ambition love itself may be only counters in the lamentable or despicable game of life but when one takes a hand one must play the game No the shade of Morrison needn t haunt me What s the matter I say Lena why are you staring like that Do you feel ill Heyst made as if to get on his feet The girl extended her arm to arrest him and he remained staring in a sitting posture propped on one arm observing her indefinable expression of anxiety as if she were unable to draw breath What has come to you he insisted feeling strangely unwilling to move to touch her Nothing She swallowed painfully Of course it can t be What name did you say I didn t hear it properly Name repeated Heyst dazedly I only mentioned Morrison It s the name of that man of whom I ve been speaking What of it And you mean to say that he was your friend You have heard enough to judge for yourself You know as much of our connection as I know myself The people in this part of the world went by appearances and called us friends as far as I can remember Appearances what more what better can you ask for In fact you can t have better You can t have anything else You are trying to confuse me with your talk she cried You can t make fun of this Can t Well no I can t It s a pity Perhaps it would have been the best way said Heyst in a tone which for him could be called gloomy Unless one could forget the silly business altogether His faint playfulness of manner and speech returned like a habit one has schooled oneself into even before his forehead had cleared completely But why are you looking so hard at me Oh I don t object and I shall try not to flinch Your eyes He was looking straight into them and as a matter of fact had forgotten all about the late Morrison at that moment No he exclaimed suddenly What an impenetrable girl you are Lena with those grey eyes of yours Windows of the soul as some poet has said The fellow must have been a glazier by vocation Well nature has provided excellently for the shyness of your soul When he ceased speaking the girl came to herself with a catch of her breath He heard her voice the varied charm of which he thought he knew so well saying with an unfamiliar intonation And that partner of yours is dead Morrison Oh yes as I ve told you he You never told me Didn t I I thought I did or rather I thought you must know It seems impossible that anybody with whom I speak should not know that Morrison is dead She lowered her eyelids and Heyst was startled by something like an expression of horror on her face Morrison she whispered in an appalled tone Morrison Her head drooped Unable to see her features Heyst could tell from her voice that for some reason or other she was profoundly moved by the syllables of that unromantic name A thought flashed through his head could she have known Morrison But the mere difference of their origins made it wildly improbable This is very extraordinary he said Have you ever heard the name before Her head moved quickly several times in tiny affirmative nods as if she could not trust herself to speak or even to look at him She was biting her lower lip Did you ever know anybody of that name he asked The girl answered by a negative sign and then at last she spoke jerkily as if forcing herself against some doubt or fear She had heard of that very man she told Heyst Impossible he said positively You are mistaken You couldn t have heard of him it s He stopped short with the thought that to talk like this was perfectly useless that one doesn t argue against thin air But I did hear of him only I didn t know then I couldn t guess that it was your partner they were talking about Talking about my partner repeated Heyst slowly No Her mind seemed almost as bewildered as full of incredulity as his No They were talking of you really only I didn t know it Who were they Heyst raised his voice Who was talking of me Talking where With the first question he had lifted himself from his reclining position at the last he was on his knees before her their heads on a level Why in that town in that hotel Where else could it have been she said The idea of being talked about was always novel to Heyst s simplified conception of himself For a moment he was as much surprised as if he had believed himself to be a mere gliding shadow among men Besides he had in him a half unconscious notion that he was above the level of island gossip But you said first that it was of Morrison they talked he remarked to the girl sinking on his heels and no longer much interested Strange that you should have the opportunity to hear any talk at all I was rather under the impression that you never saw anybody belonging to the town except from the platform You forget that I was not living with the other girls she said After meals they used to go back to the Pavilion but I had to stay in the hotel and do my sewing or what not in the room where they talked I didn t think of that By the by you never told me who they were Why that horrible red faced beast she said with all the energy of disgust which the mere thought of the hotel keeper provoked in her Oh Schomberg Heyst murmured carelessly He talked to the boss to Zangiacomo I mean I had to sit there That devil woman sometimes wouldn t let me go away I mean missus Zangiacomo I guessed murmured Heyst She liked to torment you in a variety of ways But it is really strange that the hotel keeper should talk of Morrison to Zangiacomo As far as I can remember he saw very little of Morrison professionally He knew many others much better The girl shuddered slightly That was the only name I ever overheard I would get as far away from them as I could to the other end of the room but when that beast started shouting I could not help hearing I wish I had never heard anything If I had got up and gone out of the room I don t suppose the woman would have killed me for it but she would have rowed me in a nasty way She would have threatened me and called me names That sort when they know you are helpless there s nothing to stop them I don t know how it is but bad people real bad people that you can see are bad they get over me somehow It s the way they set about downing one I am afraid of wickedness Heyst watched the changing expressions of her face He encouraged her profoundly sympathetic a little amused I quite understand You needn t apologize for your great delicacy in the perception of inhuman evil I am a little like you I am not very plucky she said Well I don t know myself what I would do what countenance I would have before a creature which would strike me as being evil incarnate Don t you be ashamed She sighed looked up with her pale candid gaze and a timid expression on her face and murmured You don t seem to want to know what he was saying About poor Morrison It couldn t have been anything bad for the poor fellow was innocence itself And then you know he is dead and nothing can possibly matter to him now But I tell you that it was of you he was talking she cried He was saying that Morrison s partner first got all there was to get out of him and then and then well as good as murdered him sent him out to die somewhere You believe that of me said Heyst after a moment of perfect silence I didn t know it had anything to do with you Schomberg was talking of some Swede How was I to know It was only when you began telling me about how you came here And now you have my version Heyst forced himself to speak quietly So that s how the business looked from outside he muttered I remember him saying that everybody in these parts knew the story the girl added breathlessly Strange that it should hurt me mused Heyst to himself yet it does I seem to be as much of a fool as those everybodies who know the story and no doubt believe it Can you remember any more he addressed the girl in a grimly polite tone I ve often heard of the moral advantages of seeing oneself as others see one Let us investigate further Can t you recall something else that everybody knows Oh Don t laugh she cried Did I laugh I assure you I was not aware of it I won t ask you whether you believe the hotel keeper s version Surely you must know the value of human judgement She unclasped her hands moved them slightly and twined her fingers as before Protest Assent Was there to be nothing more He was relieved when she spoke in that warm and wonderful voice which in itself comforted and fascinated one s heart which made her lovable I heard this before you and I ever spoke to each other It went out of my memory afterwards Everything went out of my memory then and I was glad of it It was a fresh start for me with you and you know it I wish I had forgotten who I was that would have been best and I very nearly did forget He was moved by the vibrating quality of the last words She seemed to be talking low of some wonderful enchantment in mysterious terms of special significance He thought that if she only could talk to him in some unknown tongue she would enslave him altogether by the sheer beauty of the sound suggesting infinite depths of wisdom and feeling But she went on the name stuck in my head it seems and when you mentioned it It broke the spell muttered Heyst in angry disappointment as if he had been deceived in some hope The girl from her position a little above him surveyed with still eyes the abstracted silence of the man on whom she now depended with a completeness of which she had not been vividly conscious before because till then she had never felt herself swinging between the abysses of earth and heaven in the hollow of his arm What if he should grow weary of the burden And moreover nobody had ever believed that tale Heyst came out with an abrupt burst of sound which made her open her steady eyes wider with an effect of immense surprise It was a purely mechanical effect because she was neither surprised nor puzzled In fact she could understand him better then than at any moment since she first set eyes on him He laughed scornfully What am I thinking of he cried As if it could matter to me what anybody had ever said or believed from the beginning of the world till the crack of doom I never heard you laugh till today she observed This is the second time He scrambled to his feet and towered above her That s because when one s heart has been broken into in the way you have broken into mine all sorts of weaknesses are free to enter shame anger stupid indignation stupid fears stupid laughter too I wonder what interpretation you are putting on it It wasn t gay certainly she said But why are you angry with me Are you sorry you took me away from those beasts I told you who I was You could see it Heavens he muttered He had regained his command of himself I assure you I could see much more than you could tell me I could see quite a lot that you don t even suspect yet but you can t be seen quite through He sank to the ground by her side and took her hand She asked gently What more do you want from me He made no sound for a time The impossible I suppose he said very low as one makes a confidence and pressing the hand he grasped It did not return the pressure He shook his head as if to drive away the thought of this and added in a louder light tone Nothing less And it isn t because I think little of what I ve got already Oh no It is because I think so much of this possession of mine that I can t have it complete enough I know it s unreasonable You can t hold back anything now Indeed I couldn t she whispered letting her hand lie passive in his tight grasp I only wish I could give you something more or better or whatever it is you want He was touched by the sincere accent of these simple words I tell you what you can do you can tell me whether you would have gone with me like this if you had known of whom that abominable idiot of a hotel keeper was speaking A murderer no less But I didn t know you at all then she cried And I had the sense to understand what he was saying It wasn t murder really I never thought it was What made him invent such an atrocity Heyst exclaimed He seems a stupid animal He is stupid How did he manage to hatch that pretty tale Have I a particularly vile countenance Is black selfishness written all over my face Or is that sort of thing so universally human that it might be said of anybody It wasn t murder she insisted earnestly I know I understand It was worse As to killing a man which would be a comparatively decent thing to do well I have never done that Why should you do it she asked in a frightened voice My dear girl you don t know the sort of life I have been leading in unexplored countries in the wilds it s difficult to give you an idea There are men who haven t been in such tight places as I have found myself in who have had to to shed blood as the saying is Even the wilds hold prizes which tempt some people but I had no schemes no plans and not even great firmness of mind to make me unduly obstinate I was simply moving on while the others perhaps were going somewhere An indifference as to roads and purposes makes one meeker as it were And I may say truly too that I never did care I won t say for life I had scorned what people call by that name from the first but for being alive I don t know if that is what men call courage but I doubt it very much You You have no courage she protested I really don t know Not the sort that always itches for a weapon for I have never been anxious to use one in the quarrels that a man gets into in the most innocent way sometimes The differences for which men murder each other are like everything else they do the most contemptible the most pitiful things to look back upon No I ve never killed a man or loved a woman not even in my thoughts not even in my dreams He raised her hand to his lips and let them rest on it for a space during which she moved a little closer to him After the lingering kiss he did not relinquish his hold To slay to love the greatest enterprises of life upon a man And I have no experience of either You must forgive me anything that may have appeared to you awkward in my behaviour inexpressive in my speeches untimely in my silences He moved uneasily a little disappointed by her attitude but indulgent to it and feeling in this moment of perfect quietness that in holding her surrendered hand he had found a closer communion than they had ever achieved before But even then there still lingered in him a sense of incompleteness not altogether overcome which it seemed nothing ever would overcome the fatal imperfection of all the gifts of life which makes of them a delusion and a snare All of a sudden he squeezed her hand angrily His delicately playful equanimity the product of kindness and scorn had perished with the loss of his bitter liberty Not murder you say I should think not But when you led me to talk just now when the name turned up when you understood that it was of me that these things had been said you showed a strange emotion I could see it I was a bit startled she said At the baseness of my conduct he asked I wouldn t judge you not for anything Really It would be as if I dared to judge everything that there is With her other hand she made a gesture that seemed to embrace in one movement the earth and the heaven I wouldn t do such a thing Then came a silence broken at last by Heyst I I do a deadly wrong to my poor Morrison he cried I who could not bear to hurt his feelings I who respected his very madness Yes this madness the wreck of which you can see lying about the jetty of Diamond Bay What else could I do He insisted on regarding me as his saviour he was always restraining the eternal obligation on the tip of his tongue till I was burning with shame at his gratitude What could I do He was going to repay me with this infernal coal and I had to join him as one joins a child s game in a nursery One would no more have thought of humiliating him than one would think of humiliating a child What s the use of talking of all this Of course the people here could not understand the truth of our relation to each other But what business of theirs was it Kill old Morrison Well it is less criminal less base I am not saying it is less difficult to kill a man than to cheat him in that way You understand that She nodded slightly but more than once and with evident conviction His eyes rested on her inquisitive ready for tenderness But it was neither one nor the other he went on Then why your emotion All you confess is that you wouldn t judge me She turned upon him her veiled unseeing grey eyes in which nothing of her wonder could be read I said I couldn t she whispered But you thought that there was no smoke without fire the playfulness of tone hardly concealed his irritation What power there must be in words only imperfectly heard for you did not listen with particular care did you What were they What evil effort of invention drove them into that idiot s mouth out of his lying throat If you were to try to remember they would perhaps convince me too I didn t listen she protested What was it to me what they said of anybody He was saying that there never were such loving friends to look at as you two then when you got all you wanted out of him and got thoroughly tired of him too you kicked him out to go home and die Indignation with an undercurrent of some other feeling rang in these quoted words uttered in her pure and enchanting voice She ceased abruptly and lowered her long dark lashes as if mortally weary sick at heart Of course why shouldn t you get tired of that or any other company You aren t like anyone else and and the thought of it made me unhappy suddenly but indeed I did not believe anything bad of you I A brusque movement of his arm flinging her hand away stopped her short Heyst had again lost control of himself He would have shouted if shouting had been in his character No this earth must be the appointed hatching planet of calumny enough to furnish the whole universe I feel a disgust at my own person as if I had tumbled into some filthy hole Pah And you all you can say is that you won t judge me that you She raised her head at this attack though indeed he had not turned to her I don t believe anything bad of you she repeated I couldn t He made a gesture as if to say That s sufficient In his soul and in his body he experienced a nervous reaction from tenderness All at once without transition he detested her But only for a moment He remembered that she was pretty and more that she had a special grace in the intimacy of life She had the secret of individuality which excites and escapes He jumped up and began to walk to and fro Presently his hidden fury fell into dust within him like a crazy structure leaving behind emptiness desolation regret His resentment was not against the girl but against life itself that commonest of snares in which he felt himself caught seeing clearly the plot of plots and unconsoled by the lucidity of his mind He swerved and stepping up to her sank to the ground by her side Before she could make a movement or even turn her head his way he took her in his arms and kissed her lips He tasted on them the bitterness of a tear fallen there He had never seen her cry It was like another appeal to his tenderness a new seduction The girl glanced round moved suddenly away and averted her face With her hand she signed imperiously to him to leave her alone a command which Heyst did not obey CHAPTER FIVE When she opened her eyes at last and sat up Heyst scrambled quickly to his feet and went to pick up her cork helmet which had rolled a little way off Meanwhile she busied herself in doing up her hair plaited on the top of her head in two heavy dark tresses which had come loose He tendered her the helmet in silence and waited as if unwilling to hear the sound of his own voice We had better go down now he suggested in a low tone He extended his hand to help her up He had the intention to smile but abandoned it at the nearer sight of her still face in which was depicted the infinite lassitude of her soul On their way to regain the forest path they had to pass through the spot from which the view of the sea could be obtained The flaming abyss of emptiness the liquid undulating glare the tragic brutality of the light made her long for the friendly night with its stars stilled by an austere spell for the velvety dark sky and the mysterious great shadow of the sea conveying peace to the day weary heart She put her hand to her eyes Behind her back Heyst spoke gently Let us get on Lena She walked ahead in silence Heyst remarked that they had never been out before during the hottest hours It would do her no good he feared This solicitude pleased and soothed her She felt more and more like herself a poor London girl playing in an orchestra and snatched out from the humiliations the squalid dangers of a miserable existence by a man like whom there was not there could not be another in this world She felt this with elation with uneasiness with an intimate pride and with a peculiar sinking of the heart I am not easily knocked out by any such thing as heat she said decisively Yes but I don t forget that you re not a tropical bird You weren t born in these parts either she returned No and perhaps I haven t even your physique I am a transplanted being Transplanted I ought to call myself uprooted an unnatural state of existence but a man is supposed to stand anything She looked back at him and received a smile He told her to keep in the shelter of the forest path which was very still and close full of heat if free from glare Now and then they had glimpses of the company s old clearing blazing with light in which the black stumps of trees stood charred without shadows miserable and sinister They crossed the open in a direct line for the bungalow On the veranda they fancied they had a glimpse of the vanishing Wang though the girl was not at all sure that she had seen anything move Heyst had no doubts Wang has been looking out for us We are late Was he I thought I saw something white for a moment and then I did not see it any more That s it he vanishes It s a very remarkable gift in that Chinaman Are they all like that she asked with naive curiosity and uneasiness Not in such perfection said Heyst amused He noticed with approval that she was not heated by the walk The drops of perspiration on her forehead were like dew on the cool white petal of a flower He looked at her figure of grace and strength solid and supple with an ever growing appreciation Go in and rest yourself for a quarter of an hour and then mister Wang will give us something to eat he said They had found the table laid When they came together again and sat down to it Wang materialized without a sound unheard uncalled and did his office Which being accomplished at a given moment he was not A great silence brooded over Samburan the silence of the great heat that seems pregnant with fatal issues like the silence of ardent thought Heyst remained alone in the big room The girl seeing him take up a book had retreated to her chamber Heyst sat down under his father s portrait and the abominable calumny crept back into his recollection The taste of it came on his lips nauseating and corrosive like some kinds of poison He was tempted to spit on the floor naively in sheer unsophisticated disgust of the physical sensation He shook his head surprised at himself He was not used to receive his intellectual impressions in that way reflected in movements of carnal emotion He stirred impatiently in his chair and raised the book to his eyes with both hands It was one of his father s He opened it haphazard and his eyes fell on the middle of the page The elder Heyst had written of everything in many books of space and of time of animals and of stars analysing ideas and actions the laughter and the frowns of men and the grimaces of their agony The son read shrinking into himself composing his face as if under the author s eye with a vivid consciousness of the portrait on his right hand a little above his head a wonderful presence in its heavy frame on the flimsy wall of mats looking exiled and at home out of place and masterful in the painted immobility of profile And Heyst the son read Of the stratagems of life the most cruel is the consolation of love the most subtle too for the desire is the bed of dreams He turned the pages of the little volume Storm and Dust glancing here and there at the broken text of reflections maxims short phrases enigmatical sometimes and sometimes eloquent It seemed to him that he was hearing his father s voice speaking and ceasing to speak again Startled at first he ended by finding a charm in the illusion He abandoned himself to the half belief that something of his father dwelt yet on earth a ghostly voice audible to the ear of his own flesh and blood With what strange serenity mingled with terrors had that man considered the universal nothingness He had plunged into it headlong perhaps to render death the answer that faced one at every inquiry more supportable Heyst stirred and the ghostly voice ceased but his eyes followed the words on the last page of the book Men of tormented conscience or of a criminal imagination are aware of much that minds of a peaceful resigned cast do not even suspect It is not poets alone who dare descend into the abyss of infernal regions or even who dream of such a descent The most inexpressive of human beings must have said to himself at one time or another Anything but this We all have our instants of clairvoyance They are not very helpful The character of the scheme does not permit that or anything else to be helpful Properly speaking its character judged by the standards established by its victims is infamous It excuses every violence of protest and at the same time never fails to crush it just as it crushes the blindest assent The so called wickedness must be like the so called virtue its own reward to be anything at all Clairvoyance or no clairvoyance men love their captivity To the unknown force of negation they prefer the miserably tumbled bed of their servitude Man alone can give one the disgust of pity yet I find it easier to believe in the misfortune of mankind than in its wickedness These were the last words Heyst lowered the book to his knees Lena s voice spoke above his drooping head You sit there as if you were unhappy I thought you were asleep he said I was lying down right enough but I never closed my eyes The rest would have done you good after our walk Didn t you try I was lying down I tell you but sleep I couldn t And you made no sound What want of sincerity Or did you want to be alone for a time I alone she murmured He noticed her eyeing the book and got up to put it back in the bookcase When he turned round he saw that she had dropped into the chair it was the one she always used and looked as if her strength had suddenly gone from her leaving her only her youth which seemed very pathetic very much at his mercy He moved quickly towards the chair Tired are you It s my fault taking you up so high and keeping you out so long Such a windless day too She watched his concern her pose languid her eyes raised to him but as unreadable as ever He avoided looking into them for that very reason He forgot himself in the contemplation of those passive arms of these defenceless lips and yes one had to go back to them of these wide open eyes Something wild in their grey stare made him think of sea birds in the cold murkiness of high latitudes He started when she spoke all the charm of physical intimacy revealed suddenly in that voice You should try to love me she said He made a movement of astonishment Try he muttered But it seems to me He broke off saying to himself that if he loved her he had never told her so in so many words Simple words They died on his lips What makes you say that he asked She lowered her eyelids and turned her head a little I have done nothing she said in a low voice It s you who have been good helpful and tender to me Perhaps you love me for that just for that or perhaps you love me for company and because well But sometimes it seems to me that you can never love me for myself only for myself as people do love each other when it is to be for ever Her head drooped Forever she breathed out again then still more faintly she added an entreating Do try These last words went straight to his heart the sound of them more than the sense He did not know what to say either from want of practice in dealing with women or simply from his innate honesty of thought All his defences were broken now Life had him fairly by the throat But he managed a smile though she was not looking at him yes he did manage it the well known Heyst smile of playful courtesy so familiar to all sorts and conditions of men in the islands My dear Lena he said it looks as if you were trying to pick a very unnecessary quarrel with me of all people She made no movement With his elbows spread out he was twisting the ends of his long moustaches very masculine and perplexed enveloped in the atmosphere of femininity as in a cloud suspecting pitfalls and as if afraid to move I must admit though he added that there is no one else and I suppose a certain amount of quarrelling is necessary for existence in this world That girl seated in her chair in graceful quietude was to him like a script in an unknown language or even more simply mysterious like any writing to the illiterate As far as women went he was altogether uninstructed and he had not the gift of intuition which is fostered in the days of youth by dreams and visions exercises of the heart fitting it for the encounters of a world in which love itself rests as much on antagonism as on attraction His mental attitude was that of a man looking this way and that on a piece of writing which he is unable to decipher but which may be big with some revelation He didn t know what to say All he found to add was I don t even understand what I have done or left undone to distress you like this He stopped struck afresh by the physical and moral sense of the imperfections of their relations a sense which made him desire her constant nearness before his eyes under his hand and which when she was out of his sight made her so vague so elusive and illusory a promise that could not be embraced and held No I don t see clearly what you mean Is your mind turned towards the future he interpellated her with marked playfulness because he was ashamed to let such a word pass his lips But all his cherished negations were falling off him one by one Because if it is so there is nothing easier than to dismiss it In our future as in what people call the other life there is nothing to be frightened of She raised her eyes to him and if nature had formed them to express anything else but blank candour he would have learned how terrified she was by his talk and the fact that her sinking heart loved him more desperately than ever He smiled at her Dismiss all thought of it he insisted Surely you don t suspect after what I have heard from you that I am anxious to return to mankind I I murder my poor Morrison It s possible that I may be really capable of that which they say I have done The point is that I haven t done it But it is an unpleasant subject to me I ought to be ashamed to confess it but it is Let us forget it There s that in you Lena which can console me for worse things for uglier passages And if we forget there are no voices here to remind us She had raised her head before he paused Nothing can break in on us here he went on and as if there had been an appeal or a provocation in her upward glance he bent down and took her under the arms raising her straight out of the chair into a sudden and close embrace Her alacrity to respond which made her seem as light as a feather warmed his heart at that moment more than closer caresses had done before He had not expected that ready impulse towards himself which had been dormant in her passive attitude He had just felt the clasp of her arms round his neck when with a slight exclamation He s here she disengaged herself and bolted away into her room CHAPTER SIX Heyst was astounded Looking all round as if to take the whole room to witness of this outrage he became aware of Wang materialized in the doorway The intrusion was as surprising as anything could be in view of the strict regularity with which Wang made himself visible Heyst was tempted to laugh at first This practical comment on his affirmation that nothing could break in on them relieved the strain of his feelings He was a little vexed too The Chinaman preserved a profound silence What do you want asked Heyst sternly Boat out there said the Chinaman Where What do you mean Boat adrift in the straits Some subtle change in Wang s bearing suggested his being out of breath but he did not pant and his voice was steady No row It was Heyst now who was startled and raised his voice Malay man eh Wang made a slight negative movement with his head Do you hear Lena Heyst called out Wang says there is a boat in sight somewhere near apparently Where s that boat Wang Round the point said Wang leaping into Malay unexpectedly and in a loud voice White men three So close as that exclaimed Heyst moving out on the veranda followed by Wang White men Impossible Over the clearing the shadows were already lengthening The sun hung low a ruddy glare lay on the burnt black patch in front of the bungalow and slanted on the ground between the straight tall mast like trees soaring a hundred feet or more without a branch The growth of bushes cut off all view of the jetty from the veranda Far away to the right Wang s hut or rather its dark roof of mats could be seen above the bamboo fence which insured the privacy of the Alfuro woman The Chinaman looked that way swiftly Heyst paused and then stepped back a pace into the room White men Lena apparently What are you doing I am just bathing my eyes a little the girl s voice said from the inner room Oh yes all right Do you want me No You had better I am going down to the jetty Yes you had better stay in What an extraordinary thing It was so extraordinary that nobody could possibly appreciate how extraordinary it was but himself His mind was full of mere exclamations while his feet were carrying him in the direction of the jetty He followed the line of the rails escorted by Wang Where were you when you first saw the boat he asked over his shoulder Wang explained in Malay that he had gone to the shore end of the wharf to get a few lumps of coal from the big heap when happening to raise his eyes from the ground he saw the boat a white man boat not a canoe He had good eyes He had seen the boat with the men at the oars and here Wang made a particular gesture over his eyes as if his vision had received a blow He had turned at once and run to the house to report No mistake eh said Heyst moving on At the very outer edge of the belt he stopped short Wang halted behind him on the path till the voice of Number One called him sharply forward into the open He obeyed Where s that boat asked Heyst forcibly I say where is it Nothing whatever was to be seen between the point and the jetty The stretch of Diamond Bay was like a piece of purple shadow lustrous and empty while beyond the land the open sea lay blue and opaque under the sun Heyst s eyes swept all over the offing till they met far off the dark cone of the volcano with its faint plume of smoke broadening and vanishing everlastingly at the top without altering its shape in the glowing transparency of the evening The fellow has been dreaming he muttered to himself He looked hard at the Chinaman Wang seemed turned into stone Suddenly as if he had received a shock he started flung his arm out with a pointing forefinger and made guttural noises to the effect that there there there he had seen a boat It was very uncanny Heyst thought of some strange hallucination Unlikely enough but that a boat with three men in it should have sunk between the point and the jetty suddenly like a stone without leaving as much on the surface as a floating oar was still more unlikely The theory of a phantom boat would have been more credible than that Confound it he muttered to himself He was unpleasantly affected by this mystery but now a simple explanation occurred to him He stepped hastily out on the wharf The boat if it had existed and had retreated could perhaps be seen from the far end of the long jetty Nothing was to be seen Heyst let his eyes roam idly over the sea He was so absorbed in his perplexity that a hollow sound as of somebody tumbling about in a boat with a clatter of oars and spars failed to make him move for a moment When his mind seized its meaning he had no difficulty in locating the sound It had come from below under the jetty He ran back for a dozen yards or so and then looked over His sight plunged straight into the stern sheets of a big boat the greater part of which was hidden from him by the planking of the jetty His eyes fell on the thin back of a man doubled up over the tiller in a queer uncomfortable attitude of drooping sorrow Another man more directly below Heyst sprawled on his back from gunwale to gunwale half off the after thwart his head lower than his feet This second man glared wildly upward and struggled to raise himself but to all appearance was much too drunk to succeed The visible part of the boat contained also a flat leather trunk on which the first man s long legs were tucked up nervelessly A large earthenware jug with its wide mouth uncorked rolled out on the bottom boards from under the sprawling man Heyst had never been so much astonished in his life He stared dumbly at the strange boat s crew From the first he was positive that these men were not sailors They wore the white drill suit of tropical civilization but their apparition in a boat Heyst could not connect with anything plausible The civilization of the tropics could have had nothing to do with it It was more like those myths current in Polynesia of amazing strangers who arrive at an island gods or demons bringing good or evil to the innocence of the inhabitants gifts of unknown things words never heard before Heyst noticed a cork helmet floating alongside the boat evidently fallen from the head of the man doubled over the tiller who displayed a dark bony poll An oar too had been knocked overboard probably by the sprawling man who was still struggling between the thwarts By this time Heyst regarded the visitation no longer with surprise but with the sustained attention demanded by a difficult problem With one foot poised on the string piece and leaning on his raised knee he was taking in everything The sprawling man rolled off the thwart collapsed and most unexpectedly got on his feet He swayed dizzily spreading his arms out and uttered faintly a hoarse dreamy Hallo His upturned face was swollen red peeling all over the nose and cheeks His stare was irrational Heyst perceived stains of dried blood all over the front of his dirty white coat and also on one sleeve What s the matter Are you wounded The other glanced down reeled one of his feet was inside a large pith hat and recovering himself let out a dismal grating sound in the manner of a grim laugh Blood not mine Thirst s the matter Exhausted s the matter Done up Drink man Give us water Thirst was in the very tone of his words alternating a broken croak and a faint throaty rustle which just reached Heyst s ears The man in the boat raised his hands to be helped up on the jetty whispering I tried I am too weak I tumbled down Wang was coming along the jetty slowly with intent straining eyes Run back and bring a crowbar here There s one lying by the coal heap Heyst shouted to him The man standing in the boat sat down on the thwart behind him A horrible coughing laugh came through his swollen lips Crowbar What s that for he mumbled and his head dropped on his chest mournfully Meantime Heyst as if he had forgotten the boat started kicking hard at a large brass tap projecting above the planks To accommodate ships that came for coal and happened to need water as well a stream had been tapped in the interior and an iron pipe led along the jetty It terminated with a curved end almost exactly where the strangers boat had been driven between the piles but the tap was set fast Hurry up Heyst yelled to the Chinaman who was running with the crowbar in his hand Heyst snatched it from him and obtaining a leverage against the string piece wrung the stiff tap round with a mighty jerk I hope that pipe hasn t got choked he muttered to himself anxiously It hadn t but it did not yield a strong gush The sound of a thin stream partly breaking on the gunwale of the boat and partly splashing alongside became at once audible It was greeted by a cry of inarticulate and savage joy Heyst knelt on the string piece and peered down The man who had spoken was already holding his open mouth under the bright trickle Water ran over his eyelids and over his nose gurgled down his throat flowed over his chin Then some obstruction in the pipe gave way and a sudden thick jet broke on his face In a moment his shoulders were soaked the front of his coat inundated he streamed and dripped water ran into his pockets down his legs into his shoes but he had clutched the end of the pipe and hanging on with both hands swallowed spluttered choked snorted with the noises of a swimmer Suddenly a curious dull roar reached Heyst s ears Something hairy and black flew from under the jetty A dishevelled head coming on like a cannonball took the man at the pipe in flank with enough force to tear his grip loose and fling him headlong into the stern sheets He fell upon the folded legs of the man at the tiller who roused by the commotion in the boat was sitting up silent rigid and very much like a corpse His eyes were but two black patches and his teeth glistened with a death s head grin between his retracted lips no thicker than blackish parchment glued over the gums From him Heyst s eyes wandered to the creature who had replaced the first man at the end of the water pipe Enormous brown paws clutched it savagely the wild big head hung back and in a face covered with a wet mass of hair there gaped crookedly a wide mouth full of fangs The water filled it welled up in hoarse coughs ran down on each side of the jaws and down the hairy throat soaked the black pelt of the enormous chest naked under a torn check shirt heaving convulsively with a play of massive muscles carved in red mahogany As soon as the first man had recovered the breath knocked out of him by the irresistible charge a scream of mad cursing issued from the stern sheets With a rigid angular crooking of the elbow the man at the tiller put his hand back to his hip Don t shoot him sir yelled the first man Wait Let me have that tiller I will teach him to shove himself in front of a caballero Martin Ricardo flourished the heavy piece of wood leaped forward with astonishing vigour and brought it down on Pedro s head with a crash that resounded all over the quiet sweep of Black Diamond Bay A crimson patch appeared on the matted hair red veins appeared in the water flowing all over his face and it dripped in rosy drops off his head But the man hung on Not till a second furious blow descended did the hairy paws let go their grip and the squirming body sink limply Before it could touch the bottom boards a tremendous kick in the ribs from Ricardo s foot shifted it forward out of sight whence came the noise of a heavy thud a clatter of spars and a pitiful grunt Ricardo stooped to look under the jetty Aha dog This will teach you to keep back where you belong you murdering brute you slaughtering savage you You infidel you robber of churches Next time I will rip you open from neck to heel you carrion eater Esclavo He backed a little and straightened himself up I don t mean it really he remarked to Heyst whose steady eyes met his from above He ran aft briskly Come along sir It s your turn I oughtn t to have drunk first S truth I forgot myself A gentleman like you will overlook that I know As he made these apologies Ricardo extended his hand Let me steady you sir Slowly mister Jones unfolded himself in all his slenderness rocked staggered and caught Ricardo s shoulder His henchman assisted him to the pipe which went on gushing a clear stream of water sparkling exceedingly against the black piles and the gloom under the jetty Catch hold sir Ricardo advised solicitously All right He stepped back and while mister Jones revelled in the abundance of water he addressed himself to Heyst with a sort of justificatory speech the tone of which reflecting his feelings partook of purring and spitting They had been thirty hours tugging at the oars he explained and they had been more than forty hours without water except that the night before they had licked the dew off the gunwales Ricardo did not explain to Heyst how it happened At that precise moment he had no explanation ready for the man on the wharf who he guessed must be wondering much more at the presence of his visitors than at their plight CHAPTER SEVEN The explanation lay in the two simple facts that the light winds and strong currents of the Java Sea had drifted the boat about until they partly lost their bearings and that by some extra ordinary mistake one of the two jars put into the boat by Schomberg s man contained salt water Ricardo tried to put some pathos into his tones Pulling for thirty hours with eighteen foot oars And the sun Ricardo relieved his feelings by cursing the sun They had felt their hearts and lungs shrivel within them And then as if all that hadn t been trouble enough he complained bitterly he had had to waste his fainting strength in beating their servant about the head with a stretcher The fool had wanted to drink sea water and wouldn t listen to reason There was no stopping him otherwise It was better to beat him into insensibility than to have him go crazy in the boat and to be obliged to shoot him The preventive administered with enough force to brain an elephant boasted Ricardo had to be applied on two occasions the second time all but in sight of the jetty You have seen the beauty Ricardo went on expansively hiding his lack of some sort of probable story under this loquacity I had to hammer him away from the spout Opened afresh all the old broken spots on his head You saw how hard I had to hit He has no restraint no restraint at all If it wasn t that he can be made useful in one way or another I would just as soon have let the governor shoot him He smiled up at Heyst in his peculiar lip retracting manner and added by way of afterthought That s what will happen to him in the end if he doesn t learn to restrain himself But I ve taught him to mind his manners for a while anyhow And again he addressed his quick grin up to the man on the wharf His round eyes had never left Heyst s face ever since he began to deliver his account of the voyage So that s how he looks Ricardo was saying to himself He had not expected Heyst to be like this He had formed for himself a conception containing the helpful suggestion of a vulnerable point These solitary men were often tipplers But no this was not a drinking man s face nor could he detect the weakness of alarm or even the weakness of surprise on these features in those steady eyes We were too far gone to climb out Ricardo went on I heard you walking along though I thought I shouted I tried to You didn t hear me shout Heyst made an almost imperceptible negative sign which the greedy eyes of Ricardo greedy for all signs did not miss Throat too parched We didn t even care to whisper to each other lately Thirst chokes one We might have died there under this wharf before you found us I couldn t think where you had gone to Heyst was heard at last addressing directly the newcomers from the sea You were seen as soon as you cleared that point We were seen eh grunted mister Ricardo We pulled like machines daren t stop The governor sat at the tiller but he couldn t speak to us She drove in between the piles till she hit something and we all tumbled off the thwarts as if we had been drunk Drunk ha ha Too dry by George We fetched in here with the very last of our strength and no mistake Another mile would have done for us When I heard your footsteps above I tried to get up and I fell down That was the first sound I heard said Heyst mister Jones the front of his soiled white tunic soaked and plastered against his breast bone staggered away from the water pipe Steadying himself on Ricardo s shoulder he drew a long breath raised his dripping head and produced a smile of ghastly amiability which was lost upon the thoughtful Heyst Behind his back the sun touching the water was like a disc of iron cooled to a dull red glow ready to start rolling round the circular steel plate of the sea which under the darkening sky looked more solid than the high ridge of Samburan more solid than the point whose long outlined slope melted into its own unfathomable shadow blurring the dim sheen on the bay The forceful stream from the pipe broke like shattered glass on the boat s gunwale Its loud fitful and persistent splashing revealed the depths of the world s silence Great notion to lead the water out here pronounced Ricardo appreciatively Water was life He felt now as if he could run a mile scale a ten foot wall sing a song Only a few minutes ago he was next door to a corpse done up unable to stand to lift a hand unable to groan A drop of water had done that miracle Didn t you feel life itself running and soaking into you sir he asked his principal with deferential but forced vivacity Without a word mister Jones stepped off the thwart and sat down in the stern sheets Isn t that man of yours bleeding to death in the bows under there inquired Heyst Ricardo ceased his ecstasies over the life giving water and answered in a tone of innocence He You may call him a man but his hide is a jolly sight tougher than the toughest alligator he ever skinned in the good old days You don t know how much he can stand I do We have tried him a long time ago Ola there Pedro Pedro he yelled with a force of lung testifying to the regenerative virtues of water A weak Senor came from under the wharf What did I tell you said Ricardo triumphantly Nothing can hurt him He s all right But I say the boat s getting swamped Can t you turn this water off before you sink her under us She s half full already At a sign from Heyst Wang hammered at the brass tap on the wharf then stood behind Number One crowbar in hand motionless as before Ricardo was perhaps not so certain of Pedro s toughness as he affirmed for he stooped peering under the wharf then moved forward out of sight The gush of water ceasing suddenly made a silence which became complete when the after trickle stopped Afar the sun was reduced to a red spark glowing very low in the breathless immensity of twilight Purple gleams lingered on the water all round the boat The spectral figure in the stern sheets spoke in a languid tone That er companion er secretary of mine is a queer chap I am afraid we aren t presenting ourselves in a very favourable light Heyst listened It was the conventional voice of an educated man only strangely lifeless But more strange yet was this concern for appearances expressed he did not know whether in jest or in earnest Earnestness was hardly to be supposed under the circumstances and no one had ever jested in such dead tones It was something which could not be answered and Heyst said nothing The other went on Travelling as I do I find a man of his sort extremely useful He has his little weaknesses no doubt Indeed Heyst was provoked into speaking Weakness of the arm is not one of them neither is an exaggerated humanity as far as I can judge Defects of temper explained mister Jones from the stern sheets The subject of this dialogue coming out just then from under the wharf into the visible part of the boat made himself heard in his own defence in a voice full of life and with nothing languid in his manner on the contrary it was brisk almost jocose He begged pardon for contradicting He was never out of temper with our Pedro The fellow was a Dago of immense strength and of no sense whatever This combination made him dangerous and he had to be treated accordingly in a manner which he could understand Reasoning was beyond him And so Ricardo addressed Heyst with animation you mustn t be surprised if I assure you Heyst interrupted that my wonder at your arrival in your boat here is so great that it leaves no room for minor astonishments But hadn t you better land That s the talk sir Ricardo began to bustle about the boat talking all the time Finding himself unable to size up this man he was inclined to credit him with extraordinary powers of penetration which it seemed to him would be favoured by silence Also he feared some pointblank question He had no ready made story to tell He and his patron had put off considering that rather important detail too long For the last two days the horrors of thirst coming on them unexpectedly had prevented consultation They had had to pull for dear life But the man on the wharf were he in league with the devil himself would pay for all their sufferings thought Ricardo with an unholy joy Meantime splashing in the water which covered the bottom boards Ricardo congratulated himself aloud on the luggage being out of the way of the wet He had piled it up forward He had roughly tied up Pedro s head Pedro had nothing to grumble about On the contrary he ought to be mighty thankful to him Ricardo for being alive at all Well now let me give you a leg up sir he said cheerily to his motionless principal in the stern sheets All our troubles are over for a time anyhow Ain t it luck to find a white man on this island I would have just as soon expected to meet an angel from heaven eh mister Jones Now then ready sir one two three up you go Helped from below by Ricardo and from above by the man more unexpected than an angel mister Jones scrambled up and stood on the wharf by the side of Heyst He swayed like a reed The night descending on Samburan turned into dense shadow the point of land and the wharf itself and gave a dark solidity to the unshimmering water extending to the last faint trace of light away to the west Heyst stared at the guests whom the renounced world had sent him thus at the end of the day The only other vestige of light left on earth lurked in the hollows of the thin man s eyes They gleamed mobile and languidly evasive The eyelids fluttered You are feeling weak said Heyst For the moment a little confessed the other With loud panting Ricardo scrambled on his hands and knees upon the wharf energetic and unaided He rose up at Heyst s elbow and stamped his foot on the planks with a sharp provocative double beat such as is heard sometimes in fencing schools before the adversaries engage their foils Not that the renegade seaman Ricardo knew anything of fencing What he called shooting irons were his weapons or the still less aristocratic knife such as was even then ingeniously strapped to his leg He thought of it at that moment A swift stooping motion then on the recovery a ripping blow a shove off the wharf and no noise except a splash in the water that would scarcely disturb the silence Heyst would have no time for a cry It would be quick and neat and immensely in accord with Ricardo s humour But he repressed this gust of savagery The job was not such a simple one This piece had to be played to another tune and in much slower time He returned to his note of talkative simplicity Ay and I too don t feel as strong as I thought I was when the first drink set me up Great wonder worker water is And to get it right here on the spot It was heaven hey sir mister Jones being directly addressed took up his part in the concerted piece Really when I saw a wharf on what might have been an uninhabited island I couldn t believe my eyes I doubted its existence I thought it was a delusion till the boat actually drove between the piles as you see her lying now While he was speaking faintly in a voice which did not seem to belong to the earth his henchman in extremely loud and terrestrial accents was fussing about their belongings in the boat addressing himself to Pedro Come now pass up the dunnage there Move yourself hombre or I ll have to get down again and give you a tap on those bandages of yours you growling bear you Ah You didn t believe in the reality of the wharf Heyst was saying to mister Jones You ought to kiss my hands Ricardo caught hold of an ancient Gladstone bag and swung it on the wharf with a thump Yes You ought to burn a candle before me as they do before the saints in your country No saint has ever done so much for you as I have you ungrateful vagabond Now then Up you get Helped by the talkative Ricardo Pedro scrambled up on the wharf where he remained for some time on all fours swinging to and fro his shaggy head tied up in white rags Then he got up clumsily like a bulky animal in the dusk balancing itself on its hind legs mister Jones began to explain languidly to Heyst that they were in a pretty bad state that morning when they caught sight of the smoke of the volcano It nerved them to make an effort for their lives Soon afterwards they made out the island I had just wits enough left in my baked brain to alter the direction of the boat the ghostly voice went on As to finding assistance a wharf a white man nobody would have dreamed of it Simply preposterous That s what I thought when my Chinaman came and told me he had seen a boat with white men pulling up said Heyst Most extraordinary luck interjected Ricardo standing by anxiously attentive to every word Seems a dream he added A lovely dream A silence fell on that group of three as if everyone had become afraid to speak in an obscure sense of an impending crisis Pedro on one side of them and Wang on the other had the air of watchful spectators A few stars had come out pursuing the ebbing twilight A light draught of air tepid enough in the thickening twilight after the scorching day struck a chill into mister Jones in his soaked clothes I may infer then that there is a settlement of white people here he murmured shivering visibly Heyst roused himself Oh abandoned abandoned I am alone here practically alone but several empty houses are still standing No lack of accommodation We may just as well here Wang go back to the shore and run the trolley out here The last words having been spoken in Malay he explained courteously that he had given directions for the transport of the luggage Wang had melted into the night in his soundless manner My word Rails laid down and all exclaimed Ricardo softly in a tone of admiration Well I never We were working a coal mine here said the late manager of the Tropical Belt Coal Company These are only the ghosts of things that have been mister Jones s teeth were suddenly started chattering by another faint puff of wind a mere sigh from the west where Venus cast her rays on the dark edge of the horizon like a bright lamp hung above the grave of the sun We might be moving on proposed Heyst My Chinaman and that ah ungrateful servant of yours with the broken head can load the things and come along after us The suggestion was accepted without words Moving towards the shore the three men met the trolley a mere metallic rustle which whisked past them the shadowy Wang running noiselessly behind Only the sound of their footsteps accompanied them It was a long time since so many footsteps had rung together on that jetty Before they stepped on to the path trodden through the grass Heyst said I am prevented from offering you a share of my own quarters The distant courtliness of this beginning arrested the other two suddenly as if amazed by some manifest incongruity I should regret it more he went on if I were not in a position to give you the choice of those empty bungalows for a temporary home He turned round and plunged into the narrow track the two others following in single file Queer start Ricardo took the opportunity for whispering as he fell behind mister Jones who swayed in the gloom enclosed by the stalks of tropical grass almost as slender as a stalk of grass himself In this order they emerged into the open space kept clear of vegetation by Wang s judicious system of periodic firing The shapes of buildings unlighted high roofed looked mysteriously extensive and featureless against the increasing glitter of the stars Heyst was pleased at the absence of light in his bungalow It looked as uninhabited as the others He continued to lead the way inclining to the right His equable voice was heard This one would be the best It was our counting house There is some furniture in it yet I am pretty certain that you ll find a couple of camp bedsteads in one of the rooms The high pitched roof of the bungalow towered up very close eclipsing the sky Here we are Three steps As you see there s a wide veranda Sorry to keep you waiting for a moment the door is locked I think He was heard trying it Then he leaned against the rail saying Wang will get the keys The others waited two vague shapes nearly mingled together in the darkness of the veranda from which issued a sudden chattering of mister Jones s teeth directly suppressed and a slight shuffle of Ricardo s feet Their guide and host his back against the rail seemed to have forgotten their existence Suddenly he moved and murmured Ah here s the trolley Then he raised his voice in Malay and was answered Ya tuan from an indistinct group that could be made out in the direction of the track I have sent Wang for the key and a light he said in a voice that came out without any particular direction a peculiarity which disconcerted Ricardo Wang did not tarry long on his mission Very soon from the distant recesses of obscurity appeared the swinging lantern he carried It cast a fugitive ray on the arrested trolley with the uncouth figure of the wild Pedro drooping over the load then it moved towards the bungalow and ascended the stairs After working at the stiff lock Wang applied his shoulder to the door It came open with explosive suddenness as if in a passion at being thus disturbed after two years repose From the dark slope of a tall stand up writing desk a forgotten solitary sheet of paper flew up and settled gracefully on the floor Wang and Pedro came and went through the offended door bringing the things off the trolley one flitting swiftly in and out the other staggering heavily Later directed by a few quiet words from Number One Wang made several journeys with the lantern to the store rooms bringing in blankets provisions in tins coffee sugar and a packet of candles He lighted one and stuck it on the ledge of the stand up desk Meantime Pedro being introduced to some kindling wood and a bundle of dry sticks had busied himself outside in lighting a fire on which he placed a ready filled kettle handed to him by Wang impassively at arm s length as if across a chasm Having received the thanks of his guests Heyst wished them goodnight and withdrew leaving them to their repose CHAPTER EIGHT Heyst walked away slowly There was still no light in his bungalow and he thought that perhaps it was just as well By this time he was much less perturbed Wang had preceded him with the lantern as if in a hurry to get away from the two white men and their hairy attendant The light was not dancing along any more it was standing perfectly still by the steps of the veranda Heyst glancing back casually saw behind him still another light the light of the strangers open fire A black uncouth form stooping over it monstrously staggered away into the outlying shadows The kettle had boiled probably With that weird vision of something questionably human impressed upon his senses Heyst moved on a pace or two What could the people be who had such a creature for their familiar attendant He stopped The vague apprehension of a distant future in which he saw Lena unavoidably separated from him by profound and subtle differences the sceptical carelessness which had accompanied every one of his attempts at action like a secret reserve of his soul fell away from him He no longer belonged to himself There was a call far more imperious and august He came up to the bungalow and at the very limit of the lantern s light on the top step he saw her feet and the bottom part of her dress The rest of her person was suggested dimly as high as her waist She sat on a chair and the gloom of the low eaves descended upon her head and shoulders She didn t stir You haven t gone to sleep here he asked Oh no I was waiting for you in the dark Heyst on the top step leaned against a wooden pillar after moving the lantern to one side I have been thinking that it is just as well you had no light But wasn t it dull for you to sit in the dark I don t need a light to think of you Her charming voice gave a value to this banal answer which had also the merit of truth Heyst laughed a little and said that he had had a curious experience She made no remark He tried to figure to himself the outlines of her easy pose A spot of dim light here and there hinted at the unfailing grace of attitude which was one of her natural possessions She had thought of him but not in connection with the strangers She had admired him from the first she had been attracted by his warm voice his gentle eye but she had felt him too wonderfully difficult to know He had given to life a savour a movement a promise mingled with menaces which she had not suspected were to be found in it or at any rate not by a girl wedded to misery as she was She said to herself that she must not be irritated because he seemed too self contained and as if shut up in a world of his own When he took her in his arms she felt that his embrace had a great and compelling force that he was moved deeply and that perhaps he would not get tired of her so very soon She thought that he had opened to her the feelings of delicate joy that the very uneasiness he caused her was delicious in its sadness and that she would try to hold him as long as she could till her fainting arms her sinking soul could cling to him no more Wang s not here of course Heyst said suddenly She answered as if in her sleep He put this light down here without stopping and ran Ran did he H m Well it s considerably later than his usual time to go home to his Alfuro wife but to be seen running is a sort of degradation for Wang who has mastered the art of vanishing Do you think he was startled out of his perfection by something Why should he be startled Her voice remained dreamy a little uncertain I have been startled Heyst said She was not listening to him The lantern at their feet threw the shadows of her face upward Her eyes glistened as if frightened and attentive above a lighted chin and a very white throat Upon my word mused Heyst now that I don t see them I can hardly believe that those fellows exist And what about me she asked so swiftly that he made a movement like somebody pounced upon from an ambush When you don t see me do you believe that I exist Exist Most charmingly My dear Lena you don t know your own advantages Why your voice alone would be enough to make you unforgettable Oh I didn t mean forgetting in that way I dare say if I were to die you would remember me right enough And what good would that be to anybody It s while I am alive that I want Heyst stood by her chair a stalwart figure imperfectly lighted The broad shoulders the martial face that was like a disguise of his disarmed soul were lost in the gloom above the plane of light in which his feet were planted He suffered from a trouble with which she had nothing to do She had no general conception of the conditions of the existence he had offered to her Drawn into its peculiar stagnation she remained unrelated to it because of her ignorance For instance she could never perceive the prodigious improbability of the arrival of that boat She did not seem to be thinking of it Perhaps she had already forgotten the fact herself And Heyst resolved suddenly to say nothing more of it It was not that he shrank from alarming her Not feeling anything definite himself he could not imagine a precise effect being produced on her by any amount of explanation There is a quality in events which is apprehended differently by different minds or even by the same mind at different times Any man living at all consciously knows that embarrassing truth Heyst was aware that this visit could bode nothing pleasant In his present soured temper towards all mankind he looked upon it as a visitation of a particularly offensive kind He glanced along the veranda in the direction of the other bungalow The fire of sticks in front of it had gone out No faint glow of embers not the slightest thread of light in that direction hinted at the presence of strangers The darker shapes in the obscurity the dead silence betrayed nothing of that strange intrusion The peace of Samburan asserted itself as on any other night Everything was as before except Heyst became aware of it suddenly that for a whole minute perhaps with his hand on the back of the girl s chair and within a foot of her person he had lost the sense of her existence for the first time since he had brought her over to share this invincible this undefiled peace He picked up the lantern and the act made a silent stir all along the veranda A spoke of shadow swung swiftly across her face and the strong light rested on the immobility of her features as of a woman looking at a vision Her eyes were still her lips serious Her dress open at the neck stirred slightly to her even breathing We had better go in Lena suggested Heyst very low as if breaking a spell cautiously She rose without a word Heyst followed her indoors As they passed through the living room he left the lantern burning on the centre table CHAPTER NINE That night the girl woke up for the first time in her new experience with the sensation of having been abandoned to her own devices She woke up from a painful dream of separation brought about in a way which she could not understand and missed the relief of the waking instant The desolate feeling of being alone persisted She was really alone A night light made it plain enough in the dim mysterious manner of a dream but this was reality It startled her exceedingly In a moment she was at the curtain that hung in the doorway and raised it with a steady hand The conditions of their life in Samburan would have made peeping absurd nor was such a thing in her character This was not a movement of curiosity but of downright alarm the continued distress and fear of the dream The night could not have been very far advanced The light of the lantern was burning strongly striping the floor and walls of the room with thick black bands She hardly knew whether she expected to see Heyst or not but she saw him at once standing by the table in his sleeping suit his back to the doorway She stepped in noiselessly with her bare feet and let the curtain fall behind her Something characteristic in Heyst s attitude made her say almost in a whisper You are looking for something He could not have heard her before but he didn t start at the unexpected whisper He only pushed the drawer of the table in and without even looking over his shoulder asked quietly accepting her presence as if he had been aware of all her movements I say are you certain that Wang didn t go through this room this evening Wang When After leaving the lantern I mean Oh no He ran on I watched him Or before perhaps while I was with these boat people Do you know Can you tell I hardly think so I came out as the sun went down and sat outside till you came back to me He could have popped in for an instant through the back veranda I heard nothing in here she said What is the matter Naturally you wouldn t hear He can be as quiet as a shadow when he likes I believe he could steal the pillows from under our heads He might have been here ten minutes ago What woke you up Was it a noise Can t say that Generally one can t tell but is it likely Lena You are I believe the lighter sleeper of us two A noise loud enough to wake me up would have awakened you too I tried to be as quiet as I could What roused you I don t know a dream perhaps I woke up crying What was the dream Heyst with one hand resting on the table had turned in her direction his round uncovered head set on a fighter s muscular neck She left his question unanswered as if she had not heard it What is it you have missed she asked in her turn very grave Her dark hair drawn smoothly back was done in two thick tresses for the night Heyst noticed the good form of her brow the dignity of its width its unshining whiteness It was a sculptural forehead He had a moment of acute appreciation intruding upon another order of thoughts It was as if there could be no end of his discoveries about that girl at the most incongruous moments She had on nothing but a hand woven cotton sarong one of Heyst s few purchases years ago in Celebes where they are made He had forgotten all about it till she came and then had found it at the bottom of an old sandalwood trunk dating back to pre Morrison days She had quickly learned to wind it up under her armpits with a safe twist as Malay village girls do when going down to bathe in a river Her shoulders and arms were bare one of her tresses hanging forward looked almost black against the white skin As she was taller than the average Malay woman the sarong ended a good way above her ankles She stood poised firmly half way between the table and the curtained doorway the insteps of her bare feet gleaming like marble on the overshadowed matting of the floor The fall of her lighted shoulders the strong and fine modelling of her arms hanging down her sides her immobility too had something statuesque the charm of art tense with life She was not very big Heyst used to think of her at first as that poor little girl but revealed free from the shabby banality of a white platform dress in the simple drapery of the sarong there was that in her form and in the proportions of her body which suggested a reduction from a heroic size She moved forward a step What is it you have missed she asked again Heyst turned his back altogether on the table The black spokes of darkness over the floor and the walls joining up on the ceiling in a path of shadow were like the bars of a cage about them It was his turn to ignore a question You woke up in a fright you say he said She walked up to him exotic yet familiar with her white woman s face and shoulders above the Malay sarong as if it were an airy disguise but her expression was serious No she replied It was distress rather You see you weren t there and I couldn t tell why you had gone away from me A nasty dream the first I ve had too since You don t believe in dreams do you asked Heyst I once knew a woman who did Leastwise she used to tell people what dreams mean for a shilling Would you go now and ask her what this dream means inquired Heyst jocularly She lived in Camberwell She was a nasty old thing Heyst laughed a little uneasily Dreams are madness my dear It s things that happen in the waking world while one is asleep that one would be glad to know the meaning of You have missed something out of this drawer she said positively This or some other I have looked into every single one of them and come back to this again as people do It s difficult to believe the evidence of my own senses but it isn t there Now Lena are you sure that you didn t I have touched nothing in the house but what you have given me Lena he cried He was painfully affected by this disclaimer of a charge which he had not made It was what a servant might have said an inferior open to suspicion or at any rate a stranger He was angry at being so wretchedly misunderstood disenchanted at her not being instinctively aware of the place he had secretly given her in his thoughts After all he said to himself we are strangers to each other And then he felt sorry for her He spoke calmly I was about to say are you sure you have no reason to think that the Chinaman has been in this room tonight You suspect him she asked knitting her eyebrows There is no one else to suspect You may call it a certitude You don t want to tell me what it is she inquired in the equable tone in which one takes a fact into account Heyst only smiled faintly Nothing very precious as far as value goes he replied I thought it might have been money she said Money exclaimed Heyst as if the suggestion had been altogether preposterous She was so visibly surprised that he hastened to add Of course there is some money in the house there in that writing desk the drawer on the left It s not locked You can pull it right out There is a recess and the board at the back pivots a very simple hiding place when you know the way to it I discovered it by accident and I keep our store of sovereigns in there The treasure my dear is not big enough to require a cavern He paused laughed very low and returned her steady stare The loose silver some guilders and dollars I have always kept in that unlocked left drawer I have no doubt Wang knows what there is in it but he isn t a thief and that s why I no Lena what I ve missed is not gold or jewels and that s what makes the fact interesting which the theft of money cannot be She took a long breath relieved to hear that it was not money A great curiosity was depicted on her face but she refrained from pressing him with questions She only gave him one of her deep gleaming smiles It isn t me so it must be Wang You ought to make him give it back to you Heyst said nothing to that naive and practical suggestion for the object that he missed from the drawer was his revolver It was a heavy weapon which he had owned for many years and had never used in his life Ever since the London furniture had arrived in Samburan it had been reposing in the drawer of the table The real dangers of life for him were not those which could be repelled by swords or bullets On the other hand neither his manner nor his appearance looked sufficiently inoffensive to expose him to light minded aggression He could not have explained what had induced him to go to the drawer in the middle of the night He had started up suddenly which was very unusual with him He had found himself sitting up and extremely wide awake all at once with the girl reposing by his side lying with her face away from him a vague characteristically feminine form in the dim light She was perfectly still At that season of the year there were no mosquitoes in Samburan and the sides of the mosquito net were looped up Heyst swung his feet to the floor and found himself standing there almost before he had become aware of his intention to get up Why he did this he did not know He didn t wish to wake her up and the slight creak of the broad bedstead had sounded very loud to him He turned round apprehensively and waited for her to move but she did not stir While he looked at her he had a vision of himself lying there too also fast asleep and it occurred to him for the first time in his life very defenceless This quite novel impression of the dangers of slumber made him think suddenly of his revolver He left the bedroom with noiseless footsteps The lightness of the curtain he had to lift as he passed out and the outer door wide open on the blackness of the veranda for the roof eaves came down low shutting out the starlight gave him a sense of having been dangerously exposed he could not have said to what He pulled the drawer open Its emptiness cut his train of self communion short He murmured to the assertive fact Impossible Somewhere else He tried to remember where he had put the thing but those provoked whispers of memory were not encouraging Foraging in every receptacle and nook big enough to contain a revolver he came slowly to the conclusion that it was not in that room Neither was it in the other The whole bungalow consisted of the two rooms and a profuse allowance of veranda all round Heyst stepped out on the veranda It s Wang beyond a doubt he thought staring into the night He has got hold of it for some reason There was nothing to prevent that ghostly Chinaman from materializing suddenly at the foot of the stairs or anywhere at any moment and toppling him over with a dead sure shot The danger was so irremediable that it was not worth worrying about any more than the general precariousness of human life Heyst speculated on this added risk How long had he been at the mercy of a slender yellow finger on the trigger That is if that was the fellow s reason for purloining the revolver Shoot and inherit thought Heyst Very simple Yet there was in his mind a marked reluctance to regard the domesticated grower of vegetables in the light of a murderer No it wasn t that For Wang could have done it any time this last twelve months or more Heyst s mind had worked on the assumption that Wang had possessed himself of the revolver during his own absence from Samburan but at that period of his speculation his point of view changed It struck him with the force of manifest certitude that the revolver had been taken only late in the day or on that very night Wang of course But why So there had been no danger in the past It was all ahead He has me at his mercy now thought Heyst without particular excitement The sentiment he experienced was curiosity He forgot himself in it it was as if he were considering somebody else s strange predicament But even that sort of interest was dying out when looking to his left he saw the accustomed shapes of the other bungalows looming in the night and remembered the arrival of the thirsty company in the boat Wang would hardly risk such a crime in the presence of other white men It was a peculiar instance of the safety in numbers principle which somehow was not much to Heyst s taste He went in gloomily and stood over the empty drawer in deep and unsatisfactory thought He had just made up his mind that he must breathe nothing of this to the girl when he heard her voice behind him She had taken him by surprise but he resisted the impulse to turn round at once under the impression that she might read his trouble in his face Yes she had taken him by surprise and for that reason the conversation which began was not exactly as he would have conducted it if he had been prepared for her pointblank question He ought to have said at once I ve missed nothing It was a deplorable thing that he should have let it come so far as to have her ask what it was he missed He closed the conversation by saying lightly It s an object of very small value Don t worry about it it isn t worth while The best you can do is to go and lie down again Lena Reluctant she turned away and only in the doorway asked And you I think I shall smoke a cheroot on the veranda I don t feel sleepy for the moment Well don t be long He made no answer She saw him standing there very still with a frown on his brow and slowly dropped the curtain Heyst did really light a cheroot before going out again on the veranda He glanced up from under the low eaves to see by the stars how the night went on It was going very slowly Why it should have irked him he did not know for he had nothing to expect from the dawn but everything round him had become unreasonable unsettled and vaguely urgent laying him under an obligation but giving him no line of action He felt contemptuously irritated with the situation The outer world had broken upon him and he did not know what wrong he had done to bring this on himself any more than he knew what he had done to provoke the horrible calumny about his treatment of poor Morrison For he could not forget this It had reached the ears of one who needed to have the most perfect confidence in the rectitude of his conduct And she only half disbelieves it he thought with hopeless humiliation This moral stab in the back seemed to have taken some of his strength from him as a physical wound would have done He had no desire to do anything neither to bring Wang to terms in the matter of the revolver nor to find out from the strangers who they were and how their predicament had come about He flung his glowing cigar away into the night But Samburan was no longer a solitude wherein he could indulge in all his moods The fiery parabolic path the cast out stump traced in the air was seen from another veranda at a distance of some twenty yards It was noted as a symptom of importance by an observer with his faculties greedy for signs and in a state of alertness tense enough almost to hear the grass grow CHAPTER TEN The observer was Martin Ricardo To him life was not a matter of passive renunciation but of a particularly active warfare He was not mistrustful of it he was not disgusted with it still less was he inclined to be suspicious of its disenchantments but he was vividly aware that it held many possibilities of failure Though very far from being a pessimist he was not a man of foolish illusions He did not like failure not only because of its unpleasant and dangerous consequences but also because of its damaging effect upon his own appreciation of Martin Ricardo And this was a special job of his own contriving and of considerable novelty It was not so to speak in his usual line of business except perhaps from a moral standpoint about which he was not likely to trouble his head For these reasons Martin Ricardo was unable to sleep mister Jones after repeated shivering fits and after drinking much hot tea had apparently fallen into deep slumber He had very peremptorily discouraged attempts at conversation on the part of his faithful follower Ricardo listened to his regular breathing It was all very well for the governor He looked upon it as a sort of sport A gentleman naturally would But this ticklish and important job had to be pulled off at all costs both for honour and for safety Ricardo rose quietly and made his way on the veranda He could not lie still He wanted to go out for air and he had a feeling that by the force of his eagerness even the darkness and the silence could be made to yield something to his eyes and ears He noted the stars and stepped back again into the dense darkness He resisted the growing impulse to go out and steal towards the other bungalow It would have been madness to start prowling in the dark on unknown ground And for what end Unless to relieve the oppression Immobility lay on his limbs like a leaden garment And yet he was unwilling to give up He persisted in his objectless vigil The man of the island was keeping quiet It was at that moment that Ricardo s eyes caught the vanishing red trail of light made by the cigar a startling revelation of the man s wakefulness He could not suppress a low Hallo and began to sidle along towards the door with his shoulders rubbing the wall For all he knew the man might have been out in front by this time observing the veranda As a matter of fact after flinging away the cheroot Heyst had gone indoors with the feeling of a man who gives up an unprofitable occupation But Ricardo fancied he could hear faint footfalls on the open ground and dodged quickly into the room There he drew breath and meditated for a while His next step was to feel for the matches on the tall desk and to light the candle He had to communicate to his governor views and reflections of such importance that it was absolutely necessary for him to watch their effect on the very countenance of the hearer At first he had thought that these matters could have waited till daylight but Heyst s wakefulness disclosed in that startling way made him feel suddenly certain that there could be no sleep for him that night He said as much to his governor When the little dagger like flame had done its best to dispel the darkness mister Jones was to be seen reposing on a camp bedstead in a distant part of the room A railway rug concealed his spare form up to his very head which rested on the other railway rug rolled up for a pillow Ricardo plumped himself down cross legged on the floor very close to the low bedstead so that mister Jones who perhaps had not been so very profoundly asleep on opening his eyes found them conveniently levelled at the face of his secretary Eh What is it you say No sleep for you tonight But why can t you let me sleep Confound your fussiness Because that there fellow can t sleep that s why Dash me if he hasn t been doing a think just now What business has he to think in the middle of the night How do you know He was out sir up in the middle of the night My own eyes saw it But how do you know that he was up to think inquired mister Jones It might have been anything toothache for instance And you may have dreamed it for all I know Didn t you try to sleep No sir I didn t even try to go to sleep Ricardo informed his patron of his vigil on the veranda and of the revelation which put an end to it He concluded that a man up with a cigar in the middle of the night must be doing a think mister Jones raised himself on his elbow This sign of interest comforted his faithful henchman Seems to me it s time we did a little think ourselves added Ricardo with more assurance Long as they had been together the moods of his governor were still a source of anxiety to his simple soul You are always making a fuss remarked mister Jones in a tolerant tone Ay but not for nothing am I You can t say that sir Mine may not be a gentleman s way of looking round a thing but it isn t a fool s way either You ve admitted that much yourself at odd times Ricardo was growing warmly argumentative mister Jones interrupted him without heat You haven t roused me to talk about yourself I presume No sir Ricardo remained silent for a minute with the tip of his tongue caught between his teeth I don t think I could tell you anything about myself that you don t know he continued There was a sort of amused satisfaction in his tone which changed completely as he went on It s that man over there that s got to be talked over I don t like him He failed to observe the flicker of a ghastly smile on his governor s lips Don t you murmured mister Jones whose face as he reclined on his elbow was on a level with the top of his follower s head No sir said Ricardo emphatically The candle from the other side of the room threw his monstrous black shadow on the wall He I don t know how to say it he isn t hearty like mister Jones agreed languidly in his own manner He seems to be a very self possessed man Ay that s it Self Ricardo choked with indignation I would soon let out some of his self possession through a hole between his ribs if this weren t a special job mister Jones had been making his own reflections for he asked Do you think he is suspicious I don t see very well what he can be suspicious of pondered Ricardo Yet there he was doing a think And what could be the object of it What made him get out of his bed in the middle of the night Tain t fleas surely Bad conscience perhaps suggested mister Jones jocularly His faithful secretary suffered from irritation and did not see the joke In a fretful tone he declared that there was no such thing as conscience There was such a thing as funk but there was nothing to make that fellow funky in any special way He admitted however that the man might have been uneasy at the arrival of strangers because of all that plunder of his put away somewhere Ricardo glanced here and there as if he were afraid of being overheard by the heavy shadows cast by the dim light all over the room His patron very quiet spoke in a calm whisper And perhaps that hotel keeper has been lying to you about him He may be a very poor devil indeed Ricardo shook his head slightly The Schombergian theory of Heyst had become in him a profound conviction which he had absorbed as naturally as a sponge takes up water His patron s doubts were a wanton denying of what was self evident but Ricardo s voice remained as before a soft purring with a snarling undertone I am sup prised at you sir It s the very way them tame ones the common yporcrits of the world get on When it comes to plunder drifting under one s very nose there s not one of them that would keep his hands off And I don t blame them It s the way they do it that sets my back up Just look at the story of how he got rid of that pal of his Send a man home to croak of a cold on the chest that s one of your tame tricks And d you mean to say sir that a man that s up to it wouldn t bag whatever he could lay his hands in his yporcritical way What was all that coal business Tame citizen dodge yporcrisy nothing else No no sir The thing is to extract it from him as neatly as possible That s the job and it isn t so simple as it looks I reckon you have looked at it all round sir before you took up the notion of this trip No mister Jones was hardly audible staring far away from his couch I didn t think about it much I was bored Ay that you were bad I was feeling pretty desperate that afternoon when that bearded softy of a landlord got talking to me about this fellow here Quite accidentally it was Well sir here we are after a mighty narrow squeak I feel all limp yet but never mind his swag will pay for the lot He s all alone here remarked mister Jones in a hollow murmur Ye es in a way Yes alone enough Yes you may say he is There s that Chinaman though Ay there s the Chink assented Ricardo rather absentmindedly He was debating in his mind the advisability of making a clean breast of his knowledge of the girl s existence Finally he concluded he wouldn t The enterprise was difficult enough without complicating it with an upset to the sensibilities of the gentleman with whom he had the honour of being associated Let the discovery come of itself he thought and then he could swear that he had known nothing of that offensive presence He did not need to lie He had only to hold his tongue Yes he muttered reflectively there s that Chink certainly At bottom he felt a certain ambiguous respect for his governor s exaggerated dislike of women as if that horror of feminine presence were a sort of depraved morality but still morality since he counted it as an advantage It prevented many undesirable complications He did not pretend to understand it He did not even try to investigate this idiosyncrasy of his chief All he knew was that he himself was differently inclined and that it did not make him any happier or safer He did not know how he would have acted if he had been knocking about the world on his own Luckily he was a subordinate not a wage slave but a follower which was a restraint Yes The other sort of disposition simplified matters in general it wasn t to be gainsaid But it was clear that it could also complicate them as in this most important and in Ricardo s view already sufficiently delicate case And the worst of it was that one could not tell exactly in what precise manner it would act It was unnatural he thought somewhat peevishly How was one to reckon up the unnatural There were no rules for that The faithful henchman of plain mister Jones foreseeing many difficulties of a material order decided to keep the girl out of the governor s knowledge out of his sight too for as long a time as it could be managed That alas seemed to be at most a matter of a few hours whereas Ricardo feared that to get the affair properly going would take some days Once well started he was not afraid of his gentleman failing him As is often the case with lawless natures Ricardo s faith in any given individual was of a simple unquestioning character For man must have some support in life Cross legged his head drooping a little and perfectly still he might have been meditating in a bonze like attitude upon the sacred syllable Om It was a striking illustration of the untruth of appearances for his contempt for the world was of a severely practical kind There was nothing oriental about Ricardo but the amazing quietness of his pose mister Jones was also very quiet He had let his head sink on the rolled up rug and lay stretched out on his side with his back to the light In that position the shadows gathered in the cavities of his eyes made them look perfectly empty When he spoke his ghostly voice had only to travel a few inches straight into Ricardo s left ear Why don t you say something now that you ve got me awake I wonder if you were sleeping as sound as you are trying to make out sir said the unmoved Ricardo I wonder repeated mister Jones At any rate I was resting quietly Come sir Ricardo s whisper was alarmed You don t mean to say you re going to be bored No Quite right The secretary was very much relieved There s no occasion to be I can tell you sir he whispered earnestly Anything but that If I didn t say anything for a bit it ain t because there isn t plenty to talk about Ay more than enough What s the matter with you breathed out his patron Are you going to turn pessimist Me turn No sir I ain t of those that turn You may call me hard names if you like but you know very well that I ain t a croaker Ricardo changed his tone If I said nothing for a while it was because I was meditating over the Chink sir You were Waste of time my Martin A Chinaman is unfathomable Ricardo admitted that this might be so Anyhow a Chink was neither here nor there as a general thing unfathomable as he might be but a Swedish baron wasn t couldn t be The woods were full of such barons I don t know that he is so tame was mister Jones s remark in a sepulchral undertone How do you mean sir He ain t a rabbit of course You couldn t hypnotize him as I saw you do to more than one Dago and other kinds of tame citizens when it came to the point of holding them down to a game Don t you reckon on that murmured plain mister Jones seriously No sir I don t though you have a wonderful power of the eye It s a fact I have a wonderful patience remarked mister Jones dryly A dim smile flitted over the lips of the faithful Ricardo who never raised his head I don t want to try you too much sir but this is like no other job we ever turned our minds to Perhaps not At any rate let us think so A weariness with the monotony of life was reflected in the tone of this qualified assent It jarred on the nerves of the sanguine Ricardo Let us think of the way to go to work he retorted a little impatiently He s a deep one Just look at the way he treated that chum of his Did you ever hear of anything so low And the artfulness of the beast the dirty tame artfulness Don t you start moralizing Martin said mister Jones warningly As far as I can make out the story that German hotel keeper told you it seems to show a certain amount of character and independence from common feelings which is not usual It s very remarkable if true Ay ay Very remarkable It s mighty low down all the same muttered Ricardo obstinately I must say I am glad to think he will be paid off for it in a way that ll surprise him The tip of his tongue appeared lively for an instant as if trying for the taste of that ferocious retribution on his compressed lips For Ricardo was sincere in his indignation before the elementary principle of loyalty to a chum violated in cold blood slowly in a patient duplicity of years There are standards in villainy as in virtue and the act as he pictured it to himself acquired an additional horror from the slow pace of that treachery so atrocious and so tame But he understood too the educated judgement of his governor a gentleman looking on all this with the privileged detachment of a cultivated mind of an elevated personality Ay he s deep he s artful he mumbled between his sharp teeth Confound you mister Jones s calm whisper crept into his ear Come to the point Obedient the secretary shook off his thoughtfulness There was a similarity of mind between these two one the outcast of his vices the other inspired by a spirit of scornful defiance the aggressiveness of a beast of prey looking upon all the tame creatures of the earth as its natural victim Both were astute enough however and both were aware that they had plunged into this adventure without a sufficient scrutiny of detail The figure of a lonely man far from all assistance had loomed up largely fascinating and defenceless in the middle of the sea filling the whole field of their vision There had not seemed to be any need for thinking As Schomberg had been saying Three to one But it did not look so simple now in the face of that solitude which was like an armour for this man The feeling voiced by the henchman in his own way We don t seem much forwarder now we are here was acknowledged by the silence of the patron It was easy enough to rip a fellow up or drill a hole in him whether he was alone or not Ricardo reflected in low confidential tones but He isn t alone mister Jones said faintly in his attitude of a man composed for sleep Don t forget that Chinaman Ricardo started slightly Oh ay the Chink Ricardo had been on the point of confessing about the girl but no He wanted his governor to be unperturbed and steady Vague thoughts which he hardly dared to look in the face were stirring his brain in connection with that girl She couldn t be much account he thought She could be frightened And there were also other possibilities The Chink however could be considered openly What I was thinking about it sir he went on earnestly is this here we ve got a man He s nothing If he won t be good he can be made quiet That s easy But then there s his plunder He doesn t carry it in his pocket I hope not breathed mister Jones Same here It s too big we know but if he were alone he would not feel worried about it overmuch I mean the safety of the pieces He would just put the lot into any box or drawer that was handy Would he Yes sir He would keep it under his eye as it were Why not It is natural A fellow doesn t put his swag underground unless there s a very good reason for it A very good reason eh Yes sir What do you think a fellow is a mole From his experience Ricardo declared that man was not a burrowing beast Even the misers very seldom buried their hoard unless for exceptional reasons In the given situation of a man alone on an island the company of a Chink was a very good reason Drawers would not be safe nor boxes either from a prying slant eyed Chink No sir unless a safe a proper office safe But the safe was there in the room Is there a safe in this room I didn t notice it whispered mister Jones That was because the thing was painted white like the walls of the room and besides it was tucked away in the shadows of a corner mister Jones had been too tired to observe anything on his first coming ashore but Ricardo had very soon spotted the characteristic form He only wished he could believe that the plunder of treachery duplicity and all the moral abominations of Heyst had been there But no the blamed thing was open It might have been there at one time or another he commented gloomily but it isn t there now The man did not elect to live in this house remarked mister Jones And by the by what could he have meant by speaking of circumstances which prevented him lodging us in the other bungalow You remember what he said Martin Sounded cryptic Martin who remembered and understood the phrase as directly motived by the existence of the girl waited a little before saying Some of his artfulness sir and not the worst of it either That manner of his to us this asking no questions is some more of his artfulness A man s bound to be curious and he is yet he goes on as if he didn t care He does care or else what was he doing up with a cigar in the middle of the night doing a think I don t like it He may be outside observing the light here and saying the very same thing to himself of our own wakefulness gravely suggested Ricardo s governor He may be sir but this is too important to be talked over in the dark And the light is all right it can be accounted for There s a light in this bungalow in the middle of the night because why because you are not well Not well sir that s what s the matter and you will have to act up to it The consideration had suddenly occurred to the faithful henchman in the light of a felicitous expedient to keep his governor and the girl apart as long as possible mister Jones received the suggestion without the slightest stir even in the deep sockets of his eyes where a steady faint gleam was the only thing telling of life and attention in his attenuated body But Ricardo as soon as he had enunciated his happy thought perceived in it other possibilities more to the point and of greater practical advantage With your looks sir it will be easy enough he went on evenly as if no silence had intervened always respectful but frank with perfect simplicity of purpose All you ve got to do is just to lie down quietly I noticed him looking sort of surprised at you on the wharf sir At these words a naive tribute to the aspect of his physique even more suggestive of the grave than of the sick bed a fold appeared on that side of the governor s face which was exposed to the dim light a deep shadowy semicircular fold from the side of the nose to bottom of the chin a silent smile By a side glance Ricardo had noted this play of features He smiled too appreciative encouraged And you as hard as nails all the time he went on Hang me if anybody would believe you aren t sick if I were to swear myself black in the face Give us a day or two to look into matters and size up that yporcrit Ricardo s eyes remained fixed on his crossed shins The chief in his lifeless accents approved Perhaps it would be a good idea The Chink he s nothing He can be made quiet any time One of Ricardo s hands reposing palm upwards on his folded legs made a swift thrusting gesture repeated by the enormous darting shadow of an arm very low on the wall It broke the spell of perfect stillness in the room The secretary eyed moodily the wall from which the shadow had gone Anybody could be made quiet he pointed out It was not anything that the Chink could do no it was the effect that his company must have produced on the conduct of the doomed man A man What was a man A Swedish baron could be ripped up or else holed by a shot as easily as any other creature but that was exactly what was to be avoided till one knew where he had hidden his plunder I shouldn t think it would be some sort of hole in his bungalow argued Ricardo with real anxiety No A house can be burnt set on fire accidentally or on purpose while a man s asleep Under the house or in some crack cranny or crevice Something told him it wasn t that The anguish of mental effort contracted Ricardo s brow The skin of his head seemed to move in this travail of vain and tormenting suppositions What did you think a fellow is sir a baby he said in answer to mister Jones s objections I am trying to find out what I would do myself He wouldn t be likely to be cleverer than I am And what do you know about yourself mister Jones seemed to watch his follower s perplexities with amusement concealed in a death like composure Ricardo disregarded the question The material vision of the spoil absorbed all his faculties A great vision He seemed to see it A few small canvas bags tied up with thin cord their distended rotundity showing the inside pressure of the disk like forms of coins gold solid heavy eminently portable Perhaps steel cash boxes with a chased design on the covers or perhaps a black and brass box with a handle on the top and full of goodness knows what Bank notes Why not The fellow had been going home so it was surely something worth going home with And he may have put it anywhere outside anywhere cried Ricardo in a deadened voice in the forest That was it A temporary darkness replaced the dim light of the room The darkness of the forest at night and in it the gleam of a lantern by which a figure is digging at the foot of a tree trunk As likely as not another figure holding that lantern ha feminine The girl The prudent Ricardo stifled a picturesque and profane exclamation partly joy partly dismay Had the girl been trusted or mistrusted by that man Whatever it was it was bound to be wholly With women there could be no half measures He could not imagine a fellow half trusting a woman in that intimate relation to himself and in those particular circumstances of conquest and loneliness where no confidences could appear dangerous since apparently there could be no one she could give him away to Moreover in nine cases out of ten the woman would be trusted But trusted or mistrusted was her presence a favourable or unfavourable condition of the problem That was the question The temptation to consult his chief to talk over the weighty fact and get his opinion on it was great indeed Ricardo resisted it but the agony of his solitary mental conflict was extremely sharp A woman in a problem is an incalculable quantity even if you have something to go upon in forming your guess How much more so when you haven t even once caught sight of her Swift as were his mental processes he felt that a longer silence was inadvisable He hastened to speak And do you see us sir you and I with a couple of spades having to tackle this whole confounded island He allowed himself a slight movement of the arm The shadow enlarged it into a sweeping gesture This seems rather discouraging Martin murmured the unmoved governor We mustn t be discouraged that s all retorted his henchman And after what we had to go through in that boat too Why it would be He couldn t find the qualifying words Very calm faithful and yet astute he expressed his new born hopes darkly Something s sure to turn up to give us a hint only this job can t be rushed You may depend on me to pick up the least little bit of a hint but you sir you ve got to play him very gently For the rest you can trust me Yes but I ask myself what YOU are trusting to Our luck said the faithful Ricardo Don t say a word against that It might spoil the run of it You are a superstitious beggar No I won t say anything against it That s right sir Don t you even think lightly of it Luck s not to be played with Yes luck s a delicate thing assented mister Jones in a dreamy whisper A short silence ensued which Ricardo ended in a discreet and tentative voice Talking of luck I suppose he could be made to take a hand with you sir two handed picket or ekkarty you being seedy and keeping indoors just to pass the time For all we know he may be one of them hot ones once they start Is it likely came coldly from the principal Considering what we know of his history say with his partner True sir He s a cold blooded beast a cold blooded inhuman And I ll tell you another thing that isn t likely He would not be likely to let himself be stripped bare We haven t to do with a young fool that can be led on by chaff or flattery and in the end simply overawed This is a calculating man Ricardo recognized that clearly What he had in his mind was something on a small scale just to keep the enemy busy while he Ricardo had time to nose around a bit You could even lose a little money to him sir he suggested I could Ricardo was thoughtful for a moment He strikes me too as the sort of man to start prancing when one didn t expect it What do you think sir Is he a man that would prance That is if something startled him More likely to prance than to run what The answer came at once because mister Jones understood the peculiar idiom of his faithful follower Oh without doubt Without doubt It does me good to hear that you think so He s a prancing beast and so we mustn t startle him not till I have located the stuff Afterwards Ricardo paused sinister in the stillness of his pose Suddenly he got up with a swift movement and gazed down at his chief in moody abstraction mister Jones did not stir There s one thing that s worrying me began Ricardo in a subdued voice Only one was the faint comment from the motionless body on the bedstead I mean more than all the others put together That s grave news Ay grave enough It s this how do you feel in yourself sir Are you likely to get bored I know them fits come on you suddenly but surely you can tell Martin you are an ass The moody face of the secretary brightened up Really sir Well I am quite content to be on these terms I mean as long as you don t get bored It wouldn t do sir For coolness Ricardo had thrown open his shirt and rolled up his sleeves He moved stealthily across the room bare footed towards the candle the shadow of his head and shoulders growing bigger behind him on the opposite wall to which the face of plain mister Jones was turned With a feline movement Ricardo glanced over his shoulder at the thin back of the spectre reposing on the bed and then blew out the candle In fact I am rather amused Martin mister Jones said in the dark He heard the sound of a slapped thigh and the jubilant exclamation of his henchman Good That s the way to talk sir PART FOUR CHAPTER ONE Ricardo advanced prudently by short darts from one tree trunk to another more in the manner of a squirrel than a cat The sun had risen some time before Already the sparkle of open sea was encroaching rapidly on the dark cool early morning blue of Diamond Bay but the deep dusk lingered yet under the mighty pillars of the forest between which the secretary dodged He was watching Number One s bungalow with an animal like patience if with a very human complexity of purpose This was the second morning of such watching The first one had not been rewarded by success Well strictly speaking there was no hurry The sun swinging above the ridge all at once inundated with light the space of burnt grass in front of Ricardo and the face of the bungalow on which his eyes were fixed leaving only the one dark spot of the doorway To his right to his left and behind him splashes of gold appeared in the deep shade of the forest thinning the gloom under the ragged roof of leaves This was not a very favourable circumstance for Ricardo s purpose He did not wish to be detected in his patient occupation For what he was watching for was a sight of the girl that girl just a glimpse across the burnt patch to see what she was like He had excellent eyes and the distance was not so great He would be able to distinguish her face quite easily if she only came out on the veranda and she was bound to do that sooner or later He was confident that he could form some opinion about her which he felt was very necessary before venturing on some steps to get in touch with her behind that Swedish baron s back His theoretical view of the girl was such that he was quite prepared on the strength of that distant examination to show himself discreetly perhaps even make a sign It all depended on his reading of the face She couldn t be much He knew that sort By protruding his head a little he commanded through the foliage of a festooning creeper a view of the three bungalows Irregularly disposed along a flat curve over the veranda rail of the farthermost one hung a dark rug of a tartan pattern amazingly conspicuous Ricardo could see the very checks A brisk fire of sticks was burning on the ground in front of the steps and in the sunlight the thin fluttering flame had paled almost to invisibility a mere rosy stir under a faint wreath of smoke He could see the white bandage on the head of Pedro bending over it and the wisps of black hair standing up weirdly He had wound that bandage himself after breaking that shaggy and enormous head The creature balanced it like a load staggering towards the steps Ricardo could see a small long handled saucepan at the end of a great hairy paw Yes he could see all that there was to be seen far and near Excellent eyes The only thing they could not penetrate was the dark oblong of the doorway on the veranda under the low eaves of the bungalow s roof And that was vexing It was an outrage Ricardo was easily outraged Surely she would come out presently Why didn t she Surely the fellow did not tie her up to the bedpost before leaving the house Nothing appeared Ricardo was as still as the leafy cables of creepers depending in a convenient curtain from the mighty limb sixty feet above his head His very eyelids were still and this unblinking watchfulness gave him the dreamy air of a cat posed on a hearth rug contemplating the fire Was he dreaming There in plain sight he had before him a white blouse like jacket short blue trousers a pair of bare yellow calves a pigtail long and slender The confounded Chink he muttered astounded He was not conscious of having looked away and yet right there in the middle of the picture without having come round the right hand corner or the left hand corner of the house without falling from the sky or surging up from the ground Wang had become visible large as life and engaged in the young ladyish occupation of picking flowers Step by step stooping repeatedly over the flower beds at the foot of the veranda the startlingly materialized Chinaman passed off the scene in a very commonplace manner by going up the steps and disappearing in the darkness of the doorway Only then the yellow eyes of Martin Ricardo lost their intent fixity He understood that it was time for him to be moving That bunch of flowers going into the house in the hand of a Chinaman was for the breakfast table What else could it be for I ll give you flowers he muttered threateningly You wait Another moment just for a glance towards the Jones bungalow whence he expected Heyst to issue on his way to that breakfast so offensively decorated and Ricardo began his retreat His impulse his desire was for a rush into the open face to face with the appointed victim for what he called a ripping up visualized greedily and always with the swift preliminary stooping movement on his part the forerunner of certain death to his adversary This was his impulse and as it was so to speak constitutional it was extremely difficult to resist when his blood was up What could be more trying than to have to skulk and dodge and restrain oneself mentally and physically when one s blood was up mister Secretary Ricardo began his retreat from his post of observation behind a tree opposite Heyst s bungalow using great care to remain unseen His proceedings were made easier by the declivity of the ground which sloped sharply down to the water s edge There his feet feeling the warmth of the island s rocky foundation already heated by the sun through the thin soles of his straw slippers he was as it were sunk out of sight of the houses A short scramble of some twenty feet brought him up again to the upper level at the place where the jetty had its root in the shore He leaned his back against one of the lofty uprights which still held up the company s signboard above the mound of derelict coal Nobody could have guessed how much his blood was up To contain himself he folded his arms tightly on his breast Ricardo was not used to a prolonged effort of self control His craft his artfulness felt themselves always at the mercy of his nature which was truly feral and only held in subjection by the influence of the governor the prestige of a gentleman It had its cunning too but it was being almost too severely tried since the feral solution of a growl and a spring was forbidden by the problem Ricardo dared not venture out on the cleared ground He dared not If I meet the beggar he thought I don t know what I mayn t do I daren t trust myself What exasperated him just now was his inability to understand Heyst Ricardo was human enough to suffer from the discovery of his limitations No he couldn t size Heyst up He could kill him with extreme ease a growl and a spring but that was forbidden However he could not remain indefinitely under the funereal blackboard I must make a move he thought He moved on his head swimming a little with the repressed desire of violence and came out openly in front of the bungalows as if he had just been down to the jetty to look at the boat The sunshine enveloped him very brilliant very still very hot The three buildings faced him The one with the rug on the balustrade was the most distant next to it was the empty bungalow the nearest with the flower beds at the foot of its veranda contained that bothersome girl who had managed so provokingly to keep herself invisible That was why Ricardo s eyes lingered on that building The girl would surely be easier to size up than Heyst A sight of her a mere glimpse would have been something to go by a step nearer to the goal the first real move in fact Ricardo saw no other move And any time she might appear on that veranda She did not appear but like a concealed magnet she exercised her attraction As he went on he deviated towards the bungalow Though his movements were deliberate his feral instincts had such sway that if he had met Heyst walking towards him he would have had to satisfy his need of violence But he saw nobody Wang was at the back of the house keeping the coffee hot against Number One s return for breakfast Even the simian Pedro was out of sight no doubt crouching on the door step his red little eyes fastened with animal like devotion on mister Jones who was in discourse with Heyst in the other bungalow the conversation of an evil spectre with a disarmed man watched by an ape His will having very little to do with it Ricardo darting swift glances in all directions found himself at the steps of the Heyst bungalow Once there falling under an uncontrollable force of attraction he mounted them with a savage and stealthy action of his limbs and paused for a moment under the eaves to listen to the silence Presently he advanced over the threshold one leg it seemed to stretch itself like a limb of india rubber planted his foot within brought up the other swiftly and stood inside the room turning his head from side to side To his eyes brought in there from the dazzling sunshine all was gloom for a moment His pupils like a cat s dilating swiftly he distinguished an enormous quantity of books He was amazed and he was put off too He was vexed in his astonishment He had meant to note the aspect and nature of things and hoped to draw some useful inference some hint as to the man But what guess could one make out of a multitude of books He didn t know what to think and he formulated his bewilderment in the mental exclamation What the devil has this fellow been trying to set up here a school He gave a prolonged stare to the portrait of Heyst s father that severe profile ignoring the vanities of this earth His eyes gleamed sideways at the heavy silver candlesticks signs of opulence He prowled as a stray cat entering a strange place might have done for if Ricardo had not Wang s miraculous gift of materializing and vanishing rather than coming and going he could be nearly as noiseless in his less elusive movements He noted the back door standing just ajar and all the time his slightly pointed ears at the utmost stretch of watchfulness kept in touch with the profound silence outside enveloping the absolute stillness of the house He had not been in the room two minutes when it occurred to him that he must be alone in the bungalow The woman most likely had sneaked out and was walking about somewhere in the grounds at the back She had been probably ordered to keep out of sight Why Because the fellow mistrusted his guests or was it because he mistrusted her Ricardo reflected that from a certain point of view it amounted nearly to the same thing He remembered Schomberg s story He felt that running away with somebody only to get clear of that beastly tame hotel keeper s attention was no proof of hopeless infatuation She could be got in touch with His moustaches stirred For some time he had been looking at a closed door He would peep into that other room and perhaps see something more informing than a confounded lot of books As he crossed over he thought recklessly If the beggar comes in suddenly and starts to prance I ll rip him up and be done with it He laid his hand on the handle and felt the door come unlatched Before he pulled it open he listened again to the silence He felt it all about him complete without a flaw The necessity of prudence had exasperated his self restraint A mood of ferocity woke up in him and as always at such times he became physically aware of the sheeted knife strapped to his leg He pulled at the door with fierce curiosity It came open without a squeak of hinge without a rustle with no sound at all and he found himself glaring at the opaque surface of some rough blue stuff like serge A curtain was fitted inside heavy enough and long enough not to stir A curtain This unforeseen veil baffling his curiosity checked his brusqueness He did not fling it aside with an impatient movement he only looked at it closely as if its texture had to be examined before his hand could touch such stuff In this interval of hesitation he seemed to detect a flaw in the perfection of the silence the faintest possible rustle which his ears caught and instantly in the effort of conscious listening lost again No Everything was still inside and outside the house only he had no longer the sense of being alone there When he put out his hand towards the motionless folds it was with extreme caution and merely to push the stuff aside a little advancing his head at the same time to peep within A moment of complete immobility ensued Then without anything else of him stirring Ricardo s head shrank back on his shoulders his arm descended slowly to his side There was a woman in there The very woman Lighted dimly by the reflection of the outer glare she loomed up strangely big and shadowy at the other end of the long narrow room With her back to the door she was doing her hair with bare arms uplifted One of them gleamed pearly white the other detached its perfect form in black against the unshuttered uncurtained square window hole She was there her fingers busy with her dark hair utterly unconscious exposed and defenceless and tempting Ricardo drew back one foot and pressed his elbows close to his sides his chest started heaving convulsively as if he were wrestling or running a race his body began to sway gently back and forth The self restraint was at an end his psychology must have its way The instinct for the feral spring could no longer be denied Ravish or kill it was all one to him as long as by the act he liberated the suffering soul of savagery repressed for so long After a quick glance over his shoulder which hunters of big game tell us no lion or tiger omits to give before charging home Ricardo charged head down straight at the curtain The stuff tossed up violently by his rush settled itself with a slow floating descent into vertical folds motionless without a shudder even in the still warm air CHAPTER TWO The clock which once upon a time had measured the hours of philosophic meditation could not have ticked away more than five seconds when Wang materialized within the living room His concern primarily was with the delayed breakfast but at once his slanting eyes became immovably fixed upon the unstirring curtain For it was behind it that he had located the strange deadened scuffling sounds which filled the empty room The slanting eyes of his race could not achieve a round amazed stare but they remained still dead still and his impassive yellow face grew all at once careworn and lean with the sudden strain of intense doubtful frightened watchfulness Contrary impulses swayed his body rooted to the floor mats He even went so far as to extend his hand towards the curtain He could not reach it and he didn t make the necessary step forward The mysterious struggle was going on with confused thuds of bare feet in a mute wrestling match no human sound hiss groan murmur or exclamation coming through the curtain A chair fell over not with a crash but lightly as if just grazed and a faint metallic ring of the tin bath succeeded Finally the tense silence as of two adversaries locked in a deadly grip was ended by the heavy dull thump of a soft body flung against the inner partition of planks It seemed to shake the whole bungalow By that time walking backward his eyes his very throat strained with fearful excitement his extended arm still pointing at the curtain Wang had disappeared through the back door Once out in the compound he bolted round the end of the house Emerging innocently between the two bungalows he lingered and lounged in the open where anybody issuing from any of the dwellings was bound to see him a self possessed Chinaman idling there with nothing but perhaps an unserved breakfast on his mind It was at this time that Wang made up his mind to give up all connection with Number One a man not only disarmed but already half vanquished Till that morning he had had doubts as to his course of action but this overheard scuffle decided the question Number One was a doomed man one of those beings whom it is unlucky to help Even as he walked in the open with a fine air of unconcern Wang wondered that no sound of any sort was to be heard inside the house For all he knew the white woman might have been scuffling in there with an evil spirit which had of course killed her For nothing visible came out of the house he watched out of the slanting corner of his eye The sunshine and the silence outside the bungalow reigned undisturbed But in the house the silence of the big room would not have struck an acute ear as perfect It was troubled by a stir so faint that it could hardly be called a ghost of whispering from behind the curtain Ricardo feeling his throat with tender care breathed out admiringly You have fingers like steel Jimminy You have muscles like a giant Luckily for Lena Ricardo s onset had been so sudden she was winding her two heavy tresses round her head that she had no time to lower her arms This which saved them from being pinned to her sides gave her a better chance to resist His spring had nearly thrown her down Luckily again she was standing so near the wall that though she was driven against it headlong yet the shock was not heavy enough to knock all the breath out of her body On the contrary it helped her first instinctive attempt to drive her assailant backward After the first gasp of a surprise that was really too over powering for a cry she was never in doubt of the nature of her danger She defended herself in the full clear knowledge of it from the force of instinct which is the true source of every great display of energy and with a determination which could hardly have been expected from a girl who cornered in a dim corridor by the red faced stammering Schomberg had trembled with shame disgust and fear had drooped terrified before mere words spluttered out odiously by a man who had never in his life laid his big paw on her This new enemy s attack was simple straightforward violence It was not the slimy underhand plotting to deliver her up like a slave which had sickened her heart and had made her feel in her loneliness that her oppressors were too many for her She was no longer alone in the world now She resisted without a moment of faltering because she was no longer deprived of moral support because she was a human being who counted because she was no longer defending herself for herself alone because of the faith that had been born in her the faith in the man of her destiny and perhaps in the Heaven which had sent him so wonderfully to cross her path She had defended herself principally by maintaining a desperate murderous clutch on Ricardo s windpipe till she felt a sudden relaxation of the terrific hug in which he stupidly and ineffectually persisted to hold her Then with a supreme effort of her arms and of her suddenly raised knee she sent him flying against the partition The cedar wood chest stood in the way and Ricardo with a thump which boomed hollow through the whole bungalow fell on it in a sitting posture half strangled and exhausted not so much by the efforts as by the emotions of the struggle With the recoil of her exerted strength she too reeled staggered back and sat on the edge of the bed Out of breath but calm and unabashed she busied herself in readjusting under her arms the brown and yellow figured Celebes sarong the tuck of which had come undone during the fight Then folding her bare arms tightly on her breast she leaned forward on her crossed legs determined and without fear Ricardo leaning forward too his nervous force gone crestfallen like a beast of prey that has missed its spring met her big grey eyes looking at him wide open observing mysterious from under the dark arches of her courageous eyebrows Their faces were not a foot apart He ceased feeling about his aching throat and dropped the palms of his hands heavily on his knees He was not looking at her bare shoulders at her strong arms he was looking down at the floor He had lost one of his straw slippers A chair with a white dress on it had been overturned These with splashes of water on the floor out of a brusquely misplaced sponge bath were the only traces of the struggle Ricardo swallowed twice consciously as if to make sure of his throat before he spoke again All right I never meant to hurt you though I am no joker when it comes to it He pulled up the leg of his pyjamas to exhibit the strapped knife She glanced at it without moving her head and murmured with scornful bitterness Ah yes with that thing stuck in my side In no other way He shook his head with a shamefaced smile Listen I am quiet now Straight I am I don t need to explain why you know how it is And I can see now this wasn t the way with you She made no sound Her still upward gaze had a patient mournfulness which troubled him like a suggestion of an inconceivable depth He added thoughtfully You are not going to make a noise about this silly try of mine She moved her head the least bit Jee miny You are a wonder he murmured earnestly relieved more than she could have guessed Of course if she had attempted to run out he would have stuck the knife between her shoulders to stop her screaming but all the fat would have been in the fire the business utterly spoiled and the rage of the governor especially when he learned the cause boundless A woman that does not make a noise after an attempt of that kind has tacitly condoned the offence Ricardo had no small vanities But clearly if she would pass it over like this then he could not be so utterly repugnant to her He felt flattered And she didn t seem afraid of him either He already felt almost tender towards the girl that plucky fine girl who had not tried to run screaming from him We shall be friends yet I don t give you up Don t think it Friends as friends can be he whispered confidently Jee miny You aren t a tame one Neither am I You will find that out before long He could not know that if she had not run out it was because that morning under the stress of growing uneasiness at the presence of the incomprehensible visitors Heyst had confessed to her that it was his revolver he had been looking for in the night that it was gone that he was a disarmed defenceless man She had hardly comprehended the meaning of his confession Now she understood better what it meant The effort of her self control her stillness impressed Ricardo Suddenly she spoke What are you after He did not raise his eyes His hands reposing on his knees his drooping head something reflective in his pose suggested the weariness of a simple soul the fatigue of a mental rather than physical contest He answered the direct question by a direct statement as if he were too tired to dissemble After the swag The word was strange to her The veiled ardour of her grey gaze from under the dark eyebrows never left Ricardo s A swag she murmured quietly What s that Why swag plunder what your gentleman has been pinching right and left for years the pieces Don t you know This Without looking up he made the motion of counting money into the palm of his hand She lowered her eyes slightly to observe this bit of pantomime but returned them to his face at once Then in a mere breath How do you know anything about him she asked concealing her puzzled alarm What has it got to do with you Everything was Ricardo s concise answer in a low emphatic whisper He reflected that this girl was really his best hope Out of the unfaded impression of past violence there was growing the sort of sentiment which prevents a man from being indifferent to a woman he has once held in his arms if even against her will and still more so if she has pardoned the outrage It becomes then a sort of bond He felt positively the need to confide in her a subtle trait of masculinity this almost physical need of trust which can exist side by side with the most brutal readiness of suspicion It s a game of grab see he went on with a new inflection of intimacy in his murmur He was looking straight at her now That fat tame slug of a gin slinger Schomberg put us up to it So strong is the impression of helpless and persecuted misery that the girl who had fought down a savage assault without faltering could not completely repress a shudder at the mere sound of the abhorred name Ricardo became more rapid and confidential He wants to pay him off pay both of you at that so he told me He was hot after you He would have given all he had into those hands of yours that have nearly strangled me But you couldn t eh Nohow what He paused So rather than you followed a gentleman He noticed a slight movement of her head and spoke quickly Same here rather than be a wage slave Only these foreigners aren t to be trusted You re too good for him A man that will rob his best chum She raised her head He went on well pleased with his progress whispering hurriedly Yes I know all about him So you may guess how he s likely to treat a woman after a bit He did not know that he was striking terror into her breast now Still the grey eyes remained fixed on him unmovably watchful as if sleepy under the white forehead She was beginning to understand His words conveyed a definite dreadful meaning to her mind which he proceeded to enlighten further in a convinced murmur You and I are made to understand each other Born alike bred alike I guess You are not tame Same here You have been chucked out into this rotten world of yporcrits Same here Her stillness her appalled stillness wore to him an air of fascinated attention He asked abruptly Where is it She made an effort to breathe out Where s what His tone expressed excited secrecy The swag plunder pieces It s a game of grab We must have it but it isn t easy and so you will have to lend a hand Come is it kept in the house As often with women her wits were sharpened by the very terror of the glimpsed menace She shook her head negatively No Sure Sure she said Ay Thought so Does your gentleman trust you Again she shook her head Blamed yporcrit he said feelingly and then reflected He s one of the tame ones ain t he You had better find out for yourself she said You trust me I don t want to die before you and I have made friends This was said with a strange air of feline gallantry Then tentatively But he could be brought to trust you couldn t he Trust me she said in a tone which bordered on despair but which he mistook for derision Stand in with us he urged Give the chuck to all this blamed yporcrisy Perhaps without being trusted you have managed to find out something already eh Perhaps I have she uttered with lips that seemed to her to be freezing fast Ricardo now looked at her calm face with something like respect He was even a little awed by her stillness by her economy of words Womanlike she felt the effect she had produced the effect of knowing much and of keeping all her knowledge in reserve So far somehow this had come about of itself Thus encouraged directed in the way of duplicity the refuge of the weak she made a heroically conscious effort and forced her stiff cold lips into a smile Duplicity the refuge of the weak and the cowardly but of the disarmed too Nothing stood between the enchanted dream of her existence and a cruel catastrophe but her duplicity It seemed to her that the man sitting there before her was an unavoidable presence which had attended all her life He was the embodied evil of the world She was not ashamed of her duplicity With a woman s frank courage as soon as she saw that opening she threw herself into it without reserve with only one doubt that of her own strength She was appalled by the situation but already all her aroused femininity understanding that whether Heyst loved her or not she loved him and feeling that she had brought this on his head faced the danger with a passionate desire to defend her own CHAPTER THREE To Ricardo the girl had been so unforeseen that he was unable to bring upon her the light of his critical faculties Her smile appeared to him full of promise He had not expected her to be what she was Who from the talk he had heard could expect to meet a girl like this She was a blooming miracle he said to himself familiarly yet with a tinge of respect She was no meat for the likes of that tame respectable gin slinger Ricardo grew hot with indignation Her courage her physical strength demonstrated at the cost of his discomfiture commanded his sympathy He felt himself drawn to her by the proofs of her amazing spirit Such a girl She had a strong soul and her reflective disposition to throw over her connection proved that she was no hypocrite Is your gentleman a good shot he said looking down on the floor again as if indifferent She hardly understood the phrase but in its form it suggested some accomplishment It was safe to whisper an affirmative Yes Mine too and better than good Ricardo murmured and then in a confidential burst I am not so good at it but I carry a pretty deadly thing about me all the same He tapped his leg She was past the stage of shudders now Stiff all over unable even to move her eyes she felt an awful mental tension which was like blank forgetfulness Ricardo tried to influence her in his own way And my gentleman is not the sort that would drop me He ain t no foreigner whereas you with your baron you don t know what s before you or rather being a woman you know only too well Much better not to wait for the chuck Pile in with us and get your share of the plunder I mean You have some notion about it already She felt that if she as much as hinted by word or sign that there was no such thing on the island Heyst s life wouldn t be worth half an hour s purchase but all power of combining words had vanished in the tension of her mind Words themselves were too difficult to think of all except the word yes the saving word She whispered it with not a feature of her face moving To Ricardo the faint and concise sound proved a cool reserved assent more worth having from that amazing mistress of herself than a thousand words from any other woman He thought with exultation that he had come upon one in a million in ten millions His whisper became frankly entreating That s good Now all you ve got to do is to make sure where he keeps his swag Only do be quick about it I can t stand much longer this crawling on the stomach business so as not to scare your gentleman What do you think a fellow is a reptile She stared without seeing anyone as a person in the night sits staring and listening to deadly sounds to evil incantations And always in her head there was that tension of the mind trying to get hold of something of a saving idea which seemed to be so near and could not be captured Suddenly she seized it Yes she had to get that man out of the house At that very moment raised outside not very near but heard distinctly Heyst s voice uttered the words Have you been looking out for me Wang It was for her like a flash of lightning framed in the darkness which had beset her on all sides showing a deadly precipice right under her feet With a convulsive movement she sat up straight but had no power to rise Ricardo on the contrary was on his feet on the instant as noiseless as a cat His yellow eyes gleamed gliding here and there but he too seemed unable to make another movement Only his moustaches stirred visibly like the feelers of some animal Wang s answer Ya tuan was heard by the two in the room but more faintly Then Heyst again All right You may bring the coffee in Mem Putih out in the room yet To this question Wang made no answer Ricardo s and the girl s eyes met utterly without expression all their faculties being absorbed in listening for the first sound of Heyst s footsteps for any sound outside which would mean that Ricardo s retreat was cut off Both understood perfectly well that Wang must have gone round the house and that he was now at the back making it impossible for Ricardo to slip out unseen that way before Heyst came in at the front A darkling shade settled on the face of the devoted secretary Here was the business utterly spoiled It was the gloom of anger and even of apprehension He would perhaps have made a dash for it through the back door if Heyst had not been heard ascending the front steps He climbed them slowly very slowly like a man who is discouraged or weary or simply thoughtful and Ricardo had a mental vision of his face with its martial moustache the lofty forehead the impassive features and the quiet meditative eyes Trapped Confound it After all perhaps the governor was right Women had to be shunned Fooling with this one had apparently ruined the whole business For trapped as he was he might just as well kill since anyhow to be seen was to be unmasked But he was too fair minded to be angry with the girl Heyst had paused on the veranda or in the very doorway I shall be shot down like a dog if I ain t quick Ricardo muttered excitedly to the girl He stooped to get hold of his knife and the next moment would have hurled himself out through the curtain nearly as prompt and fully as deadly to Heyst as an unexpected thunderbolt The feel more than the strength of the girl s hand clutching at his shoulder checked him He swung round crouching with a yellow upward glare Ah Was she turning against him He would have stuck his knife into the hollow of her bare throat if he had not seen her other hand pointing to the window It was a long opening high up close under the ceiling almost with a single pivoting shutter While he was still looking at it she moved noiselessly away picking up the overturned chair and placed it under the wall Then she looked round but he didn t need to be beckoned to In two long tiptoeing strides he was at her side Be quick she gasped He seized her hand and wrung it with all the force of his dumb gratitude as a man does to a chum when there is no time for words Then he mounted the chair Ricardo was short too short to get over without a noisy scramble He hesitated an instant she watchful bore rigidly on the seat with her beautiful bare arms while light and sure he used the back of the chair as a ladder The masses of her brown hair fell all about her face Footsteps resounded in the next room and Heyst s voice not very loud called her by name Lena Yes In a minute she answered with a particular intonation which she knew would prevent Heyst from coming in at once When she looked up Ricardo had vanished letting himself down outside so lightly that she had not heard the slightest noise She stood up then bewildered frightened as if awakened from a drugged sleep with heavy downcast unseeing eyes her fortitude tired out her imagination as if dead within her and unable to keep her fear alive Heyst moved about aimlessly in the other room This sound roused her exhausted wits At once she began to think hear see and what she saw or rather recognized for her eyes had been resting on it all the time was Ricardo s straw slipper lost in the scuffle lying near the bath She had just time to step forward and plant her foot on it when the curtains shook and pushed aside disclosed Heyst in the doorway Out of the appeased enchantment of the senses she had found with him like a sort of bewitched state his danger brought a sensation of warmth to her breast She felt something stir in there something profound like a new sort of life The room was in partial darkness Ricardo having accidentally swung the pivoted shutter as he went out of the window Heyst peered from the doorway Why you haven t done your hair yet he said I won t stop to do it now I shan t be long she replied steadily and remained still feeling Ricardo s slipper under the sole of her foot Heyst with a movement of retreat let the curtain drop slowly On the instant she stooped for the slipper and with it in her hand spun round wildly looking for some hiding place but there was no such spot in the bare room The chest the leather bunk a dress or two of hers hanging on pegs there was no place where the merest hazard might not guide Heyst s hand at any moment Her wildly roaming eyes were caught by the half closed window She ran to it and by raising herself on her toes was able to reach the shutter with her fingertips She pushed it square stole back to the middle of the room and turning about swung her arm regulating the force of the throw so as not to let the slipper fly too far out and hit the edge of the overhanging eaves It was a task of the nicest judgement for the muscles of those round arms still quivering from the deadly wrestle with a man for that brain tense with the excitement of the situation and for the unstrung nerves flickering darkness before her eyes At last the slipper left her hand As soon as it passed the opening it was out of her sight She listened She did not hear it strike anything it just vanished as if it had wings to fly on through the air Not a sound It had gone clear Her valiant arms hanging close against her side she stood as if turned into stone A faint whistle reached her ears The forgetful Ricardo becoming very much aware of his loss had been hanging about in great anxiety which was relieved by the appearance of the slipper flying from under the eaves and now thoughtfully he had ventured a whistle to put her mind at ease Suddenly the girl reeled forward She saved herself from a fall only by embracing with both arms one of the tall roughly carved posts holding the mosquito net above the bed For a long time she clung to it with her forehead leaning against the wood One side of her loosened sarong had slipped down as low as her hip The long brown tresses of her hair fell in lank wisps as if wet almost black against her white body Her uncovered flank damp with the sweat of anguish and fatigue gleamed coldly with the immobility of polished marble in the hot diffused light falling through the window above her head a dim reflection of the consuming passionate blaze of sunshine outside all aquiver with the effort to set the earth on fire to burn it to ashes CHAPTER FOUR Heyst seated at the table with his chin on his breast raised his head at the faint rustle of Lena s dress He was startled by the dead pallor of her cheeks by something lifeless in her eyes which looked at him strangely without recognition But to his anxious inquiries she answered reassuringly that there was nothing the matter with her really She had felt giddy on rising She had even had a moment of faintness after her bath She had to sit down to wait for it to pass This had made her late dressing I didn t try to do my hair I didn t want to keep you waiting any longer she said He was unwilling to press her with questions about her health since she seemed to make light of this indisposition She had not done her hair but she had brushed it and had tied it with a ribbon behind With her forehead uncovered she looked very young almost a child a careworn child a child with something on its mind What surprised Heyst was the non appearance of Wang The Chinaman had always materialized at the precise moment of his service neither too soon nor too late This time the usual miracle failed What was the meaning of this Heyst raised his voice a thing he disliked doing It was promptly answered from the compound Ada tuan Lena leaning on her elbow with her eyes on her plate did not seem to hear anything When Wang entered with a tray his narrow eyes tilted inward by the prominence of salient cheek bones kept her under stealthy observation all the time Neither the one nor the other of that white couple paid the slightest attention to him and he withdrew without having heard them exchange a single word He squatted on his heels on the back veranda His Chinaman s mind very clear but not far reaching was made up according to the plain reason of things such as it appeared to him in the light of his simple feeling for self preservation untrammelled by any notions of romantic honour or tender conscience His yellow hands lightly clasped hung idly between his knees The graves of Wang s ancestors were far away his parents were dead his elder brother was a soldier in the yamen of some Mandarin away in Formosa No one near by had a claim on his veneration or his obedience He had been for years a labouring restless vagabond His only tie in the world was the Alfuro woman in exchange for whom he had given away some considerable part of his hard earned substance and his duty in reason could be to no one but himself The scuffle behind the curtain was a thing of bad augury for that Number One for whom the Chinaman had neither love nor dislike He had been awed enough by that development to hang back with the coffee pot till at last the white man was induced to call him in Wang went in with curiosity Certainly the white woman looked as if she had been wrestling with a spirit which had managed to tear half her blood out of her before letting her go As to the man Wang had long looked upon him as being in some sort bewitched and now he was doomed He heard their voices in the room Heyst was urging the girl to go and lie down again He was extremely concerned She had eaten nothing The best thing for you You really must She sat listless shaking her head from time to time negatively as if nothing could be any good But he insisted she saw the beginning of wonder in his eyes and suddenly gave way Perhaps I had better She did not want to arouse his wonder which would lead him straight to suspicion He must not suspect Already with the consciousness of her love for this man of that something rapturous and profound going beyond the mere embrace there was born in her a woman s innate mistrust of masculinity of that seductive strength allied to an absurd delicate shrinking from the recognition of the naked necessity of facts which never yet frightened a woman worthy of the name She had no plan but her mind quieted down somewhat by the very effort to preserve outward composure for his sake perceived that her behaviour had secured at any rate a short period of safety Perhaps because of the similarity of their miserable origin in the dregs of mankind she had understood Ricardo perfectly He would keep quiet for a time now In this momentarily soothing certitude her bodily fatigue asserted itself the more overpoweringly since its cause was not so much the demand on her strength as the awful suddenness of the stress she had had to meet She would have tried to overcome it from the mere instinct of resistance if it had not been for Heyst s alternate pleadings and commands Before this eminently masculine fussing she felt the woman s need to give way the sweetness of surrender I will do anything you like she said Getting up she was surprised by a wave of languid weakness that came over her embracing and enveloping her like warm water with a noise in her ears as of a breaking sea You must help me along she added quickly While he put his arm round her waist not by any means an uncommon thing for him to do she found a special satisfaction in the feeling of being thus sustained She abandoned all her weight to that encircling and protecting pressure while a thrill went through her at the sudden thought that it was she who would have to protect him to be the defender of a man who was strong enough to lift her bodily as he was doing even then in his two arms For Heyst had done this as soon as they had crept through the doorway of the room He thought it was quicker and simpler to carry her the last step or two He had grown really too anxious to be aware of the effort He lifted her high and deposited her on the bed as one lays a child on its side in a cot Then he sat down on the edge masking his concern with a smile which obtained no response from the dreamy immobility of her eyes But she sought his hand seized it eagerly and while she was pressing it with all the force of which she was capable the sleep she needed overtook her suddenly overwhelmingly as it overtakes a child in a cot with her lips parted for a safe endearing word which she had thought of but had no time to utter The usual flaming silence brooded over Samburan What in the world is this new mystery murmured Heyst to himself contemplating her deep slumber It was so deep this enchanted sleep that when some time afterwards he gently tried to open her fingers and free his hand he succeeded without provoking the slightest stir There is some very simple explanation no doubt he thought as he stole out into the living room Absent mindedly he pulled a book out of the top shelf and sat down with it but even after he had opened it on his knee and had been staring at the pages for a time he had not the slightest idea of what it was about He stared and stared at the crowded parallel lines It was only when raising his eyes for no particular reason he saw Wang standing motionless on the other side of the table that he regained complete control of his faculties Oh yes he said as if suddenly reminded of a forgotten appointment of a not particularly welcome sort He waited a little and then with reluctant curiosity forced himself to ask the silent Wang what he had to say He had some idea that the matter of the vanished revolver would come up at last but the guttural sounds which proceeded from the Chinaman did not refer to that delicate subject His speech was concerned with cups saucers plates forks and knives All these things had been put away in the cupboards on the back veranda where they belonged perfectly clean all plopel Heyst wondered at the scrupulosity of a man who was about to abandon him for he was not surprised to hear Wang conclude the account of his stewardship with the words I go now Oh You go now said Heyst leaning back his book on his knees Yes Me no likee One man two man three man no can do Me go now What s frightening you away like this asked Heyst while through his mind flashed the hope that something enlightening might come from that being so unlike himself taking contact with the world with a simplicity and directness of which his own mind was not capable Why he went on You are used to white men You know them well Yes Me savee them assented Wang inscrutably Me savee plenty All that he really knew was his own mind He had made it up to withdraw himself and the Alfuro woman from the uncertainties of the relations which were going to establish themselves between those white men It was Pedro who had been the first cause of Wang s suspicion and fear The Chinaman had seen wild men He had penetrated in the train of a Chinese pedlar up one or two of the Bornean rivers into the country of the Dyaks He had also been in the interior of Mindanao where there are people who live in trees savages no better than animals but a hairy brute like Pedro with his great fangs and ferocious growls was altogether beyond his conception of anything that could be looked upon as human The strong impression made on him by Pedro was the prime inducement which had led Wang to purloin the revolver Reflection on the general situation and on the insecurity of Number One came later after he had obtained possession of the revolver and of the box of cartridges out of the table drawer in the living room Oh you savee plenty about white men Heyst went on in a slightly bantering tone after a moment of silent reflection in which he had confessed to himself that the recovery of the revolver was not to be thought of either by persuasion or by some more forcible means You speak in that fashion but you are frightened of those white men over there Me no flightened protested Wang raucously throwing up his head which gave to his throat a more strained anxious appearance than ever Me no likee he added in a quieter tone Me velly sick He put his hand over the region under the breast bone That said Heyst serenely positive belong one piecee lie That isn t proper man talk at all And after stealing my revolver too He had suddenly decided to speak about it because this frankness could not make the situation much worse than it was He did not suppose for a moment that Wang had the revolver anywhere about his person and after having thought the matter over he had arrived at the conclusion that the Chinaman never meant to use the weapon against him After a slight start because the direct charge had taken him unawares Wang tore open the front of his jacket with a convulsive show of indignation No hab got Look see he mouthed in pretended anger He slapped his bare chest violently he uncovered his very ribs all astir with the panting of outraged virtue his smooth stomach heaved with indignation He started his wide blue breeches flapping about his yellow calves Heyst watched him quietly I never said you had it on you he observed without raising his voice but the revolver is gone from where I kept it Me no savee levolvel Wang said obstinately The book lying open on Heyst s knee slipped suddenly and he made a sharp movement to catch it up Wang was unable to see the reason of this because of the table and leaped away from what seemed to him a threatening symptom When Heyst looked up the Chinaman was already at the door facing the room not frightened but alert What s the matter asked Heyst Wang nodded his shaven head significantly at the curtain closing the doorway of the bedroom Me no likee he repeated What the devil do you mean Heyst was genuinely amazed Don t like what Wang pointed a long lemon coloured finger at the motionless folds Two he said Two what I don t understand Suppose you savee you no like that fashion Me savee plenty Me go now Heyst had risen from his chair but Wang kept his ground in the doorway for a little longer His almond shaped eyes imparted to his face an expression of soft and sentimental melancholy The muscles of his throat moved visibly while he uttered a distinct and guttural Goodbye and vanished from Number One s sight The Chinaman s departure altered the situation Heyst reflected on what would be best to do in view of that fact For a long time he hesitated then shrugging his shoulders wearily he walked out on the veranda down the steps and continued at a steady gait with a thoughtful mien in the direction of his guests bungalow He wanted to make an important communication to them and he had no other object least of all to give them the shock of a surprise call Nevertheless their brutish henchman not being on watch it was Heyst s fate to startle mister Jones and his secretary by his sudden appearance in the doorway Their conversation must have been very interesting to prevent them from hearing the visitor s approach In the dim room the shutters were kept constantly closed against the heat Heyst saw them start apart It was mister Jones who spoke Ah here you are again Come in come in Heyst taking his hat off in the doorway entered the room CHAPTER FIVE Waking up suddenly Lena looked without raising her head from the pillow at the room in which she was alone She got up quickly as if to counteract the awful sinking of her heart by the vigorous use of her limbs But this sinking was only momentary Mistress of herself from pride from love from necessity and also because of a woman s vanity in self sacrifice she met Heyst returning from the strangers bungalow with a clear glance and a smile The smile he managed to answer but noticing that he avoided her eyes she composed her lips and lowered her gaze For the same reason she hastened to speak to him in a tone of indifference which she put on without effort as if she had grown adept in duplicity since sunrise You have been over there again I have I thought but you had better know first that we have lost Wang for good She repeated For good as if she had not understood For good or evil I shouldn t know which if you were to ask me He has dismissed himself He s gone You expected him to go though didn t you Heyst sat down on the other side of the table Yes I expected it as soon as I discovered that he had annexed my revolver He says he hasn t taken it That s untrue of course A Chinaman would not see the sense of confessing under any circumstances To deny any charge is a principle of right conduct but he hardly expected to be believed He was a little enigmatic at the last Lena He startled me Heyst paused The girl seemed absorbed in her own thoughts He startled me repeated Heyst She noted the anxiety in his tone and turned her head slightly to look at him across the table It must have been something to startle you she said In the depth of her parted lips like a ripe pomegranate there was a gleam of white teeth It was only a single word and some of his gestures He had been making a good deal of noise I wonder we didn t wake you up How soundly you can sleep I say do you feel all right now As fresh as can be she said treating him to another deep gleam of a smile I heard no noise and I m glad of it The way he talks in his harsh voice frightens me I don t like all these foreign people It was just before he went away bolted out I should say He nodded and pointed at the curtain to our room He knew you were there of course He seemed to think he seemed to try to give me to understand that you were in special well danger You know how he talks She said nothing she made no sound only the faint tinge of colour ebbed out of her cheek Yes Heyst went on He seemed to try to warn me That must have been it Did he imagine I had forgotten your existence The only word he said was two It sounded so at least Yes two and that he didn t like it What does that mean she whispered We know what the word two means don t we Lena We are two Never were such a lonely two out of the world my dear He might have tried to remind me that he himself has a woman to look after Why are you so pale Lena Am I pale she asked negligently You are Heyst was really anxious Well it isn t from fright she protested truthfully Indeed what she felt was a sort of horror which left her absolutely in the full possession of all her faculties more difficult to bear perhaps for that reason but not paralysing to her fortitude Heyst in his turn smiled at her I really don t know that there is any reason to be frightened I mean I am not frightened for myself I believe you are very plucky he said The colour had returned to her face I continued Heyst am so rebellious to outward impressions that I can t say that much about myself I don t react with sufficient distinctness He changed his tone You know I went to see those men first thing this morning I know Be careful she murmured I wonder how one can be careful I had a long talk with but I don t believe you have seen them One of them is a fantastically thin long person apparently ailing I shouldn t wonder if he were really so He makes rather a point of it in a mysterious manner I imagine he must have suffered from tropical fevers but not so much as he tries to make out He s what people would call a gentleman He seemed on the point of volunteering a tale of his adventures for which I didn t ask him but remarked that it was a long story some other time perhaps I suppose you would like to know who I am he asked me I told him I would leave it to him in a tone which between gentlemen could have left no doubt in his mind He raised himself on his elbow he was lying down on the camp bed and said I am he who is Lena seemed not to be listening but when Heyst paused she turned her head quickly to him He took it for a movement of inquiry but in this he was wrong A great vagueness enveloped her impressions but all her energy was concentrated on the struggle that she wanted to take upon herself in a great exaltation of love and self sacrifice which is woman s sublime faculty altogether on herself every bit of it leaving him nothing not even the knowledge of what she did if that were possible She would have liked to lock him up by some stratagem Had she known of some means to put him to sleep for days she would have used incantations or philtres without misgivings He seemed to her too good for such contacts and not sufficiently equipped This last feeling had nothing to do with the material fact of the revolver being stolen She could hardly appreciate that fact at its full value Observing her eyes fixed and as if sightless for the concentration on her purpose took all expression out of them Heyst imagined it to be the effect of a great mental effort No use asking me what he meant Lena I don t know and I did not ask him The gentleman as I have told you before seems devoted to mystification I said nothing and he laid down his head again on the bundle of rugs he uses for a pillow He affects a state of great weakness but I suspect that he s perfectly capable of leaping to his feet if he likes Having been ejected he said from his proper social sphere because he had refused to conform to certain usual conventions he was a rebel now and was coming and going up and down the earth As I really did not want to listen to all this nonsense I told him that I had heard that sort of story about somebody else before His grin is really ghastly He confessed that I was very far from the sort of man he expected to meet Then he said As to me I am no blacker than the gentleman you are thinking of and I have neither more nor less determination Heyst looked across the table at Lena Propped on her elbows and holding her head in both hands she moved it a little with an air of understanding Nothing could be plainer eh said Heyst grimly Unless indeed this is his idea of a pleasant joke for when he finished speaking he burst into a loud long laugh I didn t join him I wish you had she breathed out I didn t join him It did not occur to me I am not much of a diplomatist It would probably have been wise for indeed I believe he had said more than he meant to say and was trying to take it back by this affected jocularity Yet when one thinks of it diplomacy without force in the background is but a rotten reed to lean upon And I don t know whether I could have done it if I had thought of it I don t know It would have been against the grain Could I have done it I have lived too long within myself watching the mere shadows and shades of life To deceive a man on some issue which could be decided quicker by his destruction while one is disarmed helpless without even the power to run away no That seems to me too degrading And yet I have you here I have your very existence in my keeping What do you say Lena Would I be capable of throwing you to the lions to save my dignity She got up walked quickly round the table posed herself on his knees lightly throwing one arm round his neck and whispered in his ear You may if you like And may be that s the only way I would consent to leave you For something like that If it were something no bigger than your little finger She gave him a light kiss on the lips and was gone before he could detain her She regained her seat and propped her elbows again on the table It was hard to believe that she had moved from the spot at all The fleeting weight of her body on his knees the hug round his neck the whisper in his ear the kiss on his lips might have been the unsubstantial sensations of a dream invading the reality of waking life a sort of charming mirage in the barren aridity of his thoughts He hesitated to speak till she said businesslike Well And what then Heyst gave a start Oh yes I didn t join him I let him have his laugh out by himself He was shaking all over like a merry skeleton under a cotton sheet he was covered with I believe in order to conceal the revolver that he had in his right hand I didn t see it but I have a distinct impression it was there in his fist As he had not been looking at me for some time but staring into a certain part of the room I turned my head and saw a hairy wild sort of creature which they take about with them squatting on its heels in the angle of the walls behind me He wasn t there when I came in I didn t like the notion of that watchful monster behind my back If I had been less at their mercy I should certainly have changed my position As things are now to move would have been a mere weakness So I remained where I was The gentleman on the bed said he could assure me of one thing and that was that his presence here was no more morally reprehensible than mine We pursue the same ends he said only perhaps I pursue them with more openness than you with more simplicity That s what he said Heyst went on after looking at Lena in a sort of inquiring silence I asked him if he knew beforehand that I was living here but he only gave me a ghastly grin I didn t press him for an answer Lena I thought I had better not On her smooth forehead a ray of light always seemed to rest Her loose hair parted in the middle covered the hands sustaining her head She seemed spellbound by the interest of the narrative Heyst did not pause long He managed to continue his relation smoothly enough beginning afresh with a piece of comment He would have lied impudently and I detest being told a lie It makes me uncomfortable It s pretty clear that I am not fitted for the affairs of the wide world But I did not want him to think that I accepted his presence too meekly so I said that his comings or goings on the earth were none of my business of course except that I had a natural curiosity to know when he would find it convenient to resume them He asked me to look at the state he was in Had I been all alone here as they think I am I should have laughed at him But not being alone I say Lena you are sure you haven t shown yourself where you could be seen Certain she said promptly He looked relieved You understand Lena that when I ask you to keep so strictly out of sight it is because you are not for them to look at to talk about My poor Lena I can t help that feeling Do you understand it She moved her head slightly in a manner that was neither affirmative nor negative People will have to see me some day she said I wonder how long it will be possible for you to keep out of sight murmured Heyst thoughtfully He bent over the table Let me finish telling you I asked him point blank what it was he wanted with me he appeared extremely unwilling to come to the point It was not really so pressing as all that he said His secretary who was in fact his partner was not present having gone down to the wharf to look at their boat Finally the fellow proposed that he should put off a certain communication he had to make till the day after tomorrow I agreed but I also told him that I was not at all anxious to hear it I had no conception in what way his affairs could concern me Ah mister Heyst he said you and I have much more in common than you think Heyst struck the table with his fist unexpectedly It was a jeer I am sure it was He seemed ashamed of this outburst and smiled faintly into the motionless eyes of the girl What could I have done even if I had had my pockets full of revolvers She made an appreciative sign Killing s a sin sure enough she murmured I went away Heyst continued I left him there lying on his side with his eyes shut When I got back here I found you looking ill What was it Lena You did give me a scare Then I had the interview with Wang while you rested You were sleeping quietly I sat here to consider all these things calmly to try to penetrate their inner meaning and their outward bearing It struck me that the two days we have before us have the character of a sort of truce The more I thought of it the more I felt that this was tacitly understood between Jones and myself It was to our advantage if anything can be of advantage to people caught so completely unawares as we are Wang was gone He at any rate had declared himself but as I did not know what he might take it into his head to do I thought I had better warn these people that I was no longer responsible for the Chinaman I did not want mister Wang making some move which would precipitate the action against us Do you see my point of view She made a sign that she did All her soul was wrapped in her passionate determination in an exalted belief in herself in the contemplation of her amazing opportunity to win the certitude the eternity of that man s love I never saw two men Heyst was saying more affected by a piece of information than Jones and his secretary who was back in the bungalow by then They had not heard me come up I told them I was sorry to intrude Not at all Not at all said Jones The secretary backed away into a corner and watched me like a wary cat In fact they both were visibly on their guard I am come I told them to let you know that my servant has deserted gone off At first they looked at each other as if they had not understood what I was saying but very soon they seemed quite concerned You mean to say your Chink s cleared out said Ricardo coming forward from his corner Like this all at once What did he do it for I said that a Chinaman had always a simple and precise reason for what he did but that to get such a reason out of him was not so easy All he told me I said was that he didn t like They were extremely disturbed at this Didn t like what they wanted to know The looks of you and your party I told Jones Nonsense he cried out and immediately Ricardo the short man struck in Told you that What did he take you for sir an infant Or do you take us for kids meaning no offence Come I bet you will tell us next that you ve missed something I didn t mean to tell you anything of the sort I said but as a matter of fact it is so He slapped his thigh Thought so What do you think of this trick governor Jones made some sort of sign to him and then that extraordinary cat faced associate proposed that he and their servant should come out and help me catch or kill the Chink My object I said was not to get assistance I did not intend to chase the Chinaman I had come only to warn them that he was armed and that he really objected to their presence on the island I wanted them to understand that I was not responsible for anything that might happen Do you mean to tell us asked Ricardo that there is a crazy Chink with a six shooter broke loose on this island and that you don t care Strangely enough they did not seem to believe my story They were exchanging significant looks all the time Ricardo stole up close to his principal they had a confabulation together and then something happened which I did not expect It s rather awkward too Since I would not have their assistance to get hold of the Chink and recover my property the least they could do was to send me their servant It was Jones who said that and Ricardo backed up the idea Yes yes let our Pedro cook for all hands in your compound He isn t so bad as he looks That s what we will do He bustled out of the room to the veranda and let out an ear splitting whistle for their Pedro Having heard the brute s answering howl Ricardo ran back into the room Yes mister Heyst This will do capitally mister Heyst You just direct him to do whatever you are accustomed to have done for you in the way of attendance See Lena I confess to you that I was taken completely by surprise I had not expected anything of the sort I don t know what I expected I am so anxious about you that I can t keep away from these infernal scoundrels And only two months ago I would not have cared I would have defied their scoundrelism as much as I have scorned all the other intrusions of life But now I have you You stole into my life and Heyst drew a deep breath The girl gave him a quick wide eyed glance Ah That s what you are thinking of that you have me It was impossible to read the thoughts veiled by her steady grey eyes to penetrate the meaning of her silences her words and even her embraces He used to come out of her very arms with the feeling of a baffled man If I haven t you if you are not here then where are you cried Heyst You understand me very well She shook her head a little Her red lips at which he looked now her lips as fascinating as the voice that came out of them uttered the words I hear what you say but what does it mean It means that I could lie and perhaps cringe for your sake No No Don t you ever do that she said in haste while her eyes glistened suddenly You would hate me for it afterwards Hate you repeated Heyst who had recalled his polite manner No You needn t consider the extremity of the improbable as yet But I will confess to you that I how shall I call it that I dissembled First I dissembled my dismay at the unforeseen result of my idiotic diplomacy Do you understand my dear girl It was evident that she did not understand the word Heyst produced his playful smile which contrasted oddly with the worried character of his whole expression His temples seemed to have sunk in his face looked a little leaner A diplomatic statement Lena is a statement of which everything is true but the sentiment which seems to prompt it I have never been diplomatic in my relation with mankind not from regard for its feelings but from a certain regard for my own Diplomacy doesn t go well with consistent contempt I cared little for life and still less for death Don t talk like that I dissembled my extreme longing to take these wandering scoundrels by their throats he went on I have only two hands I wish I had a hundred to defend you and there were three throats By that time their Pedro was in the room too Had he seen me engaged with their two throats he would have been at mine like a fierce dog or any other savage and faithful brute I had no difficulty in dissembling my longing for the vulgar stupid and hopeless argument of fight I remarked that I really did not want a servant I couldn t think of depriving them of their man s services but they would not hear me They had made up their minds We shall send him over at once Ricardo said to start cooking dinner for everybody I hope you won t mind me coming to eat it with you in your bungalow and we will send the governor s dinner over to him here I could do nothing but hold my tongue or bring on a quarrel some manifestation of their dark purpose which we have no means to resist Of course you may remain invisible this evening but with that atrocious brute prowling all the time at the back of the house how long can your presence be concealed from these men Heyst s distress could be felt in his silence The girl s head sustained by her hands buried in the thick masses of her hair had a perfect immobility You are certain you have not been seen so far he asked suddenly The motionless head spoke How can I be certain You told me you wanted me to keep out of the way I kept out of the way I didn t ask your reason I thought you didn t want people to know that you had a girl like me about you What Ashamed cried Heyst It isn t what s right perhaps I mean for you is it Heyst lifted his hands reproachfully courteous I look upon it as so very much right that I couldn t bear the idea of any other than sympathetic respectful eyes resting on you I disliked and mistrusted these fellows from the first Didn t you understand Yes I did keep out of sight she said A silence fell At last Heyst stirred slightly All this is of very little importance now he said with a sigh This is a question of something infinitely worse than mere looks and thoughts however base and contemptible As I have told you I met Ricardo s suggestions by silence As I was turning away he said If you happen to have the key of that store room of yours on you mister Heyst you may just as well let me have it I will give it to our Pedro I had it on me and I tendered it to him without speaking The hairy creature was at the door by then and caught the key which Ricardo threw to him better than any trained ape could have done I came away All the time I had been thinking anxiously of you whom I had left asleep alone here and apparently ill Heyst interrupted himself with a listening turn of his head He had heard the faint sound of sticks being snapped in the compound He rose and crossed the room to look out of the back door And here the creature is he said returning to the table Here he is already attending to the fire Oh my dear Lena She had followed him with her eyes She watched him go out on the front veranda cautiously He lowered stealthily a couple of screens that hung between the column and remained outside very still as if interested by something on the open ground Meantime she had risen in her turn to take a peep into the compound Heyst glancing over his shoulder saw her returning to her seat He beckoned to her and she continued to move crossing the shady room pure and bright in her white dress her hair loose with something of a sleep walker in her unhurried motion in her extended hand in the sightless effect of her grey eyes luminous in the half light He had never seen such an expression in her face before It had dreaminess in it intense attention and something like sternness Arrested in the doorway by Heyst s extended arm she seemed to wake up flushed faintly and this flush passing off carried away with it the strange transfiguring mood With a courageous gesture she pushed back the heavy masses of her hair The light clung to her forehead Her delicate nostrils quivered Heyst seized her arm and whispered excitedly Slip out here quickly The screens will conceal you Only you must mind the stair space They are actually out I mean the other two You had better see them before you She made a barely perceptible movement of recoil checked at once and stood still Heyst released her arm Yes perhaps I had better she said with unnatural deliberation and stepped out on the veranda to stand close by his side Together one on each side of the screen they peeped between the edge of the canvas and the veranda post entwined with creepers A great heat ascended from the sun smitten ground in an ever rising wave as if from some secret store of earth s fiery heart for the sky was growing cooler already and the sun had declined sufficiently for the shadows of mister Jones and his henchman to be projected towards the bungalow side by side one infinitely slender the other short and broad The two visitors stood still and gazed To keep up the fiction of his invalidism mister Jones the gentleman leaned on the arm of Ricardo the secretary the top of whose hat just came up to his governor s shoulder Do you see them Heyst whispered into the girl s ear Here they are the envoys of the outer world Here they are before you evil intelligence instinctive savagery arm in arm The brute force is at the back A trio of fitting envoys perhaps but what about the welcome Suppose I were armed could I shoot these two down where they stand Could I Without moving her head the girl felt for Heyst s hand pressed it and thereafter did not let it go He continued bitterly playful I don t know I don t think so There is a strain in me which lays me under an insensate obligation to avoid even the appearance of murder I have never pulled a trigger or lifted my hand on a man even in self defence The suddenly tightened grip of her hand checked him They are making a move she murmured Can they be thinking of coming here Heyst wondered anxiously No they aren t coming this way she said and there was another pause They are going back to their house she reported finally After watching them a little longer she let go Heyst s hand and moved away from the screen He followed her into the room You have seen them now he began Think what it was to me to see them land in the dusk fantasms from the sea apparitions chimeras And they persist That s the worst of it they persist They have no right to be but they are They ought to have aroused my fury But I have refined everything away by this time anger indignation scorn itself Nothing s left but disgust Since you have told me of that abominable calumny it has become immense it extends even to myself He looked up at her But luckily I have you And if only Wang had not carried off that miserable revolver yes Lena here we are we two She put both her hands on his shoulders and looked straight into his eyes He returned her penetrating gaze It baffled him He could not pierce the grey veil of her eyes but the sadness of her voice thrilled him profoundly You are not reproaching me she asked slowly Reproach What a word between us It could only be myself but the mention of Wang has given me an idea I have been not exactly cringing not exactly lying but still dissembling You have been hiding yourself to please me but still you have been hiding All this is very dignified Why shouldn t we try begging now A noble art Yes Lena we must go out together I couldn t think of leaving you alone and I must yes I must speak to Wang We shall go and seek that man who knows what he wants and how to secure what he wants We will go at once Wait till I put my hair up she agreed instantly and vanished behind the curtain When the curtain had fallen behind her she turned her head back with an expression of infinite and tender concern for him for him whom she could never hope to understand and whom she was afraid she could never satisfy as if her passion were of a hopelessly lower quality unable to appease some exalted and delicate desire of his superior soul In a couple of minutes she reappeared They left the house by the door of the compound and passed within three feet of the thunderstruck Pedro without even looking in his direction He rose from stooping over a fire of sticks and balancing himself clumsily uncovered his enormous fangs in gaping astonishment Then suddenly he set off rolling on his bandy legs to impart to his masters the astonishing discovery of a woman 
3848-37389-0000	train-other-500	CHAPTER SIX As luck would have it Ricardo was lounging alone on the veranda of the former counting house He scented some new development at once and ran down to meet the trotting bear like figure
3848-37389-0001	train-other-500	The deep growling noises it made though they had only a very remote resemblance to the Spanish language or indeed to any sort of human speech were from long practice quite intelligible to mister Jones s secretary
3848-37389-0002	train-other-500	Ricardo was rather surprised He had imagined that the girl would continue to keep out of sight That line apparently was given up He did not mistrust her How could he Indeed
3848-37389-0003	train-other-500	he could not think of her existence calmly He tried to keep her image out of his mind
none	none	 so that he should be able to use its powers with some approach to that coolness which the complex nature of the situation demanded from him 
3848-37389-0004	train-other-500	both for his own sake and as the faithful follower of plain mister Jones gentleman He collected his wits and thought This was a change of policy probably on the part of Heyst If so
3848-37389-0005	train-other-500	what could it mean A deep fellow Unless it was her doing in which case
none	none	 h m all right Must be She would know what she was doing 
3848-37389-0006	train-other-500	Before him Pedro lifting his feet alternately swayed to and fro sideways his usual attitude of expectation His little red eyes lost in the mass of hair were motionless
3848-37389-0007	train-other-500	Ricardo stared into them with calculated contempt and said in a rough angry voice Woman Of course there is We know that without you He gave the tame monster a push Git
3848-37389-0008	train-other-500	Vamos Waddle Get back and cook the dinner
none	none	 Which way did they go then 
3848-37389-0009	train-other-500	Pedro extended a huge hairy forearm to show the direction and went off on his bandy legs Advancing a few steps Ricardo was just in time to see above some bushes
3848-37389-0010	train-other-500	two white helmets moving side by side in the clearing They disappeared
none	none	 Now that he had managed to keep Pedro from informing the governor 
3848-37389-0011	train-other-500	that there was a woman on the island he could indulge in speculation as to the movements of these people His attitude towards mister Jones had undergone a spiritual change of which he himself was not yet fully aware
3848-37389-0012	train-other-500	That morning before tiffin
none	none	 after his escape from 
3848-37389-0013	train-other-500	the Heyst bungalow completed in such an inspiring way by the recovery of the slipper
none	none	 Ricardo had made his way to their allotted house 
3848-37389-0014	train-other-500	reeling as he ran his head in a whirl He was wildly excited by visions of inconceivable promise He waited to compose himself before he dared to meet the governor On entering the room he found mister Jones
3848-37389-0015	train-other-500	sitting on the camp bedstead like a tailor on his board cross legged
none	none	 his long back against the wall 
3848-37389-0016	train-other-500	I say sir You aren t going to tell me you are bored Bored No Where the devil have you been all this time Observing watching nosing around What else
3848-37389-0017	train-other-500	I knew you had company Have you talked freely sir Yes I have muttered mister Jones Not downright plain sir No I wished you had been here
3848-37389-0018	train-other-500	You loaf all the morning and now you come in out of breath What s the matter
none	none	 I haven t been wasting my time out there 
3848-37389-0019	train-other-500	said Ricardo Nothing s the matter
none	none	 I I might have hurried a bit 
3848-37389-0020	train-other-500	He was in truth still panting only it was not with running but with the tumult of thoughts and sensations long repressed
none	none	 which had been set free by the adventure of the morning 
3848-37389-0021	train-other-500	He was almost distracted by them now He forgot himself in the maze of possibilities threatening and inspiring And so you had a long talk he said to gain time Confound you
3848-37389-0022	train-other-500	The sun hasn t affected your head has it
none	none	 Why are you staring at me like a basilisk 
3848-37389-0023	train-other-500	Beg pardon sir Wasn t aware I stared Ricardo apologized good humouredly The sun might well affect a thicker skull than mine
none	none	 It blazes Phew What do you think a fellow is sir 
3848-37389-0024	train-other-500	a salamander You ought to have been here observed mister Jones Did the beast give any signs of wanting to prance asked Ricardo quickly with absolutely genuine anxiety It wouldn t do sir
3848-37389-0025	train-other-500	You must play him easy for at least a couple of days sir I have a plan I have a notion that I can find out a lot in a couple of days
none	none	 You have 
3848-37389-0026	train-other-500	In what way Why by watching Ricardo answered slowly mister Jones grunted Nothing new that
none	none	 Watch eh 
3848-37389-0027	train-other-500	Why not pray a little too Ha ha ha That s a good one burst out the secretary fixing mister Jones with mirthless eyes The latter dropped the subject indolently Oh
3848-37389-0028	train-other-500	you may be certain of at least two days he said Ricardo recovered himself His eyes gleamed voluptuously We ll pull this off yet clean whole right through
none	none	 if you will only trust me sir 
3848-37389-0029	train-other-500	I am trusting you right enough said mister Jones It s your interest too And indeed Ricardo was truthful enough in his statement He did absolutely believe in success now
3848-37389-0030	train-other-500	But he couldn t tell his governor that he had intelligences in the enemy s camp It wouldn t do to tell him of the girl Devil only knew what he would do if he learned there was a woman about
none	none	 And how could he begin to tell of it He couldn t confess his sudden escapade 
3848-37389-0031	train-other-500	We ll pull it off sir he said with perfectly acted cheerfulness He experienced gusts of awful joy expanding in his heart and hot like a fanned flame We must
3848-37389-0032	train-other-500	pronounced mister Jones This thing Martin is not like our other tries
none	none	 I have a peculiar feeling about this 
3848-37389-0033	train-other-500	It s a different thing It s a sort of test Ricardo was impressed by the governor s manner for the first time a hint of passion could be detected in him
none	none	 But also a word he used 
3848-37389-0034	train-other-500	the word test had struck him as particularly significant somehow It was the last word uttered during that morning s conversation Immediately afterwards Ricardo went out of the room
3848-37389-0035	train-other-500	It was impossible for him to keep still An elation in which an extraordinary softness mingled with savage triumph would not allow it It prevented his thinking also
3848-37389-0036	train-other-500	He walked up and down the veranda far into the afternoon eyeing the other bungalow at every turn It gave no sign of being inhabited Once or twice he stopped dead short and looked down at his left slipper
3848-37389-0037	train-other-500	Each time he chuckled audibly His restlessness kept on increasing till at last it frightened him He caught hold of the balustrade of the veranda and stood still
none	none	 smiling not at his thought 
3848-37389-0038	train-other-500	but at the strong sense of life within him He abandoned himself to it carelessly even recklessly He cared for no one friend or enemy At that moment mister Jones called him by name from within
3848-37389-0039	train-other-500	A shadow fell on the secretary s face Here sir he answered but it was a moment before he could make up his mind to go in He found the governor on his feet mister Jones was tired of lying down
3848-37389-0040	train-other-500	when there was no necessity for it His slender form gliding about the room came to a standstill I ve been thinking Martin of something you suggested At the time it did not strike me as practical
3848-37389-0041	train-other-500	but on reflection it seems to me that to propose a game is as good a way as any to let him understand that the time has come to disgorge It s less how should I say vulgar
3848-37389-0042	train-other-500	He will know what it means It s not a bad form to give to the business which in itself is crude Martin crude Want to spare his feelings jeered the secretary in such a bitter tone that
3848-37389-0043	train-other-500	mister Jones was really surprised Why it was your own notion confound you Who says it wasn t retorted Ricardo sulkily But I am fairly sick of this crawling No No
3848-37389-0044	train-other-500	Get the exact bearings of his swag and then a rip up That s plenty good enough for him His passions being thoroughly aroused a thirst for blood was allied in him with a thirst for tenderness yes tenderness
3848-37389-0045	train-other-500	A sort of anxious melting sensation pervaded and softened his heart when he thought of that girl one of his own sort And at the same time jealousy started gnawing at his breast as the image of Heyst
3848-37389-0046	train-other-500	intruded itself on his fierce anticipation of bliss The crudeness of your ferocity is positively gross Martin mister Jones said disdainfully You don t even understand my purpose
3848-37389-0047	train-other-500	I mean to have some sport out of him Just try to imagine the atmosphere of the game the fellow handling the cards the agonizing mockery of it Oh I shall appreciate this greatly Yes
3848-37389-0048	train-other-500	let him lose his money instead of being forced to hand it over You of course would shoot him at once but I shall enjoy the refinement and the jest of it He s a man of the best society
3848-37389-0049	train-other-500	I ve been hounded out of my sphere by people very much like that fellow How enraged and humiliated he will be I promise myself some exquisite moments while watching his play Ay and
3848-37389-0050	train-other-500	suppose he suddenly starts prancing He may not appreciate the fun
none	none	 I mean you to be present mister Jones remarked calmly Well as long 
3848-37389-0051	train-other-500	as I am free to plug him or rip him up whenever I think the time has come you are welcome to your bit of sport sir
none	none	 I shan t spoil it CHAPTER SEVEN It was at this precise moment of their conversation that Heyst had intruded on mister Jones and his secretary with his warning about Wang as he had related to Lena When he left them the two looked at each other in wondering silence My Jones was the first to break it I say Martin Yes sir What does this mean It s some move Blame me if I can understand Too deep for you mister Jones inquired dryly It s nothing but some of his infernal impudence growled the secretary You don t believe all that about the Chink do you sir Tain t true It isn t necessary for it to be true to have a meaning for us It s the why of his coming to tell us this tale that s important Do you think he made it up to frighten us asked Ricardo mister Jones scowled at him thoughtfully The man looked worried he muttered as if to himself Suppose that Chinaman has really stolen his money The man looked very worried Nothing but his artfulness sir protested Ricardo earnestly for the idea was too disconcerting to entertain Is it likely that he would have trusted a Chink with enough knowledge to make it possible he argued warmly Why it s the very thing that he would keep close about There s something else there Ay but what Ha ha ha mister Jones let out a ghostly squeaky laugh I ve never been placed in such a ridiculous position before he went on with a sepulchral equanimity of tone It s you Martin who dragged me into it However it s my own fault too I ought to but I was really too bored to use my brain and yours is not to be trusted You are a hothead A blasphemous exclamation of grief escaped from Ricardo Not to be trusted Hothead He was almost tearful Haven t I heard you sir saying more than twenty times since we got fired out from Manila that we should want a lot of capital to work the East Coast with You were always telling me that to prime properly all them officials and Portuguese scallywags we should have to lose heavily at first Weren t you always worrying about some means of getting hold of a good lot of cash It wasn t to be got hold of by allowing yourself to become bored in that rotten Dutch town and playing a two penny game with confounded beggarly bank clerks and such like Well I ve brought you here where there is cash to be got and a big lot to a moral he added through his set teeth Silence fell Each of them was staring into a different corner of the room Suddenly with a slight stamp of his foot mister Jones made for the door Ricardo caught him up outside Put an arm through mine sir he begged him gently but firmly No use giving the game away An invalid may well come out for a breath of fresh air after the sun s gone down a bit That s it sir But where do you want to go Why did you come out sir mister Jones stopped short I hardly know myself he confessed in a hollow mutter staring intently at the Number One bungalow It s quite irrational he declared in a still lower tone Better go in sir suggested Ricardo What s that Those screens weren t down before He s spying from behind them now I bet the dodging artful plotting beast Why not go over there and see if we can t get to the bottom of this game was the unexpected proposal uttered by mister Jones He will have to talk to us Ricardo repressed a start of dismay but for a moment could not speak He only pressed the governor s hand to his side instinctively No sir What could you say Do you expect to get to the bottom of his lies How could you make him talk It isn t time yet to come to grips with that gent You don t think I would hang back do you His Chink of course I ll shoot like a dog the moment I catch sight of him but as to that mister Blasted Heyst the time isn t yet My head s cooler just now than yours Let s go in again Why we are exposed here Suppose he took it into his head to let off a gun on us He s an unaccountable yporcritical skunk Allowing himself to be persuaded mister Jones returned to his seclusion The secretary however remained on the veranda for the purpose he said of seeing whether that Chink wasn t sneaking around in which case he proposed to take a long shot at the galoot and chance the consequences His real reason was that he wanted to be alone away from the governor s deep sunk eyes He felt a sentimental desire to indulge his fancies in solitude A great change had come over mister Ricardo since that morning A whole side of him which from prudence from necessity from loyalty had been kept dormant was aroused now colouring his thoughts and disturbing his mental poise by the vision of such staggering consequences as for instance the possibility of an active conflict with the governor The appearance of the monstrous Pedro with his news drew Ricardo out of a feeling of dreaminess wrapped up in a sense of impending trouble A woman Yes there was one and it made all the difference After driving away Pedro and watching the white helmets of Heyst and Lena vanishing among the bushes he stood lost in meditation Where could they be off to like this he mentally asked himself The answer found by his speculative faculties on their utmost stretch was to meet that Chink For in the desertion of Wang Ricardo did not believe It was a lying yarn the organic part of a dangerous plot Heyst had gone to combine some fresh move But then Ricardo felt sure that the girl was with him the girl full of pluck full of sense full of understanding an ally of his own kind He went indoors briskly mister Jones had resumed his cross legged pose at the head of the bed with his back against the wall Anything new No sir Ricardo walked about the room as if he had no care in the world He hummed snatches of song mister Jones raised his waspish eyebrows at the sound The secretary got down on his knees before an old leather trunk and rummaging in there brought out a small looking glass He fell to examining his physiognomy in it with silent absorption I think I ll shave he decided getting up He gave a sidelong glance to the governor and repeated it several times during the operation which did not take long and even afterwards when after putting away the implements he resumed his walking humming more snatches of unknown songs mister Jones preserved a complete immobility his thin lips compressed his eyes veiled His face was like a carving So you would like to try your hand at cards with that skunk sir said Ricardo stopping suddenly and rubbing his hands mister Jones gave no sign of having heard anything Well why not Why shouldn t he have the experience You remember in that Mexican town what s its name the robber fellow they caught in the mountains and condemned to be shot He played cards half the night with the jailer and the sheriff Well this fellow is condemned too He must give you your game Hang it all a gentleman ought to have some little relaxation And you have been uncommonly patient sir You are uncommonly volatile all of a sudden mister Jones remarked in a bored voice What s come to you The secretary hummed for a while and then said I ll try to get him over here for you tonight after dinner If I ain t here myself don t you worry sir I shall be doing a bit of nosing around see I see sneered mister Jones languidly But what do you expect to see in the dark Ricardo made no answer and after another turn or two slipped out of the room He no longer felt comfortable alone with the governor CHAPTER EIGHT Meantime Heyst and Lena walking rather fast approached Wang s hut Asking the girl to wait Heyst ascended the little ladder of bamboos giving access to the door It was as he had expected The smoky interior was empty except for a big chest of sandalwood too heavy for hurried removal Its lid was thrown up but whatever it might have contained was no longer there All Wang s possessions were gone Without tarrying in the hut Heyst came back to the girl who asked no questions with her strange air of knowing or understanding everything Let us push on he said He went ahead the rustle of her white skirt following him into the shades of the forest along the path of their usual walk Though the air lay heavy between straight denuded trunks the sunlit patches moved on the ground and raising her eyes Lena saw far above her head the flutter of the leaves the surface shudder on the mighty limbs extended horizontally in the perfect immobility of patience Twice Heyst looked over his shoulder at her Behind the readiness of her answering smile there was a fund of devoted concentrated passion burning with the hope of a more perfect satisfaction They passed the spot where it was their practice to turn towards the barren summit of the central hill Heyst held steadily on his way towards the upper limit of the forest The moment they left its shelter a breeze enveloped them and a great cloud racing over the sun threw a peculiar sombre tint over everything Heyst pointed up a precipitous rugged path clinging to the side of the hill It ended in a barricade of felled trees a primitively conceived obstacle which must have cost much labour to erect at just that spot This Heyst explained in his urbane tone is a barrier against the march of civilization The poor folk over there did not like it as it appeared to them in the shape of my company a great step forward as some people used to call it with mistaken confidence The advanced foot has been drawn back but the barricade remains They went on climbing slowly The cloud had driven over leaving an added brightness on the face of the world It s a very ridiculous thing Heyst went on but then it is the product of honest fear fear of the unknown of the incomprehensible It s pathetic too in a way And I heartily wish Lena that we were on the other side of it Oh stop stop she cried seizing his arm The face of the barricade they were approaching had been piled up with a lot of fresh cut branches The leaves were still green A gentle breeze sweeping over the top stirred them a little but what had startled the girl was the discovery of several spear blades protruding from the mass of foliage She had made them out suddenly They did not gleam but she saw them with extreme distinctness very still very vicious to look at You had better let me go forward alone Lena said Heyst She tugged persistently at his arm but after a time during which he never ceased to look smilingly into her terrified eyes he ended by disengaging himself It s a sign rather than a demonstration he argued persuasively Just wait here a moment I promise not to approach near enough to be stabbed As in a nightmare she watched Heyst go up the few yards of the path as if he never meant to stop and she heard his voice like voices heard in dreams shouting unknown words in an unearthly tone Heyst was only demanding to see Wang He was not kept waiting very long Recovering from the first flurry of her fright Lena noticed a commotion in the green top dressing of the barricade She exhaled a sigh of relief when the spear blades retreated out of sight sliding inward the horrible things in a spot facing Heyst a pair of yellow hands parted the leaves and a face filled the small opening a face with very noticeable eyes It was Wang s face of course with no suggestion of a body belonging to it like those cardboard faces at which she remembered gazing as a child in the window of a certain dim shop kept by a mysterious little man in Kingsland Road Only this face instead of mere holes had eyes which blinked She could see the beating of the eyelids The hands on each side of the face keeping the boughs apart also did not look as if they belonged to any real body One of them was holding a revolver a weapon which she recognized merely by intuition never having seen such an object before She leaned her shoulders against the rock of the perpendicular hillside and kept her eyes on Heyst with comparative composure since the spears were not menacing him any longer Beyond the rigid and motionless back he presented to her she saw Wang s unreal cardboard face moving its thin lips and grimacing artificially She was too far down the path to hear the dialogue carried on in an ordinary voice She waited patiently for its end Her shoulders felt the warmth of the rock now and then a whiff of cooler air seemed to slip down upon her head from above the ravine at her feet choked full of vegetation emitted the faint drowsy hum of insect life Everything was very quiet She failed to notice the exact moment when Wang s head vanished from the foliage taking the unreal hands away with it To her horror the spear blades came gliding slowly out The very hair on her head stirred but before she had time to cry out Heyst who seemed rooted to the ground turned round abruptly and began to move towards her His great moustaches did not quite hide an ugly but irresolute smile and when he had come down near enough to touch her he burst out into a harsh laugh Ha ha ha She looked at him uncomprehending He cut short his laugh and said curtly We had better go down as we came She followed him into the forest The advance of the afternoon had filled it with gloom Far away a slant of light between the trees closed the view All was dark beyond Heyst stopped No reason to hurry Lena he said in his ordinary serenely polite tones We return unsuccessful I suppose you know or at least can guess what was my object in coming up there No I can t guess dear she said and smiled noticing with emotion that his breast was heaving as if he had been out of breath Nevertheless he tried to command his speech pausing only a little between the words No I went up to find Wang I went up he gasped again here but this was for the last time I made you come with me because I didn t like to leave you unprotected in the proximity of those fellows Suddenly he snatched his cork helmet off his head and dashed it on the ground No he cried roughly All this is too unreal altogether It isn t to be borne I can t protect you I haven t the power He glared at her for a moment then hastened after his hat which had bounded away to some distance He came back looking at her face which was very white I ought to beg your pardon for these antics he said adjusting his hat A movement of childish petulance Indeed I feel very much like a child in my ignorance in my powerlessness in my want of resource in everything except in the dreadful consciousness of some evil hanging over your head yours It s you they are after she murmured No doubt but unfortunately Unfortunately what Unfortunately I have not succeeded with Wang he said I failed to move his Celestial heart that is if there is such a thing He told me with horrible Chinese reasonableness that he could not let us pass the barrier because we should be pursued He doesn t like fights He gave me to understand that he would shoot me with my own revolver without any sort of compunction rather than risk a rude and distasteful contest with the strange barbarians for my sake He has preached to the villagers They respect him He is the most remarkable man they have ever seen and their kinsman by marriage They understand his policy And anyway only women and children and a few old fellows are left in the village This is the season when the men are away in trading vessels But it would have been all the same None of them have a taste for fighting and with white men too They are peaceable kindly folk and would have seen me shot with extreme satisfaction Wang seemed to think my insistence for I insisted you know very stupid and tactless But a drowning man clutches at straws We were talking in such Malay as we are both equal to Your fears are foolish I said to him Foolish of course I am foolish he replied If I were a wise man I would be a merchant with a big hong in Singapore instead of being a mine coolie turned houseboy But if you don t go away in time I will shoot you before it grows too dark to take aim Not till then Number One but I will do it then Now finish All right I said Finish as far as I am concerned but you can have no objections to the mem putih coming over to stay with the Orang Kaya s women for a few days I will make a present in silver for it Orang Kaya is the head man of the village Lena added Heyst She looked at him in astonishment You wanted me to go to that village of savages she gasped You wanted me to leave you It would have given me a freer hand Heyst stretched out his hands and looked at them for a moment then let them fall by his side Indignation was expressed more in the curve of her lips than in her clear eyes which never wavered I believe Wang laughed he went on He made a noise like a turkey cock That would be worse than anything he told me I was taken aback I pointed out to him that he was talking nonsense It could not make any difference to his security where you were because the evil men as he calls them did not know of your existence I did not lie exactly Lena though I did stretch the truth till it cracked but the fellow seems to have an uncanny insight He shook his head He assured me they knew all about you He made a horrible grimace at me It doesn t matter said the girl I didn t want I would not have gone Heyst raised his eyes Wonderful intuition As I continued to press him Wang made that very remark about you When he smiles his face looks like a conceited death s head It was his very last remark that you wouldn t want to I went away then She leaned back against a tree Heyst faced her in the same attitude of leisure as if they had done with time and all the other concerns of the earth Suddenly high above their heads the roof of leaves whispered at them tumultuously and then ceased That was a strange notion of yours to send me away she said Send me away What for Yes what for You seem indignant he remarked listlessly To these savages too she pursued And you think I would have gone You can do what you like with me but not that not that Heyst looked into the dim aisles of the forest Everything was so still now that the very ground on which they stood seemed to exhale silence into the shade Why be indignant he remonstrated It has not happened I gave up pleading with Wang Here we are repulsed Not only without power to resist the evil but unable to make terms for ourselves with the worthy envoys the envoys extraordinary of the world we thought we had done with for years and years And that s bad Lena very bad It s funny she said thoughtfully Bad I suppose it is I don t know that it is But do you Do you You talk as if you didn t believe in it She gazed at him earnestly Do I Ah That s it I don t know how to talk I have managed to refine everything away I ve said to the Earth that bore me I am I and you are a shadow And by Jove it is so But it appears that such words cannot be uttered with impunity Here I am on a Shadow inhabited by Shades How helpless a man is against the Shades How is one to intimidate persuade resist assert oneself against them I have lost all belief in realities Lena give me your hand She looked at him surprised uncomprehending Your hand he cried She obeyed he seized it with avidity as if eager to raise it to his lips but halfway up released his grasp They looked at each other for a time What s the matter dear she whispered timidly Neither force nor conviction Heyst muttered wearily to himself How am I to meet this charmingly simple problem I am sorry she murmured And so am I he confessed quickly And the bitterest of this humiliation is its complete uselessness which I feel I feel She had never before seen him give such signs of feeling Across his ghastly face the long moustaches flamed in the shade He spoke suddenly I wonder if I could find enough courage to creep among them in the night with a knife and cut their throats one after another as they slept I wonder She was frightened by his unwonted appearance more than by the words in his mouth and said earnestly Don t you try to do such a thing Don t you think of it I don t possess anything bigger than a penknife As to thinking of it Lena there s no saying what one may think of I don t think Something in me thinks something foreign to my nature What is the matter He noticed her parted lips and the peculiar stare in her eyes which had wandered from his face There s somebody after us I saw something white moving she cried Heyst did not turn his head he only glanced at her out stretched arm No doubt we are followed we are watched I don t see anything now she said And it does not matter Heyst went on in his ordinary voice Here we are in the forest I have neither strength nor persuasion Indeed it s extremely difficult to be eloquent before a Chinaman s head stuck at one out of a lot of brushwood But can we wander among these big trees indefinitely Is this a refuge No What else is left to us I did think for a moment of the mine but even there we could not remain very long And then that gallery is not safe The props were too weak to begin with Ants have been at work there ants after the men A death trap at best One can die but once but there are many manners of death The girl glanced about fearfully in search of the watcher or follower whom she had glimpsed once among the trees but if he existed he had concealed himself Nothing met her eyes but the deepening shadows of the short vistas between the living columns of the still roof of leaves She looked at the man beside her expectantly tenderly with suppressed affright and a sort of awed wonder I have also thought of these people s boat Heyst went on We could get into that and only they have taken everything out of her I have seen her oars and mast in a corner of their room To shove off in an empty boat would be nothing but a desperate expedient supposing even that she would drift out a good distance between the islands before the morning It would only be a complicated manner of committing suicide to be found dead in a boat dead from sun and thirst A sea mystery I wonder who would find us Davidson perhaps but Davidson passed westward ten days ago I watched him steaming past one early morning from the jetty You never told me she said He must have been looking at me through his big binoculars Perhaps if I had raised my arm but what did we want with Davidson then you and I He won t be back this way for three weeks or more Lena I wish I had raised my arm that morning What would have been the good of it she sighed out What good No good of course We had no forebodings This seemed to be an inexpugnable refuge where we could live untroubled and learn to know each other It s perhaps in trouble that people get to know each other she suggested Perhaps he said indifferently At any rate we would not have gone away from here with him though I believe he would have come in eagerly enough and ready for any service he could render It s that fat man s nature a delightful fellow You would not come on the wharf that time I sent the shawl back to missus Schomberg through him He has never seen you I didn t know that you wanted anybody ever to see me she said He had folded his arms on his breast and hung his head And I did not know that you cared to be seen as yet A misunderstanding evidently An honourable misunderstanding But it does not matter now He raised his head after a silence How gloomy this forest has grown Yet surely the sun cannot have set already She looked round and as if her eyes had just been opened she perceived the shades of the forest surrounding her not so much with gloom but with a sullen dumb menacing hostility Her heart sank in the engulfing stillness at that moment she felt the nearness of death breathing on her and on the man with her If there had been a sudden stir of leaves the crack of a dry branch the faintest rustle she would have screamed aloud But she shook off the unworthy weakness Such as she was a fiddle scraping girl picked up on the very threshold of infamy she would try to rise above herself triumphant and humble and then happiness would burst on her like a torrent flinging at her feet the man whom she loved Heyst stirred slightly We had better be getting back Lena since we can t stay all night in the woods or anywhere else for that matter We are the slaves of this infernal surprise which has been sprung on us by shall I say fate your fate or mine It was the man who had broken the silence but it was the woman who led the way At the very edge of the forest she stopped concealed by a tree He joined her cautiously What is it What do you see Lena he whispered She said that it was only a thought that had come into her head She hesitated for a moment giving him over her shoulder a shining gleam in her grey eyes She wanted to know whether this trouble this danger this evil whatever it was finding them out in their retreat was not a sort of punishment Punishment repeated Heyst He could not understand what she meant When she explained he was still more surprised A sort of retribution from an angry Heaven he said in wonder On us What on earth for He saw her pale face darken in the dusk She had blushed Her whispering flowed very fast It was the way they lived together that wasn t right was it It was a guilty life For she had not been forced into it driven scared into it No no she had come to him of her own free will with her whole soul yearning unlawfully He was so profoundly touched that he could not speak for a moment To conceal his trouble he assumed his best Heystian manner What Are our visitors then messengers of morality avengers of righteousness agents of Providence That s certainly an original view How flattered they would be if they could hear you Now you are making fun of me she said in a subdued voice which broke suddenly Are you conscious of sin Heyst asked gravely She made no answer For I am not he added before Heaven I am not You You are different Woman is the tempter You took me up from pity I threw myself at you Oh you exaggerate you exaggerate It was not so bad as that he said playfully keeping his voice steady with an effort He considered himself a dead man already yet forced to pretend that he was alive for her sake for her defence He regretted that he had no Heaven to which he could recommend this fair palpitating handful of ashes and dust warm living sentient his own and exposed helplessly to insult outrage degradation and infinite misery of the body She had averted her face from him and was still He suddenly seized her passive hand You will have it so he said Yes Well let us then hope for mercy together She shook her head without looking at him like an abashed child Remember he went on incorrigible with his delicate raillery that hope is a Christian virtue and surely you can t want all the mercy for yourself Before their eyes the bungalow across the cleared ground stood bathed in a sinister light An unexpected chill gust of wind made a noise in the tree tops She snatched her hand away and stepped out into the open but before she had advanced more than three yards she stood still and pointed to the west Oh look there she exclaimed Beyond the headland of Diamond Bay lying black on a purple sea great masses of cloud stood piled up and bathed in a mist of blood A crimson crack like an open wound zigzagged between them with a piece of dark red sun showing at the bottom Heyst cast an indifferent glance at the ill omened chaos of the sky Thunderstorm making up We shall hear it all night but it won t visit us probably The clouds generally gather round the volcano She was not listening to him Her eyes reflected the sombre and violent hues of the sunset That does not look much like a sign of mercy she said slowly as if to herself and hurried on followed by Heyst Suddenly she stopped I don t care I would do more yet And some day you ll forgive me You ll have to forgive me CHAPTER NINE Stumbling up the steps as if suddenly exhausted Lena entered the room and let herself fall on the nearest chair Before following her Heyst took a survey of the surroundings from the veranda It was a complete solitude There was nothing in the aspect of this familiar scene to tell him that he and the girl were not as completely alone as they had been in the early days of their common life on this abandoned spot with only Wang discreetly materializing from time to time and the uncomplaining memory of Morrison to keep them company After the cold gust of wind there was an absolute stillness of the air The thunder charged mass hung unbroken beyond the low ink black headland darkening the twilight By contrast the sky at the zenith displayed pellucid clearness the sheen of a delicate glass bubble which the merest movement of air might shatter A little to the left between the black masses of the headland and of the forest the volcano a feather of smoke by day and a cigar glow at night took its first fiery expanding breath of the evening Above it a reddish star came out like an expelled spark from the fiery bosom of the earth enchanted into permanency by the mysterious spell of frozen spaces In front of Heyst the forest already full of the deepest shades stood like a wall But he lingered watching its edge especially where it ended at the line of bushes masking the land end of the jetty Since the girl had spoken of catching a glimpse of something white among the trees he believed pretty firmly that they had been followed in their excursion up the mountain by mister Jones s secretary No doubt the fellow had watched them out of the forest and now unless he took the trouble to go back some distance and fetch a considerable circuit inland over the clearing he was bound to walk out into the open space before the bungalows Heyst did indeed imagine at one time some movement between the trees lost as soon as perceived He stared patiently but nothing more happened After all why should he trouble about these people s actions Why this stupid concern for the preliminaries since when the issue was joined it would find him disarmed and shrinking from the ugliness and degradation of it He turned and entered the room Deep dusk reigned in there already Lena near the door did not move or speak The sheen of the white tablecloth was very obtrusive The brute these two vagabonds had tamed had entered on its service while Heyst and Lena were away The table was laid Heyst walked up and down the room several times The girl remained without sound or movement on the chair But when Heyst placing the two silver candelabra on the table struck a match to light the candles she got up suddenly and went into the bedroom She came out again almost immediately having taken off her hat Heyst looked at her over his shoulder What s the good of shirking the evil hour I ve lighted these candles for a sign of our return After all we might not have been watched while returning I mean Of course we were seen leaving the house The girl sat down again The great wealth of her hair looked very dark above her colourless face She raised her eyes glistening softly in the light with a sort of unreadable appeal with a strange effect of unseeing innocence Yes said Heyst across the table the fingertips of one hand resting on the immaculate cloth A creature with an antediluvian lower jaw hairy like a mastodon and formed like a pre historic ape has laid this table Are you awake Lena Am I I would pinch myself only I know that nothing would do away with this dream Three covers You know it is the shorter of the two who s coming the gentleman who in the play of his shoulders as he walks and in his facial structure recalls a Jaguar Ah you don t know what a jaguar is But you have had a good look at these two It s the short one you know who s to be our guest She made a sign with her head that she knew Heyst s insistence brought Ricardo vividly before her mental vision A sudden languor like the physical echo of her struggle with the man paralysed all her limbs She lay still in the chair feeling very frightened at this phenomenon ready to pray aloud for strength Heyst had started to pace the room Our guest There is a proverb in Russia I believe that when a guest enters the house God enters the house The sacred virtue of hospitality But it leads one into trouble as well as any other The girl unexpectedly got up from the chair swaying her supple figure and stretching her arms above her head He stopped to look at her curiously paused and then went on I venture to think that God has nothing to do with such a hospitality and with such a guest She had jumped to her feet to react against the numbness to discover whether her body would obey her will It did She could stand up and she could move her arms freely Though no physiologist she concluded that all that sudden numbness was in her head not in her limbs Her fears assuaged she thanked God for it mentally and to Heyst murmured a protest Oh yes He s got to do with everything every little thing Nothing can happen Yes he said hastily one of the two sparrows can t be struck to the ground you are thinking of that The habitual playful smile faded on the kindly lips under the martial moustache Ah you remember what you have been told as a child on Sundays Yes I do remember She sank into the chair again It was the only decent bit of time I ever had when I was a kid with our landlady s two girls you know I wonder Lena Heyst said with a return to his urbane playfulness whether you are just a little child or whether you represent something as old as the world She surprised Heyst by saying dreamily Well and what about you I I date later much later I can t call myself a child but I am so recent that I may call myself a man of the last hour or is it the hour before last I have been out of it so long that I am not certain how far the hands of the clock have moved since since He glanced at the portrait of his father exactly above the head of the girl as if it were ignoring her in its painted austerity of feeling He did not finish the sentence but he did not remain silent for long Only what must be avoided are fallacious inferences my dear Lena especially at this hour Now you are making fun of me again she said without looking up Am I he cried Making fun No giving warning Hang it all whatever truth people told you in the old days there is also this one that sparrows do fall to the ground that they are brought to the ground This is no vain assertion but a fact That s why again his tone changed while he picked up the table knife and let it fall disdainfully that s why I wish these wretched round knives had some edge on them Absolute rubbish neither edge point nor substance I believe one of these forks would make a better weapon at a pinch But can I go about with a fork in my pocket He gnashed his teeth with a rage very real and yet comic There used to be a carver here but it was broken and thrown away a long time ago Nothing much to carve here It would have made a noble weapon no doubt but He stopped The girl sat very quiet with downcast eyes As he kept silence for some time she looked up and said thoughtfully Yes a knife it s a knife that you would want wouldn t you in case in case He shrugged his shoulders There must be a crowbar or two in the sheds but I have given up all the keys together And then do you see me walking about with a crowbar in my hand Ha ha And besides that edifying sight alone might start the trouble for all I know In truth why has it not started yet Perhaps they are afraid of you she whispered looking down again By Jove it looks like it he assented meditatively They do seem to hang back for some reason Is that reason prudence or downright fear or perhaps the leisurely method of certitude Out in the black night not very far from the bungalow resounded a loud and prolonged whistle Lena s hands grasped the sides of the chair but she made no movement Heyst started and turned his face away from the door The startling sound had died away Whistles yells omens signals portents what do they matter he said But what about the crowbar Suppose I had it Could I stand in ambush at the side of the door this door and smash the first protruding head scatter blood and brains over the floor over these walls and then run stealthily to the other door to do the same thing and repeat the performance for a third time perhaps Could I On suspicion without compunction with a calm and determined purpose No it is not in me I date too late Would you like to see me attempt this thing while that mysterious prestige of mine lasts or their not less mysterious hesitation No no she whispered ardently as if compelled to speak by his eyes fixed on her face No it s a knife you want to defend yourself with to defend there will be time And who knows if it isn t really my duty he began again as if he had not heard her disjointed words at all It may be my duty to you to myself For why should I put up with the humiliation of their secret menaces Do you know what the world would say He emitted a low laugh which struck her with terror She would have got up but he stooped so low over her that she could not move without first pushing him away It would say Lena that I the Swede after luring my friend and partner to his death from mere greed of money have murdered these unoffending shipwrecked strangers from sheer funk That would be the story whispered perhaps shouted certainly spread out and believed and believed my dear Lena Who would believe such awful things Perhaps you wouldn t not at first at any rate but the power of calumny grows with time It s insidious and penetrating It can even destroy one s faith in oneself dry rot the soul All at once her eyes leaped to the door and remained fixed stony a little enlarged Turning his head Heyst beheld the figure of Ricardo framed in the doorway For a moment none of the three moved then looking from the newcomer to the girl in the chair Heyst formulated a sardonic introduction mister Ricardo my dear Her head drooped a little Ricardo s hand went up to his moustache His voice exploded in the room At your service ma am He stepped in taking his hat off with a flourish and dropping it carelessly on a chair near the door At your service he repeated in quite another tone I was made aware there was a lady about by that Pedro of ours only I didn t know I should have the privilege of seeing you tonight ma am Lena and Heyst looked at him covertly but he with a vague gaze avoiding them both looked at nothing seeming to pursue some point in space Had a pleasant walk he asked suddenly Yes And you returned Heyst who had managed to catch his glance I haven t been a yard away from the governor this afternoon till I started for here The genuineness of the accent surprised Heyst without convincing him of the truth of the words Why do you ask pursued Ricardo with every inflection of perfect candour You might have wished to explore the island a little said Heyst studying the man who to render him justice did not try to free his captured gaze I may remind you that it wouldn t be a perfectly safe proceeding Ricardo presented a picture of innocence Oh yes meaning that Chink that has ran away from you He ain t much He has a revolver observed Heyst meaningly Well and you have a revolver too mister Ricardo argued unexpectedly I don t worry myself about that That s different I am not afraid of you Heyst made answer after a short pause Of me Of all of you You have a queer way of putting things began Ricardo At that moment the door on the compound side of the house came open with some noise and Pedro entered pressing the edge of a loaded tray to his breast His big hairy head rolled a little his feet fell in front of each other with a short hard thump on the floor The arrival changed the current of Ricardo s thought perhaps but certainly of his speech You heard me whistling a little while ago outside That was to give him a hint as I came along that it was time to bring in the dinner and here it is Lena rose and passed to the right of Ricardo who lowered his glance for a moment They sat down at the table The enormous gorilla back of Pedro swayed out through the door Extraordinary strong brute ma am said Ricardo He had a propensity to talk about his Pedro as some men will talk of their dog He ain t pretty though No he ain t pretty And he has got to be kept under I am his keeper as it might be The governor don t trouble his head much about dee tails All that s left to Martin Martin that s me ma am Heyst saw the girl s eyes turn towards mister Jones s secretary and rest blankly on his face Ricardo however looked vaguely into space and with faint flickers of a smile about his lips made conversation indefatigably against the silence of his entertainers He boasted largely of his long association with mister Jones over four years now he said Then glancing rapidly at Heyst You can see at once he s a gentleman can t you You people Heyst said his habitual playful intonation tinged with gloom are divorced from all reality in my eyes Ricardo received this speech as if he had been expecting to hear those very words or else did not mind at all what Heyst might say He muttered an absent minded Ay ay played with a bit of biscuit sighed and said with a peculiar stare which did not seem to carry any distance but to stop short at a point in the air very near his face Anybody can see at once you are one You and the governor ought to understand each other He expects to see you tonight The governor isn t well and we ve got to think of getting away from here While saying these words he turned himself full towards Lena but without any marked expression Leaning back with folded arms the girl stared before her as if she had been alone in the room But under that aspect of almost vacant unconcern the perils and emotion that had entered into her life warmed her heart exalted her mind with a sense of an inconceivable intensity of existence Really Thinking of going away from here Heyst murmured The best of friends must part Ricardo pronounced slowly And as long as they part friends there s no harm done We two are used to be on the move You I understand prefer to stick in one place It was obvious that all this was being said merely for the sake of talking and that Ricardo s mind was concentrated on some purpose unconnected with the words that were coming out of his mouth I should like to know Heyst asked with incisive politeness how you have come to understand this or anything else about me As far as I can remember I ve made you no confidences Ricardo gazing comfortably into space out of the back of his chair for some time all three had given up any pretence of eating answered abstractedly Any fellow might have guessed it He sat up suddenly and uncovered all his teeth in a grin of extraordinary ferocity which was belied by the persistent amiability of his tone The governor will be the man to tell you something about that I wish you would say you would see my governor He s the one who does all our talking Let me take you to him this evening He ain t at all well and he can t make up his mind to go away without having a talk with you Heyst looking up met Lena s eyes Their expression of candour seemed to hide some struggling intention Her head he fancied had made an imperceptible affirmative movement Why What reason could she have Was it the prompting of some obscure instinct Or was it simply a delusion of his own senses But in this strange complication invading the quietude of his life in his state of doubt and disdain and almost of despair with which he looked at himself he would let even a delusive appearance guide him through a darkness so dense that it made for indifference Well suppose I do say so Ricardo did not conceal his satisfaction which for a moment interested Heyst It can t be my life they are after he said to himself What good could it be to them He looked across the table at the girl What did it matter whether she had nodded or not As always when looking into her unconscious eyes he tasted something like the dregs of tender pity He had decided to go Her nod imaginary or not imaginary advice or illusion had tipped the scale He reflected that Ricardo s invitation could scarcely be anything in the nature of a trap It would have been too absurd Why carry subtly into a trap someone already bound hand and foot as it were All this time he had been looking fixedly at the girl he called Lena In the submissive quietness of her being which had been her attitude ever since they had begun their life on the island she remained as secret as ever Heyst got up abruptly with a smile of such enigmatic and despairing character that mister Secretary Ricardo whose abstract gaze had an all round efficiency made a slight crouching start as if to dive under the table for his leg knife a start that was repressed as soon as begun He had expected Heyst to spring on him or draw a revolver because he created for himself a vision of him in his own image Instead of doing either of these obvious things Heyst walked across the room opened the door and put his head through it to look out into the compound As soon as his back was turned Ricardo s hand sought the girl s arm under the table He was not looking at her but she felt the groping nervous touch of his search felt suddenly the grip of his fingers above her wrist He leaned forward a little still he dared not look at her His hard stare remained fastened on Heyst s back In an extremely low hiss his fixed idea of argument found expression scathingly See He s no good He s not the man for you He glanced at her at last Her lips moved a little and he was awed by that movement without a sound Next instant the hard grasp of his fingers vanished from her arm Heyst had shut the door On his way back to the table he crossed the path of the girl they had called Alma she didn t know why also Magdalen whose mind had remained so long in doubt as to the reason of her own existence She no longer wondered at that bitter riddle since her heart found its solution in a blinding hot glow of passionate purpose CHAPTER TEN She passed by Heyst as if she had indeed been blinded by some secret lurid and consuming glare into which she was about to enter The curtain of the bedroom door fell behind her into rigid folds Ricardo s vacant gaze seemed to be watching the dancing flight of a fly in mid air Extra dark outside ain t it he muttered Not so dark but that I could see that man of yours prowling about there said Heyst in measured tones What Pedro He s scarcely a man you know or else I wouldn t be so fond of him as I am Very well Let s call him your worthy associate Ay Worthy enough for what we want of him A great standby is Peter in a scrimmage A growl and a bite oh my And you don t want him about I don t You want him out of the way insisted Ricardo with an affectation of incredulity which Heyst accepted calmly though the air in the room seemed to grow more oppressive with every word spoken That s it I do want him out of the way He forced himself to speak equably Lor That s no great matter Pedro s not much use here The business my governor s after can be settled by ten minutes rational talk with with another gentleman Quiet talk He looked up suddenly with hard phosphorescent eyes Heyst didn t move a muscle Ricardo congratulated himself on having left his revolver behind He was so exasperated that he didn t know what he might have done He said at last You want poor harmless Peter out of the way before you let me take you to see the governor is that it Yes that is it H m One can see Ricardo said with hidden venom that you are a gentleman but all that gentlemanly fancifulness is apt to turn sour on a plain man s stomach However you ll have to pardon me He put his fingers into his mouth and let out a whistle which seemed to drive a thin sharp shaft of air solidly against one s nearest ear drum Though he greatly enjoyed Heyst s involuntary grimace he sat perfectly stolid waiting for the effect of the call It brought Pedro in with an extraordinary uncouth primeval impetuosity The door flew open with a clatter and the wild figure it disclosed seemed anxious to devastate the room in leaps and bounds but Ricardo raised his open palm and the creature came in quietly His enormous half closed paws swung to and fro a little in front of his bowed trunk as he walked Ricardo looked on truculently You go to the boat understand Go now The little red eyes of the tame monster blinked with painful attention in the mass of hair Well Why don t you get Forgot human speech eh Don t you know any longer what a boat is Si boat the creature stammered out doubtfully Well go there the boat at the jetty March off to it and sit there lie down there do anything but go to sleep there till you hear my call and then fly here Them s your orders March Get vamos No not that way out through the front door No sulks Pedro obeyed with uncouth alacrity When he had gone the gleam of pitiless savagery went out of Ricardo s yellow eyes and his physiognomy took on for the first time that evening the expression of a domestic cat which is being noticed You can watch him right into the bushes if you like Too dark eh Why not go with him to the very spot then Heyst made a gesture of vague protest There s nothing to assure me that he will stay there I have no doubt of his going but it s an act without guarantee There you are Ricardo shrugged his shoulders philosophically Can t be helped Short of shooting our Pedro nobody can make absolutely sure of his staying in the same place longer than he has a mind to but I tell you he lives in holy terror of my temper That s why I put on my sudden death air when I talk to him And yet I wouldn t shoot him not I unless in such a fit of rage as would make a man shoot his favourite dog Look here sir This deal is on the square I didn t tip him a wink to do anything else He won t budge from the jetty Are you coming along now sir A short silence ensued Ricardo s jaws were working ominously under his skin His eyes glided voluptuously here and there cruel and dreamy Heyst checked a sudden movement reflected for a while then said You must wait a little Wait a little Wait a little What does he think a fellow is a graven image grumbled Ricardo half audibly Heyst went into the bedroom and shut the door after him with a bang Coming from the light he could not see a thing in there at first yet he received the impression of the girl getting up from the floor On the less opaque darkness of the shutter hole her head detached itself suddenly very faint a mere hint of a round dark shape without a face I am going Lena I am going to confront these scoundrels He was surprised to feel two arms falling on his shoulders I thought that you he began Yes yes the girl whispered hastily She neither clung to him nor yet did she try to draw him to her Her hands grasped his shoulders and she seemed to him to be staring into his face in the dark And now he could see something of her face too an oval without features and faintly distinguish her person in the blackness a form without definite lines You have a black dress here haven t you Lena he asked speaking rapidly and so low that she could just hear him Yes an old thing Very good Put it on at once But why Not for mourning There was something peremptory in the slightly ironic murmur Can you find it and get into it in the dark She could She would try He waited very still He could imagine her movements over there at the far end of the room but his eyes accustomed now to the darkness had lost her completely When she spoke her voice surprised him by its nearness She had done what he had told her to do and had approached him invisible Good Where s that piece of purple veil I ve seen lying about he asked There was no answer only a slight rustle Where is it he repeated impatiently Her unexpected breath was on his cheek In my hands Capital Listen Lena As soon as I leave the bungalow with that horrible scoundrel you slip out at the back instantly lose no time and run round into the forest That will be your time while we are walking away and I am sure he won t give me the slip Run into the forest behind the fringe of bushes between the big trees You will know surely how to find a place in full view of the front door I fear for you but in this black dress with most of your face muffled up in that dark veil I defy anybody to find you there before daylight Wait in the forest till the table is pushed into full view of the doorway and you see three candles out of four blown out and one relighted or should the lights be put out here while you watch them wait till three candles are lighted and then two put out At either of these signals run back as hard as you can for it will mean that I am waiting for you here While he was speaking the girl had sought and seized one of his hands She did not press it she held it loosely as it were timidly caressingly It was no grasp it was a mere contact as if only to make sure that he was there that he was real and no mere darker shadow in the obscurity The warmth of her hand gave Heyst a strange intimate sensation of all her person He had to fight down a new sort of emotion which almost unmanned him He went on whispering sternly But if you see no such signals don t let anything fear curiosity despair or hope entice you back to this house and with the first sign of dawn steal away along the edge of the clearing till you strike the path Wait no longer because I shall probably be dead The murmur of the word Never floated into his ear as if it formed itself in the air You know the path he continued Make your way to the barricade Go to Wang yes to Wang Let nothing stop you It seemed to him that the girl s hand trembled a little The worst he can do to you is to shoot you but he won t I really think he won t if I am not there Stay with the villagers with the wild people and fear nothing They will be more awed by you than you can be frightened of them Davidson s bound to turn up before very long Keep a look out for a passing steamer Think of some sort of signal to call him She made no answer The sense of the heavy brooding silence in the outside world seemed to enter and fill the room the oppressive infinity of it without breath without light It was as if the heart of hearts had ceased to beat and the end of all things had come Have you understood You are to run out of the house at once Heyst whispered urgently She lifted his hand to her lips and let it go He was startled Lena he cried out under his breath She was gone from his side He dared not trust himself no not even to the extent of a tender word Turning to go out he heard a thud somewhere in the house To open the door he had first to lift the curtain he did so with his face over his shoulder The merest trickle of light coming through the keyhole and one or two cracks was enough for his eyes to see her plainly all black down on her knees with her head and arms flung on the foot of the bed all black in the desolation of a mourning sinner What was this A suspicion that there were everywhere more things than he could understand crossed Heyst s mind Her arm detached from the bed motioned him away He obeyed and went out full of disquiet The curtain behind him had not ceased to tremble when she was up on her feet close against it listening for sounds for words in a stooping tragic attitude of stealthy attention one hand clutching at her breast as if to compress to make less loud the beating of her heart Heyst had caught mister Jones s secretary in the contemplation of his closed writing desk Ricardo might have been meditating how to break into it but when he turned about suddenly he showed so distorted a face that it made Heyst pause in wonder at the upturned whites of the eyes which were blinking horribly as if the man were inwardly convulsed I thought you were never coming Ricardo mumbled I didn t know you were pressed for time Even if your going away depends on this conversation as you say I doubt if you are the men to put to sea on such a night as this said Heyst motioning Ricardo to precede him out of the house With feline undulations of hip and shoulder the secretary left the room at once There was something cruel in the absolute dumbness of the night The great cloud covering half the sky hung right against one like an enormous curtain hiding menacing preparations of violence As the feet of the two men touched the ground a rumble came from behind it preceded by a swift mysterious gleam of light on the waters of the bay Ha said Ricardo It begins It may be nothing in the end observed Heyst stepping along steadily No Let it come Ricardo said viciously I am in the humour for it By the time the two men had reached the other bungalow the far off modulated rumble growled incessantly while pale lightning in waves of cold fire flooded and ran off the island in rapid succession Ricardo unexpectedly dashed ahead up the steps and put his head through the doorway Here he is governor Keep him with you as long as you can till you hear me whistle I am on the track He flung these words into the room with inconceivable speed and stood aside to let the visitor pass through the doorway but he had to wait an appreciable moment because Heyst seeing his purpose had scornfully slowed his pace When Heyst entered the room it was with a smile the Heyst smile lurking under his martial moustache CHAPTER ELEVEN Two candles were burning on the stand up desk mister Jones tightly enfolded in an old but gorgeous blue silk dressing gown kept his elbows close against his sides and his hands deeply plunged into the extraordinarily deep pockets of the garment The costume accentuated his emaciation He resembled a painted pole leaning against the edge of the desk with a dried head of dubious distinction stuck on the top of it Ricardo lounged in the doorway Indifferent in appearance to what was going on he was biding his time At a given moment between two flickers of lightning he melted out of his frame into the outer air His disappearance was observed on the instant by mister Jones who abandoned his nonchalant immobility against the desk and made a few steps calculated to put him between Heyst and the doorway It s awfully close he remarked Heyst in the middle of the room had made up his mind to speak plainly We haven t met to talk about the weather You favoured me earlier in the day with a rather cryptic phrase about yourself I am he that is you said What does that mean mister Jones without looking at Heyst continued his absentminded movements till attaining the desired position he brought his shoulders with a thump against the wall near the door and raised his head In the emotion of the decisive moment his haggard face glistened with perspiration Drops ran down his hollow cheeks and almost blinded the spectral eyes in their bony caverns It means that I am a person to be reckoned with No stop Don t put your hand into your pocket don t His voice had a wild unexpected shrillness Heyst started and there ensued a moment of suspended animation during which the thunder s deep bass muttered distantly and the doorway to the right of mister Jones flickered with bluish light At last Heyst shrugged his shoulders he even looked at his hand He didn t put it in his pocket however mister Jones glued against the wall watched him raise both his hands to the ends of his horizontal moustaches and answered the note of interrogation in his steady eyes A matter of prudence said mister Jones in his natural hollow tones and with a face of deathlike composure A man of your free life has surely perceived that You are a much talked about man mister Heyst and though as far as I understand you are accustomed to employ the subtler weapons of intelligence still I can t afford to take any risks of the er grosser methods I am not unscrupulous enough to be a match for you in the use of intelligence but I assure you mister Heyst that in the other way you are no match for me I have you covered at this very moment You have been covered ever since you entered this room Yes from my pocket During this harangue Heyst looked deliberately over his shoulder stepped back a pace and sat down on the end of the camp bedstead Leaning his elbow on one knee he laid his cheek in the palm of his hand and seemed to meditate on what he should say next mister Jones planted against the wall was obviously waiting for some sort of overture As nothing came he resolved to speak himself but he hesitated For though he considered that the most difficult step had been taken he said to himself that every stage of progress required great caution lest the man in Ricardo s phraseology should start to prance which would be most inconvenient He fell back on a previous statement And I am a person to be reckoned with The other man went on looking at the floor as if he were alone in the room There was a pause You have heard of me then Heyst said at length looking up I should think so We have been staying at Schomberg s hotel Schom Heyst choked on the word What s the matter mister Heyst Nothing Nausea Heyst said resignedly He resumed his former attitude of meditative indifference What is this reckoning you are talking about he asked after a time in the quietest possible tone I don t know you It s obvious that we belong to the same social sphere began mister Jones with languid irony Inwardly he was as watchful as he could be Something has driven you out the originality of your ideas perhaps Or your tastes mister Jones indulged in one of his ghastly smiles In repose his features had a curious character of evil exhausted austerity but when he smiled the whole mask took on an unpleasantly infantile expression A recrudescence of the rolling thunder invaded the room loudly and passed into silence You are not taking this very well observed mister Jones This was what he said but as a matter of fact he thought that the business was shaping quite satisfactorily The man he said to himself had no stomach for a fight Aloud he continued Come You can t expect to have it always your own way You are a man of the world And you Heyst interrupted him unexpectedly How do you define yourself I my dear sir In one way I am yes I am the world itself come to pay you a visit In another sense I am an outcast almost an outlaw If you prefer a less materialistic view I am a sort of fate the retribution that waits its time I wish to goodness you were the commonest sort of ruffian said Heyst raising his equable gaze to mister Jones One would be able to talk to you straight then and hope for some humanity As it is I dislike violence and ferocity of every sort as much as you do mister Jones declared looking very languid as he leaned against the wall but speaking fairly loud You can ask my Martin if it is not so This mister Heyst is a soft age It is also an age without prejudices I ve heard that you are free from them yourself You mustn t be shocked if I tell you plainly that we are after your money or I am if you prefer to make me alone responsible Pedro of course knows no more of it than any other animal would Ricardo is of the faithful retainer class absolutely identified with all my ideas wishes and even whims mister Jones pulled his left hand out of his pocket got a handkerchief out of another and began to wipe the perspiration from his forehead neck and chin The excitement from which he suffered made his breathing visible In his long dressing gown he had the air of a convalescent invalid who had imprudently overtaxed his strength Heyst broad shouldered robust watched the operation from the end of the camp bedstead very calm his hands on his knees And by the by he asked where is he now that henchman of yours Breaking into my desk That would be crude Still crudeness is one of life s conditions There was the slightest flavour of banter in the tone of Ricardo s governor Conceivable but unlikely Martin is a little crude but you are not mister Heyst To tell you the truth I don t know precisely where he is He has been a little mysterious of late but he has my confidence No don t get up mister Heyst The viciousness of his spectral face was indescribable Heyst who had moved a little was surprised by the disclosure It was not my intention he said Pray remain seated mister Jones insisted in a languid voice but with a very determined glitter in his black eye caverns If you were more observant said Heyst with dispassionate contempt you would have known before I had been five minutes in the room that I had no weapon of any sort on me Possibly but pray keep your hands still They are very well where they are This is too big an affair for me to take any risks Big Too big Heyst repeated with genuine surprise Good Heavens Whatever you are looking for there s very little of it here very little of anything You would naturally say so but that s not what we have heard retorted mister Jones quickly with a grin so ghastly that it was impossible to think it voluntary Heyst s face had grown very gloomy He knitted his brows What have you heard he asked A lot mister Heyst a lot affirmed mister Jones He was vying to recover his manner of languid superiority We have heard for instance of a certain mister Morrison once your partner Heyst could not repress a slight movement Aha said mister Jones with a sort of ghostly glee on his face The muffled thunder resembled the echo of a distant cannonade below the horizon and the two men seemed to be listening to it in sullen silence This diabolical calumny will end in actually and literally taking my life from me thought Heyst Then suddenly he laughed Portentously spectral mister Jones frowned at the sound Laugh as much as you please he said I who have been hounded out from society by a lot of highly moral souls can t see anything funny in that story But here we are and you will now have to pay for your fun mister Heyst You have heard a lot of ugly lies observed Heyst Take my word for it You would say so of course very natural As a matter of fact I haven t heard very much Strictly speaking it was Martin He collects information and so on You don t suppose I would talk to that Schomberg animal more than I could help It was Martin whom he took into his confidence The stupidity of that creature is so great that it becomes formidable Heyst said as if speaking to himself Involuntarily his mind turned to the girl wandering in the forest alone and terrified Would he ever see her again At that thought he nearly lost his self possession But the idea that if she followed his instructions those men were not likely to find her steadied him a little They did not know that the island had any inhabitants and he himself once disposed of they would be too anxious to get away to waste time hunting for a vanished girl All this passed through Heyst s mind in a flash as men think in moments of danger He looked speculatively at mister Jones who of course had never for a moment taken his eyes from his intended victim And the conviction came to Heyst that this outlaw from the higher spheres was an absolutely hard and pitiless scoundrel mister Jones s voice made him start It would be useless for instance to tell me that your Chinaman has run off with your money A man living alone with a Chinaman on an island takes care to conceal property of that kind so well that the devil himself Certainly Heyst muttered Again with his left hand mister Jones mopped his frontal bone his stalk like neck his razor jaws his fleshless chin Again his voice faltered and his aspect became still more gruesomely malevolent as of a wicked and pitiless corpse I see what you mean he cried but you mustn t put too much trust in your ingenuity You don t strike me as a very ingenious person mister Heyst Neither am I My talents lie another way But Martin Who is now engaged in rifling my desk interjected Heyst I don t think so What I was going to say is that Martin is much cleverer than a Chinaman Do you believe in racial superiority mister Heyst I do firmly Martin is great at ferreting out such secrets as yours for instance Secrets like mine repeated Heyst bitterly Well I wish him joy of all he can ferret out That s very kind of you remarked mister Jones He was beginning to be anxious for Martin s return Of iron self possession at the gaming table fearless in a sudden affray he found that this rather special kind of work was telling on his nerves Keep still as you are he cried sharply I ve told you I am not armed said Heyst folding his arms on his breast I am really inclined to believe that you are not admitted mister Jones seriously Strange he mused aloud the caverns of his eyes turned upon Heyst Then briskly But my object is to keep you in this room Don t provoke me by some unguarded movement to smash your knee or do something definite of that sort He passed his tongue over his lips which were dry and black while his forehead glistened with moisture I don t know if it wouldn t be better to do it at once He who deliberates is lost said Heyst with grave mockery mister Jones disregarded the remark He had the air of communing with himself Physically I am no match for you he said slowly his black gaze fixed upon the man sitting on the end of the bed You could spring Are you trying to frighten yourself asked Heyst abruptly You don t seem to have quite enough pluck for your business Why don t you do it at once mister Jones taking violent offence snorted like a savage skeleton Strange as it may seem to you it is because of my origin my breeding my traditions my early associations and such like trifles Not everybody can divest himself of the prejudices of a gentleman as easily as you have done mister Heyst But don t worry about my pluck If you were to make a clean spring at me you would receive in mid air so to speak something that would make you perfectly harmless by the time you landed No don t misapprehend us mister Heyst We are er adequate bandits and we are after the fruit of your labours as a er successful swindler It s the way of the world gorge and disgorge He leaned wearily the back of his head against the wall His vitality seemed exhausted Even his sunken eyelids drooped within the bony sockets Only his thin waspish beautifully pencilled eyebrows drawn together a little suggested the will and the power to sting something vicious unconquerable and deadly Fruits Swindler repeated Heyst without heat almost without contempt You are giving yourself no end of trouble you and your faithful henchman to crack an empty nut There are no fruits here as you imagine There are a few sovereigns which you may have if you like and since you have called yourself a bandit Yaas drawled mister Jones That rather than a swindler Open warfare at least Very good Only let me tell you that there were never in the world two more deluded bandits never Heyst uttered these words with such energy that mister Jones stiffening up seemed to become thinner and taller in his metallic blue dressing gown against the whitewashed wall Fooled by a silly rascally innkeeper Heyst went on Talked over like a pair of children with a promise of sweets I didn t talk with that disgusting animal muttered mister Jones sullenly but he convinced Martin who is no fool I should think he wanted very much to be convinced said Heyst with the courteous intonation so well known in the Islands I don t want to disturb your touching trust in your your follower but he must be the most credulous brigand in existence What do you imagine If the story of my riches were ever so true do you think Schomberg would have imparted it to you from sheer altruism Is that the way of the world mister Jones For a moment the lower jaw of Ricardo s gentleman dropped but it came up with a snap of scorn and he said with spectral intensity The beast is cowardly He was frightened and wanted to get rid of us if you want to know mister Heyst I don t know that the material inducement was so very great but I was bored and we decided to accept the bribe I don t regret it All my life I have been seeking new impressions and you have turned out to be something quite out of the common Martin of course looks to the material results He s simple and faithful and wonderfully acute Ah yes He s on the track and now Heyst s speech had the character of politely grim raillery but not sufficiently on the track as yet to make it quite convenient to shoot me without more ado Didn t Schomberg tell you precisely where I conceal the fruit of my rapines Pah Don t you know he would have told you anything true or false from a very clear motive Revenge Mad hate the unclean idiot mister Jones did not seem very much moved On his right hand the doorway incessantly flickered with distant lightning and the continuous rumble of thunder went on irritatingly like the growl of an inarticulate giant muttering fatuously Heyst overcame his immense repugnance to allude to her whose image cowering in the forest was constantly before his eyes with all the pathos and force of its appeal august pitiful and almost holy to him It was in a hurried embarrassed manner that he went on If it had not been for that girl whom he persecuted with his insane and odious passion and who threw herself on my protection he would never have but you know well enough I don t know burst out mister Jones with amazing heat That hotel keeper tried to talk to me once of some girl he had lost but I told him I didn t want to hear any of his beastly women stories It had something to do with you had it Heyst looked on serenely at this outburst then lost his patience a little What sort of comedy is this You don t mean to say that you didn t know that I had that there was a girl living with me here One could see that the eyes of mister Jones had become fixed in the depths of their black holes by the gleam of white becoming steady there The whole man seemed frozen still Here Here he screamed out twice There was no mistaking his astonishment his shocked incredulity something like frightened disgust Heyst was disgusted also but in another way He too was incredulous He regretted having mentioned the girl but the thing was done his repugnance had been overcome in the heat of his argument against the absurd bandit Is it possible that you didn t know of that significant fact he inquired Of the only effective truth in the welter of silly lies that deceived you so easily No I didn t mister Jones shouted But Martin did he added in a faint whisper which Heyst s ears just caught and no more I kept her out of sight as long as I could said Heyst Perhaps with your bringing up traditions and so on you will understand my reason for it He knew He knew before mister Jones mourned in a hollow voice He knew of her from the first Backed hard against the wall he no longer watched Heyst He had the air of a man who had seen an abyss yawning under his feet If I want to kill him this is my time thought Heyst but he did not move Next moment mister Jones jerked his head up glaring with sardonic fury I have a good mind to shoot you you woman ridden hermit you man in the moon that can t exist without no it won t be you that I ll shoot It s the other woman lover the prevaricating sly low class amorous cuss And he shaved shaved under my very nose I ll shoot him He s gone mad thought Heyst startled by the spectre s sudden fury He felt himself more in danger nearer death than ever since he had entered that room An insane bandit is a deadly combination He did not could not know that mister Jones was quick minded enough to see already the end of his reign over his excellent secretary s thoughts and feelings the coming failure of Ricardo s fidelity A woman had intervened A woman a girl who apparently possessed the power to awaken men s disgusting folly Her power had been proved in two instances already the beastly innkeeper and that man with moustaches upon whom mister Jones his deadly right hand twitching in his pocket glared more in repulsion than in anger The very object of the expedition was lost from view in his sudden and overwhelming sense of utter insecurity And this made mister Jones feel very savage but not against the man with the moustaches Thus while Heyst was really feeling that his life was not worth two minutes purchase he heard himself addressed with no affectation of languid impertinence but with a burst of feverish determination Here Let s call a truce said mister Jones Heyst s heart was too sick to allow him to smile Have I been making war on you he asked wearily How do you expect me to attach any meaning to your words he went on You seem to be a morbid senseless sort of bandit We don t speak the same language If I were to tell you why I am here talking to you you wouldn t believe me because you would not understand me It certainly isn t the love of life from which I have divorced myself long ago not sufficiently perhaps but if you are thinking of yours then I repeat to you that it has never been in danger from me I am unarmed mister Jones was biting his lower lip in a deep meditation It was only towards the last that he looked at Heyst Unarmed eh Then he burst out violently I tell you a gentleman is no match for the common herd And yet one must make use of the brutes Unarmed eh And I suppose that creature is of the commonest sort You could hardly have got her out of a drawing room Though they re all alike for that matter Unarmed It s a pity I am in much greater danger than you are or were or I am much mistaken But I am not I know my man He lost his air of mental vacancy and broke out into shrill exclamations To Heyst they seemed madder than anything that had gone before On the track On the scent he cried forgetting himself to the point of executing a dance of rage in the middle of the floor Heyst looked on fascinated by this skeleton in a gay dressing gown jerkily agitated like a grotesque toy on the end of an invisible string It became quiet suddenly I might have smelt a rat I always knew that this would be the danger He changed suddenly to a confidential tone fixing his sepulchral stare on Heyst And yet here I am taken in by the fellow like the veriest fool I ve been always on the watch for some beastly influence but here I am fairly caught He shaved himself right in front of me and I never guessed The shrill laugh following on the low tone of secrecy sounded so convincingly insane that Heyst got up as if moved by a spring mister Jones stepped back two paces but displayed no uneasiness It s as clear as daylight he uttered mournfully and fell silent Behind him the doorway flickered lividly and the sound as of a naval action somewhere away on the horizon filled the breathless pause mister Jones inclined his head on his shoulder His mood had completely changed What do you say unarmed man Shall we go and see what is detaining my trusted Martin so long He asked me to keep you engaged in friendly conversation till he made a further examination of that track Ha ha ha He is no doubt ransacking my house said Heyst He was bewildered It seemed to him that all this was an incomprehensible dream or perhaps an elaborate other world joke contrived by that spectre in a gorgeous dressing gown mister Jones looked at him with a horrible cadaverous smile of inscrutable mockery and pointed to the door Heyst passed through it first His feelings had become so blunted that he did not care how soon he was shot in the back How oppressive the air is the voice of mister Jones said at his elbow This stupid storm gets on my nerves I would welcome some rain though it would be unpleasant to get wet On the other hand this exasperating thunder has the advantage of covering the sound of our approach The lightning s not so convenient Ah your house is fully illuminated My clever Martin is punishing your stock of candles He belongs to the unceremonious classes which are also unlovely untrustworthy and so on I left the candles burning said Heyst to save him trouble You really believed he would go to your house asked mister Jones with genuine interest I had that notion strongly I do believe he is there now And you don t mind No You don t mister Jones stopped to wonder You are an extraordinary man he said suspiciously and moved on touching elbows with Heyst In the latter s breast dwelt a deep silence the complete silence of unused faculties At this moment by simply shouldering mister Jones he could have thrown him down and put himself by a couple of leaps beyond the certain aim of the revolver but he did not even think of that His very will seemed dead of weariness He moved automatically his head low like a prisoner captured by the evil power of a masquerading skeleton out of a grave mister Jones took charge of the direction They fetched a wide sweep The echoes of distant thunder seemed to dog their footsteps By the by said mister Jones as if unable to restrain his curiosity aren t you anxious about that ouch that fascinating creature to whom you owe whatever pleasure you can find in our visit I have placed her in safety said Heyst I I took good care of that mister Jones laid a hand on his arm You have Look is that what you mean Heyst raised his head In the flicker of lightning the desolation of the cleared ground on his left leaped out and sank into the night together with the elusive forms of things distant pale unearthly But in the brilliant square of the door he saw the girl the woman he had longed to see once more as if enthroned with her hands on the arms of the chair She was in black her face was white her head dreamily inclined on her breast He saw her only as low as her knees He saw her there in the room alive with a sombre reality It was no mocking vision She was not in the forest but there She sat there in the chair seemingly without strength yet without fear tenderly stooping Can you understand their power whispered the hot breath of mister Jones into his ear Can there be a more disgusting spectacle It s enough to make the earth detestable She seems to have found her affinity Move on closer If I have to shoot you in the end then perhaps you will die cured Heyst obeyed the pushing pressure of a revolver barrel between his shoulders He felt it distinctly but he did not feel the ground under his feet They found the steps without his being aware that he was ascending them slowly one by one Doubt entered into him a doubt of a new kind formless hideous It seemed to spread itself all over him enter his limbs and lodge in his entrails He stopped suddenly with a thought that he who experienced such a feeling had no business to live or perhaps was no longer living Everything the bungalow the forest the open ground trembled incessantly the earth the sky itself shivered all the time and the only thing immovable in the shuddering universe was the interior of the lighted room and the woman in black sitting in the light of the eight candle flames They flung around her an intolerable brilliance which hurt his eyes seemed to sear his very brain with the radiation of infernal heat It was some time before his scorched eyes made out Ricardo seated on the floor at some little distance his back to the doorway but only partly so one side of his upturned face showing the absorbed all forgetful rapture of his contemplation The grip of mister Jones s hard claw drew Heyst back a little In the roll of thunder swelling and subsiding he whispered in his ear a sarcastic Of course A great shame descended upon Heyst the shame of guilt absurd and maddening mister Jones drew him still farther back into the darkness of the veranda This is serious he went on distilling his ghostly venom into Heyst s very ear I had to shut my eyes many times to his little flings but this is serious He has found his soul mate Mud souls obscene and cunning Mud bodies too the mud of the gutter I tell you we are no match for the vile populace I even I have been nearly caught He asked me to detain you till he gave me the signal It won t be you that I ll have to shoot but him I wouldn t trust him near me for five minutes after this He shook Heyst s arm a little If you had not happened to mention the creature we should both have been dead before morning He would have stabbed you as you came down the steps after leaving me and then he would have walked up to me and planted the same knife between my ribs He has no prejudices The viler the origin the greater the freedom of these simple souls He drew a cautious hissing breath and added in an agitated murmur I can see right into his mind I have been nearly caught napping by his cunning He stretched his neck to peer into the room from the side Heyst too made a step forward under the slight impulse of that slender hand clasping his hand with a thin bony grasp Behold the skeleton of the crazy bandit jabbered thinly into his ear in spectral fellowship Behold the simple Acis kissing the sandals of the nymph on the way to her lips all forgetful while the menacing fife of Polyphemus already sounds close at hand if he could only hear it Stoop a little CHAPTER TWELVE On returning to the Heyst bungalow rapid as if on wings Ricardo found Lena waiting for him She was dressed in black and at once his uplifting exultation was replaced by an awed and quivering patience before her white face before the immobility of her reposeful pose the more amazing to him who had encountered the strength of her limbs and the indomitable spirit in her body She had come out after Heyst s departure and had sat down under the portrait to wait for the return of the man of violence and death While lifting the curtain she felt the anguish of her disobedience to her lover which was soothed by a feeling she had known before a gentle flood of penetrating sweetness She was not automatically obeying a momentary suggestion she was under influences more deliberate more vague and of greater potency She had been prompted not by her will but by a force that was outside of her and more worthy She reckoned upon nothing definite she had calculated nothing She saw only her purpose of capturing death savage sudden irresponsible death prowling round the man who possessed her death embodied in the knife ready to strike into his heart No doubt it had been a sin to throw herself into his arms With that inspiration that descends at times from above for the good or evil of our common mediocrity she had a sense of having been for him only a violent and sincere choice of curiosity and pity a thing that passes She did not know him If he were to go away from her and disappear she would utter no reproach she would not resent it for she would hold in herself the impress of something most rare and precious his embraces made her own by her courage in saving his life All she thought of the essence of her tremors her flushes of heat and her shudders of cold was the question how to get hold of that knife the mark and sign of stalking death A tremor of impatience to clutch the frightful thing glimpsed once and unforgettable agitated her hands The instinctive flinging forward of these hands stopped Ricardo dead short between the door and her chair with the ready obedience of a conquered man who can bide his time Her success disconcerted her She listened to the man s impassioned transports of terrible eulogy and even more awful declarations of love She was even able to meet his eyes oblique apt to glide away throwing feral gleams of desire No he was saying after a fiery outpouring of words in which the most ferocious phrases of love were mingled with wooing accents of entreaty I will have no more of it Don t you mistrust me I am sober in my talk Feel how quietly my heart beats Ten times today when you you you swam in my eye I thought it would burst one of my ribs or leap out of my throat It has knocked itself dead and tired waiting for this evening for this very minute And now it can do no more Feel how quiet it is He made a step forward but she raised her clear voice commandingly No nearer He stopped with a smile of imbecile worship on his lips and with the delighted obedience of a man who could at any moment seize her in his hands and dash her to the ground Ah If I had taken you by the throat this morning and had my way with you I should never have known what you are And now I do You are a wonder And so am I in my way I have nerve and I have brains too We should have been lost many times but for me I plan I plot for my gentleman Gentleman pah I am sick of him And you are sick of yours eh You you He shook all over he cooed at her a string of endearing names obscene and tender and then asked abruptly Why don t you speak to me It s my part to listen she said giving him an inscrutable smile with a flush on her cheek and her lips cold as ice But you will answer me Yes she said her eyes dilated as if with sudden interest Where s that plunder Do you know No Not yet But there is plunder stowed somewhere that s worth having Yes I think so But who knows she added after a pause And who cares he retorted recklessly I ve had enough of this crawling on my belly It s you who are my treasure It s I who found you out where a gentleman had buried you to rot for his accursed pleasure He looked behind him and all around for a seat then turned to her his troubled eyes and dim smile I am dog tired he said and sat down on the floor I went tired this morning since I came in here and started talking to you as tired as if I had been pouring my life blood here on these planks for you to dabble your white feet in Unmoved she nodded at him thoughtfully Woman like all her faculties remained concentrated on her heart s desire on the knife while the man went on babbling insanely at her feet ingratiating and savage almost crazy with elation But he too was holding on to his purpose For you For you I will throw away money lives all the lives but mine What you want is a man a master that will let you put the heel of your shoe on his neck not that skulker who will get tired of you in a year and you of him And then what You are not the one to sit still neither am I I live for myself and you shall live for yourself too not for a Swedish baron They make a convenience of people like you and me A gentleman is better than an employer but an equal partnership against all the yporcrits is the thing for you and me We ll go on wandering the world over you and I both free and both true You are no cage bird We ll rove together for we are of them that have no homes We are born rovers She listened to him with the utmost attention as if any unexpected word might give her some sort of opening to get that dagger that awful knife to disarm murder itself pleading for her love at her feet Again she nodded at him thoughtfully rousing a gleam in his yellow eyes yearning devotedly upon her face When he hitched himself a little closer her soul had no movement of recoil This had to be Anything had to be which would bring the knife within her reach He talked more confidentially now We have met and their time has come he began looking up into her eyes The partnership between me and my gentleman has to be ripped up There s no room for him where we two are Why he would shoot me like a dog Don t you worry This will settle it not later than tonight He tapped his folded leg below the knee and was surprised flattered by the lighting up of her face which stooped towards him eagerly and remained expectant the lips girlishly parted red in the pale face and quivering in the quickened drawing of her breath You marvel you miracle you man s luck and joy one in a million No the only one You have found your man in me he whispered tremulously Listen They are having their last talk together for I ll do for your gentleman too by midnight Without the slightest tremor she murmured as soon as the tightening of her breast had eased off and the words would come I wouldn t be in too much of a hurry with him The pause the tone had all the value of meditated advice Good thrifty girl he laughed low with a strange feline gaiety expressed by the undulating movement of his shoulders and the sparkling snap of his oblique eyes You are still thinking about the chance of that swag You ll make a good partner that you will And I say what a decoy you will make Jee miny He was carried away for a moment but his face darkened swiftly No No reprieve What do you think a fellow is a scarecrow All hat and clothes and no feeling no inside no brain to make fancies for himself No he went on violently Never in his life will he go again into that room of yours never any more A silence fell He was gloomy with the torment of his jealousy and did not even look at her She sat up and slowly gradually bent lower and lower over him as if ready to fall into his arms He looked up at last and checked this droop unwittingly Say You who are up to fighting a man with your bare hands could you eh could you manage to stick one with a thing like that knife of mine She opened her eyes very wide and gave him a wild smile How can I tell she whispered enchantingly Will you let me have a look at it Without taking his eyes from her face he pulled the knife out of its sheath a short broad cruel double edged blade with a bone handle and only then looked down at it A good friend he said simply Take it in your hand and feel the balance he suggested At the moment when she bent forward to receive it from him there was a flash of fire in her mysterious eyes a red gleam in the white mist which wrapped the promptings and longings of her soul She had done it The very sting of death was in her hands the venom of the viper in her paradise extracted safe in her possession and the viper s head all but lying under her heel Ricardo stretched on the mats of the floor crept closer and closer to the chair in which she sat All her thoughts were busy planning how to keep possession of that weapon which had seemed to have drawn into itself every danger and menace on the death ridden earth She said with a low laugh the exultation in which he failed to recognize I didn t think that you would ever trust me with that thing Why not For fear I should suddenly strike you with it What for For this morning s work Oh no There s no spite in you for that You forgave me You saved me You got the better of me too And anyhow what good would it be No no good she admitted In her heart she felt that she would not know how to do it that if it came to a struggle she would have to drop the dagger and fight with her hands Listen When we are going about the world together you shall always call me husband Do you hear Yes she said bracing herself for the contest in whatever shape it was coming The knife was lying in her lap She let it slip into the fold of her dress and laid her forearms with clasped fingers over her knees which she pressed desperately together The dreaded thing was out of sight at last She felt a dampness break out all over her I am not going to hide you like that good for nothing finicky sneery gentleman You shall be my pride and my chum Isn t that better than rotting on an island for the pleasure of a gentleman till he gives you the chuck I ll be anything you like she said In his intoxication he crept closer with every word she uttered with every movement she made Give your foot he begged in a timid murmur and in the full consciousness of his power Anything Anything to keep murder quiet and disarmed till strength had returned to her limbs and she could make up her mind what to do Her fortitude had been shaken by the very facility of success that had come to her She advanced her foot forward a little from under the hem of her skirt and he threw himself on it greedily She was not even aware of him She had thought of the forest to which she had been told to run Yes the forest that was the place for her to carry off the terrible spoil the sting of vanquished death Ricardo clasping her ankle pressed his lips time after time to the instep muttering gasping words that were like sobs making little noises that resembled the sounds of grief and distress Unheard by them both the thunder growled distantly with angry modulations of it s tremendous voice while the world outside shuddered incessantly around the dead stillness of the room where the framed profile of Heyst s father looked severely into space Suddenly Ricardo felt himself spurned by the foot he had been cherishing spurned with a push of such violence into the very hollow of his throat that it swung him back instantly into an upright position on his knees He read his danger in the stony eyes of the girl and in the very act of leaping to his feet he heard sharply detached on the comminatory voice of the storm the brief report of a shot which half stunned him in the manner of a blow He turned his burning head and saw Heyst towering in the doorway The thought that the beggar had started to prance darted through his mind For a fraction of a second his distracted eyes sought for his weapon all over the floor He couldn t see it Stick him you he called hoarsely to the girl and dashed headlong for the door of the compound While he thus obeyed the instinct of self preservation his reason was telling him that he could not possibly reach it alive It flew open however with a crash before his launched weight and instantly he swung it to behind him There his shoulder leaning against it his hands clinging to the handle dazed and alone in the night full of shudders and muttered menaces he tried to pull himself together He asked himself if he had been shot at more than once His shoulder was wet with the blood trickling from his head Feeling above his ear he ascertained that it was only a graze but the shock of the surprise had unmanned him for the moment What the deuce was the governor about to let the beggar break loose like this Or was the governor dead perhaps The silence within the room awed him Of going back there could be no question But she knows how to take care of her self he muttered She had his knife It was she now who was deadly while he was disarmed no good for the moment He stole away from the door staggering the warm trickle running down his neck to find out what had become of the governor and to provide himself with a firearm from the armoury in the trunks CHAPTER THIRTEEN mister Jones after firing his shot over Heyst s shoulder had thought it proper to dodge away Like the spectre he was he noiselessly vanished from the veranda Heyst stumbled into the room and looked around All the objects in there the books portrait on the wall seemed shadowy unsubstantial the dumb accomplices of an amazing dream plot ending in an illusory effect of awakening and the impossibility of ever closing his eyes again With dread he forced himself to look at the girl Still in the chair she was leaning forward far over her knees and had hidden her face in her hands Heyst remembered Wang suddenly How clear all this was and how extremely amusing Very She sat up a little then leaned back and taking her hands from her face pressed both of them to her breast as if moved to the heart by seeing him there looking at her with a black horror struck curiosity He would have pitied her if the triumphant expression of her face had not given him a shock which destroyed the balance of his feelings She spoke with an accent of wild joy I knew you would come back in time You are safe now I have done it I would never never have let him Her voice died out while her eyes shone at him as when the sun breaks through a mist Never get it back Oh my beloved He bowed his head gravely and said in his polite Heystian tone No doubt you acted from instinct Women have been provided with their own weapon I was a disarmed man I have been a disarmed man all my life as I see it now You may glory in your resourcefulness and your profound knowledge of yourself but I may say that the other attitude suggestive of shame had its charm For you are full of charm The exultation vanished from her face You mustn t make fun of me now I know no shame I was thanking God with all my sinful heart for having been able to do it for giving you to me in that way oh my beloved all my own at last He stared as if mad Timidly she tried to excuse herself for disobeying his directions for her safety Every modulation of her enchanting voice cut deep into his very breast so that he could hardly understand the words for the sheer pain of it He turned his back on her but a sudden drop an extraordinary faltering of her tone made him spin round On her white neck her pale head dropped as in a cruel drought a withered flower droops on its stalk He caught his breath looked at her closely and seemed to read some awful intelligence in her eyes At the moment when her eyelids fell as if smitten from above by an the gleam of old silver familiar to him from boyhood the very invisible power he snatched her up bodily out of the chair and disregarding an unexpected metallic clatter on the floor carried her off into the other room The limpness of her body frightened him Laying her down on the bed he ran out again seized a four branched candlestick on the table and ran back tearing down with a furious jerk the curtain that swung stupidly in his way but after putting the candlestick on the table by the bed he remained absolutely idle There did not seem anything more for him to do Holding his chin in his hand he looked down intently at her still face Has she been stabbed with this thing asked Davidson whom suddenly he saw standing by his side and holding up Ricardo s dagger to his sight Heyst uttered no word of recognition or surprise He gave Davidson only a dumb look of unutterable awe then as if possessed with a sudden fury started tearing open the front of the girls dress She remained insensible under his hands and Heyst let out a groan which made Davidson shudder inwardly the heavy plaint of a man who falls clubbed in the dark They stood side by side looking mournfully at the little black hole made by mister Jones s bullet under the swelling breast of a dazzling and as it were sacred whiteness It rose and fell slightly so slightly that only the eyes of the lover could detect the faint stir of life Heyst calm and utterly unlike himself in the face moving about noiselessly prepared a wet cloth and laid it on the insignificant wound round which there was hardly a trace of blood to mar the charm the fascination of that mortal flesh Her eyelids fluttered She looked drowsily about serene as if fatigued only by the exertions of her tremendous victory capturing the very sting of death in the service of love But her eyes became very wide awake when they caught sight of Ricardo s dagger the spoil of vanquished death which Davidson was still holding unconsciously Give it to me she said It s mine Davidson put the symbol of her victory into her feeble hands extended to him with the innocent gesture of a child reaching eagerly for a toy For you she gasped turning her eyes to Heyst Kill nobody No said Heyst taking the dagger and laying it gently on her breast while her hands fell powerless by her side The faint smile on her deep cut lips waned and her head sank deep into the pillow taking on the majestic pallor and immobility of marble But over the muscles which seemed set in their transfigured beauty for ever passed a slight and awful tremor With an amazing strength she asked loudly What s the matter with me You have been shot dear Lena Heyst said in a steady voice while Davidson at the question turned away and leaned his forehead against the post of the foot of the bed Shot I did think too that something had struck me Over Samburan the thunder had ceased to growl at last and the world of material forms shuddered no more under the emerging stars The spirit of the girl which was passing away from under them clung to her triumph convinced of the reality of her victory over death No more she muttered There will be no more Oh my beloved she cried weakly I ve saved you Why don t you take me into your arms and carry me out of this lonely place Heyst bent low over her cursing his fastidious soul which even at that moment kept the true cry of love from his lips in its infernal mistrust of all life He dared not touch her and she had no longer the strength to throw her arms about his neck Who else could have done this for you she whispered gloriously No one in the world he answered her in a murmur of unconcealed despair She tried to raise herself but all she could do was to lift her head a little from the pillow With a terrible and gentle movement Heyst hastened to slip his arm under her neck She felt relieved at once of an intolerable weight and was content to surrender to him the infinite weariness of her tremendous achievement Exulting she saw herself extended on the bed in a black dress and profoundly at peace while stooping over her with a kindly playful smile he was ready to lift her up in his firm arms and take her into the sanctuary of his innermost heart for ever The flush of rapture flooding her whole being broke out in a smile of innocent girlish happiness and with that divine radiance on her lips she breathed her last triumphant seeking for his glance in the shades of death CHAPTER FOURTEEN Yes Excellency said Davidson in his placid voice there are more dead in this affair more white people I mean than have been killed in many of the battles in the last Achin war Davidson was talking with an Excellency because what was alluded to in conversation as the mystery of Samburan had caused such a sensation in the Archipelago that even those in the highest spheres were anxious to hear something at first hand Davidson had been summoned to an audience It was a high official on his tour You knew the late Baron Heyst well The truth is that nobody out here can boast of having known him well said Davidson He was a queer chap I doubt if he himself knew how queer he was But everybody was aware that I was keeping my eye on him in a friendly way And that s how I got the warning which made me turn round in my tracks In the middle of my trip and steam back to Samburan where I am grieved to say I arrived too late Without enlarging very much Davidson explained to the attentive Excellency how a woman the wife of a certain hotel keeper named Schomberg had overheard two card sharping rascals making inquiries from her husband as to the exact position of the island She caught only a few words referring to the neighbouring volcano but there were enough to arouse her suspicions which went on Davidson she imparted to me your Excellency They were only too well founded That was very clever of her remarked the great man She s much cleverer than people have any conception of said Davidson But he refrained from disclosing to the Excellency the real cause which had sharpened missus Schomberg s wits The poor woman was in mortal terror of the girl being brought back within reach of her infatuated Wilhelm Davidson only said that her agitation had impressed him but he confessed that while going back he began to have his doubts as to there being anything in it I steamed into one of those silly thunderstorms that hang about the volcano and had some trouble in making the island narrated Davidson I had to grope my way dead slow into Diamond Bay I don t suppose that anybody even if looking out for me could have heard me let go the anchor He admitted that he ought to have gone ashore at once but everything was perfectly dark and absolutely quiet He felt ashamed of his impulsiveness What a fool he would have looked waking up a man in the middle of the night just to ask him if he was all right And then the girl being there he feared that Heyst would look upon his visit as an unwarrantable intrusion The first intimation he had of there being anything wrong was a big white boat adrift with the dead body of a very hairy man inside bumping against the bows of his steamer Then indeed he lost no time in going ashore alone of course from motives of delicacy I arrived in time to see that poor girl die as I have told your Excellency pursued Davidson I won t tell you what a time I had with him afterwards He talked to me His father seems to have been a crank and to have upset his head when he was young He was a queer chap Practically the last words he said to me as we came out on the veranda were Ah Davidson woe to the man whose heart has not learned while young to hope to love and to put its trust in life As we stood there just before I left him for he said he wanted to be alone with his dead for a time we heard a snarly sort of voice near the bushes by the shore calling out Is that you governor Yes it s me Jeeminy I thought the beggar had done for you He has started prancing and nearly had me I have been dodging around looking for you ever since Well here I am suddenly screamed the other voice and then a shot rang out This time he has not missed him Heyst said to me bitterly and went back into the house I returned on board as he had insisted I should do I didn t want to intrude on his grief Later about five in the morning some of my calashes came running to me yelling that there was a fire ashore I landed at once of course The principal bungalow was blazing The heat drove us back The other two houses caught one after another like kindling wood There was no going beyond the shore end of the jetty till the afternoon Davidson sighed placidly I suppose you are certain that Baron Heyst is dead He is ashes your Excellency said Davidson wheezing a little he and the girl together I suppose he couldn t stand his thoughts before her dead body and fire purifies everything That Chinaman of whom I told your Excellency helped me to investigate next day when the embers got cooled a little We found enough to be sure He s not a bad Chinaman He told me that he had followed Heyst and the girl through the forest from pity and partly out of curiosity He watched the house till he saw Heyst go out after dinner and Ricardo come back alone While he was dodging there it occurred to him that he had better cast the boat adrift for fear those scoundrels should come round by water and bombard the village from the sea with their revolvers and Winchesters He judged that they were devils enough for anything So he walked down the wharf quietly and as he got into the boat to cast her off that hairy man who it seems was dozing in her jumped up growling and Wang shot him dead Then he shoved the boat off as far as he could and went away There was a pause Presently Davidson went on in his tranquil manner Let Heaven look after what has been purified The wind and rain will take care of the ashes The carcass of that follower secretary or whatever the unclean ruffian called himself I left where it lay to swell and rot in the sun His principal had shot him neatly through the head Then apparently this Jones went down to the wharf to look for the boat and for the hairy man I suppose he tumbled into the water by accident or perhaps not by accident The boat and the man were gone and the scoundrel saw himself alone his game clearly up and fairly trapped Who knows The water s very clear there and I could see him huddled up on the bottom between two piles like a heap of bones in a blue silk bag with only the head and the feet sticking out Wang was very pleased when he discovered him That made everything safe he said and he went at once over the hill to fetch his Alfuro woman back to the hut Davidson took out his handkerchief to wipe the perspiration off his forehead And then your Excellency I went away There was nothing to be done there Clearly assented the Excellency Davidson thoughtful seemed to weigh the matter in his mind and then murmured with placid sadness Nothing October nineteen twelve May nineteen
