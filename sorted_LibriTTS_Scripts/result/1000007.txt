evening at about five o clock to take a walk around the Palais Royal I m the one you see dreaming on the bench in Argenson s Alley always alone I talk to myself about politics love taste or philosophy I let my spirit roam at will allowing it to follow the first idea wise or foolish which presents itself just as we see our dissolute young men on Foy s Walk following in the footsteps of a prostitute with a smiling face an inviting air and a turned up nose then leaving her for another going after all of them and sticking to none For me my thoughts are my prostitutes If the weather is too cold or too rainy I take refuge in the Regency Caf I like to watch the games of chess The best chess players in the world are in Paris and the best players in Paris are in the Regency Caf Here in Rey s establishment they battle it out Legal the Profound Philidor the Subtle Mayot the Solid One sees the most surprising moves and hears the stupidest remarks For one can be an intelligent man and a great chess player like Legal but one can also be a great chess player and a fool like Foubert and Mayot One day I was there after dinner looking on a great deal but not saying much listening as little as possible when I was accosted by one of the most bizarre people in this country and God has made sure we don t lack such types He is a mixture of loftiness and depravity of good sense and buffoonery The notions of honesty and dishonesty must be really badly confused in his head for he shows without ostentation that nature has given him fine qualities and has no shame in revealing that he has also received some bad ones Beyond that he s endowed with a strong constitution a remarkably warm imagination and an extraordinary lung power If you ever meet him and his originality does not hold your attention you ll either put your fingers in your ears or run off God what terrible lungs Nothing is more unlike him than himself Sometimes he is thin and haggard like an invalid in the final stages of consumption You can count his teeth through his cheeks You d say he d spent several days without a meal or had just left a Trappist monastery The next month he s sleek and plump as if he d been eating steadily at a banker s table or had been shut up inside a Bernadine convent Today in dirty linen and torn trousers dressed in rags almost barefoot he slinks along with his head down One is tempted to call to him to give him a hand out Tomorrow he marches along with his head high powdered his hair curled well dressed with fine shoes He shows himself off and you d almost take him for a gentleman He lives from day to day sad or happy according to circumstances His first concern in the morning when he gets up is to know where he ll have lunch After lunch he thinks about where he ll go for supper Night time also brings uncertainties Should he return on foot to the little garret where he lives assuming that the caretaker in her irritation at not getting the rent has not asked him to return his key or should he settle for a working class tavern to wait for daylight over a slice of bread and a mug of beer When he hasn t got even six pennies in his pocket which happens sometimes he resorts to one of his friends who drives a cab or the coachman of a noble lord who gives him a pallet in the straw beside the horses In the morning there are still bits of his mattress in his hair If the season is mild he paces all night along the Cours or the Champs lyses He reappears in town with the dawn dressed up for today in yesterday s clothes and dressed up today perhaps for the rest of the week I don t think much of these eccentrics Some people turn them into familiar acquaintances even friends Once a year they interest me when I meet them because their character stands in contrast to others and they break that fastidious uniformity which our education our social conventions and our habitual proprieties have introduced If one of them appears in company he s a grain of yeast which ferments and gives back to everyone some part of his natural individuality He shakes things up He agitates us He makes us praise or blame He makes the truth come out revealing who has value He unmasks the scoundrels So that s the time a man with sense pays attention and sorts his world out The man I ve described I knew from some time back He used to hang about a house where his talent had opened doors for him There was an only daughter He swore to the father and mother that he would marry their daughter They shrugged their shoulders and laughed in his face telling him he was mad I saw it happen He used to ask me for money which I gave him He got himself introduced I don t know how into some good homes where he had a place for dinner but on condition he didn t speak without first getting permission He kept silent and ate in anger It was really good to see him under this constraint If he was seized by a desire to break this agreement and opened his mouth with his first word all the guests would cry out O Rameau Then his fury would burn in his eyes and he d go back to his meal even more enraged You were curious to know this man s name and now you do He is the nephew of that famous musician who delivered us from the plain song of Lully which we ve been chanting for more than a century and who wrote so much unintelligible visionary stuff and apocalyptic truths about the theory of music none of which ever made sense either to him or anyone else He left us a certain number of operas where there is some harmony scraps of song some disconnected ideas noise flights triumphal marches lances glories murmurs victories that leave one breathless and dance tunes which will last forever He buried the Florentine but will now be buried by Italian virtuosi a fact which he saw coming and which made him gloomy sad and surly For no one not even a pretty woman who wakes up with a pimple on her nose is as moody as an author who threatens to outlive his reputation just look at Marivaux and the younger Crebillon He greets me Ah ha so there you are Mister Philosopher What are you doing here in this pile of idlers Are you also wasting time pushing wood around That s how people speak contemptuously of chess or checkers ME No But when I don t have anything better to do I amuse myself for a bit by watching those who push well HIM In that case you don t get to enjoy yourself often Except for Legal and Philidor the others have no idea about the game ME What about mister de Bissy HIM That man plays chess the way Miss Clairon acts They both know everything about their respective games that one can learn ME You re harsh I see you honour only men of genius HIM Yes In chess in checkers poetry oratory music and other similar nonsense What good is mediocrity in things like that ME Not much I agree But large numbers of men must work at them before the man of genius appears one man in a multitude But let s drop that subject It s been an eternity since I last saw you I hardly think of you when I don t see you But I m always pleased to see you again What have you been doing HIM What you I and all the other do some good some bad and nothing Then when I was hungry I ate when I had a chance After eating I was thirsty and I drank sometimes However I grew a beard and when that came I shaved it off ME You shouldn t have done that It s the one thing you need to be a wise man HIM That s right I have a lofty wrinkled forehead a burning eye a jutting nose large cheeks black bushy eyebrows a clean cut mouth curving lips a square face If this vast chin was covered with a long beard can you imagine how splendid that would look in bronze or marble ME Up there beside Caesar Marcus Aurelius and Socrates HIM No I d go better between Diogenes the philosopher and Phryne the prostitute Like one of them I m impudent and I happily hang around the houses of the other ME Is your health still good HIM Yes normally it is But it s not so marvelous today ME Why s that There you are with a belly like Silenus and a face HIM A face one might mistake for what s behind the belly That s because the humour which is making my uncle waste away is apparently making his dear nephew fat ME What about your uncle do you ever see him HIM Yes he walks past me in the street ME Hasn t he done anything for you HIM If he s done anything for anyone he s done it without being aware of what he s doing The man s a philosopher in his own way He thinks only of himself To him the rest of the universe isn t worth a damn His daughter and his wife might as well die whenever they want So long as the parish bells which toll for them continue to resonate at the twelfth and seventeenth intervals all will be fine That s a good thing for him And that s what I especially value in people of genius They are good at only one thing Other than that nothing They ve no idea what it is to be citizens fathers mothers brothers parents friends Just between us we should try to be like them in every way but without wanting their breed to become something common We must have men but men of genius no No my goodness we don t need them They re the ones who change the face of the earth And in the smallest things stupidity is so common and so powerful that no one can reform it without making a great fuss That sets up at least in part what men of vision see And part remains just as it was Thus we have two gospels the costume of Harlequin The wisdom of the monk Rabelais is true wisdom for his own peace of mind and that of others do one s duty somehow or other always speak well of your master the prior and leave the world to its fantasies That works well because the majority is happy with it If I understood history I d show you that evil has always come here below from some man of genius But I don t know history because I don t know anything The devil take me if I ve ever learned a thing and if I m any the worse off for having learned nothing One day I was at the table of one of the King s ministers who had brains enough for four men Well he demonstrated to us as clearly as one and one adds up to two that nothing is more useful to nations than lies nothing more harmful than the truth I don t recall his proofs very well but it evidently follows that people of genius are detestable and that if a child at birth bears on its forehead the characteristics of this dangerous natural gift one should either smother the child or throw it to the dogs ME But people like that so hostile to genius all pretend to have some HIM I m sure they think that about themselves deep inside but I don t think they dare admit the fact ME That s just their modesty So from that point on you ve developed a terrible hatred against genius HIM Something I ll never put behind me ME But I ve seen the time when you were desperate to be anything but an ordinary person You ll never be happy if the arguments for and against affect you equally You have to pick a side and stick to it I quite agree with you that men of genius are usually odd or as the proverb states that there are no great minds without a grain of folly One can t deny the fact But we despise the ages which have not produced men of genius and men will honour those nations among whom genius has lived Sooner or later we raise statutes to them and consider them benefactors of the human race I don t mean to disparage the sublime minister you mentioned to me but I think that if a lie can be useful momentarily it is necessarily harmful in the long run and by contrast the truth is useful over time even though it could be harmful at a particular moment From that I m temped to conclude that the man of genius who speaks out against a common error or who establishes a great truth is always a being worthy of our veneration It could happen that such a being is the victim of prejudice and the law but there are two kinds of laws those which are based on equity which are universally true and others which are peculiar and derive their authority only from blindness or from the needs of certain circumstances This second type confers upon the man who breaks them merely a passing ignominy a shame which time turns back on the judges and countries who condemned him The shame stays with them for ever Think of Socrates and the magistrate who made him drink the hemlock which of those two is the dishonourable man today HIM That s a great help to Socrates Does that make him any less condemned any less put to death Was he any less a rebellious citizen With his contempt for a bad law didn t he encourage fools to disregard good laws Was he any less an audacious and odd individual Just now you were not so far from expressing how little you liked men of genius ME My dear fellow listen to me A society should never have bad laws And if it had only good ones it would never be in a position to persecute a man of genius I didn t say that genius was inseparably attached to malice or malice to genius A fool is more often an evil person than a man of intelligence is And if a man of genius were characteristically hard to get along with difficult prickly and unbearable even if he were bad what would you conclude from that HIM He should be drowned ME Gently my dear fellow Now tell me I won t take your uncle as an example He s a hard man brutal inhuman and miserly He s a bad father a bad husband a bad uncle And it s by no means clear that he s a man of genius who has pushed his art a long way so that in ten years we ll be discussing his works But what about Racine He certainly had genius and he didn t have much of a reputation as a good man What about Voltaire HIM Don t press me on this question I can give you an argument ME Which of these two options would you prefer that Racine had been a good man known for his business like Briasson or for his yardstick like Barbier getting his wife regularly pregnant every year with legitimate children a good husband a good father a good uncle a good neighbour an honest merchant but nothing more or that he had been deceitful treacherous ambitious envious and nasty but the author of Andromache Britannicus Iphigeneia Phedre and Athalie HIM For him I imagine it would perhaps have been better if he d been the first of the two ME What you ve just said is infinitely truer than you think HIM There you go you others If we say something good it s as if we re mad or inspired just a fluke It s only you others who really understand what you re saying Yes Mister Philosopher I understand what I m saying and I understand that just as much as you understand what you re saying ME All right let s see Why would that have been better for Racine HIM The point is that all these beautiful things he created didn t bring him twenty thousand francs If he d been a good silk merchant on Saint Denis or Saint Honore street a fine wholesale grocer or a well connected apothecary he d have amassed an immense fortune and in the process of getting it he could ve enjoyed no end of pleasures From time to time he could ve given a few coins to a poor foolish devil like myself who d have made him laugh and occasionally procured for him a young woman to relieve the boredom of his eternal company habitation with his wife We d have had some excellent meals at his home played for high stakes drunk some fine wines fine liqueurs fine coffees and gone for picnics in the country You see I know what I m talking about You laugh But let me continue That would ve been better for those around him ME No disagreement there provided he didn t use the money he got from legitimate business for dishonest purposes and kept far away from his home all gamblers hangers on all those self satisfied tasteless people all those layabouts all those useless perverts and made his shop assistants beat senseless the officious gentlemen who in various ways relieve husbands of the disgust they feel at a never ending life with their wives HIM Beat senseless my dear chap beat up We don t beat anyone senseless in a well policed town Pimping is a respectable profession Many people even those with titles are mixed up in it And what in the devil do you want us to use our money for if not for a good table good company good wines fine women pleasures of all sorts amusement of all kinds I d have no desire to possess a large fortune without these enjoyments But let s get back to Racine The man was good only for those he didn t know and for a time when he was no longer alive ME I agree But weigh the good and bad A thousand years from now he ll still make people cry and win men s admiration In all countries of the world he will inspire humanity sympathy tenderness People will ask who he was what country he came from and they ll envy France He made a few people suffer who are no longer alive and in whom we have hardly any interest We have nothing to fear from his vices or faults No doubt it would ve been better if nature had given him the virtues of a good man along with the talents of a great man He s a tree which has caused some trees planted near him to wither up and has suffocated the plants growing at his feet But he carried his top right up into the sky his branches stretched a long way He provided shade to those who came who come and who will come to rest alongside his majestic trunk He produced fruits with an exquisite taste which replenish themselves continuously We could also wish that Voltaire had had the sweetness of Duclos the ingenuousness of Abb Trublet the honesty of Abb d Olivet But since that s impossible let s look at the really interesting side of this issue Let s forget for the moment the point which we occupy in space and time and extend our vision into the centuries to come into the most distant regions into nations yet to be born Let s think of the well being of our species If we are not generous enough let s at least forgive nature for having been wiser than we are If you throw cold water on Greuze s head perhaps you will extinguish his talent along with his vanity If you make Voltaire less sensitive to criticism he will not know how to descend into the soul of Merope He will no longer move you HIM But if nature was as powerful as she was wise why didn t she make those men good in the same way she made them great ME But don t you see that with that sort of reasoning you confound the general order If everything here below were excellent then nothing would be excellent HIM You re right The important point is that you and I exist and that we exist as you and I Let everything beyond that go ahead however it can The best order of things in my view is one in which I had to exist Who cares about the most perfect of worlds if I m not on it I prefer to exist even as an impertinent quibbler than not to exist at all ME There s no one who doesn t think just as you do and who doesn t put existing order on trial without noticing he s renouncing his own existence HIM That s true ME So let s accept things as they are Let s see what they cost us and what they bring us leaving aside everything we don t know well enough to assign praise or blame what s perhaps neither good nor bad but what s necessary as many respectable people think HIM I don t understand much about that spiel you ve just given me It seems like philosophy and I warn you I ll not get mixed up in that All I know is that I d be quite happy to be someone else on the off chance I d be a genius a great man Yes I have to admit it There s something there which speaks to me I ve never heard a single genius praised without such tributes to him making me secretly enraged I get envious When I learn about some detail of their private lives which demeans them I listen with pleasure That brings us closer together and I bear my mediocrity more easily I say to myself It s true you never could have created Mahomet but you d never have praised Maupeou So I ve been mediocre and I m angry with my mediocrity Yes yes I am mediocre and angry I ve never heard the overture to Les Indes Galantes or heard anyone sing Profonds Abmes du Tnaire Nuit ternelle Nuit without feeling pain and saying to myself There s something you d never create Hence I was jealous of my uncle and if at his death there d been some fine compositions for the keyboard in his portfolio I wouldn t have hesitated to remain myself and to be him as well ME If that s the only thing bothering you it s not worth the trouble HIM It s nothing they re just passing moments Then he started to sing the overture to Indes Galantes and the song Profonds Abmes adding That something or other inside me which talks to me says Rameau you d love to have composed those two pieces If you d done these two you d probably have done two others And when you d composed a certain number people would play and sing you all over the place When you walked along you d hold your head high Your own awareness would confirm your own merit for you Others would point you out They d say There s the man who wrote those lovely gavottes He sang the gavottes and then looking like a man deeply moved swimming in joy his eyes damp he added rubbing his hands together You d have a fine house he measured its extent with his arms a fine bed he pretended to stretch himself out on it nonchalantly good wines which he tasted by smacking his tongue against his palate a fine horse and carriage he raised his foot as if to climb in beautiful women he embraced their breasts and gazed at them voluptuously A hundred hangers on would come to sing my praises every day he imagined he saw them all around him Palissot Poincinet the two Frrons father and son La Porte he listened to them he puffed himself up agreed with what they said smiled at them ignored them scorned them sent them off called them back Then he continued That s the way people would tell you every morning that you re a great man You d read in the history of Trois Sicles that you were a great man You d be convinced in the evening that you were great man and that great man Rameau the nephew would fall asleep to the soft murmur of praise which echoed in his ears Even while he was sleeping he would have a satisfied air his chest would expand rise and fall with assurance and he d snore like a great man As he was saying this he moved over and lay gently on a bench He closed his eyes and imitated the happy sleep he d just imagined After having enjoyed this relaxed repose for a few moments he woke up stretched his arms yawned rubbed his eyes and looked around him for any dull admirers still there ME So you think that a happy man sleeps like that 
7215-91628-0000	train-other-500	HIM Do I think so I m a poor wretch and when I go back to my garret in the evening and tuck myself in on my pallet I m shriveled up under my coverlet my chest is tight and my breathing short like a weak moan that s hardly audible
none	none	 whereas a financier makes his apartment reverberate 
7215-91628-0001	train-other-500	and amazes his entire street But what bothers me today is not that I sleep and snore meanly like someone destitute ME But that s sad HIM
7215-91628-0002	train-other-500	What s happened to me is much worse ME So what is it HIM You ve always taken some interest in me because I m a good little devil whom deep down you despise
none	none	 but I amuse you 
7215-91628-0003	train-other-500	ME That s true HIM And I m going to tell you Before beginning he sighs deeply and puts both hands on his forehead
7215-91628-0004	train-other-500	Then he recovers his calm appearance and says to me You know that I m ignorant a silly man a fool impertinent lazy what we Burgundians call an incorrigible crook a swindler
7215-91628-0005	train-other-500	a thief ME What a panegyric HIM It s true
none	none	 all of it 
7215-91628-0006	train-other-500	I don t take back a word of it Let s please not argue about it No one knows me better than I do and I m not saying everything ME
none	none	 I don t want to upset you 
7215-91628-0007	train-other-500	so I ll accept everything you say HIM
none	none	 All right 
7215-91628-0008	train-other-500	I used to live with people who liked me precisely because I was endowed with all those qualities to an unusual extent ME That s odd Up to the present I believed that people hid them from themselves
7215-91628-0009	train-other-500	or forgave them in themselves and condemned them in other people HIM Hide them from oneself is that possible Rest assured that when Palissot is alone and reflects on himself he tells himself something different
none	none	 You can be sure that in a tte tte with his colleague they frankly confess that they are nothing but two outstanding rogues 
7215-91628-0010	train-other-500	Despise such defects in others My people were fairer than that their character made me a marvelous success in their company I was in clover
none	none	 They fted me 
7215-91628-0011	train-other-500	They were sorry every moment I was away from them I was their little Rameau there beautiful Rameau their Rameau the foolish the impertinent the ignorant the lazy the greedy the clown the great beast
7215-91628-0012	train-other-500	There wasn t one of these familiar labels which didn t earn me a smile a caress a pat on the shoulder a slap a kick at table a fine morsel tossed onto my plate for me
7215-91628-0013	train-other-500	away from the table a liberty which I tolerated as of no consequence for I myself was of no consequence People make of me with me and in front of me anything they want without my taking exception
7215-91628-0014	train-other-500	And all the small presents which showered down on me I m such a stupid dog I lost them all I lost everything because once the only time in my life I had common sense May that never happen to me again
7215-91628-0015	train-other-500	ME What was it about HIM It was an incomparable stupidity incredible unpardonable ME What stupidity
7215-91628-0016	train-other-500	HIM Rameau Rameau people didn t accept you for your common sense The idiocy of having had a little taste a little intelligence a little reason Rameau my friend
7215-91628-0017	train-other-500	this will teach you to remain the man God made you the man your patrons wanted you to be So they grabbed you by the scruff of the neck marched you to the door and said Imposter get out And don t come back I believe it wants to have some sense
7215-91628-0018	train-other-500	some reason Beat it We have these qualities to spare You went off biting your nails You should ve bitten off your damned tongue long before that Because you didn t think about it here you are on the pavement the ground
7215-91628-0019	train-other-500	with no idea where to go next You d been eating high on the hog and now you ll return to slops you d been well lodged and now you ll be very lucky if they let you have your garret back you had a nice place to sleep
none	none	 and now the straw is waiting for you between mister de Soubise s coachman and your friend Robb 
7215-91628-0020	train-other-500	Instead of a soft and peaceful sleep as you used to have you ll be listening with one ear to the neighing and stomping of horses and with the other to a sound a thousand times more unbearable dry hard and barbarous verse
none	none	 Miserable stupid fool 
7215-91628-0021	train-other-500	possessed by a million devils ME But isn t there some way to go back
none	none	 Is the fault you committed unforgivable 
7215-91628-0022	train-other-500	In your place I d go to find my people again You re more necessary to them than you think HIM Oh I m certain that right now when they don t have me around to make them laugh they re bored to death
7215-91628-0023	train-other-500	ME Then I d go get them back I wouldn t leave them the time to learn to do without me to turn to some decent amusement Who knows what could happen HIM That s not what I m afraid of
7215-91628-0024	train-other-500	That won t happen ME No matter how wonderful you are another could replace you HIM
none	none	 That would be difficult 
7215-91628-0025	train-other-500	ME I agree However I d go back with this dejected face these wild eyes this disheveled collar tousled hair in the truly tragic state you re in right now
7215-91628-0026	train-other-500	I d throw myself at the feet of that goddess stick my face against the earth and without getting up I d say to her in a low and sobbing voice Pardon madame Forgive me I m unworthy despicable That was an unfortunate moment
7215-91628-0027	train-other-500	for you know I m not subject to having common sense and I promise you I ll never have it again in my life What was amusing was that while I was having this conversation with him he carried out the pantomime He threw himself down
7215-91628-0028	train-other-500	stuck his face against the ground and seemed to hold between his two hands the toe of a slipper He was crying and sobbing the words Yes my little queen Yes I do promise I ll never have it in my life never
7215-91628-0029	train-other-500	Then he got up quickly and added in a serious and deliberate tone HIM Yes you re right I think that would be best She s a good woman mister Viellard says that she is so kind
7215-91628-0030	train-other-500	And I know a little bit that she is Nonetheless to go humiliate oneself in front of an ugly bitch To cry for pity at the feet of a miserable little actress who s always followed by the hissing from the theatre stalls Me
7215-91628-0031	train-other-500	Rameau son of mister Rameau apothecary of Dijon a man of means who s never bent his knee to anyone at all Me Rameau nephew of the man who calls himself the Great Rameau
7215-91628-0032	train-other-500	the man people see walking upright on the Palais Royal with his arms waving in the air ever since mister Carmontelle made that drawing of him bent over with his hand under the tails of his coat I
7215-91628-0033	train-other-500	who have composed pieces for the keyboard which no one plays but which may well be the only ones which our posterity finds agreeable enough to play I well I I
none	none	 would go 
7215-91628-0034	train-other-500	but look here sir it s impossible Then putting his right hand to his chest he added I feel something there rising up it says to me Rameau you ll do none of that
7215-91628-0035	train-other-500	There must be a certain dignity attached to human nature which nothing can extinguish The most trivial thing will awaken it something trifling There are other days when it would cost me nothing to be as vile as anyone could wish
7215-91628-0036	train-other-500	On those days for a penny I d kiss the ass of the little Hus girl ME But my friend she s white pretty young soft chubby it s an act of humility
7215-91628-0037	train-other-500	that even a man more refined than you could sometimes stoop to HIM Let s understand each other there s literal ass kissing and metaphorical ass kissing
7215-91628-0038	train-other-500	Ask fat Bergier who kisses the ass of Madame de La Mark both literally and figuratively my God with them the literal and figurative disgust me equally ME
7215-91628-0039	train-other-500	If the course of action I m suggesting doesn t suit you then have the courage to be a beggar HIM It s hard to be poor as long as there are so many wealthy idiots one can rely upon for one s living
7215-91628-0040	train-other-500	And then contempt for oneself that s unbearable ME Do you know that feeling HIM Do I know it How many times have I said to myself
7215-91628-0041	train-other-500	How come there are ten thousand fine tables in Paris each with fifteen or twenty places and there s no place for you There are purses full of gold spilling over left and right and no piece falls on you
7215-91628-0042	train-other-500	A thousand fine half wits without talent or merit a thousand tiny creatures without charm a thousand insipid schemers are well dressed and you d walk around naked
none	none	 In this business how could you be so stupid 
7215-91628-0043	train-other-500	Couldn t you lie swear forswear promise and then perform or fail to perform like everyone else Couldn t you crawl on hands and knees like the others
none	none	 Couldn t you promote a lady s affair and carry a love letter from a gentleman like any other man Couldn t you encourage this young man to speak to this young lady and persuade her to listen to him like other men Couldn t you tell the daughter of one of our bourgeois that she is badly dressed that some fine earrings a little rouge lace and a Polish style dress would make her look ravishing that those little feet of hers were not made to walk along the road that there s a fine gentleman young and rich who has a coat trimmed in gold a superb horse and carriage and six huge footmen who saw her passing by and who finds her charming and who since that day has lost his desire for food and drink doesn t sleep and will die for her But what about my father Yes yes your father He will be a little angry at first And what about Mummy She s told me so often to be an honest girl She says there s nothing in the world but honour An ancient saying which doesn t mean a thing And my father confessor You won t see him any more Or if you continue the fairy tale of going to him to tell the story of your amusements it will cost you some pounds of sugar and coffee But he s a strict man who has already refused me absolution for singing Viens dans ma cellule That s because you didn t have anything to give him but when you appear before him in a lace dress Then I ll have a lace dress There s no doubt about it all sorts of them and diamond earrings 
7215-91628-0044	train-other-500	So I ll have beautiful diamond earrings
none	none	 Yes 
7215-91628-0045	train-other-500	Just like the ones belonging to that marquise who comes sometimes to buy gloves in our shop That s right In a fine carriage with dappled gray horses two large footmen a small Negro and a man running in front you ll have rouge
7215-91628-0046	train-other-500	beauty spots a train carried behind you To a ball To a ball to the opera to the theatre Her heart is already quivering with joy You play with a sheet of paper between your fingers
none	none	 What s that It s nothing It seem to me to be 
7215-91628-0047	train-other-500	It s a letter For whom For you if you are at all curious Curious I m really curious Let s see it She reads A meeting That s impossible
7215-91628-0048	train-other-500	Perhaps when you are going to mass Mamma always comes with me But if he came here early in the morning I get up first and I m at the counter before they get up He comes He is pleasing
none	none	 One fine day at dusk the girl disappears and I get paid my two thousand cus 
7215-91628-0049	train-other-500	How come you possess such talent and are short of bread You wretched man aren t you ashamed I remember a group of scoundrels who couldn t hold a candle to me and who were loaded with money I was in a buckram overcoat
7215-91628-0050	train-other-500	and they were dressed in velvet leaning on gold headed canes shaped like ravens beaks with pictures of Aristotle or Plato on cameo rings on their fingers But who were they For the most part they were incompetent musicians nowadays a sort of nobility
none	none	 At the time it gave me courage 
7215-91628-0051	train-other-500	raised my spirits made my mind more subtle capable of everything But these happy states of mind apparently didn t last because up to now I haven t been able to make any headway Whatever the case those are the words of my frequent soliloquies
7215-91628-0052	train-other-500	which you can paraphrase however you like provided you conclude from them that I understand disgust for oneself or the torment of conscience which arises from the uselessness of the gifts given to us by heaven It s the cruelest thing of all
none	none	 It would almost be better for a man not to be born 
7215-91628-0053	train-other-500	I listened to him While he was acting out the scene of the procurer and the young girl being seduced I was pulled in two opposite directions
none	none	 I didn t know whether to give in to my desire to laugh or get carried away with anger 
7215-91628-0054	train-other-500	I was perplexed
none	none	 Twenty time a fit of laughter prevented my anger from bursting out 
7215-91628-0055	train-other-500	twenty times the anger arising at the bottom of my heart ended in a burst of laughter I was taken aback by so much cleverness and base behaviour by such valid ideas alternating with false ones
7215-91628-0056	train-other-500	by such a general perversity of feeling and such complete depravity and such rare frankness He noticed the conflict going on inside me What s the matter with you he said ME Nothing
7215-91628-0057	train-other-500	HIM You seem upset ME Well I am HIM What do you think I should do ME Change the subject
7215-91628-0058	train-other-500	You poor man to be born or fall into such a debased condition HIM
none	none	 I agree 
7215-91628-0059	train-other-500	However don t let my condition affect you too much
none	none	 In revealing myself to you I didn t mean to cause you distress 
7215-91628-0060	train-other-500	From those people I ve saved up something Remember that I didn t need anything absolutely nothing and they gave me a considerable allowance for my trifling pleasures Then he began hitting his forehead again with one of his fists
7215-91628-0061	train-other-500	biting his lip rolling his wild eyes up to the ceiling commenting But that business is over and done with I ve set something aside Time has gone by It s always that much more of a gain ME
7215-91628-0062	train-other-500	You mean more of a loss HIM No no More of a gain We become richer every moment
none	none	 It s one less day to go on living or one cu more 
7215-91628-0063	train-other-500	it s all one The important point is to keep emptying one s bowels easily freely pleasurably copiously every night O stercus pretiosum That s the grand result of life in all conditions
none	none	 In the last analysis everyone is equally rich 
7215-91628-0064	train-other-500	Samuel Bernard who by dint of robbery pillaging and bankruptcies leaves twenty seven million in gold
none	none	 or Rameau 
7215-91628-0065	train-other-500	who won t leave anything Rameau for whom charity will provide a floor cloth as a shroud to wrap him in A dead man doesn t hear the bells tolling
7215-91628-0066	train-other-500	It s a waste of time for one hundred priests to shout themselves hoarse on his behalf or for him to be preceded and followed by a long line of burning torches His soul does not walk alongside the master of ceremonies To rot under marble or to rot under the earth
7215-91628-0067	train-other-500	it s still rotting To have around your coffin choirboys in red and choirboys in blue or none at all what does that matter Take a good look at this wrist It used to be stiff as the devil
7215-91628-0068	train-other-500	These ten fingers were like so many sticks stuck into a wooden metacarpal And these tendons were old cords of catgut
none	none	 drier stiffer and more inflexible that those used to turn a lathe operator s wheel 
7215-91628-0069	train-other-500	But I ve tormented broken and abused them so much You don t want to move but by God I say that you will and that s that As he said this
7215-91628-0070	train-other-500	with his right hand he grabbed the fingers and wrist of his left hand and bent them back and forth The tips of his fingers were touching his arm His joints were cracking I was afraid he d end up dislocating the bones ME
7215-91628-0071	train-other-500	Be careful I say to him You re going to hurt yourself HIM Don t worry They can stand it
none	none	 For ten years I ve given them a hard time 
7215-91628-0072	train-other-500	Whatever they felt like the little buggers had to get used to it and learn to strike the keys and fly over the strings So right now they re working Yes they re working fine At that moment he takes on the pose of a violin player
7215-91628-0073	train-other-500	He hums an allegro from Locatelli and his right arm imitates the movement of the bow while his left hand and his fingers seem to move along the length of the neck If he hits a wrong note he stops
7215-91628-0074	train-other-500	tightens or loosens the string and plucks the string with his nail to make sure that it s just right He resumes playing the piece where he has stopped He keeps time with his feet and thrashes about with his head feet hands arms and body
7215-91628-0075	train-other-500	Perhaps at some concert of spiritual music you ve had occasion to see Ferrari or Chiabran or some other virtuoso in the same sort of convulsions presenting a picture of the same torture That gives me almost as much pain
7215-91628-0076	train-other-500	for surely it s agonizing to watch the torment of someone who is busy giving me a representation of pleasure If he simply has to show me a patient under torture then draw a curtain between the man and me something to conceal me
7215-91628-0077	train-other-500	In the midst of his agitation and cries if there was a moment when the note had to be held one of those harmonious spots when the bow is drawn slowly across several strings at once his face took on an ecstatic expression his voice softened
7215-91628-0078	train-other-500	and he listened in rapture He was sure the harmony was resonating in his ears and mine Then placing his instrument under his left arm using the same hand he was holding it with and letting his right hand holding the bow fall he said
7215-91628-0079	train-other-500	Well what do you think of that ME Wonderful HIM That was all right I thought That sounded almost like the others
7215-91628-0080	train-other-500	All at once he crouches down like a musician sitting down at a keyboard I say to him Have mercy on yourself and me HIM No no Since I ve got your attention you ll listen
none	none	 I don t want anyone s approval unless they know why 
7215-91628-0081	train-other-500	You ll praise me with a more confident tone and that might be worth another pupil to me ME I don t go out very much and you re going to exhaust yourself to no purpose HIM
7215-91628-0082	train-other-500	I m never tired Since I saw that my wish to pity the man was useless for the violin sonata had left him bathed in sweat I decided to let him do what he wanted So there he was seated at the keyboard
7215-91628-0083	train-other-500	his legs bent his head raised towards the ceiling where one would have said he was looking at a written musical score singing playing a prelude working through a piece by Alberti or Galuppi I don t know which of the two His voice went like the wind
7215-91628-0084	train-other-500	and his fingers flew across the keys sometimes abandoning the upper part to play the bass sometimes abandoning the accompaniment to return to the upper register A series of emotions went in succession across his face You could see there tenderness
7215-91628-0085	train-other-500	anger pleasure sadness You could feel the soft notes and the loud ones I m sure that someone more astute than myself would have recognized the piece from the movement and style
7215-91628-0086	train-other-500	from his expressions and from some snatches of melody coming out of him now and then But what was really strange was that from time to time he groped around and started again as if he had made a mistake and was upset at himself for not having the piece at his finger tips
7215-91628-0087	train-other-500	Finally he straightened up wiped the beads of sweat running down his cheeks and said You see that we also know how to play a tritone or an augmented fifth and that we re familiar with transitions of dominants
none	none	 Those enharmonic passages which my dear uncle has made such a fuss about there s not all that much to it We ll get a handle on it ME You ve gone to a lot of trouble to show me that you ve got great skill But I m a man who would ve taken your word for it HIM Great skill Oh no I know a few tricks of the trade and that s more than one needs After all in this country does anyone have to understand what he teaches ME No more than people have to understand what they learn HIM That s well said my God very apt There Mister Philosopher cross your heart and tell the truth There was a time when you weren t as well off as you are today HE I m not all that well off even now HIM But you ll no longer be going to the Luxembourg in summer You remember ME Drop that subject Yes I do remember HIM In a gray plush frock coat ME Yes yes HIM All worn out on one side with frayed cuffs and black wool stockings stitched up the back with white thread ME Yes indeed Everything just as you like HIM What did you do then in the Alley of Sighs ME I was a sorry enough sight HIM When you left there you used to scurry along the pavement ME That s right HIM You gave lessons in mathematics ME Without understanding a word of it Isn t that where you want to go HIM Exactly ME I learned by teaching others and I produced some good students HIM That may well be but with music things aren t the same as in algebra or geometry Now these days you are a grand gentleman ME Not so grand HIM But you re well to do ME Not really HIM You provide tutors for your daughter ME Not any more It s her mother who s concerned about her education and one has to have peace at home HIM Peace at home My God one only has that when one is the servant or the master And it s essential to be the master I had a wife God rest her soul but when she got the idea now and then to answer back my hackles rose I let go with my thunder and said like God Let there be light And there was light So over a four year period we didn t raise our voices in a row ten times How old is your child ME That s got nothing to do with it HIM How old is your child ME What the devil leave my child and her age out of it and let s get back to the teachers she ll have HIM My goodness I know nothing as stubborn as a philosopher If one supplicates you very humbly might one not be able to learn from Monsieur the Philosopher the approximate age of Mademoiselle his daughter ME Let s assume she s eight years old HIM Eight She should have had her fingers on the keys four years ago ME But perhaps I don t worry very much about putting into the plan for her education a study which is so time consuming and which is so little use HIM And what are you intending to teach her Please tell me ME To reason correctly if I can That s something uncommon among men and even rarer still among women HIM Let her reason badly as much as she likes provided she s pretty amusing and flirtatious ME Since in her case nature has been so ungrateful as to give her a delicate constitution with a sensible soul and to expose her to the same pains of life as if she had a strong constitution and a heart made of bronze I ll teach her if I can to bear those pains bravely HIM Oh leave her to cry suffer and simper with delicate nerves like the others provided she is pretty amusing and flirtatious What no dancing ME No more than what s necessary for her to curtsey and have a decent carriage to present herself well and to know how to move HIM No singing ME No more than is necessary for her to enunciate well HIM No music ME If there was a good teacher of harmony I would willingly entrust her to him for two hours a day for one or two years no more HIM And in the place of these essential things you are cutting out ME I put grammar literature history geography a little drawing and a great deal of moral instruction HIM It would be so easy for me to prove to you the uselessness of all those subjects in a world like ours Did I say uselessness perhaps I should have said danger But for the moment I ll confine myself to one question Won t one or two teachers be necessary ME Undoubtedly HIM Ah well there we are again And these teachers you hope they ll know something about the grammar literature history geography and morality which they re teaching her in her lessons That s just a song and dance my dear sir a song and dance If they grasped these matters well enough to teach them they wouldn t be teaching them ME Why not HIM Because they would have spent their lives studying them It s necessary to be profound in art or in science in order to grasp the basics well Educational works can only be properly produced by those who have grown white in harness It s the middle and the end which illuminate the shadows at the beginning Ask your friend mister d Alembert the leading light in the mathematical sciences if he would be too good to teach the basics Only after twenty or thirty years of practice did my uncle glimpse the first faint light of musical theory ME Oh you idiot you total idiot How is it that in your wretched head there are such reasonable ideas all mixed up higgledy piggledy with so many absurdities HIM Who the devil knows Chance throws them out to you and they stay with you Still when we doesn t know everything we don t know anything well We don t know where something is going or where something else comes from where this or that should fit which should go first or whether it would be better to go second Can anyone teach well without a method And where is that method born You see my philosopher I have this notion that physics will always be a poor science a drop of water picked up by a needle from the vast ocean a grain detached from the mountain range of the Alps And the reasons for phenomena In truth it would be just as good to be ignorant about them as to understand them so little and so badly That was exactly where I was when I made myself a teacher of accompaniment and composition What are you dreaming about ME I m dreaming that everything you ve just said is more specious than substantial But let s leave that Did you say you taught accompaniment and composition HIM Yes ME And you didn t understand them at all HIM No my goodness not at all And that s the reason there were worse teachers than me those who believed they understood something At least I didn t ruin the judgment or the hands of the children When they left me for a good teacher they d learned nothing and so at least they didn t have to unlearn anything And that was always so much money and time saved ME How did you manage that HIM How they all do I arrived I threw myself into a chair What dreadful weather How tiring the pavement is I chattered about some news Miss Lemierre was to have taken on the role of a vestal virgin in the new opera But she is pregnant for the second time They don t know who will take her place Miss Arnould has just left her count People say she is negotiating with Bertin The little count however has just found out about mister de Montamy s porcelain At the last concert for the lovers of music there was an Italian woman who sang like an angel That Preville is an exceptional fellow You must see him in the Mercure galant The part about the riddle is priceless And poor Dumesnil no longer knows what she s saying or doing Come Mademoiselle take your book While the young lady who s in no hurry looks for her book which she has mislaid and while the maid is being summoned and chastised I keep going That Clairon is truly incomprehensible People are talking about a really crazy marriage one with Miss What s Her Name a little creature he s been supporting with whom he s had two or three children and who s been kept by so many others Come now Rameau that s not possible You re rambling on No I m not rambling They even say that the marriage has taken place There s a rumour going around that Voltaire is dead So much the better Why s that good Well that means he s going to give us some fine foolishness He has a habit of dying two weeks before he does so What else shall I tell you I told her a few naughty remarks which I d brought back from some homes where I d been for we are all great gossips I played the fool and they listened to me They laughed They cried out He s always charming However the young lady s book was finally recovered from under an armchair where it had been dragged chewed and ripped by a young pug dog or by a kitten She sat at the keyboard At first she made some noise there all by herself Then I came up after having given her mother a sign of approval The mother said That isn t bad One need only to want to do it but one doesn t want to One prefers to waste one s time with chit chat clothes running around and I don t know what As soon as you re gone the book is closed and it s not opened again until you return And then you never reprimand her However since I had to do something I took her hands and placed them in a different position I got upset I cried out G G G mademoiselle It s a G The mother Young lady don t you have an ear I m not even at the keyboard and I m not looking at your book but I feel that that must be a G You re giving this gentleman a great deal of trouble I don t understand his patience You don t retain anything he tells you You re not progressing at all Then I eased the blows a little by shaking my head and saying Excuse me madam excuse me Yes that could go better if the young lady wanted to if she studied a little But it s not going badly The mother In your place I d keep her on the same piece for a year That s all right she won t leave it until she has surmounted all the difficulties and that won t take as long as madam thinks The mother mister Rameau you re flattering her You re too kind That s the only thing she ll remember from her lesson and she ll know the right time to repeat it in front of me The hour went by My pupil gave me the small fee with a graceful movement of her arm and the curtsy she had learned from her dancing master I put it in my pocket while the mother said Very good mademoiselle If Javillier were here he d applaud you I kept chatting for a moment longer out of courtesy then disappeared There you have it that s what people used to call a lesson in accompaniment in those days ME And nowadays it s something different HIM My God I should think so I arrive I m serious I m in a rush to take off my coat I open the keyboard I test the keys I m always in a hurry If anyone makes me wait for a moment I cry out as if they ve stolen an cu from me In an hour from now I have to be over there in two hours at madam s house the duchess of something or other I m expected to dine at the home of a beautiful marquise and once I leave there to go to a concert in the house of Baron de Bacq in Rue Neuve des Petits Champs ME Of course you re not expected anywhere HIM That s the truth ME So why do you use all these vile little schemes HIM Vile Why vile if you please They re what s customary in my profession I don t demean myself in acting just like everyone else I m not the one who invented them And I d be really odd and tactless if I didn t conform Of course I know very well that if you re going to apply certain universal principles from I don t know what morality which all of them mouth but none of them practices it will end up that what s white will really be black and what s black will really be white But Mister Philosopher there s a universal conscience just as there s a universal grammar and then there are exception in every language You call them I think you scholarly types some give me some help here some ME Idioms HIM That s it Well every profession has its exceptions to the general conscience I m happy to call these trade idioms ME I understand Fontenelle speaks well and writes well although his style is crawling with French idioms HIM And the sovereign the minister the financier the magistrate the soldier the man of letters the lawyer the prosecutor the merchant the banker the artisan the singing master the dancing master these are all really honest people although their conduct goes against the general conscience in several points and is full of moral idioms The older the business institution the more idioms there are The worse times get the more idioms multiply Whatever the man is worth that s what the job is worth and conversely in the end whatever the job is worth that s what the man is worth So we value the job as much as we can ME What I can see clearly from all this nonsense is that there are few professions honestly practised or few honest people in their professions HIM Right there aren t any But on the other hand few of them are rascals outside their own shops and everything would go well enough if there weren t a certain number of people whom we call diligent and accurate who carry out their duties rigorously and strictly or what amounts to the same thing who are always in their shops busy with their trade from morning to evening doing nothing else In addition they re the only ones who get rich and respected ME Because of idioms HIM That s it I see you ve understood what I ve been saying All right one idiom in almost every profession for there are idioms common to all countries and all times just as there are common ways of being foolish a common idiom is to acquire for oneself the largest number of customers as possible A common stupidity is to believe that the person who has the most customers is the most expert There you have two exceptions to the general conscience which we have to bow down to It s a sort of credit system In itself it s nothing but it is worth something in public opinion It s been said that a good reputation is more valuable than a golden belt However the man with a good reputation doesn t have a golden belt but I see that nowadays the man with the golden belt rarely lacks a good reputation It s necessary as much as possible to have the good reputation and the belt And that s my goal when I make myself valuable by what you characterize as vile tricks and unworthy little schemes I give my lesson and I give it well there s the general rule I let people believe that I ve more lessons to give than there are hours in the day that s the idiom ME And the lesson you give a good one HIM Yes not bad quite good My dear uncle s fundamental bass has made it all a lot simpler Before that I used to rob my pupil of money yes I did that s for sure But today I earn it at least as much as the others ME And did you steal the money without any guilt HIM Oh none whatsoever People say that if one robber steals from another the devil laughs The parents are overflowing with a fortune they ve acquired God knows how they re from the court or financiers or great merchants or bankers or business people I was helping them pay some of it back me and a crowd of others just like me whom they employed In nature all species devour each other and in society all the classes feed on one another We bring justice to each other without the law getting involved Earlier that woman Deschamps and nowadays Guimard are the prince s vengeance on the financier and then the fashion merchant the jeweler the upholsterer the laundry woman the swindler the chambermaid the cook the saddle maker get their revenge on Deschamps on behalf of the financier In the middle of all this it s only the idiot or the lay about who gets hurt without having upset anyone and that s just fine So from all this you see that these exceptions to the general conscience or these moral idioms about which people make such a fuss calling them tricks of the trade are nothing and that in the last analysis the only thing one needs is to keep one s eyes open ME Your eyes are admirable HIM And then there s poverty The voice of conscience and honour are really feeble when one s guts are crying out If I ever get rich I ll certainly have to give the money back and I m firmly resolved to do so in all possible ways dining gambling wine women ME But I m afraid you ll never get rich HIM I suspect the same thing myself ME But if things turn out differently what will you do HIM I d act like all beggars whose life has turned around I d be the most insolent rogue anyone has ever seen Then I d remember everything they made me suffer and I d pay them back full measure for the humiliations they put me through I like to give orders and that s what I d do I like it when people praise me and praise me they will I ll have in my service all Villemorien s hangers on and I ll speak to them they way they spoke to me Come on you scoundrels amuse me and they ll amuse me Rip some honest people to shreds and they ll tear them apart if there are any still to be found And then we ll have girls and all address each other as friends when we re drunk and we ll get drunk We ll make up stories We ll have all sorts of quirks and vices It will be delicious We ll prove that Voltaire has no genius that Buffon is always strutting formally on stilts and is nothing but a bombastic windbag that Montesquieu is nothing more than a witty fellow We ll consign d Alembert to his mathematics and we ll throw down onto their bellies and backs all those little Catos like you who despise us from envy whose modesty is a coat covering their pride and whose sobriety is a law arising from their own needs And music That s when we ll make music ME Given the dignified way you d use your wealth I see what a great pity it is that you re a pauper You d live in a way that would confer great honour on the human species and would be really useful to your fellow citizens and truly glorious for yourself HIM I think you re making fun of me Mister Philosopher You don t know who you re playing with You don t suspect that at this moment I represent the most important party in the town and at court The wealthy people in all professions either have told themselves the same things I ve confided to you or they have not but the fact is that the life I d live in their place is exactly the life they lead That s just where you are too you others You believe that happiness is the same thing for everyone What a strange vision Your version assumes a certain romantic frame of mind which we don t have a peculiar soul a strange taste You dress this weirdness up with the name virtue You call it philosophy But are virtue and philosophy made for everyone Some are able to get them and some can keep them Imagine a wise and philosophical universe You ll concede it would be devilishly sad So long live philosophy long live the wisdom of Solomon Drink good wine gorge oneself on choice delicacies roll around on beautiful women lie on lovely soft beds Other than that the rest is nothing but vanity ME What about defending one s country HIM That s vanity There s no country any more From one pole to the other all I see is tyrants and slaves ME Helping one s friends HIM Vanity Does one really have friends And if we had would we have to make them ungrateful Look closely and you ll notice that that s almost always what you get back for services rendered Gratitude is a burden and every burden is put there to be shaken off ME Occupy a position in society and carry out its duties HIM Vanity What does it matter whether one has a position or not provided that one is rich since no one assumes a position except to get rich Carry out its duties where does that lead To jealousy trouble persecution Is that the way one gets ahead Pay court to people by God pay court to them Observe great people study their tastes take part in their fantasies serve their vices applaud their injustices That s the secret ME Taking care of the education of one s children HIM Vanity That s the business of a tutor ME But if this tutor has fully absorbed your principles and neglects his duties who s going to be punished for it HIM My goodness it won t be me Maybe someday my daughter s husband or my son s wife ME But what if both your son and daughter hurl themselves into debauchery and vice HIM That s their look out ME What if they dishonour themselves HIM Whatever one does one cannot dishonour oneself if one is rich ME What if they ruin themselves HIM Too bad for them ME I see that if you can dispense with taking care of the conduct of your wife your children and your servants you could easily neglect your own affairs HIM Excuse me but no It s sometimes difficult to find money and it s prudent to get it well in advance ME You ll pay little attention to your wife HIM None whatsoever if you please The best arrangement which one can have with one s dear better half I think is to do whatever one wants In your view wouldn t society be really amusing if everyone did what was agreeable to them ME Why not The evening is never more beautiful for me than when I m happy about my morning HIM The same goes for me ME What makes fashionable people so delicate about their amusements is that they are profoundly idle HIM Don t you believe it They run around a lot ME Since they never get tired they never relax HIM Don t believe that They are constantly exhausted from excess ME Pleasure is always a business for them never a need HIM So much the better Need is always painful ME They wear everything out Their souls become stupefied Boredom grabs hold of them Whoever took away their lives in the midst of their overwhelming abundance would be doing them a service The fact is they don t know anything about happiness except the part which becomes jaded most quickly I don t disparage the pleasures of the senses I have a palate as well and it really likes a tasty delicacy or a delicious wine I have a heart and eyes and I like to see a beautiful woman I like to have my hands feel the firmness and the roundness of her breasts to press her lips against mine to soak up rapture from her looks and to die in her arms I m not against a party with my friends sometimes a debauch even one that gets a little out of hand But I won t conceal from you that it is infinitely more pleasurable to me to have helped someone in distress brought some difficult business to a conclusion given some beneficial advice read something agreeable taken a walk with a man or woman close to my heart passed some instructive hours with my children written a good page fulfilled the duties of my position or told the woman I love something tender and soft so that she put her arms around my neck I know the sorts of actions I would give up all I own to have done Mahomet is a sublime work of literature but I would prefer to have rehabilitated the memory of Calas An acquaintance of mine once took refuge in Cartagena He was the youngster of the family in a country where custom gives all property to the eldest There he learned that his older brother a spoiled child after stripping his mother and father very easily of everything they possessed had kicked them out of their chateau and that the good old people were languishing in poverty in a small town in the provinces So what then did this youngster do a boy who had been treated harshly by his parents and had gone to see if he could win his fortune far away He sent them assistance He quickly wound up his own affairs and returned wealthy He brought his father and mother back into their home He arranged for his sisters to be married Ah my dear Rameau the man considered this period the happiest of his life When he told me of it he had tears in his eyes And as I tell you the story I feel my heart beating for joy and my delight makes talking difficult HIM You people are so very odd ME 
7215-91630-0000	train-other-500	And you are creatures who well deserve to be pitied if you can t see how we ve raised ourselves above our fate and that it s impossible to be unhappy under the shelter of two fine actions like the ones I ve just mentioned HIM Well
7215-91630-0001	train-other-500	that s a type of happiness which I ll find it difficult to get familiar with because we meet it rarely But according to you should we then be decent people ME To be happy Yes certainly
7215-91630-0002	train-other-500	HIM But I see countless decent people who are not happy and countless people who are happy without being decent ME So it seems to you HIM
7215-91630-0003	train-other-500	But isn t it because I had some common sense and candour for a moment that I have no idea where to get a meal this evening ME Not at all The reason is you ve not had those qualities all along
7215-91630-0004	train-other-500	It s because you didn t realize early on that it s first necessary to create options for yourself which will make you independent free from serving others HIM
none	none	 Independent or not 
7215-91630-0005	train-other-500	what I ve made for myself is at least the most comfortable ME And the least secure and the least honest HIM
7215-91630-0006	train-other-500	But it s the one best suited to my character as a lazy man fool and scoundrel ME I agree with that HIM And since I can find happiness through vices natural to me
7215-91630-0007	train-other-500	which I ve acquired without working which I maintain without effort which are compatible with the customs of my country which suit the taste of those who protect me and are closer to their small particular needs than virtues which would embarrass them
none	none	 by criticizing them morning and night 
7215-91630-0008	train-other-500	it would be really odd if I were to go on tormenting myself like some soul in hell in order to cut myself up and make myself something other than I am to give myself a character foreign to my own very worthy qualities
none	none	 I ll concede that to avoid an argument 
7215-91630-0009	train-other-500	but which would cost me a great deal to acquire and to practise and which would lead to nothing perhaps worse than nothing because all the time I d have to satirize the rich people among whom beggars like me have to find a living People praise virtue but they hate it
7215-91630-0010	train-other-500	They run away from it because it makes them freezing cold and in this world one has to have warm feet Besides it would inevitably make me moody
none	none	 Why else do we so often see devout people so hard so angry so unsociable It s because they ve imposed on themselves a task which isn t natural to them 
7215-91630-0011	train-other-500	They suffer and when one suffers one makes others suffer That s not what I want nor my patrons I have to be happy flexible pleasant funny amusing Virtue makes itself respected and respect is uncomfortable
7215-91630-0012	train-other-500	Virtue makes itself admired and admiration is not amusing My business is with people who are bored and I have to make them laugh So I have to be ridiculous and funny And if nature had not made me that way the simplest thing would be to appear like that
none	none	 Fortunately I don t need to be a hypocrite 
7215-91630-0013	train-other-500	There are already so many of them of every stripe without counting those who are hypocritical even with themselves
none	none	 Take that Chevalier de la Morlire 
7215-91630-0014	train-other-500	who turns up his hat above his ears who holds his head in the air who looks at you over his shoulder as you go by who has a long sword banging against his thigh who has an insult ready for anyone who doesn t carry one
none	none	 and who seems to be issuing a challenge to everyone coming along 
7215-91630-0015	train-other-500	What s he doing Everything he can to persuade himself that he s a stout hearted man
none	none	 But he s a coward Just tweak the end of his nose he s take it quietly If you want to make him lower his voice raise you own 
7215-91630-0016	train-other-500	Show him your cane or give him a kick in the ass He ll be astonished to find out he s a coward and will ask you how you found out who told you The moment before he was ignorant of the fact for his long and habitual aping of bravery had impressed on him that he was
7215-91630-0017	train-other-500	He d gone through the pretence so many times he believed that s what he was And that woman who mortifies herself who visits prisons who helps at all the charitable meetings who walks along with her eyes lowered who would never dare to look a man in the face
7215-91630-0018	train-other-500	always on guard against being seduced by her senses does all that keep her heart from burning sighs escaping from her her temperament catching fire her desires obsessing her
none	none	 and her imagination going over and over night and day scenes from the Portier des Chartreux or the Postures de l Artin 
7215-91630-0019	train-other-500	So then what happens to her What does her maid think of her when she gets up in her nightdress and rushes to help her mistress as she s dying Justine go back to bed It s not you your mistress is calling for in her delirium And what about friend Rameau
7215-91630-0020	train-other-500	what if one day he began to show signs of contempt for wealth women good food and laziness and started to act like Cato what would he be A hypocrite Rameau has to be what he is a happy thief among wealthy thieves
7215-91630-0021	train-other-500	and not a virtuous swaggerer or even a virtuous man gnawing his crust of bread by himself or among beggars To sum up I won t put up with your idea of happiness or the well being of a few visionaries like you ME
7215-91630-0022	train-other-500	I see my dear fellow that you have no idea what that is and that you re not even capable of learning what it is HIM So much the better by God so much the better
7215-91630-0023	train-other-500	It would probably make me die of hunger boredom and remorse ME Given that the only advice I have for you is to go back quickly to the house where you so imprudently got yourself thrown out
7215-91630-0024	train-other-500	HIM And do what you don t object to literally but find offensive metaphorically ME That s my advice HIM
7215-91630-0025	train-other-500	Regardless of that metaphor which I object to for the moment but which won t bother me at some other time ME How odd you are HIM There s nothing odd about it
none	none	 I m happy enough to be abject 
7215-91630-0026	train-other-500	but I want that to happen without any compulsion It s all right with me to abandon my dignity What s so funny ME Your dignity makes me laugh HIM
none	none	 Everyone has his own 
7215-91630-0027	train-other-500	I m happy to forget mine but at my own discretion and not on someone else s orders Does it have to be the case that when someone can say to me Crawl I have to crawl That s how a worm operates and it s my way too
7215-91630-0028	train-other-500	We both follow it when people leave us alone But we raise ourselves up when someone steps on our tails People have stepped on my tail and I straightened up But then you have no idea of the madhouse we re talking about
7215-91630-0029	train-other-500	Imagine a melancholy and sullen personality consumed with vapours wrapped up in two or three layers of dressing gown who loves himself but who s unhappy about everything
none	none	 a person from whom it s difficult to get a smile 
7215-91630-0030	train-other-500	even if you distort your body and mind in a hundred different ways He examines coldly the pleasant grimaces of my face and of my judgment which are even more pleasant for between us that father Christmas that nasty Benedictine so famous for his grimaces
7215-91630-0031	train-other-500	for all his success at court is nothing but a wooden Punch in comparison to me and I say that without praising myself or him I went to great lengths tormenting myself to reach the highest arts of the idiot house But it s no use
7215-91630-0032	train-other-500	Will he laugh Won t he That s what I m forced to say to myself in the middle of my contortions and you can judge how much this uncertainty damages one s talent My hypochondriac with a nightcap pulled down over his head covering his eyes
7215-91630-0033	train-other-500	has the expression of an immobile idol with a string attached around his chin which goes from there right down under his armchair One waits for the string to be pulled but it s not pulled
none	none	 If it so happens that the jaws open 
7215-91630-0034	train-other-500	it s to utter a distressing word a word which informs you that you ve not even been noticed and that all your monkey tricks have been wasted
none	none	 This word is a response to a question you asked him four days ago 
7215-91630-0035	train-other-500	Once the word has been uttered the mastoid spring is released and the jaws snap shut Then he began to imitate the man he was talking about He was seated in a chair with his head fixed his cap right down to his eyelids his eyes half shut
7215-91630-0036	train-other-500	his arms hanging down moving his jaws like a robot He said Yes you are right mademoiselle One has to be perceptive in these matters That s the person who decides who always decides and there s no appeal in the evening
7215-91630-0037	train-other-500	in the morning at his morning toilet at dinner in the caf at
none	none	 the gaming table 
7215-91630-0038	train-other-500	in the theatre at supper in bed and God forgive me in the arms of his mistress too I think I m not in a position to hear these last decisions but I m damn weary of the others Sad obscure cut and dried like fate
7215-91630-0039	train-other-500	that s the kind of patron we have Right across from him there s a prudish woman who s pretending to be important One could persuade oneself that she s attractive because she still is
7215-91630-0040	train-other-500	although her face has some scabs here and there and she s getting as large as Madame Bouvillion I do like flesh when it s beautiful but for all that too much is too much Movement is so essential to matter Item
7215-91630-0041	train-other-500	she is more malicious more proud more stupid than a goose Item she d like to have wit Item one has to persuade her that people think she s more witty than anyone else Item she knows nothing
7215-91630-0042	train-other-500	but she makes decisions too Item one has to applaud these decisions with one s feet and hands to jump for joy to become paralyzed with admiration Your decision is so beautiful delicate well said perceptive uniquely felt
7215-91630-0043	train-other-500	Where do you women get all this Without any studying purely by the power of instinct by your own natural light it s miraculous And then people come to tell us that experience study reflection and education all play a part in it
7215-91630-0044	train-other-500	All sorts of other similar stupidities with tears of joy To bow down ten times a day with one knee bent in front and the other leg stuck out behind one s arms stretched towards the goddess
none	none	 looking for her desires in her eyes 
7215-91630-0045	train-other-500	hanging onto her lip waiting for her order and dashing off like a bolt of lightning Who could subject himself to such a role except the poor wretch who two or three times a week finds something there to calm the tribulation of his intestines
none	none	 What is one to think of the others like Palissot Frron 
7215-91630-0046	train-other-500	the Poinsinets Baculard who do have some property and whose baseness thus cannot be excused by the rumbling of a suffering stomach ME
none	none	 I d never have though you were so fussy HIM I m not At first I used to watch the others doing it and I carried on like them even a little better because I m more candidly impudent a better actor and I was hungrier and equipped with better lungs Apparently I trace my descent in a direct line from the famous Stentor And to give me a fair idea of the force of this organ of his he began to cough violently enough to make the windows in the caf rattle and to divert the attention of the chess players from their game ME But what good is this talent HIM You can t guess ME No I m a bit limited HIM Supposing a dispute has started and victory is uncertain I stand up and displaying my thunder cry out It s just as Madame has assured us it is That s what one calls judgment a hundred times better than our fine wits The expression is pure genius But one mustn t always approve in the same way That would make one monotonous You d look false and would become insipid The only way around that is with judgment and creativity You need to know how to prepare and when to put in those peremptory major tones how to seize your chance and the moment for example when there is a division of opinion when the argument has moved up to the final stage of violence when no one is in agreement any more when everyone is speaking at once then you must take up a position some distance away in the corner to the apartment furthest removed from the field of battle You must prepare for the eruption with a long silence and then blow up suddenly like an explosion in the middle of the contenders No one has my skill in this art But where I m really surprising is in the opposite skill I have some soft notes which I accompany with a smile an infinite variety of expressions of approval bringing into play my nose mouth forehead and eyes I have a supple back a way of turning my spine or raising and lowering my shoulders extending my fingers inclining my head closing my eyes and being amazed as if I d heard the voice of a divine angel coming down from heaven That s what does the flattering I m not sure if you really understand the full power of the attitude I ve just mentioned I didn t invent it but no one has pulled it off better than me Look Watch this ME It s certainly unique HIM Do you think that there s a slightly vain female brain which could hold out against it ME No I have to concede that you have taken the talent for making fools of people and for demeaning oneself as far as it s possible to go HIM All those other however many there are they ll do well but they ll never get to that point The best of them Palissot for example will never be anything but a good pupil But if this role is amusing at first and if you enjoy the pleasure of laughing to yourself at the stupidity of those you are intoxicating in the long run it loses its appeal Besides after a certain number of discoveries you have to repeat yourself Wit and art have their limits Only God or a few rare geniuses could make a career out of it which grows as they advance Bouret is such a person perhaps That man has certain tricks which impress me yes even me as sublime ideas the little dog the book of happiness the torches on the road to Versailles those are things which stagger me and put me to shame It could be enough to make one unhappy with the profession ME What about that little dog What are you talking about HIM Where have you come from What in all seriousness you don t know how that extraordinary man set about detaching himself from a little dog and attaching it to the Keeper of the Seals who d taken a fancy to it ME I confess I have no idea HIM So much the better It s one of the most beautiful things one could imagine All Europe marveled at it and there isn t a single courtier who wasn t envious of it You re a man who doesn t lack a certain shrewdness let s see what you d have done in his place Remember that Bouret was loved by his dog Remember that the odd costume of the minister used to terrify the little animal And remember that there were only eight days to overcome the difficulties One has to understand all the conditions attached to the problem in order to appreciate properly the merit of the solution Well then ME Well I have to confess to you that in this sort of thing the simplest things baffle me HIM Listen he says to me giving me a slight blow on the shoulder he s very informal listen and admire He has someone make him a mask which looks like the Keeper of the Seals and he borrows the latter s voluminous robe from a footman He covers his face with the mask and puts on the robe He calls his dog and caresses it He give it a biscuit Then all of a sudden with a change of clothes he is no longer the Keeper of the Seals but Bouret He calls his dog and beats it In less than two or three days of doing this exercise from morning to night the dog learns to run away from Bouret the Farmer General and run to Bouret the Keeper of the Seals But I m being too kind You re a layman who doesn t deserve to be instructed in the miracles which go on right beside you ME In spite of that if you don t mind the book and the torches HIM No no Ask the cobble stones They ll tell you about those things You must profit from the circumstances which have brought us together to learn those things which no one knows except me ME You re right HIM To borrow the robe and the wig of the Keeper of the Seals I d forgotten about the wig To make a mask which looks like him It s the mask above all that turns my head Also this man is of the highest respectability and he owns millions There are men with the Saint Louis cross who don t have any bread so why run after the cross at the risk of working oneself to death and not turn to an activity with no danger which never fails to pay That s what we call acting in the grand manner Role models like that are disheartening One pities oneself and loses interest That mask The mask I d give one of my fingers to have come up with that mask ME But with this enthusiasm of yours for fine things and the creative genius you possess have you invented anything HIM Let s see well one example is the attitude of admiration I make with my back which I spoke you about I look upon that as mine although some envious people could perhaps argue with me about it I think that people used it before but who realized just how handy it was for having a secret laugh at the fool one was admiring I have more than a hundred ways to start the seduction of a young girl right under her mother s nose without her perceiving a thing and even making her an accomplice I d hardly started on my career when I turned my back on all the common ways to slip someone a love letter I have ten ways of getting people to snatch it away from me Among these methods I dare flatter myself that there are some original ones Above all I possess the talent for encouraging a timid young man I ve enabled some to succeed who had neither wit nor looks If that were all written out I think that people would attribute some genius to me ME Would you get remarkable honours HIM I don t doubt it ME If I were you I d put those things down on paper It would be a pity if they were lost HIM That s true but you have no idea how unimportant method and precepts are to me Someone who needs written instructions will never get far Geniuses read little act a great deal and create themselves Look at Caesar Turenne Vauban the Marquise de Tencin his brother the cardinal and the cardinal s secretary Abb Trublet And Bouret Who gave Bouret lessons No one It s nature that makes exceptional men like that Do you think that the story of the dog and the mask is written down somewhere ME But in the hours when you have nothing to do when the agony of your empty stomach or the weariness in your crammed stomach stop you from sleeping HIM I ll think about it It s better to write about great things than to carry out trivial ones Then the soul is raised the imagination heats up catches fire and grows instead of shrinking up beside the little Hus girl in her amazement at the applause which the idiotic public insists on lavishing on that simpering Dangeville who acts with so little imagination who moves through the scene almost doubled over and affects to stare continuously into the eyes of whoever she is talking to underplays her role and who confuses her own grimaces with subtlety her tiny trotting around with graceful movement or on that bombastic Clairon woman who s scrawnier more affected more mannered and starchy than anyone could imagine Those idiots in the pit bring the house down applauding them They don t see that we are a pack full of charm It s true that the pack is getting somewhat larger but so what We have the most beautiful skin the finest eyes the best looking mouths not much heart inside to be sure a walk which is not light but not as awkward as people maintain As for feelings on the other hand there isn t one which we couldn t overtrump ME Why are you saying all this Are you being truthful or ironical HIM The problem is that this devil of a feeling is all inside and no glimmer of it reaches the outside But as for me the one talking to you I know and know well that she has some Well if it s not that exactly it s something like it You need to see how we treat servants when we re in the mood how we slap the chambermaids how we kick old casual parts Boutin around if he fails to deliver the respect due to us She s a little devil I tell you full of feeling and dignity Hey you re not sure what all this is about are you ME I confess I have no idea how to sort out whether you re speaking in good faith or maliciously I m a decent man so be good enough to deal with me directly and put away your art HIM That s just what we say to the little Hus girl about Dangeville and Clairon mixing in a few words here and there to rouse your suspicions I don t mind your taking me for a rascal but not for an idiot And only an idiot or a man hopelessly in love could say so many outrageous things seriously ME But how does one bring oneself to say such things HIM That doesn t happen all at once one gets there gradually Ingenii largitor venter The belly incites genius ME You have to be forced into it by a savage hunger HIM That could do it However no matter how extreme these things seem to you you should know that those to whom they are addressed are much more accustomed to hearing them than we are to trying them out ME Is there anyone out there who has the courage to share your opinion HIM What do mean anyone It s the opinion and the language of all society ME Those among you who are not great rascals have to be great fools HIM Fools among us I swear there is only one fool and that s the one who gives us a good time in exchange for our imposing this language on him ME But how can anyone let himself be so crudely imposed upon For in the end the superior talent of Dangeville and Clairon is well established HIM We swallow whole the lie which flatters us and sip drop by drop a truth set down before us Besides we have such an earnest and truthful demeanour ME Nonetheless you must have sinned at least once against the principles of your art and let slip inadvertently some of those bitter truths which hurt For despite the wretched abject vile and abominable role you play I think that basically you have a refined soul HIM In my case not at all The Devil take me if I have any idea what I am deep down In general my mind is as round as a ball and my character as open as a wicker chair I m never false if I have any interest in being truthful and never truthful if I have any interest in being dishonest I say things as they come to me If they re sensible all well and good if impertinent people don t worry about it I use my candour in speaking to the full I ve never thought about my life before speaking or while I m talking or after I ve finished talking In that way I don t hurt anyone ME But that s just what happened to you with those respectable people whose house you lived in and who were so kind to you HIM What about it It was unfortunate a bad moment These things happen in life No happiness lasts I was too well off It couldn t last We have as you know the most numerous and exclusive company It s a school for humanity the renewal of ancient hospitality All the fallen poets we gather them up We had Palissot after his Zara Bret after Le Faux gnreux all the discredited musicians all the authors no one reads any more all the actresses hissed off the stage all the booed actors a pile of poor disgraced people dull parasites I have the honour of being at their head the brave chief of a timid band I m the one who urges them to eat the first time they come I m the one who demands they get something to drink They take up so little room Some ragged young people who don t know where to lay their heads but who are good looking Others are villains who suck up to the master and send him off to sleep so they can scoop up what he s left with the lady of the house We appear carefree but at bottom we re all moody and greedy Wolves are no hungrier than we are nor are tigers more cruel We cram ourselves like wolves when the earth has been covered in snow for a long time and like tigers we rip apart anything which has succeeded Sometimes the crowds of Bertin Montsauge and Villemorien come together and then there s a fine old noise in the menagerie You ve never seen so many wretched creatures in one place cantankerous harmful and angry No one hears anything but the names of Buffon Duclos Montesquieu Rousseau Votaire D Alembert Diderot and God only knows what epithets are attached to them No one can have any wit unless he is as stupid as we are That s the place where the plan for the comedy Les Philosphes was conceived I m the one who came up with the scene of the peddler I based it on La Thologie en Quenouille You don t get off the hook in it any more than anyone else ME So much the better Perhaps you re giving me more honour than I deserve I d be humiliated if those who speak badly about so many expert and decent people decided to say something good about me HIM There are many of us and each one must pay his dues After the sacrifice of the great animals we immolate the others ME Insulting science and virtue in order to make a living that s really expensive bread HIM I ve already told you we have no effect We could injure the entire world and we wouldn t hurt anyone Sometimes our company includes the peasant Abb d Olivet the fat Abb Le Blanc and the hypocrite Batteux The fat abb is malicious only before he s eaten Once he s had his coffee he throws himself into an armchair rests his feet against the shelf by the chimney and goes to sleep like an old parrot on its perch If the noise gets violent he yawns stretches his arms rubs his eyes and says All right what s up What is it We re trying to find out if Piron has more wit than Voltaire Let s get this straight are you talking about wit It s not a question of taste for your Piron has no notion of taste No idea at all No And then we set out on a discussion of taste Then our patron signals with his hand that we should listen to him because he s keener on taste than on anything Taste he says taste is something my goodness I ve no idea what he said it was and neither does he Sometimes our friend Robb is with us He amuses us with cynical stories miracles about people in convulsions where he was a visual witness and also with a few cantos from his poem on a subject which he knows really well I hate his verses but I like to hear him recite He has the air of someone truly weird All those around him cry out Now that s what we call a poet Just between us that poetry is nothing but a din of all sorts of confused noises the barbarous song of people living in the tower of Babel Sometimes we also get a visit from a certain simpleton with a dull stupid expression who has a mind like a demon and who s smarter than an old monkey He s one of those figures who invite jokes and tricks someone God made to correct people who judge on the basis of appearances those who should have learned at their own mirrors that it is just as easy to be a witty man and look like a fool as it is to hide a fool under an intelligent looking physiognomy It s a really common form of cowardice to sacrifice a good man for the amusement of others And they never fail to go after this man He s a trap we set for the new arrivals and I ve hardly seen a single one of them fail to get caught I was sometimes surprised by the justice of this fool s observations on men and on their characters I told him as much Well he replied it s a matter of getting some benefits out of bad company just like out of being a libertine You get compensation for the loss of innocence by also losing your prejudices In a society of bad people where vice shows itself with its mask removed you learn to recognize it And besides I ve read a bit ME What have you read HIM I ve read I read and I constantly re read Theophrastus La Bruyre and Molire ME Those are excellent books HIM They are much better than people think but who knows how to read them ME Everyone according to how intelligent he is HIM Hardly anyone Could you tell me what people are looking for in those books ME Amusement and instruction HIM What instruction That s the point ME A knowledge of one s duties a love of virtue and a hatred of vice HIM Well I gather from them everything one should do and everything which one shouldn t say So when I read L Avare I say to myself be a miser if you want to but be careful not to talk like a miser When I read Tartuffe I tell myself be a hypocrite if you like but don t talk like a hypocrite Keep the vices which are useful but don t assume a tone or an appearance which will make you ridiculous In order to be sure about this tone and appearance you have to know them Now these authors have provided excellent portraits of them I am myself and I remain what I am But I act and speak in a way that s suitable I m not one of those people who disparage the moralists One can profit a lot from them above all from those who have put morals into action Vice doesn t hurt people except now and then But the visible features of vice injure them from morning to night Perhaps it would be better to be a scoundrel than to look like one insolence in a character is only insulting from time to time but an insolent appearance is always insulting As for the rest don t go and imagine that I m the only reader of this sort I ve no particular merit in this except that I ve done systematically with a keen intelligence and a reasonable and true aim in mind what most others do by instinct That s the reason why what they read doesn t make them better than me and why they continue to be ridiculous in spite of themselves whereas I m ridiculous only when I choose to be and then I leave them far behind me For the same art which at certain times teaches me to save myself from being ridiculous also teaches me at other times to make myself ridiculous in a superior way Then I recall everything other people have said everything I ve read and I add to those everything from my own capital funds which in this type of thing are a surprisingly rich resource ME You ve done well to reveal these mysteries to me Without that I would ve thought you were contradicting yourself HIM No I don t to that at all Fortunately for one occasion when it s necessary to avoid ridicule there are a hundred where one has to be ridiculous There s no better role to play in the presence of grand people that that of the fool For a long time there was an official jester to the king but there has never been an official wise man to the king Me I m a fool for Bertin and many others perhaps for you at this moment or perhaps you re my fool A man who wanted to be wise would not have such a fool That s why anyone who has a fool is not wise If he s not wise he s a fool and perhaps if he s a king his fool s fool Beyond this you should remember than in a subject as varied as morals there s no absolute essential universal truth or falsity unless it s the fact that one has to be what one s self interest wants one to be good or bad wise or foolish decent or ridiculous honest or vicious If by chance virtue had led the way to a fortune either I d have been virtuous or I d have pretended to be virtuous just like anyone else People wanted me to be ridiculous and that s what I ve made myself As for viciousness nature alone paid the cost of that When I say vicious it s in order to speak your language for if we were to come to an understanding of each other it could turn out that you call vice what I call virtue and virtue what I call vice We also had among us authors from the Opera Comique their actors and actresses and more often their managers Corby Moette all resourceful people of superior merit And I was forgetting the great literary critics L Avant Coureur Les Petites Affiches L Anne littraire L Observateur littraire Le Censeur hebdomadaire all that clique of columnists ME L Anne littraire L Obervateur littraire that s not possible They detest each other HIM That s true But all beggars are reconciled at the feeding trough That damned Obervateur littraire I wish the devil had taken the man and his columns It s that little cur of an avaricious priest that stinking usurer who s the cause of my disaster He appeared on our horizon for the first time yesterday He arrived at the hour which drives us all out of our hide outs dinner time When the weather is bad anyone among us who has a twenty four sou coin in his pocket for cab fare is a happy man Some people make fun of a fellow beggar who arrives in the morning with mud up to his ribs and soaked to the bone and then in the evening have to return home in the same condition There was one of them I don t know which one who a few months ago had a violent tangle with the Savoyard peasant who had set up at our door They were running on credit and the creditor wanted the debtor to settle up but the latter didn t have the money Well they serve the meal and honour the abb by placing him at the head of the table I come in I notice him So I say to him Well abb so you re presiding today That s fine for today but tomorrow you move down one setting if you please and the day after tomorrow to the next place setting and thus from place to place either to the left or right until you move from that place which I ve occupied once before you Freron once after me Dorat once after Freron Palissot once after Dorat and come to rest beside me a poor dull bugger like yourself qui siedo sempre come un maestoso cazzo fra duoi coglioni The abb who s a good little devil and takes everything well began to laugh Mademoiselle was struck by the truth of my observation and the justice of my comparison and she began to laugh All those who were seated to the right and to the left of the abb and whom he had moved down one notch began to laugh So everyone was laughing except Monsieur who was irritated and went at me with things which wouldn t have mattered at all if we d been alone Rameau you re an impudent man I know that that s why you receive me here A scoundrel Just like the others A beggar Would I be here if I weren t I ll see to it that you re thrown out After dinner I ll leave on my own I d advise you to do that So we ate and I didn t miss a bite After we d eaten well and drank a good deal because after all it wouldn t have mattered one way or the other mister Guts is someone whom I ve never avoided I made my decision and was preparing to leave I d given my word in the presence of so many people that I had to keep it I was prowling around the apartment for a long time looking for my walking stick and my hat in places where they wouldn t be all the time counting on the fact that my patron would let out a new torrent of abuse that someone would intervene and that we d finish up by being reconciled because we d lost our tempers I wandered round I kept wandering around for I wasn t feeling anything inside but my patron well he was blacker and grimmer than Homer s Apollo when he fired his arrows down on the Greek army He was walking back and forth with his hat pulled down more than usual and his fist on his chin Mademoiselle came up to me But Mademoiselle what s been so extraordinary then Have I been any different today from my usual self I wish him to leave I will leave I haven t done him any wrong Excuse me but Monsieur l Abb was invited and He let himself down by inviting the abb and then letting me in and with me so many other hangers on like me Come on my dear Rameau You must apologize to Monsieur l Abb I don t want his pardon Come on come on all this will sort itself out They took me by the hand and dragged me towards the abb s armchair I held out my arms I looked at the abb with a sort of admiration for who had ever made an apology to the abb Abb I said to him abb all this is really silly isn t it And then I started to laugh and so did he So right there I was forgiven in that quarter But I had to tackle the other one and what I had to say to him was a different game altogether I don t know much about how I framed my apology Monsieur look at this fool He s been making me suffer for too long I don t want to hear any more talk about him Monsieur is angry Yes I am very angry That won t happen any more Well the first scoundrel I don t know if he was in one of his moody days when Mademoiselle is afraid to go near him and doesn t dare touch him except with velvet mitts or whether he misheard what I was saying or whether I spoke badly but things got worse than before To hell with it doesn t he know me Doesn t he know that I m like a child and there are situations where I just let everything go under me And then God forgive me I thought I d never have a rest from performing Even a puppet made of steel gets worn out if the strings are pulled from morning to night and from night until morning I must relieve them of their boredom I take that for granted but I have to amuse myself sometimes In the middle of this mess a fatal thought went through my mind an idea which made me arrogant and inspired me with pride and insolence it was the notion that they couldn t do without me that I was someone indispensable ME Yes I think you re very useful to them but they re even more so to you You won t find a house as good as that one when you want to but those people if they re missing one fool can come up with a hundred HIM A hundred fools like me Mister Philosopher they re not as common as that Yes some insipid fools It s harder to find quality in foolishness than in talent or virtue I m a rare member of my species yes very rare Now that they don t have me any more what are they doing They re as bored as dogs I m an inexhaustible sack of impertinence At every moment I had a joke which made people laugh until they cried For them I was an entire house of idiots ME So that s why you had table bed coat vest trousers shoes and a small allowance HIM Well that s the good side That s the profit But what about the charges you don t say a word about those First if there was a rumour about a new play no matter what the weather I had to poke my nose in all the attics in Paris until I found the author Then I had to find a way to read the work and to insinuate skillfully that there was role in it which would be performed extremely well by someone I knew By whom if you please By whom a good question Someone with grace charm and delicacy You mean Mademoiselle Dangeville Do you know her by any chance Yes a little But it s not her Then who I d say her name in a low voice Her Yes her I d repeat somewhat ashamed for there are times I feel a sense of modesty and when I repeated the name you should ve seen the poet make a long face or at other times blow up in a temper right in front of me However for better or worse I had to bring my man to dinner and he didn t want to get involved He d stall and offer his thanks You should ve seen how I was treated if I didn t succeed in my negotiations with him I was a lout a fool an oaf I was good for nothing I wasn t worth the glass of water they d given me to drink But it was even worse if she got the part then I had to go fearlessly through the midst of the booing public and they re good judges no matter what people say about them and make my applause heard as a one man claque I attracted people s attention and sometimes stole the booing away from the actress I d hear people whispering beside me It s a valet in disguise one of those belonging to the man who sleeps with her Won t the rascal ever shut up People have no idea what could make a person do that They think it s stupidity whereas it comes from a motive that excuses everything ME Up to and including breaking the laws HIM Finally however I became known and people said Oh it s Rameau My only option was to throw out some ironic expression to salvage the ridicule of my solitary applause so that people would interpret it as its opposite You have to admit that it takes a powerful interest to brave the assembled public like that and the effort is worth more than one small cu ME Why didn t you get some help HIM I ve done that too I earned a bit of money from it Before going into the torture chamber we had to memorize some brilliant passages where we had to set the tone If I happened to forget them or got confused there was a real earthquake when I returned You ve no idea the kind of fuss they made And then in the house there was a pack of dogs to look after It s true that I d taken on this job like a fool And then I had to take care of the cats And I was only too happy if Micou favoured me with a claw scratch which ripped my cuff or my hand Criquette is subject to colic and it s my job to rub her belly Previously Mademoiselle had vapours Now it s nerves I m not mentioning the other slight indispositions which no one bothered about in front of me Those were all right I ve never believed in too much formality I ve read I don t know where that a prince known as The Great used to rest sometimes leaning against the back of his mistress s toilet commode People act relaxed around their familiars and in those days I was more familiar than anyone I m the apostle of familiarity and relaxation I preached them there by example without anyone objecting to me They just had to let me be I ve given you a sketch of my patron Mademoiselle is beginning to put on weight and you should hear the fine stories people make of that ME You re not one of those people are you HIM Why not ME At the very least it s indecent to make your benefactors sound ridiculous HIM But isn t it even worse to let your good deeds give you an excuse to discredit your protg ME If the protg wasn t vile on his own nothing would give his protector such a right HIM But if these people weren t ridiculous in themselves one couldn t make up good stories about them And then is it my fault if they become vulgar Is it my fault once they ve become vulgar if people betray and ridicule them If they decide to live with people like us and have any common sense they have to expect all sorts of dark stuff People who take up with us surely they know us for what we are for self interested souls vile and two timing If they understand us then everything s fine There is a tacit agreement that they ll provide good things for us and sooner or later we ll pay back the good they ve done us with something bad Isn t this the agreement that exists between a man and his pet monkey or parrot Brun cries out that Palissot his guest and friend has written some couplets attacking him Palissot had to compose the couplets and it s Brun who s in the wrong Poinsinet cries out that Palissot has ascribed to him the couplets he wrote against Brun But Palissot had to ascribe to Poinsinet the couplets he wrote attacking Brun and it s Poinsinet who s in the wrong The little Abb Rey cries out that his friend Palissot has snatched away his mistress after he introduced her to him But he shouldn t have introduced someone like Pallisot to his mistress if he wasn t prepared to lose her Palissot did his duty and it s Abb Rey who is in the wrong The bookseller David cries out because his associate Palissot has slept with or wanted to sleep with his wife The wife of the bookseller David cries out that Palissot has told anyone willing to listen that he has slept with her Whether Palissot has slept with the bookseller s wife or not is difficult to determine because the wife s duty was to deny the fact and Palissot could ve let people believe what was not true Whatever the case Palissot played his role and it s David and his wife who are in the wrong Helvitius may cry out that Palissot slanders him by putting him in a scene as a dishonest man but Palissot still owes him the money he borrowed for the medical treatment for his bad health as well as for his food and clothing But should Helvetius have expected any other treatment from a man soiled with all sorts of infamy a man who for fun makes his friend swear off his religion who appropriates the assets of his partners who has no faith law or feeling who runs after fortune per fas et nefas who measures his days by the acts of villainy he commits and who has even lampooned himself on stage as one of the most dangerous rascals a piece of impudence I believe we ve not seen in the past and won t see in the future No So it s not Palissot but Helvetius who s in the wrong If one takes a young man from the provinces to the zoo at Versailles and his foolishness persuades him to stick his hand through the bars of the tiger s or panther s cage and if the young man leaves his arm behind in the throat of the ferocious animal who s in the wrong All that is written in the tacit agreement Too bad for the man who doesn t know that or who forgets it How many of those people accused of viciousness I could justify by appealing to this universal and sacred pact whereas people should accuse themselves of stupidity Yes you fat countess you re the one in the wrong when you gather around you what people of your sort call characters and when these characters play dirty tricks on you and you do the same thus exposing yourself to the resentment of decent people Honest people do what they ought to do so do your characters And it s your fault for having collected them If Bertinhus lived quietly and peacefully with his mistress if through the honesty of their characters they d made the acquaintance of decent people they d have summoned round them men of talent people known in society for their virtue If they d reserved for a small enlightened select group hours of entertainment taken from the sweet life they had together loving each other in the quiet of their retreat do you think people would have made up stories about them good or bad So then what happened to them They got what they deserved They ve been punished for their imprudence And we re the ones whom Providence has destined from all eternity to bring justice to the Bertins of today And it s people like us among our descendants who are destined to bring justice to the Montsauges and Bertins of the future But while we execute the decrees of justice on stupidity you paint us as we are and carry out these just decrees against us What would you think of us if with our disgraceful habits we claimed that we enjoyed popular favour You d say we were out of our minds And those who expect decent treatment from people born vicious from vile and base characters are they wise Everything in this world receives its due There are two public prosecutors The one by your door punishes the criminal offences against society Nature is the other She recognizes all the vices which escape the laws You devote yourself to debauchery with women You ll get dropsy You re a scoundrel You ll get consumption You open your door to rascals and you live with them You ll be betrayed mocked and despised The simplest thing to do is to resign yourself to the equity of these judgments and tell yourself that it s all right Then you can shake your ears and change your ways or else stay as you are but on the conditions mentioned above ME You re right HIM In fact about these bad stories I don t myself make any of them up I stick to the role of peddler They say that a few days ago at five o clock in the morning people could hear a really violent noise All the house bells were in motion There were stifled and broken cries of a man choking Help help I m being suffocated I m dying These cries came from the apartment of my patron People arrived They went to help him That fat creature of ours had lost her mind and was no longer aware of what she was doing which sometimes happens at such moments She kept speeding up her movements raising herself on her two hands so that from higher up she could let fall on his casual parts her weight of two or three hundred pounds energized with all the speed provided by furious desire They had a lot of difficulty getting him out from under What a devilish fantasy for a little hammer to place himself under a heavy anvil ME You re too naughty Speak about something else Since we ve been talking I ve had a question on the tip of my tongue HIM Why has it stayed there so long ME I was afraid it might be indiscreet HIM After the things I ve just shown you I don t know what secret I could conceal from you ME You have no doubts about how I judge your character HIM None whatsoever In your eyes I m a very abject person very contemptible and I m also sometimes just the same in my own eyes but rarely I congratulate myself on my vices more often than I criticize myself for them ME That s true but why show me all your nastiness HIM Well first because you know a good deal about it already and I saw that there s more to win than to lose by confessing the rest to you ME Please tell me how that works HIM If it s important to be sublimely good at anything it s above all necessary with being bad People spit on a petty cheat but they can t hold back a certain respect for a grand criminal His courage astonishes you His atrocity makes you tremble In everything people value integrity of character ME But this worthy integrity of character you don t yet have it From time to time I find you vacillating in your principles It s uncertain whether you hold to your nastiness from nature or from study or if study has taken you as far as it s possible to go HIM I agree with that But I ve done my best Haven t I had the modesty to recognize beings more perfect than myself Haven t I spoken to you about Bouret with the most profound admiration Bouret in my view is the greatest man in the world ME But immediately after Bouret there s you HIM No ME Then it s Palissot HIM It s Palissot but it s not only Palissot ME And who could be worthy of sharing second place with him HIM The renegade from Avignon ME I ve never heard mention of this renegade of Avignon but he must be a really astonishing man HIM That he is ME The history of great people has always interested me HIM That I can believe This one used to live with a good and honest descendant of Abraham the one who was promised he d be father of the faithful and they d be as numerous as the stars ME He lived with a Jew HIM With a Jew He began by winning the Jew s sympathy and then his good will and finally his total confidence That s how it always goes We count so much on the effects of our kindnesses that we rarely hide a secret from someone we ve buried in our good deeds It s impossible to have no ungrateful people when we expose men to the temptation of being ungrateful with impunity This perceptive idea is one our Jew did not think about So he confided to the renegade that he could not in good conscience eat pork Now you re going to see the advantages a creative mind can derive from this confession A few months went by during which our renegade strengthened the bond between them When he thought that the Jew was totally won over and truly caught that his attentions had completely convinced him that he didn t have a better friend in all the tribes of Israel You have to admire the man s circumspection He didn t hurry He lets the pear grow ripe before he shakes the branch Too much eagerness could ve ruined his project Usually greatness of character comes from a natural balance of several contrasting qualities ME Leave your reflections and go on with your story HIM That s not possible There are days when I have to reflect It s a sickness which has to be left to run its course Where was I ME At the well established intimacy between the Jew and the renegade HIM So the pear was ripe But you re not listening to me What are you dreaming about ME I m dreaming about the unevenness of your style sometimes lofty sometimes low HIM Can the style of a vicious man be unified He comes one night to the home of his good friend with an agitated air his voice broken his face pale as death trembling in all his limbs What s the matter with you We re lost Lost How Lost I m telling you lost without hope Explain yourself Wait a minute until I get over my fear Come on pull yourself together the Jew said to him instead of saying You re an incorrigible scoundrel I don t know what you have to tell me but you re an incorrigible scoundrel You re pretending to be terrified ME And why should he have spoken to him like that HIM Because the man was a liar and had gone too far That s clear to me so don t interrupt me any more We re lost lost without hope Don t you sense the affectation in the repetition of the wordlost A traitor has denounced us to the Holy Inquisition you as a Jew and me as a renegade as a disgusting renegade Observe how the traitor was not embarrassed to use the most odious expressions It requires more courage than people think to call yourself by your proper name You have no idea what it costs to get to that point ME Of course not But what about this disgusting renegade HIM He s a liar but it s a really adroit lie The Jew gets scared He pulls his beard He rolls on the ground He sees the guard at his door He sees himself dressed in the San Benito and his ownauto da fe being prepared My friend my dear friend my only friend what do we do What do we do You show yourself you affect the greatest self confidence go on with your business as usual The procedures of this tribunal are secret but slow You must use the delay to sell everything I ll charter a ship or I ll get a third party to do it yes a third party that ll be better We ll put your fortune in it because it s mainly your fortune they want and we ll go you and I to seek under another sky the liberty to serve our God and to follow in safety the law of Abraham and our conscience The important point in these perilous circumstances we find ourselves in is not to do anything imprudent No sooner said that done The ship is chartered loaded with provisions and sailors The Jew s fortune is on board The next day at dawn they re going to set sail They can dine happily and sleep soundly The next day they ll escape their persecutors During the night the renegade gets up steals the Jew s wallet his purse and his jewels goes on board and sails away And you think that s all there is to it If so you haven t got the point When I was told this story I guessed what I haven t yet told you to test your intelligence You ve done well to be a respectable man you wouldn t have been anything but a petty rogue And up to this point the renegade has been only that a miserable wretch whom no one would want to be like But the supreme part of his wickedness is that he had himself denounced his good friend the Israelite The Holy Inquisition seized him when he got up and some days later turned him into a fine bonfire That s how the renegade became the peaceful possessor of the fortune of this cursed descendant of those who crucified Our Saviour ME I don t know which gives me greater horror the evil of your renegade or your style of speaking about him HIM That s the very thing I was telling you The atrocity of the action takes you beyond contempt and that s the reason why I m so sincere I wanted you to understand how I excelled in my art and to pull out of you the admission that I was at least original in my degradation I wanted to give you the idea that I belonged in the line of great scoundrels and then to shout to myself Vivat Mascarillus fourbum imperator Long live Mascarillus emperor of the rogues Come mister Philosopher sing along Vivat Mascarillus fourbum imperator At that point he began to sing a really extraordinary fugue Sometimes the melody was serious and full of majesty sometimes light and playful At one moment he imitated the bass at another one of the upper parts He indicated to me with his outstretched arms and neck the places with held notes and performed and made up on his own a song of triumph It showed that he knew more about good music than about good habits As for me I didn t know if I ought to remain or run away to laugh or grow indignant I stayed intending to steer the conversation onto some subject which would rid my soul of the horror filling it I was starting to find it difficult to endure the presence of a man who talked about a horrible action a hideous crime like a connoisseur of painting or poetry examining the beauties of a tasteful work or like a moralist or historian selecting and emphasizing the circumstances of a heroic action I became gloomy in spite of myself He noticed that and spoke to me HIM What s the matter Are you feeling ill ME A little But it will pass HIM You have the worried look of a man upset about some distressing idea ME That s it After a moment of silence on his part and mine during which he walked around whistling and singing to get him back to his talent I said to him What are you doing at present HIM Nothing ME That very tiring HIM I was already stupid enough Then I went to hear the music of Duni and other young composers and that finished me off ME So you approve of this style of music HIM No doubt ME You find beauty in these new melodies HIM My God do I find beauty in them I ll say I do What declamation What truth What expressiveness ME Every art of imitation has its model in nature What s the musician s model when he writes a tune HIM Why not tackle the issue at a higher level What s a melody ME I confess to you that this question is beyond my capabilities In that we re all alike In our memory we have only words which we think we understand from our frequent use of them and even the correct way we apply them But in our minds they are only vague notions When I say the word melody I don t have ideas any clearer than yours or those of the majority of people like you when they say reputation blame honour vice virtue modesty decency shame ridicule HIM A melody is an imitation using the sounds of a scale invented by art or inspired by nature whichever you like either with the voice or with an instrument an imitation of the physical sounds or accents of passion You see that by changing some things in this definition it would fit exactly a definition of painting oratory sculpture and poetry Now to get to your question What s the musician s model or the model of a melody It s declamation if the model is alive and thinking it s noise if the model is inanimate You must think of declamation as a line and the melody as another line which winds along the first The more this declamation the basis of the melody is strong and true the more the melody which matches it will intersect it in a greater number of points And the truer the melody the more beautiful it will be That s something our young musicians have understood really well When one hears Je suis un pauvre diable one thinks one can recognize the sad cry of a miser If he wasn t singing he would speak to the earth in the same tones when he entrusts his gold to it saying O terre reois mon trsor And that little girl who feels her heart beating who blushes who s confused and who begs the gentleman to let her go would she express herself any differently In these works there are all sorts of characters an infinite variety of declamations That s sublime I m the one telling you this Go on go on and listen to the piece where the young man who feels himself dying cries out Mon coeur s en va Listen to the song Listen to the instrumental accompaniment and then tell me what difference there is between the real actions of a man who s dying and the form of the melody You ll see whether the line of the melody coincides completely with the line of the declamation or not I m not going to talk to you about measure which is another condition of melody I m confining myself to the expression and there is nothing more obvious than the following passage which I read somewhere musices seminarium accentus Accent is the breeding ground of melody Judge from that just how difficult and how important it is to know how to deal with recitative well There is no fine tune from which one cannot make a fine recitative and no fine recitative from which a expert cannot derive a fine tune I wouldn t want to guarantee that someone who recites well will also sing well but I would be surprised if a person who sings well didn t know how to recite well And you should believe everything I ve said about this because it s the truth ME I d like nothing better than to believe you if I were not held back by one small difficulty HIM And this difficulty ME Well it s this if this music is sublime then the music of Lully Campra Destouches Mouret and even just between us your dear uncle must be a little dull HIM coming close and whispering in my ear I don t wish to be overheard for there are plenty of people who know me around here But their music is dull It s not that I concern myself much about my dear uncle if he s dear at all He s a stone He could look at me with my tongue hanging out a foot and he wouldn t give me a glass of water But he s done well with the octave with the seventh tra la la rum ti tum too de loo with a devilish noise Still those who are beginning to understand these things and who ll no longer accept this fussing about for music will never put up with that There should be a police order forbidding anyone no matter what their quality or condition from having Pergolesi s Stabat sung This Stabat should have been burned by the public hangman My God these damned Buffons Italian writers of light opera with their Servante Matresse and their Tracollo have given us a real kick in the ass Previously a Tancrde an Iss a Europe galante les Indes Castor and the Talents lyriques ran for four five or six months Performances of Armide went on for ever Nowadays they fall down around each other like a house of cards And Rebel and Francoeur throw fuel on the flames saying everything is lost they re ruined if people tolerate any longer this singing rabble from the circus our national music will go to the devil and the Royal Academy in the cul de sac will have to close up shop There s some truth in that The old wigs who have been coming there for thirty or forty years every Friday instead of enjoying themselves the way they used to in the past are getting bored and yawning without knowing why They ask themselves the question but have no idea how to answer Why don t they ask me Duni s prediction will come true and the way things are going I ll eat my hat if in four or five years after Le Peintre amoureux de son Modle there s a cat left to kick in the celebrated Impasse Those good people they ve turned their backs on their own symphonies to play Italian symphonies They thought they could train their ears for these without having any effect on their own vocal music as if except for the greater freedom afforded by the reach of the instrument and the mobility of the fingers the symphony was not related to singing as singing is to real declamation As if the violin were not the mimic of the singer who one day will become the imitator of the violin when what s difficult takes the place of what s beautiful The first musician who played Locatelli was the apostle of the new music That s so typical We ll get accustomed to the imitation of the accents of passion or of natural phenomena by melody and voice by instruments because that s the whole extent and purpose of music And will we retain our taste for robbery lances glories triumphs and victories Go and see if they come Jean They imagined that they would laugh or cry at scenes from tragedy or comedy set to music that the accents of fury hate jealousy the true sorrows of love the ironies the jokes of the Italian or French theatre could be presented to their ears and they d remain admirers of Ragonde and Plate I tell you in reply taradiddle boom boom Even if they sensed without interruption with what ease what flexibility what tenderness the harmony prosody ellipses and inversions of the Italian language lend themselves to art movement expression turns of melody and the measured value of sounds they d still remain ignorant of how their music is stiff dead heavy ungainly pedantic and monotonous Yes yes They ve persuaded themselves that after having mixed their tears in with the crying of a mother who is desolated over the death of her son after having trembled at the orders of a tyrant commanding a murder they wouldn t be bored with their fairy land their insipid mythology their sugary little madrigals which display the bad taste of the poet as much as the poverty of the art which puts up with them Such good people It s not so and can t be The true the good and the beautiful have their rights One may argue with them but in the end one admires them What doesn t bear their stamp people admire for a while but they end up by yawning So yawn away gentlemen yawn to your heart s content Don t be embarrassed The gates of hell will never prevail against the imperial power of nature and my trinity The true establishes itself gently it s the father and gives birth to the good who is the son and from him comes the beautiful which is the Holy Ghost The strange god sets himself up humbly on the altar beside the idol of the country Gradually it gets stronger One fine day it nudges its comrade with an elbow and bang crash the idol is on the floor They say that s how the Jesuits planted Christianity in China and India And these Jansenists can say whatever they please but the political method which marches towards its goal quietly without bloodshed without martyrs without a single tuft of hair being cut off seems to me the best ME There s some reason in everything you ve just said HIM Reason So much the better The devil take me if I ve been trying to be reasonable It just comes out somehow or other I m like the musicians at the Impasse when my uncle appeared If I speak well it s because a boy from a coal mine will always speak better of his trade than an entire academy and all the Duhamels of this world And then there he goes walking around humming some tunes from l Ile des Fous Peintre amoureux de son Modle Marchal ferrant and Plaideuse From time to time he lifted his hand and eyes to the sky and cried out Isn t that beautiful by God Isn t it beautiful How could anyone have a pair of ears on his head and even raise such a question He began to get worked up and to sing very softly As he grew even more impassioned he raised his voice and then there followed gestures facial grimaces and bodily contortions I say All right there he is off his head getting some new scene ready Then in fact he set off with a loud shout I am a poor wretch Monseigneur Monseigneur let me go O earth take my gold Keep my treasure safe My soul my soul my life O earth There it is my little friend There s my little friend Aspettare e non venire A Zerbina penserete Sempre in contrasti con te si sta He crammed together and jumbled up together thirty songs Italian French tragic comic in all sorts of different styles Sometimes in a bass voice he went down all the way to hell and sometimes he d feign a falsetto and sing at the top of his voice tearing into the high points of some songs imitating the walk deportment gestures of the different singing characters by turns furious soft imperious sniggering At one point he s a young girl crying portraying all her mannerisms at another point he s a priest he s a king he s a tyrant he threatens commands loses his temper He s a slave He obeys He calms down he laments he complains he laughs never straying from the tone rhythm or sense of the words or the character of the song All the men pushing wood had left their chess boards and gathered around him The windows of the caf were filled up on the outside by passers by who d been stopped by the sound People gave out bursts of laughter strong enough to break open the ceiling But he didn t notice a thing He continued in the grip of some mental fit of an enthusiasm so closely related to madness that it s uncertain whether he ll come out of it It might be necessary to throw him into a cab and take him straight to the lunatic asylum As he was singing snatches from Lamentations by Jomelli he brought out the most beautiful parts of each piece with precision truth and an incredible warmth That beautiful recitative in which the prophet describes the desolation of Jerusalem he bathed in a flood of tears which brought tears to everyone s eyes Everything was there the delicacy of the song the force of expression the sorrow He stressed those places where the composer had particularly demonstrated his great mastery If he stopped the singing part it was to take up the part of the instruments which he left suddenly to return to the vocals moving from one to the other in such a way as to maintain the connections and the overall unity taking hold of our souls and keeping them suspended in the most unusual situation which I ve ever experienced Did I admire him Oh yes I admired him Was I touched with pity I was touched with pity But a tinge of ridicule was mixed in with these feelings and spoiled them But you would ve burst out laughing at the way in which he imitated the different instruments With his cheeks swollen all puffed out and with harsh dark sounds he delivered the horns and bassoons For the oboes he produced a shrill nasal tone and then accelerated his voice with an amazing speed for the stringed instruments trying to find the best approximations for their sounds He whistled for the piccolos warbled for the flutes shouting singing carrying on like a maniac acting out by himself the male and female dancers and singers an entire orchestra the whole musical company dividing himself into twenty different roles running stopping looking like a man possessed frothing at the mouth It was stiflingly hot and the sweat running down the wrinkles in his forehead and down the length of his cheeks mixed in with the powder in his hair came down in streaks and lined the top of his coat What didn t I see him do He cried he laughed he sighed he looked tender or calm or angry a woman who was swooning in grief an unhappy man left in total despair a temple being built birds calming down at sunset waters either murmuring in a cool lonely place or descending in a torrent from the high mountains a storm a tempest the cries of those who are going to die intermingled with the whistling winds the bursts of thunder the night with its shadows silent and dark for sounds do depict even silence His mind was completely gone Worn out with fatigue and looking like a man coming out of a deep sleep or a long trance he stayed motionless dazed astonished He directed his gaze around him like someone disturbed who s trying to recognize where is He was waiting for his energy and his spirit to return Mechanically he wiped his face Like someone who wakes up to see a large number of people surrounding his bed totally forgetful of or profoundly ignorant about what s happened He first cried out Well then gentlemen what s going on Why are you laughing What s so surprising What s happening Then he added Now that s what people should call music and a musician However gentlemen we should not deprecate certain pieces of Lully I defy anyone to improve on the scene Ah j attendrai without changing the words We should not criticize some places in Campra the violin pieces of my uncle his gavottes his entries for soldiers priests those carrying out the sacrifice Pale torches a night more frightening than shadows God of Tartarus God of Oblivion At that point his voice grew loud he sustained the sounds The neighbours came to their windows and we stuffed our fingers in our ears He added Here s where we need lungs a great organ plenty of air But before long it will be time to say yours sincerely good bye to Assumption Lent and Epiphany They still don t know what needs to be set to music and thus what s appropriate for a composer Lyric poetry has yet to be born But they ll get there by hearing Pergolisi the Saxon Terradoglias Trasetta and the rest by reading Metastasio they ll have to get there ME So Quinault La Motte and Fontenelle didn t understand any of that HIM Not for the new style There aren t six consecutive lines in all their charming poems which can be set to music There are ingenious sentences light madrigals tender and delicate but if you want to see how that s a barren resource for our art which is the most demanding of all and I don t except the art of Demosthenes get someone to recite these pieces You ll find them so cold listless and monotonous There s nothing there which could serve as the basis for a melody I d sooner have La Rochefoucauld s Maxims or Pascal s Penses set to music The cry of animal passion should dictate the line which suits us The expressive passages must follow each other closely The phrasing must be brief the sense cut off suspended so the musician can use the whole piece and each of its parts leaving out a word or repeating it adding a missing word turning and re turning it like a polyp without destroying it all that makes French lyric poetry much harder than is the case with languages with inversions which in themselves offer all these advantages Cruel barbarian plunge your dagger in my breast Here I am ready to receive the fatal blow Strike Dare Oh I faint I die A secret fire lights up my senses Cruel love what do you want with me Leave me to the sweet peace I enjoyed Give me my reason The passions must be strong The tenderness of the composer and the poet should be extreme The aria is almost always the peroration for the scene We have to have exclamations interjections suspensions interruptions affirmations negations we call we invoke we cry out we groan we cry we laugh openly No wit no epigrams none of these neatly crafted thoughts That s too far from simple nature And don t go on thinking that the role playing of theatrical actors and their declamation can serve us as models Bah We need something more energetic less mannered more true The straightforward language and common voice of passion are all the more necessary for us because our language is more monotonous and less stressed The cry of an animal or a man in passion will provide them While he was saying these things to me the crowd which had surrounded us had moved away either because they couldn t hear anything or were taking less interest in what he was saying For in general human beings like children prefer to be amused than to be instructed They d gone back each to his game and we remained alone in our corner Seated on a bench with his head leaning against the wall his arms hanging down and his eyes half closed he said to me I don t know what s the matter with me When I came here I was fresh and in good form And now here I am beaten up and shattered as if I d hiked thirty miles Something came over me all of a sudden ME Would you like some refreshment HIM Yes I d like that I feel hoarse I haven t got any energy and my chest hurts a bit It happens to me almost every day just like that I ve no idea why ME What would you like HIM Whatever you like I m not hard to please Poverty has taught me to adjust to everything They served us some beer and lemonade He fills a large glass and drains it two or three times one after the other Then like a man with renewed energy he coughs moves around and starts again But in your view my Master Philosopher isn t it something really odd that a foreigner an Italian a Duni should come to teach us how to use accents in our music to adapt our melodies to all the movements measures intervals all the forms of speech without hurting our prosody And yet it wasn t all that difficult to do not like drinking the sea Anyone who d ever heard a beggar asking for a hand out in the street a man carried away by anger a jealous and furious woman a despairing lover a flatterer yes a flatterer softening his voice drawing out his syllables in a voice like honey in short anyone who d ever heard passion of some sort or other provided that its energy made it worthy of serving as a model for a composer should have recognized two things first that the syllables long or short have no fixed length nor even a set relationship between their lengths and second that passion uses prosody almost as it likes it can work across the greatest intervals A man who cries out in the depths of his grief Ah what an unhappy creature I am lifts the opening syllable of exclamation to the highest and shrillest note and brings the others down to the most solemn and low notes going through the octave or an even greater interval giving to each sound the quantity which suits the turn of the melody without offending the ear and without either the long or the short syllables maintaining the length or brevity of normal speech How far we ve come since the time when we used to point to the parenthetical comments in Armide The conqueror of Renaud if anyone can be or Obey don t hesitate from Indes galantes as amazing moments of musical expression Right now these amazing moments make me shrug my shoulders with pity The way art is improving I don t know where it ll end up So while we re waiting let s have another drink He had two or three more drinks without knowing what he was doing He was going to drown himself without realizing it as if he was totally exhausted if I hadn t moved the bottle which he kept looking for absent mindedly Then I spoke to him ME How is it that with such fine discrimination and such a strong sensibility for the beauties of musical art you are also blind to the beautiful things in morality and equally insensible to the charms of virtue HIM I suppose it s because there s a sense for some things which I lack a fibre which I wasn t given a loose fibre which one can pluck firmly but which will not vibrate or perhaps it s because I ve always lived among good musicians and bad people so that it s made my ear become very refined and my heart deaf And then there was something about heredity My father s blood and my uncle s blood are the same My blood is the same as my father s My paternal molecule was hard and stubborn and this damned first molecule has swallowed up the rest ME Do you love your child HIM Do I love the little savage I m crazy about him ME Are you seriously concerned about stopping the effects in him of this damned paternal molecule HIM I ve been working on it but without much effect I think If he s destined to become a good man I won t do him any injury But if the molecule wants him to become a scoundrel like his father the troubles I ve taken to make him a decent man could be very harmful Education would work against the tendency of the molecule and he d be pulled apart as if by two opposing forces and would stagger all over the place along the road of life as I seen in countless people equally awkward in doing good or bad Those are the ones we call types which is the most frightening of all labels because it indicates mediocrity and the final degree of contempt A great scoundrel is a great scoundrel but he s not a type It would require an enormous length of time before the paternal molecule could reassert its mastery and take him to the state of perfect debasement where I am He d lose his best years So I m doing nothing about it at the moment I ll let him come along I ll keep my eye on him He is already greedy glib a lazy thief and a liar I m afraid he s true to his heredity ME Why not make a musician of him so he ll be just like you HIM A musician A musician Sometimes I look at him and grind my teeth telling him If you ever learn a single note I believe I ll wring your neck ME And why on earth would you do that HIM It doesn t lead to anything ME It leads to everything HIM Yes when one excels but who can promise himself that his child will excel The odds are ten thousand to one that he ll be nothing but an unhappy scraper of strings like me You know it would probably be easier to find a child suited to govern a kingdom to make a great king than one to make a great violin player ME It seems to me that agreeable talents even mediocre ones among a people without morals lost in debauchery and luxury would enable a man to advance rapidly along the road to fortune I myself once heard the following conversation between some sort of patron and a kind of protg The latter had been recommended to the former as a pleasant man who could be of service to him Sir what do you know I know mathematics passably well All right but after you ve taught mathematics ten or twelve years you ll be covered with mud from the streets of Paris and you ll be entitled to an income of between three and four hundred pounds I ve studied our laws and I m well versed in our legal system If Puffendorf and Grotius were to return to earth they d die of hunger beside some road marker I know a lot about history and geography If there were parents who d set their hearts on a good education for their children your fortune would be made but there are none I am a competent musician Well why didn t you say so right away Just to show you what you can gain from such a talent I have a daughter Come around every day between seven and seven thirty in the evening until nine You ll give her lessons and I ll give you twenty five louis per year You ll have breakfast lunch and dinner with us The rest of the day will belong to you You can do with it whatever works to your benefit HIM And what became of this man ME If he d been wise he d have made a fortune which is the only thing you seem to think about HIM No doubt Gold some gold Gold is everything and the rest without gold is nothing So instead of cramming his head with fine maxims which he d have to forget or else be nothing but a beggar whenever I have a louis which isn t often I stand in front of him I pull the louis out of my pocket I show it to him with admiration I raise my eyes to the ceiling I kiss the louis right in front of him And to make him understand even better the importance of this sacred coin I stammer out the words I point out to him with my finger everything one can acquire with this coin a fine frock a pretty hat a tasty biscuit Then I put the louis in my pocket I walk around with pride I lift up my coattails and strike my hand against my fob pocket to make him understand that it s the coin in there that gives rise to the self assurance he sees in me ME One could do no better What if it happens one day that deeply impressed with the value of the louis HIM I see where you re going One has to close one s eyes to that There is no principle of morality which doesn t have some inconvenience At the worst one has a bad fifteen minutes and then it s all over ME Even after such courageous and such wise opinions I continue to think that it would be good to make him a musician I d don t know any way one can get close to important people more quickly pander to their vices and make a profit from one s own HIM It s true but I have plans for a faster and more assured success Oh if the child were only a daughter But since we can t do what we want we have to take what comes and get the best we can from that And for that one shouldn t be stupid like most fathers who give a Spartan education to a child destined to live in Paris They couldn t do any worse if they were intending to make their children unhappy If education is poor it s the fault of my country s customs not mine Whoever s responsible I want my son to be happy or what amounts to the same thing honoured rich and powerful I know a few of the easiest ways to arrive at this goal and I ll teach him those early on If you criticize me you wise men the mob and my child s success will absolve me He ll have gold I assure you and if he has a lot of that he won t lack anything not even your estimation and respect ME You could be wrong HIM Well then he ll go without like plenty of other people In everything he said there were so many things one thinks about and acts upon but which one does not say And to tell you the truth that s the most remarkable difference between my man and most of those around us He admitted the vices he had which are those other men possess but he wasn t a hypocrite He was neither more nor less abominable than they were He was only more candid more consistent and sometimes more profound in his depravity I trembled to think what his child could become with a teacher like him It s certain that after educational ideas so strictly tailored to our morality he would go far unless he was prematurely stopped along the way HIM Come now you needn t be afraid The important point the difficult point which a father has to attend to above all is not so much to give his child vices that will make him wealthy or foolish behaviour that will make him valuable to great people everyone does that if not systematically as I do at least by example and in lessons but to give him a sense of proportion the art of dodging shame dishonour and the law Those are dissonances in the social harmony which he must know how to set up prepare and resolve Nothing is so insipid as a sequence of perfect chords There has to be something which acts as a spur which breaks up the light and scatters its rays ME That s very good With this comparison you bring me back from morality to music which I d strayed from in spite of myself I thank you for that for to be perfectly frank with you I like you better as a musician than as a moralist HIM But I m very second rate in music and much better as a moralist ME I doubt it but even if that were true I m a good man and your principles are not the same as mine HIM So much the worse for you Ah if I only had your talents ME Leave my talents out of it Let s get back to yours HIM If only I knew how to express myself like you But my way of speaking is such a devilish mixture half from the people of the literary world half from the street market ME I speak badly I only know how to speak the truth and that s not always welcome as you know HIM But I envy your talent not because I want to speak the truth but in order to tell lies well If I could write do up a book turn out a dedicatory epistle intoxicate a fool with his own merit insinuate myself close to women ME In all that you re a thousand times more capable than I am I wouldn t even be worthy to be your pupil HIM How many great qualities wasted And you aren t even aware of their value ME I collect back everything I put into them HIM If that were the case you wouldn t have this coarse coat this muslin vest these wool socks these thick shoes and this ancient wig ME I agree One must be very inept if one is not rich after stopping at nothing to become wealthy But the fact is there are people like me who do not consider riches the most precious thing in the world strange people HIM Very odd We aren t born with this frame of mind One has to acquire it because it s not natural ME Not natural to men HIM No not to men Everything living including human beings seeks benefits for itself at the expense of whoever they belong to And I m sure that if I left the little savage to go his own way without speaking to him about anything he d want to be richly clothed splendidly fed liked by men and adored by women and would like to gather round him all the fine things of life ME If the little savage were left to himself so that he retained all his imbecility uniting the little reason possessed by a child in the cradle with the passionate violence in a man thirty years old he d wring his father s neck and sleep with his mother HIM That proves the need for a good education Who ll argue about that And what s a fine education if not one which leads to all sorts of pleasures without danger and without inconvenience ME I almost share you opinion but let s not explore that HIM Why not ME Well I m afraid we may only appear to agree and if we once enter into a discussion of the dangers and the difficulties which need to be avoided we won t agree any more HIM And what s the problem with that ME Let s leave it I m telling you For I know I could never teach you about these things and it s much easier for you to teach me about music things I don t understand and you do Dear Rameau let s talk music Tell me how it comes about that with your ability to feel to remember and deliver the finest passages of the grand masters with the enthusiasm which inspires you and which you transmit to others you ve done nothing worth anything Instead of answering me he began to shake his head Then raising his finger to the sky he added The star My star When nature made Leo Vinci Pergolese and Duni she smiled She assumed an imposing and serious expression when she formed my dear uncle Rameau whom people will call the Great Rameau for ten years and then in a little while won t mention any more When nature did up his nephew she made grimace after grimace and then grimaced again While he uttered these words he made all sorts of faces disgust disdain irony and he seemed to be kneading in his fingers a piece of dough and smiling at the ridiculous shapes he made with it This done he threw the misshapen idol far away from him and said That s how nature made me and threw me away alongside other idols some with shriveled stomachs short necks huge eyes outside their heads apoplectic others with wry necks wizened with a vibrant eye and a hooked nose All of them started to laugh when they saw me And I put my two fists against my sides and exploded with laughter when I saw them for fools and madmen amuse each other They seek each other out They attract each other If on my arrival here I hadn t found ready made the proverb which says A fool s money is the inheritance of a man with brains I d have invented it I felt that nature had put what was legitimately mine into the safe keeping of these idols so I devised thousands of ways of getting it back for myself ME I know these methods You ve told me about them and I admired them a lot But with such resources why haven t you attempted creating a fine work of art HIM That s what a man of the world said to Abb Le Blanc The abb replied The Marquise of Pompadour takes me by the hand leads me right to the threshold of the Academy and there she removes her hand I fall down and break both my legs The man of the world answered him All right abb you must get up and bash in the door with your head The abb replied That what I tried to do and do you know what happened to me I got a bump on my forehead After this little story my man began to move around with his head held down and a pensive and demoralized expression He sighed and wept He was upset Raising his hands and his eyes he banged his head with his fist hard enough to break his forehead or his fingers and he added It seems to me that there could be something in there but no matter how hard I knock or shake it nothing emerges Then he began shaking his head and hitting his forehead again even more firmly saying Either no one is in there or they won t answer A moment later he took on a proud attitude He raised his head laid his right hand over his heart walked along and said I feel Yes I do feel He imitated for me a man who was getting annoyed who was indignant who was feeling moved who was issuing orders who was begging He improvised speeches of anger sympathy hatred love He sketched out passionate characters with a surprising delicacy and fidelity Then he added That s it I think It s coming along That s what it is to find a midwife who knows how to stimulate and bring on the labour pains and make the child emerge When I m alone I take up my pen intending to write I bite my nails I wear out my forehead No good Good night The god is absent I d persuaded myself that I had some genius but at the end of a line I read that I am a fool a fool a fool But how does one feel raise oneself think or describe anything with energy when one hangs out with people like those it s necessary to see in order to live in the midst of the comments one makes and hears and gossip like this Today the boulevard was charming Did you hear the little Marmotte She played enchantingly mister Someone or Other has the most beautiful dappled grays in harness you could ever imagine As for lovely Madame So and So she s beginning to get past it At the age of forty five does one have one s hair done like that That young What s her name is covered with diamonds which didn t cost her much You mean to say which cost her a lot Not at all Where did you see her At L Enfant d Arlequin perdu et retrouv The scene of despair was acted out as never before The Punch at the fair can really shout but has no finesse no soul Madame Such and Such has given birth to two children at once Each father will have his own Do you think stuff like that spoken repeated and heard every day inspires and leads to great things ME No It would be more worthwhile to shut yourself up in your attic drink water eat dry bread and find your real self HIM Perhaps But I don t have the courage for that And then to sacrifice one s happiness for an uncertain success And what about the name I carry Rameau To be called Rameau that s embarrassing Talent is not like nobility which can be passed on and whose lustre increases as it goes from grandfather to father from father to son from son to grandson without the grandparent requiring his descendant to have any merit The old stock branches out into an enormous line of fools but who cares It s not like that with talent In order to acquire nothing more than the reputation of one s father it s necessary to be more skilled than he is You have to have inherited his fibre I lack the fibre But my wrist is flexible the bow moves and the pot boils If it s not glory well it s food ME In your place I wouldn t assume it s all said and done with I d make an attempt HIM And you think I haven t tried I wasn t fifteen years old when I first said to myself What are you up to Rameau You re dreaming And what are you dreaming about That you d like to have done or do something which excites the admiration of the universe Well then you just have to blow on your fingers and wiggle them Just get started and you ll be there At a more advanced age I repeated what I d said to myself in my childhood Today I m still repeating it and I m standing by the statue of Memnon ME What do you mean talking about the statue of Memnon HIM That s obvious enough it seems to me Around the statue of Memnon there were numberless other statues which the sun s rays struck just as much but Memnon s statue was the only one which produced a sound Who s a poet Well there s Voltaire And who else Voltaire And a third Voltaire And a fourth Voltaire And musicians There s Rinaldo da Capoua Hasse Pergolese Alberti Tartinin Locatelli Terradoglias there s my uncle and little Duni who s nothing to look at no figure but who feels my God who has melody and expression The others around this small number of Memnons are just so many pairs of ears stuck on the end of sticks And we re beggars so poor it s a miracle Oh Mister Philosopher poverty is a terrible thing I see her crouching there with her mouth gaping open to receive a few drops of icy cold water dripping from the barrel of the Danaids I don t know if she sharpens the mind of the philosopher but she has a devilish way of cooling off the head of a poet People don t sing well under this barrel The man who can get himself under it is only too lucky I was there and I didn t know how to keep my place I d already done that stupid thing once before I d been traveling in Bohemia Germany Switzerland Holland Flanders all over the damned country ME Under the leaky barrel HIM Under the leaky barrel The man was a rich Jew who was happy to splash his money around He liked music and my silly jokes I played music just the way that made God happy and I played the fool I didn t lack anything My Jew was a man who understood his law and who observed it strictly in every detail sometimes with a friend always with strangers He got himself in bad trouble which I must tell you about because it s amusing In Utrecht there was a charming prostitute He was attracted to this Christian and sent her a messenger with quite a large letter of credit The strange creature rejected his offer The Jew grew desperate The messenger told him Why are you so upset by this You want to sleep with a good looking woman Nothing is easier even to sleep with one more beautiful than the one you re chasing That s my wife I ll let you have her for the same price No sooner said than done The messenger keeps the letter of credit and my Jew sleeps with the messenger s wife The due date for the letter of credit arrives The Jew allows the letter to be challenged and disputes its validity A trial The Jew tells himself The man will never dare to reveal what right he has to possess my letter and I ll not have to pay him At the hearing he interrogates the messenger This letter of credit who did you get it from From you Is it for a loan No Is it for the sale of merchandise No Is it for services rendered No but that s not the point I m in possession of the letter You signed it and you can discharge it I didn t sign it So then I m a forger You or someone else who you re acting for I m a coward but you re a scoundrel Believe me don t push me to the limit I ll tell everything I ll dishonour myself but I ll sink you The Jew paid no attention to the threat and at the next hearing the messenger revealed the entire affair They were both reprimanded and the Jew was condemned to pay off the letter of credit and the money was applied to the relief of the poor At that point I left him and came back here What was I to do I had to do something or die of poverty All sorts of plans went through my head One day I was going to leave tomorrow to join up with a troupe traveling through the provinces I d be equally good or bad in the theatre or in the orchestra The next day I was dreaming of getting someone to paint for me one of those pictures attached to a pole which people set up in a public crossroad where I d have shouted my head off There s the town where he was born Here he is leaving his father the apothecary Here he is arriving in the capital looking for his uncle s residence Here he is on his knees before his uncle who is chasing him away Here he is with a Jew and so on and so on The next day I d get up firmly resolved to join up with the street singers That s not the worst thing I could ve done We could ve gone to give a concert under my dear uncle s windows He d have collapsed with rage But I chose something else At that point he stopped and assumed in succession the pose of a man who s holding a violin turning his arms to tighten the strings and then the pose of a poor devil worn out with exhaustion with no energy whose limbs wobbled ready to die if someone didn t throw him a piece of bread He showed his extreme need with the gesture of a finger pointing towards his half open mouth Then he added You see what I mean They d toss me the loaf and three or four of us all famished would fight over it So go on then think grand thoughts create beautiful things in an environment of such distress ME That s difficult HIM From one tumble to the next I fell into that job I was in clover Now I ve left it Now I have to scrape the gut once again and come back to that gesture with my finger pointing towards my gaping mouth Nothing s very stable in this world Today at the top of the wheel tomorrow at the bottom Damned circumstances lead us along and lead us really badly Then drinking up what remained at the bottom of the bottle he spoke to the man next to him Sir would you be so good as to give me a pinch of snuff That s a lovely box you have there Are you a musician No All the better for you for they re poor buggers a pitiful bunch Destiny wanted me to be a musician while in a mill in Montmartre there s perhaps a miller or a miller s helper who never listens to anything but the sound of the ratchet but who d have made up some fine songs Rameau go to the mill the mill that s where you belong ME Whatever a man devotes himself to nature has destined him for that HIM She makes some strange blunders In my case I m not looking down from that height where everything merges into one where the man who prunes a tree with cutters and the caterpillar who eats the leaves seem nothing but two different insects each doing his own work Go and perch on the epicycle of Mercury and from there like Reamur who classifies flies into seamstresses surveyors and harvesters you can divide up the human species into woodworkers carpenters roofers dancers singers whatever you like I won t get involved in it I m in the world and I m staying here But if it s part of nature to have an appetite for it s always appetite I come back to to the feeling which is always present in me I find that it s not part of a good order if one doesn t always have something to eat It s a damnable economy with men who cram themselves with everything while others whose stomachs are just as demanding as theirs and have a recurring hunger like theirs have nothing to chew on The worst thing is the way our need compels us to a certain posture The man in need doesn t walk like another man he jumps he grovels he wriggles he crawls He spends his life taking up and carrying out various positions ME What are these positions HIM Go and ask Noverre The world offers many more positions than his art can imitate ME So there you are too if I can use your expression or rather Montaigne s perched on the epicycle of Mercury contemplating the different pantomimes of the human species HIM No no I m telling you I m too heavy to raise myself so high Those misty regions I leave to the cranes I move around from one piece of earth to another I look around me and I take up my positions or I amuse myself with positions which I have derived from others I m an excellent mimic as you re going to see The he begins to smile to imitate a man admiring begging obliging He sets his right foot forward his left behind with his back bent over his head raised with his gaze looking directly into another person s eyes his mouth half open his arms stretched out towards some object He waits for his orders He receives them He dashes off comes back He s done the job and is giving an account of it He attends to everything He picks up what falls down He puts a pillow or a footstool under someone s feet He holds a saucer He goes up to a chair He opens a door He closes a window He pulls the curtains He observes the master and mistress He is immobile his arms hanging down his legs lined up straight He listens He seeks to read what s on their faces And he continues That s my pantomime almost the same as what flatterers prostitutes valets and beggars do The antics of this man the stories of Abb Galiani and the extravagances of Rabelais sometimes force me to me profound reflections They are three stores where I have acquired for myself some ridiculous masks which I put over the faces of the most serious people I see Pantalon in prelate a satyr in a judge a pig in a monk an ostrich in a minister and a goose in his first deputy ME But by your count there are lots of beggars in this world and I don t know anyone who doesn t do some steps in that dance of yours HIM You re right In the entire kingdom there s only one man who walks That s the king All the rest take up positions ME The king Isn t there more to it that that Don t you think that from time to time he finds beside him a little foot a little curl a little nose which makes him go through a small pantomime Whoever needs someone else is a beggar and takes up a position The king takes up a position before his mistress and before God He goes through the paces of his pantomime The minister goes through the paces of prostitute flatterer valet or beggar in front of his king The crowds of ambitious people dance your positions in hundreds of ways each more vile than the others in front of the minister The noble abb in his bands of office and his long cloak goes at least once a week in front of the agent in charge of the list of benefices My goodness what you call the pantomime of beggars is what makes the earth go round Everyone has his little Hus and his Bertin HIM That s a great consolation But while I was speaking he was imitating in a killingly funny way the positions of the persons I was naming For example for the little abb he held his hat under his arm and his breviary in his left hand in his right hand he lifted up the train of his cloak He came forward with his head a little inclined towards his shoulders his eyes lowered imitating the hypocrite so perfectly that I believed I was looking at the author of the Refutations appearing before the Bishop of Orleans For the flatterers and for the ambitious he crawled along on his belly just like Bouret at the Ministry of Finance ME That s done extremely well But there s one creature who can do without pantomime That s the philosopher who has nothing and who demands nothing HIM Where s there an animal like that If he has nothing he suffers If he s not asking for anything he ll get nothing and he ll be suffering for ever ME No Diogenes mocked his needs HIM But we have to have clothing ME No He went about totally naked HIM Sometimes the weather was cold in Athens ME Less so than here HIM People eat there ME No doubt HIM At whose expense ME At nature s Where does the savage turn To the earth to animals to fish to trees to grasses to roots to streams HIM A bad menu ME It s a big one HIM But badly served ME Still it s nature s table that serves to cover our own HIM But you ll admit that the work of our cooks pastry cooks sellers of roast meats caterers and confectioners adds something of their own to it With the austere diet of your Diogenes it wouldn t do to have organs that were easily upset ME But you re wrong The habits of the cynic were the habits of our monks with the same virtue The cynics were the Carmelites and Cordeliers of Athens HIM I ll take you up on that Diogenes also danced his pantomime if not in front of Pericles at least in front of Lais or Phryne ME You re wrong again Other people used to pay a prostitute well who gave herself to him for pleasure HIM But what happened if the prostitute was busy and the cynic was in a hurry ME He d go back to his barrel and manage without her HIM And you re advising me to imitate Diogenes ME I ll bet my life it s better than crawling demeaning and prostituting oneself HIM But I need a good bed a fine table warm clothing in winter cool clothing in summer spare time money and lots of other things which I prefer to owe to charity than to acquire by work ME That s because you re a good for nothing greedy coward with a soul of mud HIM I think I ve told you that ME Things in life no doubt have a price but you ve no idea of the sacrifice you re making to obtain them You dance you have danced and you ll continue to dance the vile pantomime HIM It s true But it hasn t cost me much and isn t costing me any more for all that And that s the reason I d be making a mistake to take up some other way of getting along which would bring me grief and which I wouldn t keep up But I see from what you ve told me that my poor little wife was a sort of philosopher She was as brave as a lion Sometimes we didn t have any bread or any money We d sold just about all our old clothes I d throw myself at the foot of our bed and rack my brains to find someone who could lend me an cu which I wouldn t repay She was as happy as a lark She d sit down at her keyboard and accompany herself while singing She had a voice like a nightingale I m sorry you never heard her When I had some concert to go to I d take her with me On the way I d say to her Come on then Madame make them look up to you Display your talent and your charm Up with you Knock them out We d arrive She s sing She d rise to the occasion and knock them out Alas I lost her the poor little thing Apart from her talent she had a small mouth big enough to put your finger in her teeth were a row of pears her eyes feet skin cheeks breasts limbs like a deer thighs and buttocks all fit for a sculptor s model Sooner or later she d have had the Farmer General What a walk she had what a rump Oh God what a rump And there he was starting to imitate his wife s walk He took little paces He held his head high He played with a fan He wiggled his backside It was the most agreeable and ridiculous caricature of our little prostitutes Then picking up the thread of his remarks he added I used to walk with her everywhere to the Tuileries to the Palais Royal on the Boulevards It was impossible that she d go on living with me When she crossed the road in the morning without a hat in a really short skirt you d have stopped to look at her And you could ve encircled her waist in your fingers without pinching her The men who followed her who watched her mincing along on her small feet and measured that large rump whose shape was outlined by her thin petticoats walked more quickly She d let them come up Then she d turn around suddenly confronting them with her two large black shining eyes That stopped them in their tracks For the front part of the medal was as good as the back But alas I lost her And my hopes for a fortune have all vanished with her That s the only reason I married her I confided all my schemes to her and she had too much intelligence not to see how right they were and too much judgment not to approve of them Then there he was sobbing and crying as he said No no I ll never get over it Ever since I ve taken to wearing bands and a skull cap ME From grief HIM If you like But the real reason is to have my bowl on my head But look at the time I have to go to the opera ME What s playing HIM Something by Dauvergne There are quite a few fine things in his music It s a pity that he wasn t the first to write them There are always a few dead people who upset the living That s just the way it is Quisque suos patimur manes Each of us has ancestors we must endure It s half past five I hear the bell sounding for vespers for the Abb de Canaye and for me Farewell Mister Philosopher Isn t it true that I m always the same ME Alas yes unfortunately HIM Well I hope this misfortune keeps going for only another forty years The man who ll laugh last will laugh best THE END
