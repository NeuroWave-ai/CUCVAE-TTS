Balm Wright s Rheumatic Remedy Young s Victoria Cream SOCIAL FORMS Manners and Customs of Good Society ETIQUETTE OF COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE It is a growing custom in America not to announce an engagement until the date of the marriage is approximately settled Long engagements are irksome to both man and woman and a man is generally not supposed to ask a girl to marry him until he is able to provide a home for her This however does not prevent long friendships between young couples or a sentimental understanding growing up between them and it is during this period that they learn to know each other and find out if they are suited for a life s partnership When a young man goes a courting it generally means that he has some particular girl in mind whom he has singled out as the object of his devotion A man a courting is generally on his best behavior and many a happily married wife looks back on her courting days as the most delightful of her life At that time the woman is the object of a devotion to which she has as yet conceded nothing She is still at liberty to weigh and choose to compare her lover to other men while the knowledge that she is the ultimate girl that some man is trying to win gives her a pretty sense of self importance and a feeling that she has come into the heritage of womanhood Whether it is one of the fictions about courtship or not it is generally assumed that a young woman is longer in making up her mind than is the young man When a man finds the right girl he is pretty apt to know it and it is his business then to start out and persuade her to his point of view Neither willing nor reluctant is the attitude of the young girl Gifts and Attention Just what attention a man is privileged to show a young woman to whom he is not engaged and yet to whom he wishes to express his devotion is a point a little difficult to define If she is a bookish girl she will be pleased with gifts of books or the suggestion that they may read the same books so they may talk them over together She will probably feel complimented if a man discusses with her his business affairs and the problems that are interesting men in their life work When a man begins to call often and regularly on a girl it is best to have some topic of conversation aside from personalities When a man is led to spend more money than he can afford in entertaining a girl it is a bad preparation for matrimony Courtship is a time when a man desires to bring gifts and it is quite right and fitting that he should do so within reasonable limits A girl of refined feelings does not like to accept valuable presents from a man at this period of their acquaintance Flowers books music if the girl plays or sings and boxes of candy are always permissible offerings which neither engage the man who offers them nor the girl who receives them This is the time when a man invites a girl to the theater to concerts and lectures and may offer to escort her to church The pleasure of her society is supposed to be a full return for the trouble and expense incurred in showing these small attentions The Claims of Companionship A man cannot justly complain if a girl accepts similar favors from other men for until he has proposed and been accepted he has no claim on her undivided companionship An attitude of proprietorship on his part particularly if it is exercised in public is as bad manners as it is unwise and a high spirited girl although she may find her feelings becoming engaged is prone to resent it It should be remembered that a man is free to cease his attentions and until he has finally surrendered his liberty he should not expect her to devote all her time to him At this period it is a wise man who makes a friend of a girl s mother and if he does this he will generally be repaid in a twofold manner No matter how willful a girl may be her mother s opinion of her friends always has weight with her Moreover what the mother is the girl will in all probability become and a man has no better opportunity of learning a girl s mental and moral qualities than by knowing the woman who bore and reared her Engagement and Wedding Rings The form and material of the mystic ring of marriage change but little and innovations on the plain gold band are rarely successful The very broad flat band is now out of date and replaced by a much narrower ring sufficiently thick however to stand the usage of a lifetime It is generally engraved on the concealed side with the initials of the giver and the date of the marriage The gold in the ring should be as pure as possible and the color which depends on the alloy used should be unobtrusive the pale gold being better liked now than the red gold Many women never remove their wedding ring after it has been put on and believe it is bad luck to do so There is but one choice for an engagement ring a solitaire diamond and clusters or colored stones are not considered in this connection As after the wedding the engagement ring is used as a guard to the wedding ring it should be as handsome as possible and a small pure stone is a far better choice than a more showy one that may be a little off in color or possess a flaw Correct Form in Jewelry On the wedding day the groom often makes the bride a wedding present of some piece of jewelry and if this is to be worn during the ceremony it should consist of white stones in a thin gold or platinum setting such as a pendant bracelet or pin of pearls and diamonds If a colored stone is preferred and a turquoise for instance adds the touch of blue which is supposed to bring a bride good luck it should be concealed inside the dress during the services As a memento of the event a groom often presents his ushers with a scarf pin or watch or cigarette case ornamented with the initials of the bride and groom and the bride generally makes a similar present to her bridesmaids of some dainty piece of jewelry Whether this takes the form of a pin bracelet or one of the novelties that up to date jewelers are always showing it should be the best of its kind Imitation stones or silver gilt have no place as wedding gifts Wedding Customs There is no time in a woman s life when ceremonies seem so important as when a wedding in the family is imminent Whether the wedding is to be a simple home ceremony or an elaborate church affair followed by a reception the formalities which etiquette prescribes for these functions should be carefully studied and followed Only by doing so can there be the proper dignity and above all the absence of confusion that should mark the most important episode in the life of a man or woman Wedding customs have undergone some changes of late years mostly in the direction of simplicity Meaningless display and ostentation should be avoided and if a girl is marrying into a family much better endowed in worldly goods than her own she should have no false pride in insisting on simple festivities and in preventing her family from incurring expense that they cannot afford The entire expenses of a wedding with the exception of the clergyman s fee and the carriage which takes the bride and groom away for their honeymoon are met by the bride s family and there is no worse impropriety than in allowing the groom to meet or share any of these obligations Rather than allow this a girl would show more self respect in choosing to do away with the social side of the function and be content with the marriage ceremony read by her clergyman under his own roof Invitations and Announcements In the case of a private wedding announcement cards should be mailed the following day to all relatives and acquaintances of both the contracting parties Evening weddings are no longer the custom and the fashionable hour is now high noon although in many cases three o clock in the afternoon is the hour chosen Whether the wedding is to be followed by a reception or not the invitations to it should be sent out not less than two weeks before the event and these should be promptly accepted or declined by those receiving them The acceptance of a wedding invitation by no means implies that the recipient is obliged to give a present These are only expected of relatives and near friends of the bride and groom and in all cases the presents should be addressed and sent to the bride who should acknowledge them by a prettily worded note of thanks as soon as the gifts are received or at the latest a few days after the marriage ceremony Silver and Linen The usual rule followed in the engraving of silver or the marking of linen is to use the initials of the bride s maiden name The question of duplicate gifts is as annoying to the sender as it is to the young couple who are ultimately to enjoy the gifts Theoretically it is bad form to 
1046_133225_000027_000000	train-clean-360	exchange 
none	none	a gift after it has been received but in truth this is often done when a great deal of silver is given by close friends or members of the family it is a comparatively easy matter to find out what has already been sent and to learn the bride s wishes in this matter Prenuptial Functions After the wedding invitations are out it is not customary for a girl to attend any social functions or to be much seen in public This gives her the necessary time to devote to the finishing of her trousseau and for making any necessary arrangements for the new life she is to take up after the honeymoon is over Family dinners are quite proper at this time and it is expected of her to give a lunch to her bridesmaids The wedding presents may be shown at this occasion but any more public and general display of them is now rarely indulged in and is in fact not considered in good taste The groom as a prenuptial celebration is supposed to give a supper to his intimate bachelor friends and the men who are to act as ushers at the marriage ceremony The ushers are generally recruited from the friends of the groom rather than those of the bride but if she has a grown brother he is always asked to act in this capacity Ushers like bridesmaids are chosen among the unmarried friends of the young couple although a matron of honor is often included in the bridal party The Bride s Trousseau The bride s trousseau should be finished well before the fortnight preceding the wedding Fashions change so quickly now that it is rarely advisable for a bride to provide gowns for more than a season ahead If the check her father furnishes her for her trousseau is a generous one it is a wise provision to put a part of it aside for later use and in so doing she has the equivalent of a wardrobe that will last her for a year or more Custom has decreed that the bride s wedding dress shall be of pure white and as the marriage ceremony is a religious one whether it takes place in a church or in a private house that it shall be made high in the neck and with long sleeves Orange blossoms the natural flowers form the trimming to the corsage and a coronet to fasten the veil A bride s ornaments include only one gift of white jewelry pearls or diamonds from her future husband and the bouquet he presents her So many awkward moments have been occasioned in wedding ceremonies by removing the glove that brides are dispensing with wearing gloves at this time The bride s appearance is by no means affected by this custom and the slipping of the ring on the third finger of the left hand is made simpler and thereby more graceful The engagement ring which up to the time of the wedding ceremony has been worn on this finger afterwards serves as a guard for the wedding ring The Bridesmaids Millinery is a most important question in discussing a wedding and we cannot dismiss the question with the gown worn by the bride A most serious consideration is what the bridesmaids are to wear and this is generally only settled after long and serious consultation with the bride It is generally agreed that all of these gowns shall be made by the same dressmaker so that they may conform to the colors and styles decided on the gown of the maid or matron of honor differing slightly from the general scheme At a church wedding bridesmaids wear hats and carry baskets or bouquets of flowers but if bouquets are carried they should be quite unlike the one borne by the bride It is customary for the bride to give her bridesmaids some souvenir of the occasion and it is expected that the groom provide the gloves and ties for the ushers Duties of the Best Man The duties of the best man are arduous and it is indeed wise as it is general for a man to ask his best and most devoted friend to serve in this capacity The best man is supposed to relieve the groom of all the details of the ceremony and to take on his shoulders all the worry incident to its success as a social function It is he who purchases the gloves and ties for the other ushers and sees that they are coached in their duties he procures the marriage license if that is necessary and has the ring ready for the groom at the critical moment After the ceremony he is supposed to hand the clergyman his fee and at the same time be in readiness to conduct the line of bridesmaids and ushers to their carriages He must be at the bride s home in case there is a wedding reception before the principal actors in the ceremony are there It is he who sends the notices of the event to the newspapers and if there is a formal breakfast with speech making it is the best man who proposes the health of the newly married pair and replies to the toast in behalf of the bridesmaids He is the one member of the wedding party who sees the happy couple off at the station and bids them the last farewell as they depart on their honeymoon This is perhaps the time and moment when his good sense and social tact is the most needed The foolish custom of decorating bridal baggage with white ribbon and of throwing a superabundance of old shoes and a rain of rice after the departing pair may be mitigated by a little care on his part MOURNING CUSTOMS There has been of late years a healthy revolt against the excessive use of crepe or the wearing of mourning for an undue period Mourning is first of all a protection for in these busy days and in a large city a death affecting our acquaintances is not always known to us If we meet a friend wearing black we are instantly apprised that she has suffered the loss of a near member of her family It is easy to say under such circumstances I am very sorry to see you in black or I am afraid I have not heard of your loss For a father or mother full mourning that is black unrelieved by any touch of white is worn for a year and at the end of that period half mourning consisting first of white with black and then violet and gray is worn for the second year For a brother or sister or grandparent black is worn for six months and then half mourning for the six months preceding the wearing of ordinary colors What is called complimentary mourning put on at the death of a relative by marriage consists of the wearing of black for a period of from six weeks to a year depending on the closeness of the personal relationship For instance in the case of the death of a mother in law residing in a distant city it would only be necessary for a woman to wear black for a few weeks following the funeral If on the other hand she resides in the same place and is a great deal in the company of her husband s family it would show more tact and affection on her part to refrain from wearing colors for a longer period Crepe is no longer obligatory in even first mourning Many widows only wear the crepe bordered veil hanging from the conventional bonnet for the funeral services and for a few weeks afterward when it is replaced by an ordinary hat and veil of plain black net bordered with thin black silk Widows wear neck and cuff bands of unstarched white book muslin this being the only sort of white permitted during the first period of mourning Young widows especially those who must lead an active life often lighten their mourning during the second year and discard it at the end of the second year Of course the conventional period of mourning for a widow is three years but if there should be any indication that a second marriage is contemplated black should gradually be put aside However the discarding of mourning is no indication that a woman is about to change her name and the wearing of black is so much a matter of personal feeling that a woman should not be criticised for curtailing the conventional period In this country it is not the custom for young children to wear mourning and with men the wearing of a black band about the hat or on the left arm is all that is deemed necessary A woman wearing full mourning refrains from attending the theater or any large functions She may properly be seen at concerts club meetings or lectures and she may receive and visit her friends informally ETIQUETTE OF THE VISITING CARD The prevailing shape for a woman s card is nearly square about two one two by three inches while the correct form for a man s card is slightly smaller The color should be pure white with a dull finish while the engraving plain script or more elaborate text is a matter of choice and fashion varying from time to time It is safe to trust the opinion of a first class stationer in this matter for styles fluctuate and he should be constantly informed of what polite usage demands A woman s card should always bear the prefix Miss or missus There is no exception to this rule save in the case of women who have regularly graduated in medicine or theology and who are allowed therefore the use of doctor or reverend before the name Miss or missus should not be used in addition to either of these titles The card of a married woman is engraved with her husband s full name such as missus William Eaton Brown but she has no right to any titles he may bear If he is a judge or colonel she is still missus James Eaton Brown and not missus Judge or missus Colonel Brown A widow may with propriety retain the same visiting card that she used during the lifetime of her husband especially if she has no grown son who bears his father s name In that case she generally has her cards engraved with a part of her full maiden name before her husband s name such as missus Mary Baker Brown In this country a divorced woman if she has children does not discard her husband s family name neither does she retain his given name For social purposes she becomes missus Mary Baker Brown or if she wishes missus Baker Brown The address is engraved in the lower right corner of the visiting card and if a woman has any particular day for receiving her friends that fact is announced in the lower left corner As a rule even informal notes should not be written on a visiting card although when a card accompanies a gift it is quite proper to write Best wishes or Greetings on it This is even done when a card does not accompany a gift but it should be borne in mind that a card message should not take the place of a note of thanks or be used when a more formal letter is necessary A man s visiting card should bear his full name with the prefix mister unless he has a military title above the grade of lieutenant or is a doctor or clergyman In these cases the proper title should be used in place of mister Courtesy titles although they may be common usage in conversation and a man may be known by them are best abandoned on the visiting card During the first year of marriage cards are engraved thus mister and missus William Eaton Brown and this card may be used in sending presents returning wedding civilities or making calls even when the bride is not accompanied by her husband After the first year these cards are discarded and husband and wife have separate visiting cards In some communities it is not the custom for a young girl to make formal calls without her mother To meet this requirement the girl s name with the prefix Miss is engraved on her mother s card below her mother s name It is no longer considered necessary to leave a number of cards at the same house when calling in person or sending cards If there are several women members of the family one card suffices If a woman wishes to leave her husband s card she should leave two one for the mistress and one for the man of the house A woman never leaves a card for a man unless she has called on him on a matter of business and wishes him to be reminded of the fact At a tea or large afternoon reception a card should be left in the hall as a guest departs so as to enable the hostess to preserve a record of those who have called on her If she is not able to attend she should send her visiting card so that it may arrive on the day of the function After a dinner or any formal function she should make a personal call or leave her card in person When making an ordinary call it is not necessary to send one s visiting card to the hostess by the servant who opens the door Pronouncing the name distinctly is sufficient but if it is a first call and there is danger that the hostess may not be familiar with the caller s address it is best to leave a card on the hall table when leaving no matter if the hostess herself conducts her visitor to the door When one is invited but unable to attend a church wedding it is necessary to send on the day of the ceremony cards to those who issue the invitations An invitation to a wedding reception or breakfast demands a more formal acceptance sent immediately on receipt of the invitation and couched in the same manner in which the invitation reads A newcomer in town or a young married woman may receive a card from an older woman indicating her receiving days and hours This is a polite invitation to call and if she is unable to make a call at the time indicated she should send a card on that day Cards of condolence are left as soon as possible after learning of the affliction It is not necessary to write anything on the card in fact it is better not to do so for if the acquaintance warrants a personal message it should take the form of a letter On the other hand it is quite proper in felicitating a friend on a happy event such as the announcement of an engagement in the family or the arrival of a new baby to send a visiting card with Congratulations written on it There are times when it seems necessary to send cards to practically all one s acquaintances This is wise after a long absence or a change of residence and when one is leaving town for a long period it is proper to send cards with the French expression Pour prendre conge FORMALITIES IN DRESS AND ETIQUETTE Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy was old Polonius advice to his son and he counseled suitability as well It is this question of suitability that is the hall mark of correct dressing A safe rule to follow especially in the case of a young woman is not to be conspicuous in attire and to conform to the standards of dress as set down by older women of recognized standing in the town in which she lives and the community in which her social or business life is spent A young girl needs little adorning Her school or college dresses should be characterized by their neatness freshness correctness of cut and utility rather than by elaborate trimmings or costly materials Her party gowns are simpler than those of a girl who has left school and she wears less jewelry At the end of school life if her parents are able and willing to give her a coming out party she begins her social career under the pleasantest auspices and this is the opportunity for her first elaborate gown The Debutante The character of this gown depends largely on the nature of the entertainment given her It most commonly takes the form of an afternoon tea or reception to which her mother invites all of her friends as well as the younger set The debutante receives with her mother and wears an elaborate frock of light material and color made high in the neck and with elbow sleeves Long white gloves are worn and her hair is more elaborately arranged than it was during her school girl period In fact she is now a full fledged young lady and is dressed accordingly Such a gown may serve later as an informal evening gown or if it is made with a detachable yoke it may be worn as a dancing frock or for any evening occasion for which a full evening gown is expected The receiving party at an afternoon function generally includes near relatives of the debutante and a number of her intimate girl friends are asked to assist in various ways These receive with her and her mother in the early part of the afternoon and later assist at the tea table or mingle among the guests The ladies assisting do not wear hats and the young girls in the party are gowned much like the debutante except that their gowns may be less elaborate if they choose and they do not carry flowers A popular girl or one with many family connections may count on a good many floral offerings on the occasion of her coming out party These are scattered about the room either left in bunches or arranged in vases One large bunch she generally carries in her left hand and it is a wise girl who avoids singling out anyone of her men friends by carrying his flowers A gift from her father or brother or the flowers sent by some friend of the family is the better choice The success a girl makes during her first year in society depends more on her general popularity than on the devotion of any one man Afternoon Reception For an afternoon reception light refreshments consisting of tea coffee chocolate perhaps a light claret cup with cakes and delicate sandwiches are sufficient and these are set out on a long table in a room adjoining the reception parlors If a large number of guests are expected it is necessary to have a maid or two in attendance to remove cups and saucers keep the tea urn replenished with hot water and to bring additional cakes and sandwiches if the supply on the table is in danger of running short Two women friends are generally asked to preside at the refreshment table one at each end to pour tea and chocolate and as this task is an arduous one and much of the success of the entertainment depends on its being well done it is advisable to relieve the ladies in charge during the afternoon This however like every other feature of the entertainment should be arranged beforehand The charm of an afternoon reception lies in its apparent informality but every detail should be considered in advance and all contingencies provided for The debutante and especially her mother should be relieved from all such responsibilities before the guests begin to come The mother s duties consist in welcoming her guests and presenting her daughter to them If many people are arriving the guests are quickly passed on to some one of the ladies assisting whose duty it is to see that they meet some of those who are already in the room and are eventually asked to the tea table A part of the receiving party and certainly the hostess and her daughter should remain together in a place where they may be easily found as the guests enter the room No more sympathetic act of friendship can be shown a debutante than to contribute toward the success of her party Girls who are asked to assist should remember that their first duty is not to entertain their own friends who may happen to be present but to see that everyone is welcome and that especially those who are not acquainted with many in the room have an opportunity to become so Anyone asked to assist at a function of this sort is in a sense a hostess and it is quite within her province to enter into conversation with any unoccupied guest whether she has been introduced or not The usual hours for an afternoon tea are from four to six but in the case of a coming out reception the hour is often prolonged to seven so as to allow more men to be present than would be the case if the time were restricted to the early afternoon In these busy days few men are at liberty to make afternoon calls and it is always a compliment to a girl if her tea includes a sprinkling of black coats Whatever hours are decided on they should be engraved on the cards sent out two weeks before the tea These are of the form and size of an ordinary visiting card and include the daughter s name below that of her mother s If she is the eldest unmarried daughter or the only girl in the family the card reads as follows missus Geo Baker Blank Miss Blank December nine nineteen eleven four to seven o clock The daughter s given name is only used in case she has an older unmarried sister Ball and Evening Reception A more elaborate form of coming out party consists of a ball or of an evening reception followed by dancing and in this case the card contains the word Dancing below the date of the entertainment and the hours at which it is given Few homes are large enough to provide for even a small dance and so a party of this sort is generally given at a hotel The guests as well as the receiving party wear evening gowns without hats and men are expected to come in full evening clothes which means the long tailed coats and not the popular Tuxedo white gloves and although this is not obligatory white waistcoats After a girl has been introduced into society she has her individual visiting cards makes her own calls and is allowed to receive her own friends Social customs differ with locality and the chaperon is less customary in the West than in the East In many cities girls are allowed to go to the theater and to evening parties with a man friend without a married woman being included in the party A wise girl however is careful that any man she meets shall be introduced as soon as possible to some older member of her family and to introduce a young man calling for the first time to either her mother or father Also when she accepts an invitation to an evening s entertainment she insists that her escort shall call for her at her own home and bring her directly home at the close of it Dining or supping at a restaurant alone with a young man is sure to expose a girl to criticism A Woman s Lunch There are many pleasant forms of entertainment offered to a young girl entering society in which men are not included and the most popular of these is a woman s lunch This is a favorite form of entertainment for a young married woman to give in honor of some girl friend who has just come out in society or whose engagement has just been announced One o clock or half after is the usual hour and the meal is served in courses and is as elaborate as the household resources may allow The decorations of the table are important and three courses are sufficient if they are carefully arranged Handsome street costumes are worn for a function of this sort and the guest of honor if there is one dresses as the others do Outer wraps are left in the hall or in a room put aside for this purpose and as a rule hats are retained and gloves removed when the guests sit down at table The custom of wearing a hat during lunch is not an arbitrary one and it is not universal In France for example where social customs are most carefully observed it is the custom to wear handsome afternoon gowns if invited for the noon meal and to remove hats The noon meal there is a social function and certain formalities are observed In London on the contrary no matter if a number of guests are expected lunch is an informal occasion and women dress for lunch as they would for an afternoon tea Hats are worn and women are prepared to rush off afterwards to meet other engagements The English custom prevails now in the large cities in America and moreover women seem disinclined to remove their hats after they are once dressed for the round of the day s social obligations It is simpler and really quite conventional to leave the wearing of hats to the individual The hostess should ask her guest if she wishes to take her hat off or retain it and she can at the same time intimate to her guest if she is a stranger in the town what the others will probably do in this connection True hospitality on the part of the hostess is to make her guests at ease and true politeness on the part of the visitor is to conform to the rules governing the community that she is visiting PROPER APPAREL FOR MEN American gentlemen are no longer dependent on English tailors or on English fashions as they were some years ago The American type of physique is a distinct one and London tailors have never been able to fit American men as well as they do their own clients Moreover social life is so different in the United States from what it is in England that men really need different clothes Practically all American men are business men for the working hours of the day and few of them have any time or inclination for anything save business clothes while daylight lasts For dinner or for the evening what are generally called evening clothes are permissible and in fact obligatory in large cities for anything beyond the most informal home functions For the evening there is the informal and formal dress suit The former consists of the long tailed coat worn with either a white or black waistcoat For a dancing party or formal dinner the white waistcoat is generally preferred and if it is worn it must be accompanied by a white lawn tie A made up bow is considered incorrect The accompaniments to a suit of this sort are patent leather shoes and white kid gloves if dancing is a part of the evening programme The informal evening suit includes the shorter dinner jacket or Tuxedo as it was formerly called and strictly speaking this is only considered proper for the club or for parties where ladies are not expected to be present However men who commonly dress for dinner in the home circle generally prefer the dinner jacket to the long coat and well dressed men are often seen wearing it at small dinner parties at the theater or at any informal evening event This coat is always worn with a black tie and waistcoat and it is not a suitable apparel for a dance or any large formal evening affair The correct dress for a daytime wedding is a black frock coat with light trousers light fancy waistcoat and gray gloves and gray Ascot or four in hand tie and the frock coat with black waistcoat proper for church or when making afternoon calls Many young men are adopting for afternoon wear the English morning suit which consists of a cutaway coat with trousers and waistcoat to match and made of some other color save black WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES First Anniversary Cotton Wedding Second Anniversary Paper Wedding Third Anniversary

Anniversary Diamond Wedding HOW TO SELECT COLORS The Natural Laws of Tints Tones Shades and Hues Some combinations of color are pleasing to the eye and some are discordant The reasons for this are based on natural laws and are explained in a very simple manner in a learned article by doctor W K Carr which originally appeared in Shop Notes Quarterly Impressions continue upon the retina of the eye says doctor Carr about one sixth of a second after the object has been moved For this reason a point of light or flame whirled swiftly around appears as a continuous ring Or take a piece or red ribbon place it on white paper look intently at it for thirty seconds and suddenly remove the ribbon The portion of the paper which was covered by the ribbon will then appear green The explanation is that the color sensation in the eye is caused by the almost unthinkably rapid whirling of electrons around their atoms and that the retina becoming fatigued by the vibration of the red is therefore less sensitive to them When the ribbon is suddenly removed the eye sees not the blue yellow and red which produce the white surface of the paper but because of the fatigue of the eye to the red it sees only the blue and yellow constituents of the white light But blue and yellow produce green hence the tendency at the eye to see the complementary of a color This may be referred to as the successive contrast of colors Colors for

none	none	s and for Brunettes Now for a practical application of this knowledge The hair of the blond is a mixture of red yellow and brown As a rule the skin is lighter that is it contains not so much orange and the tinges of red are lighter Nature therefore very properly made the blond s eyes blue since the blue is complementary to the orange of her hair The brunette s skin on the other hand has more orange in it and hence a color favorable to one would not be becoming to the other What would be the effect of green upon a complexion deficient in red It would certainly heighten the rose tints in the cheeks but the greatest care should be exercised in the selection of the proper shade of green because the brunette s complexion contains a great deal of orange and the green acting upon the red of the orange could readily produce a brick dust appearance Green therefore is a risky color for a brunette and so is violet which would neutralize the yellow of the orange and heighten the red But if the orange complexion had more yellow than red then the association of violet would produce pallor Yellow of course is her color since its complementary violet neutralizes the yellow of the orange complexion and leaves the red But with the yellow haired blond the conditions are very different The complementary of blue is orange which improves the hair and freshens the light flesh tints A blond therefore can wear blue just as a brunette can wear yellow In arranging flowers the same law holds Complementary colors should be placed side by side blue with orange yellow with violet red and rose with green leaves And anyone who successfully selects his wall paper and house furnishings is drawing unconsciously perhaps on an intuitive knowledge of these fundamental facts Dark papers are bad especially in rooms with a northern exposure because they absorb too much light The complementaries of red and violet are exceedingly trying to most complexions and orange and orange yellow are fatiguing to the eye The most pleasing effects are to be had with yellow light blue and light green for the latter freshens the red in pale skins and the blue heightens blond complexions and goes well with gilding and with mahogany and cherry furniture COLOR CONTRAST AND HARMONY The following tables will be found useful in selecting colors for dress decoration or any other purpose in which the proper application of the true laws of contrast and harmony in color is desirable Contrasts in Color Yellow contrasts with Purple russet and auburn Red contrasts with Green olive and drab Blue

is the result of chemical action produced by decomposition of food Acids found in some fruits will cause decay if allowed to remain in contact with the teeth Then there are the natural mouth acids which although not strong are none the less effective if allowed to remain long enough around the teeth Microscopical examinations have shown that the secretions of almost every person s month contain more or less vegetable and animal life that will withstand the application of acids and astringents and will only succumb to alkalies A dentifrice or mouth wash should be alkaline Toothache Toothache is not always due to an exposed nerve for in the majority of teeth extracted because they are painful the nerve is dead Inflammation is often the cause of the trouble A toothache due to inflammation is a steady aggravating pain overspreading the affected side of the face sometimes even the neck and shoulder As there is no nerve to kill in a case of this kind the tooth should be treated until cured or removed upon the first symptom of trouble Its extraction would be unattended by any danger and would afford welcome relief Tartar a creamy calcareous deposit supposed to be from the saliva will sometimes cause toothache It accumulates around the necks of the teeth and eventually becomes hard and dark colored It also causes foul breath and loosens the gums from the teeth causing them to present an unsightly appearance The Teeth of Children Children have twenty temporary teeth which begin making their appearance about the sixth or seventh month The time varies in different children This is the most dangerous and troublesome period of the child s existence and every parent will do well to consult a reputable dentist About the second or third year the temporary teeth are fully developed They require the same care to preserve them as is exercised toward the permanent set About the sixth year or soon after four permanent molars or double teeth make their appearance Some parents mistakenly suppose these belong to the first set It is a serious error They are permanent teeth and if lost will be lost forever No teeth that come after the sixth year are ever shed Let every parent remember this At twelve years the second set is usually complete with the exception of the wisdom teeth which appear anywhere from the eighteenth to the twenty fourth year When the second set is coming in the beauty and character of the child s countenance is completed or forever spoiled Everything depends upon proper care at this time to see that the teeth come with regularity and are not crowded together The teeth cannot have too much room When a little separated they are less liable to decay Dentifrices Useful and Injurious The habit of caring for the teeth daily and if possible after each meal should be established early in life Those who have neglected to do so should lose no time in consulting a reputable dentist and then persistently caring for their teeth day by day Children especially should be taught to use the tooth brush and some reliable dentifrice The more pleasant the preparation the easier it will be to teach them its daily use A fragrant refreshing liquid is recommended as it is a mouth wash as well as a tooth cleanser The habit thus formed neglected for even a single day will make the mouth feel decidedly uncomfortable Cleansing the Teeth Preparations for cleansing the teeth and purifying the mouth should be free from all acids and should be saponaceous or soapy containing as one of the principal ingredients an alkali to neutralize the acids and destroy the animal and vegetable parasites which as the microscope would show us are in the secretions of almost every person s mouth A finely triturated powder having slight abrasive properties but free from dangerous grit should be used as the complement of a liquid One way to use both is to pour on the wet brush or into the palm of the hand a sufficient quantity of powder and moisten it with the liquid Occasionally the powder or the liquid alone could be employed Be careful to use a liquid and powder of established reputation Beware of thy teeth Take good care of thy teeth And they will take good care of thee THE PERFECT FEMALE FIGURE According to the Chicago Tribune Miss Helen Loewe a student at the Chicago Art Institute is credited by art critics with closely

Boston speaking of men s complexions arrives at the following conclusions There are of course exceptions to all rules As a general rule the blonds are inconstant They change their minds too often They get angry one moment and forgive the next They are impulsive and when they do commit crimes they are done on the impulse of the moment A blond radiates his personality about him The brunette on the other hand as a rule likes to concentrate on one subject He is a specialist He prefers his home and family and his pleasures are more often lectures and kindred entertainments than those of a lighter order He learns slowly but he retains what he knows far better than does the blond HOW THE BABY S MIND DEVELOPS In his book on The Development of the Intellect mister H W Brown presents a conspectus of the observations of Prof Preyer on the mind of the child which shows chronologically the gradual development of the senses intellect and will of the growing child and presents in a condensed form the result of a great number of careful observations It is recorded that sensibility to light touch temperature smell and taste are present on the first day of infant life Hearing therefore is the only special sense which is not active at this time The child hears by the third or fourth day Taste and smell are senses at the first most active but they are differentiated General organic sensations of well being or discomfiture are felt from the first but pain and pleasure as mental states are not noted till at or near the second month The first sign of speech in the shape of utterance of consonant sounds is heard about the end of the second month these consonants being generally m r g or t 
982-133222-0000	train-other-500	All the movements of the eyes become company ordinate by the fourth month and by this time the child begins to have the
982-133222-0001	train-other-500	feeling of self that is he looks at his own hands and looks at himself in the mirror The study of the child s mind during the first year shows conclusively that ideas develop and reasoning processes occur before there is any knowledge of words or of language
982-133222-0002	train-other-500	though it may be assumed that the child thinks in symbols visual or auditory which are clumsy equivalents for words By the end of the year the child begins to express itself by sounds that is speech begins

before lathering especially if the beard is hard Have the lather very soapy thin enough to spread easily yet thick enough so it won t drop Rub well into the face with the brush then with the fingers The longer you lather and the more you rub the easier the shave The hair usually grows downward Shave with the grain not against it Use a sliding motion as well as downward If you get a nick wash with cold water Rubbing the cut with a piece of lump alum will stop the bleeding at once and help to heal Hold the razor properly Lay it as flat as possible the back of razor nearly touching the skin Have it under easy control Don t grab it an easy position means an easy shave A poor strop will spoil the best razor ever made To buy a good razor and a cheap strop is pour economy If you prefer a swing strop pull it as tightly as you can Better use a stiff strop cushion or solid if in doubt A serious mistake made by a number of self shavers is to hold the strop loose This bends the invisible teeth and rounds the edge Strop your razor before and after shaving This keeps the edge free from rust Dip your razor in hot water before stropping and shaving This dissolves the accumulation in the invisible teeth Press as hard as you like on the back of the blade but very lightly on the edge As you reach the end of the strop turn the razor on the back of the blade to strop the other side pulling toward you Keep rust away from your strop and remember that a cut in the strop will ruin your razor Don t use a strop that is cut FACTS TO SETTLE ARGUMENTS Telephone invented eighteen sixty

1046_133224_000001_000000	train-clean-360	This idea was first formulated by mister Henry George in eighteen seventy nine and has grown steadily in favor 
none	none	Single tax men assert as a fundamental principle that all men are equally entitled to the use of the earth therefore no one should be allowed to hold valuable land without paying to the community the value of the privilege 
1046_133224_000001_000002	train-clean-360	They hold that this is the only rightful source of public revenue and they would therefore abolish all taxation local state and national except a tax upon the rental value of land exclusive of its improvements the revenue thus raised to be divided among local state and general governments as the revenue from certain direct taxes is now divided between local and state governments 
1046_133224_000002_000000	train-clean-360	The single tax would not fall on all land but only on valuable land and on that in proportion to its value 
1046_133224_000002_000001	train-clean-360	It would thus be a tax not on use or improvements but on ownership of land taking what would otherwise go to the landlord as owner 
1046_133224_000003_000000	train-clean-360	In accordance with the principle that all men are equally entitled to the use of the earth they would solve the transportation problem by public ownership and control of all highways including the roadbeds of railroads leaving their use equally free to all 
none	none	The single tax system would they claim dispense with a horde of tax gatherers simplify government and greatly reduce its cost give us with all the world that absolute free trade which now exists between the States of the Union abolish all taxes on private issues of money take the weight of taxation from agricultural districts where land has little or no value apart from improvements and put it upon valuable land such as city lots and mineral deposits 
1046_133224_000004_000001	train-clean-360	It would call upon men to contribute for public expenses in proportion to the natural opportunities they monopolize and make it unprofitable for speculators to hold land unused or only partly used thus opening to labor unlimited fields of employment solving the labor problem and abolishing involuntary poverty

1046_133224_000006_000000	train-clean-360	A Compend of the General Claims Made by Professional Hypnotists 
none	none	Animal magnetism is the nerve force of all human and animal bodies and is common to every person in a greater or less degree 
1046_133224_000007_000001	train-clean-360	It may be transmitted from one person to another 
1046_133224_000007_000002	train-clean-360	The transmitting force is the concentrated effort of will power which sends the magnetic current through the nerves of the operator to the different parts of the body of his subject 
none	none	It may be transmitted by and through the eyes as well as the finger tips and the application of the whole open hands to different regions of the body of the subject as well as to the mind The effect of this force upon the subject will depend very much upon the health mental capacity and general character of the operator 
1046_133224_000007_000004	train-clean-360	Its action in general should be soothing and quieting upon the nervous system stimulating to the circulation of the blood the brain and other vital organs of the body of the subject 
1046_133224_000007_000005	train-clean-360	It is the use and application of this power or force that constitutes hypnotism 
none	none	Magnetism is a quality that inheres in every human being and it may be cultivated like any other physical or mental force of which men and women are constituted 
1046_133224_000008_000001	train-clean-360	From the intelligent operator using it to overcome disease a patient experiences a soothing influence that causes a relaxation of the muscles followed by a pleasant drowsy feeling which soon terminates in refreshing sleep 
none	none	On waking the patient feels rested all his troubles have vanished from consciousness and he is as if he had a new lease of life In the true hypnotic condition when a patient voluntarily submits to the operator any attempt to make suggestions against the interests of the patient can invariably be frustrated by the patient Self preservation is the first law of nature and some of the best known operators who have recorded their experiments assert that suggestions not in accord with the best interest of the patient could not be carried out 
1046_133224_000009_000001	train-clean-360	No one was ever induced to commit any crime under hypnosis that could not have been induced to do the same thing much easier without hypnosis 
1046_133224_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The hypnotic state is a condition of mind that extends from a comparatively wakeful state with slight drowsiness to complete somnambulism no two subjects as a rule ever presenting the same characteristics 
1046_133224_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The operator to be successful must have control of his own mind be in perfect health and have the ability to keep his mind concentrated upon the object he desires to accomplish with his subject 
1046_133224_000012_000000	train-clean-360	HOW TO CARE FOR A PIANO By William H Damon
1046_133224_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The most important thing in the preservation of a piano is to avoid atmospheric changes and extremes and sudden changes of temperature Where the summer condition of the atmosphere is damp all precautions possible should be taken to avoid an entirely dry condition in winter such as that given by steam or furnace heat 
none	none	In all cases should the air in the home contain moisture enough to permit a heavy frost on the windows in zero weather The absence of frost under such conditions is positive proof of an entirely dry atmosphere and this is a piano s most dangerous enemy causing the sounding board to crack shrinking up the bridges and consequently putting the piano seriously out of tune also causing an undue dryness in all the action parts and often a loosening of the glue joints thus producing clicks and rattles To obviate this difficulty is by no means an easy task and will require considerable attention Permit all the fresh air possible during winter being careful to keep the piano out of cold drafts as this will cause a sudden contraction of the varnish and cause it to check or crack 
1046_133224_000013_000005	train-clean-360	Plants in the room are desirable and vessels of water of any kind will be of assistance 
1046_133224_000013_000006	train-clean-360	The most potent means of avoiding extreme dryness is to place a single loaf bread pan half full of water in the lower part of the piano taking out the lower panel and placing it on either side of the pedals inside 
none	none	This should be refilled about once a month during artificial heat care being taken to remove the vessel as soon as the heat is discontinued in the spring 
1046_133224_000013_000008	train-clean-360	In cases where stove heat is used these precautions are not necessary 
1046_133224_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The action of a piano like any other delicate piece of machinery should be carefully examined and if necessary adjusted each time it is tuned 
1046_133224_000014_000001	train-clean-360	The hammers need occasional and careful attention to preserve original tone quality and elasticity 
none	none	Never allow the piano to be beaten or played hard upon 
1046_133224_000014_000003	train-clean-360	This is ruinous to both the action and tuning 
1046_133224_000014_000004	train-clean-360	When not in use the music rack and top should be closed to exclude dust 
1046_133224_000014_000005	train-clean-360	The keyboard need never be closed as the ivory needs both light and ventilation and will eventually turn yellow unless left open 
1046_133224_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The case demands careful treatment to preserve its beauty and polish Never use anything other than a soft piece of cotton cloth or cheese cloth to dust it with 
1046_133224_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Never wipe it with a dry chamois skin or silk cloth 
1046_133224_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Silk is not as soft as cotton and will scratch 
1046_133224_000015_000003	train-clean-360	A dry chamois skin picks up the dust and grit and gradually scours off the fine finish 
1046_133224_000015_000004	train-clean-360	In dusting never use a feather duster nor rub the piano hard with anything 
1046_133224_000015_000005	train-clean-360	The dust should be whipped off and not rubbed into the varnish 
1046_133224_000015_000006	train-clean-360	If the piano is dingy smoky or dirty looking it should be washed carefully with lukewarm water with a little ammonia in it to soften it 
1046_133224_000015_000007	train-clean-360	Never use soap 
1046_133224_000015_000008	train-clean-360	Use nothing but a small soft sponge and a chamois skin 
1046_133224_000015_000009	train-clean-360	Wipe over a small part at a time with the sponge following quickly with the wet chamois skin wrung out of the same water This will dry it immediately and leave it as beautiful and clean as new Never use patent polishes 
1046_133224_000015_000010	train-clean-360	If your piano needs polishing employ a competent polisher to give it a hand rubbing friction polish

1046_133224_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Scald this with new milk heated to the boiling point and mix to the thickness of mush 
1046_133224_000020_000002	train-clean-360	This can be made in a cup 
none	none	Wrap in a clean cloth and put in a warm place overnight
1046_133224_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 In the morning when all is ready take a one gallon stone jar and into this put one scant cupful of new milk 
1046_133224_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Add a level teaspoonful of salt and one of sugar 
1046_133224_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Scald this with three cupfuls of water heated to the boiling point 
1046_133224_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Reduce to a temperature of one hundred and eight degrees with cold water using a milk thermometer to enable you to get exactly the right temperature 
none	none	Then add flour and mix to a good batter after the batter is made mix in your starter that was made the night before Cover the stone jar with a plate and put the jar in a large kettle of water and keep this water at a temperature of one hundred and eight degrees until the sponge rises 
1046_133224_000021_000005	train-clean-360	It should rise at least an inch and a half 
1046_133224_000021_000006	train-clean-360	When it has raised mix to a stiff dough make into loaves and put into pans 
1046_133224_000021_000007	train-clean-360	Do not let the heat get out of the dough while working Grease the loaves well on top and set your bread where it will be warm and rise 
1046_133224_000021_000008	train-clean-360	After the loaves rise bake in a medium oven for one hour and ten minutes 
1046_133224_000021_000009	train-clean-360	When you take the loaves from the oven wrap them in a bread cloth

1046_133225_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The stub of your check book will furnish a permanent memorandum and when the check is canceled and returned to you by the bank it is an indisputable evidence that the debt has been paid or that the remittance has been made 
none	none	The making of a check is a simple matter but even the best business men make mistakes sometimes which are as difficult to remedy as they are easy to avoid The hints here given and the facsimiles of checks printed in illustration will repay careful study
1046_133225_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Illustration A Check Properly Drawn 
1046_133225_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The name and amount are against the left side of their fields 
1046_133225_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The first facsimile shows a check properly made 
1046_133225_000012_000001	train-clean-360	It will be seen in the first place that this check is written very plainly and that there is no room for the insertion of extra figures or words 
1046_133225_000012_000002	train-clean-360	The writing of the amount commences as nearly as possible to the extreme left of the check The figures are written close together and there is no space between the first figure and the dollar mark 
none	none	All erasures in checks should be avoided 
1046_133225_000013_000001	train-clean-360	If you have made a mistake tear a blank check from the back of your check book and use that in place of the one spoiled 
1046_133225_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Some business men allow their clerks to fill out checks on the typewriter 
1046_133225_000014_000001	train-clean-360	This is ill advised for two reasons First it is much easier to alter a typewritten check than one filled in with a pen in the second place a teller in passing on the genuineness of a check takes into consideration the character of the handwriting in the body of the check as well as in the signature 
1046_133225_000014_000002	train-clean-360	The typewritten characters offer no clue to individuality 
1046_133225_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Never mail a check drawn to Bearer Remember that if your check is made payable to Bearer or to John Smith or Bearer it may be cashed by anybody who happens to have it 
none	none	Unless it is for a large amount the paying teller of your bank will look only to see whether your signature is correct and that being right the bank cannot be held responsible if the check should have come into the wrong hands A check drawn to order can be cashed only when the person to whose order it has been drawn has indorsed it by writing his or her name on the back and the bank will be responsible for the correctness of the indorsement 
1046_133225_000017_000000	train-clean-360	If you make your check payable say to William Armstrong or order nobody but William Armstrong or some one to whom he indorses the check can collect the amount and if through fraud or otherwise some one not entitled to it gets the money which the check calls for the responsibility is not yours but the bank s 
1046_133225_000017_000001	train-clean-360	It is for that reason that bankers and business men use such great care in accepting checks 
1046_133225_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Illustration A Check Carelessly Drawn 
1046_133225_000018_000001	train-clean-360	The text and numbers for the amount is in the center of their fields leaving of space for extra text 
1046_133225_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Illustration The Same Check Raised 
none	none	The amount has been changed from One Hundred one hundred point zero to Eighty One Hundred eight thousand one hundred dollars For the same reason you should never accept a check from anybody whom you do not know as responsible and you should not be surprised or angered if some one else should hesitate to take a check from you 
1046_133225_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Checks or drafts received by you should be deposited as soon as possible 
1046_133225_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Should you receive a check for a considerable amount and have no convenient bank account you should go to the bank on which the check is drawn and have the cashier certify it by stamping Accepted or Certified across the face over his signature 
1046_133225_000021_000002	train-clean-360	That formality makes the paper as good as money so long as the bank accepting it is solvent 
none	none	It sometimes happens that a check drawn in good faith by a responsible party is withheld so long by the person receiving it that there is no money to the account when the check is finally presented 
1046_133225_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Paying Notes and Acceptances 
none	none	Make your notes and accepted drafts payable at the bank where you do business 
1046_133225_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Whether it or other banks hold them for collection they will be presented to your bank when due 
none	none	Pay your notes et cetera on the day they fall due and early in the day if convenient or leave a check for the amount with your bank on the day before your paper matures 
1046_133225_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Banks will not pay notes or drafts without instructions 
none	none	Keep a careful record of the days of maturity of all your paper Banks usually notify all payers a few days beforehand when their paper matures but this is only courtesy on their part and not an obligation Exchange
1046_133225_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Exchange means funds in other cities made available by bankers drafts on such places 
1046_133225_000028_000001	train-clean-360	These drafts afford the safest and cheapest means for remitting money 
1046_133225_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Drafts on New York are worth their face value practically all over the United States in settlement of accounts 
1046_133225_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Collections 
1046_133225_000030_000000	train-clean-360	A draft is sometimes the most convenient form for collecting an account The prevalence of the custom is due to the fact that most men will wait to be asked to pay a debt 
1046_133225_000030_000001	train-clean-360	If a draft is a time draft it is accepted by the person on whom it is drawn by writing his name and date across the face 
1046_133225_000030_000002	train-clean-360	This makes it practically a note to be paid at maturity 
none	none	Notes or drafts that you desire to have collected for you by your bank should be left at the bank several days before they are due so as to give ample time to notify the payers 
1046_133225_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Borrowing 
1046_133225_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Banks are always willing to loan their funds to responsible persons within reasonable limits 
1046_133225_000033_000001	train-clean-360	That is what they exist for 
none	none	There is of course a limit to the amount a bank may loan even on the best known security but the customer of the bank is entitled to and will receive the first consideration 
1046_133225_000034_000000	train-clean-360	The customer should not hesitate when occasion requires to offer to the bank for discount such paper as may come into his hands in the course of business if in his opinion the paper is good 
1046_133225_000034_000001	train-clean-360	At the same time he should not be offended if his bank refuses to take it even without giving reasons 
1046_133225_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Indorsing Checks et cetera 
none	none	When depositing checks drafts et cetera see that they are dated properly and that the written amounts and figures correspond 
1046_133225_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The proper way to indorse a check or draft this also applies to notes and other negotiable paper is to write your name upon the back about one inch from the top 
none	none	The proper end may be determined in this way As you read the check holding one end in each hand draw the right hand toward you and turn the check over 
1046_133225_000036_000003	train-clean-360	The end which is then farthest from you is the top 
1046_133225_000036_000004	train-clean-360	If however the check draft or note has already been indorsed by another person you should write your name directly under the other indorsement even if that is on the wrong end 
1046_133225_000036_000005	train-clean-360	If your own name on the face of the check draft or note is misspelled or has the wrong initials but if the paper is clearly intended for you you should first write your name as it appears on the face and under it your regular signature 
1046_133225_000036_000006	train-clean-360	You should indorse every check you deposit even though it be payable to bearer 
1046_133225_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Mistakes in Banking 
none	none	mister Samuel Woods a member of the American Institute of Bank Clerks recently contributed to Munsey s Magazine an interesting article on the subject of Mistakes in Banking From this we are permitted by the courtesy of the publishers of Munsey s to reproduce two of the facsimiles shown 
1046_133225_000039_000000	train-clean-360	One wrong word or figure or letter the right thing in the wrong way or the wrong place the scratch of an eraser or the alteration of a word or any one of these things in the making or cashing of a check is liable to become as expensive as a racing automobile 
1046_133225_000040_000000	train-clean-360	The paying teller of a bank says mister Woods must keep his eyes open for new dangers as well as old ones 
1046_133225_000040_000001	train-clean-360	The cleverest crooks in the country are pitting their brains against his 
1046_133225_000040_000002	train-clean-360	After he has learned the proper guard for all the well known tricks and forgeries it is still possible that an entirely new combination may leave him minus cash and plus experience 
1046_133225_000041_000000	train-clean-360	But it is not the unique and novel swindle that is most dangerous either to a bank or an individual 
1046_133225_000041_000001	train-clean-360	It is the simple ordinary mistake or the time worn trick that makes continuous trouble 
1046_133225_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Apparently every new generation contains a number of dishonest people who lay the same traps and a number of careless people who fall into these traps in the same old way 
1046_133225_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Check Raising Made Easy 
1046_133225_000043_000000	train-clean-360	One of the first lessons for instance that a depositor should learn before he is qualified to own a check book is to commence writing the amount as near as possible to the extreme left of the check 
1046_133225_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Those who forget this are often reminded of it in a costly way 
1046_133225_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Some one raises their checks by writing another figure in front of the proper amount Five hundred might be raised to twenty five hundred in this way even by an unskilled forger 
1046_133225_000044_000000	train-clean-360	The highest court has recently decided that a bank cannot be held responsible when it pays a raised check if the maker of the check failed in the first place to write it out correctly 
none	none	The treasurer of the Bath Electric Company of Bath Maine had written a check for one hundred dollars which was raised to eighty one hundred dollars and cashed The court held that the company and not the bank should lose the eight thousand dollars because of the gross carelessness in drawing up the check Facsimiles showing the check as originally written and as it looked when paid are here reproduced 
1046_133225_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Altered Words and Figures 
1046_133225_000046_000000	train-clean-360	The altered check is the bane of the paying teller s profession and it is the general practice in conservative banks to accept no checks or other paper which shows signs of erasure or alteration in either words or figures

224_133227_000032_000000	train-clean-360	THEOSOPHY 
none	none	Much is said nowadays about theosophy which is really but another name for mysticism It is not a philosophy for it will have nothing to do with philosophical methods it might be called a religion though it has never had a following large enough to make a very strong impression on the world s religious history 
224_133227_000033_000002	train-clean-360	The name is from the Greek word theosophia divine wisdom and the object of theosophical study is professedly to understand the nature of divine things 
none	none	It differs however from both philosophy and theology even when these have the same object of investigation For in seeking to learn the divine nature and attributes philosophy employs the methods and principles of natural reasoning theology uses these adding to them certain principles derived from revelation Theosophy on the other hand professes to exclude all reasoning processes as imperfect and to derive its knowledge from direct communication with God himself It does not therefore accept the truths of recorded revelation as immutable but as subject to modification by later and personal revelations The theosophical idea has had followers from the earliest times 
224_133227_000033_000008	train-clean-360	Since the Christian era we may class among theosophists such sects as Neo Platonists the Hesychasts of the Greek Church the Mystics of mediaeval times and in later times the disciples of Paracelsus Thalhauser Bohme Swedenborg and others 
none	none	Recently a small sect has arisen which has taken the name of Theosophists Its leader was an English gentleman who had become fascinated with the doctrine of Buddhism Taking a few of his followers to India they have been prosecuting their studies there certain individuals attracting considerable attention by a claim to miraculous powers 
224_133227_000033_000012	train-clean-360	It need hardly be said that the revelations they have claimed to receive have been thus far without element of benefit to the human race 
none	none	THE EVOLUTION THEORY The evolution or development theory declares the universe as it now exists to be the result of a long series of changes which were so far related to each other as to form a series of growths analogous to the evolving of the parts of a growing organism Herbert Spencer defines evolution as a progress from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous from general to special from the simple to the complex elements of life and it is believed that this process can be traced in the formation of worlds in space in the multiplication of types and species among animals and plants in the origin and changes of languages and literature and the arts and also in all the changes of human institutions and society Asserting the general fact of progress in nature the evolution theory shows that the method of this progress has been one by the multiplication of organs and functions two according to a defined unity of plan although with three intervention of transitional forms and four with modifications dependent upon surrounding conditions Ancient writers occasionally seemed to have a glimmering knowledge of the fact of progress in nature but as a theory evolution belongs to the enlightenment of the nineteenth century Leibnitz in the latter part of the seventeenth century first uttered the opinion that the earth was once in a fluid condition and Kant about the middle of the eighteenth century definitely propounded the nebular hypothesis which was enlarged as a theory by the Herschels 
224_133227_000035_000004	train-clean-360	The first writer to suggest the transmutation of species among animals was Buffon about seventeen fifty and other writers followed out the idea 
224_133227_000035_000005	train-clean-360	The eccentric Lord Monboddo was the first to suggest the possible descent of man from the ape about seventeen seventy four In eighteen thirteen doctor W C Wells first proposed to apply the principle of natural selection to the natural history of man and in eighteen twenty two Professor Herbert first asserted the probable transmutation of species of plants 
none	none	In eighteen forty four a book appeared called Vestiges of Creation which though evidently not written by a scientific student yet attracted great attention by its bold and ingenious theories 
224_133227_000035_000007	train-clean-360	The authorship of this book was never revealed until after the death of Robert Chambers a few years since it became known that this publisher whom no one would ever have suspected of holding such heterodox theories had actually written it 
224_133227_000035_000008	train-clean-360	But the two great apostles of the evolution theory were Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer 
none	none	The latter began his great work the First Principles of Philosophy showing the application of evolution in the facts of life in eighteen fifty two In eighteen fifty nine appeared Darwin s Origin of Species The hypothesis of the latter was that different species originated in spontaneous variation and the survival of the fittest through natural selection and the struggle for existence This theory was further elaborated and applied by Spencer Darwin Huxley and other writers in Europe and America and though to day by no means all the ideas upheld by these early advocates of the theory are still accepted evolution as a principle is now acknowledged by nearly all scientists 
224_133227_000035_000012	train-clean-360	It is taken to be an established fact in nature a valid induction from man s knowledge of natural order 
224_133227_000036_000000	train-clean-360	THE ENGLISH SPARROW

none	none	The question sometimes arises whether it man is entitled to vote at an election held on the day preceding the twenty first anniversary of his birth Blackstone in his Commentaries book one page four hundred sixty three says Full age in male or female is twenty one years which age is completed on the day preceding the anniversary of a person s birth who till that time is an infant and so styled in law The late Chief Justice Sharswood in his edition of Blackstone s Commentaries quotes Christian s note on the above as follows If he is born on the sixteenth day of February sixteen oh eight he is of age to do any legal act on the morning of the fifteenth of February sixteen twenty nine though he may not have lived twenty one years by nearly forty eight hours The reason assigned is that in law there is no fraction of a day and if the birth were on the last second of one day and the act on the first second of the preceding day twenty one years after then twenty one years would be complete and in the law it is the same whether a thing is done upon one moment of the day or another DREAMS AND THEIR MEANING The Bible speaks of dreams as being sometimes prophetic or suggestive of future events This belief has prevailed in all ages and countries and there are numerous modern examples apparently authenticated which would appear to favor this hypothesis The interpretation of dreams was a part of the business of the soothsayers at the royal courts of Egypt Babylon and other ancient nations Dreams and visions have attracted the attention of mankind of every age and nation It has been claimed by all nations both enlightened and heathen that dreams are spiritual revelations to men so much so that their modes of worship have been founded upon the interpretation of dreams and visions Why should we discard the interpretation of dreams while our mode of worship faith and knowledge of Deity are founded upon the interpretation of the dreams and visions of the prophets and seers of old Dreams vividly impressed upon the mind are sure to be followed by some event We read in the Holy Scripture the revelation of the Deity to His chosen people through the prophet Joel And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and the handmaids in those days will I pour out My Spirit Joel ii twenty eight Both sacred and profane history contain so many examples of the fulfilment of dreams that he who has no faith in them must be very skeptical indeed Hippocrates says that when the body is asleep the soul is awake and transports itself everywhere the body would be able to go knows and sees all that the body could see or know were it awake that it touches all that the body could touch In a word it performs all the actions that the body of a sleeping man could do were he awake A dream to have a significance must occur to the sleeper while in healthy and tranquil sleep Those dreams of which we have not a vivid conception or clear remembrance have no significance Those of which we have a clear remembrance must have formed in the mind in the latter part of the night for up to that time the faculties of the body have been employed in digesting the events of the day DICTIONARY OF DREAMS Note

writing are those in which words are employed that are unsuitable to convey the meaning intended Thus a person wishing to express his intention of going to a given place says I propose going when in fact he purposes going The following affords an amusing illustration of this class of error A venerable matron was speaking of her son who she said was quite stage struck In fact remarked the old lady he is going to a premature performance this evening Considering that most amateur performances are premature it cannot be said that this word was altogether misapplied though evidently the maternal intention was to convey quite another meaning Other errors arise from the substitution of sounds similar to the words which should be employed that is spurious words instead of genuine ones Thus some people say renumerative when they mean remunerative A nurse recommending her mistress to have a perambulator for her child advised her to purchase a preamputator Other errors are occasioned by imperfect knowledge of English grammar thus many people say Between you and I instead of Between you and me And there are numerous other departures from the rules of grammar which will be pointed out hereafter Misuse of the Adjective What beautiful butter What a nice landscape They should say What a beautiful landscape What nice butter Again errors are frequently occasioned by the following causes Mispronunciation of Words Many persons say pronoun ciation instead of pronunciation others say pro nun ce a shun instead of pro nun she a shun Misdivision of Words and Syllables This defect makes the words an ambassador sound like a nambassador or an adder like a nadder Imperfect Enunciation As when a person says hebben for heaven ebber for ever jocholate for chocolate To correct these errors by a systematic course of study would involve a closer application than most persons could afford but the simple and concise rules and hints here given founded upon usage and the authority of scholars will be of great assistance to inquirers ENGLISH GRAMMAR IN A NUTSHELL Who and whom are used in relation to persons and which in relation to things But it was once common to say the man which This should now be avoided It is now usual to say Our Father who art in heaven instead of which art in heaven Whose is however sometimes applied to things as well as to persons We may therefore say The country whose inhabitants are free Thou is employed in solemn discourse and you in common language Ye plural is also used in serious addresses and you in familiar language The uses of the word it are various and very perplexing to the uneducated It is not only used to imply persons but things and even ideas and therefore in speaking or writing its assistance is constantly required The perplexity respecting this word arises from the fact that in using it in the construction of a long sentence sufficient care is not taken to insure that when it is employed it really points out or refers to the object intended For instance It was raining when John set out in his cart to go to market and he was delayed so long that it was over before he arrived Now what is to be understood by this sentence Was the rain over or the market Either or both might be inferred from the construction of the sentence which therefore should be written thus It was raining when John set out in his cart to go to market and he was delayed so long that the market was over before he arrived Rule After writing a sentence always look through it and see that wherever the word it is employed it refers to or carries the mind back to the object which it is intended to point out The general distinction between this and that may be thus defined this denotes an object present or near in time or place that something which is absent These refers in the same manner to present objects while those refers to things that are remote Who changes under certain conditions into whose and whom but that and which always remain the same with the exception of the possessive case as noted above That may be applied to nouns or subjects of all sorts as the girl that went to school the dog that bit me the opinion that he entertains The misuse of these pronouns gives rise to more errors in speaking and writing than any other cause When you wish to distinguish between two or more persons say Which is the happy man not who Which of those ladies to you admire Instead of Whom do you think him to be say Who do you think him to be Whom should I see To whom do you speak Who said so Who gave it to you Of whom did you procure them Who was he Who do men say that I am Self should never be added to his their mine or thine Each is used to denote every individual of a number Every denotes all the individuals of a number Either and or denote an alternative I will take either road at your pleasure I will take this or that Neither means not either and nor means not the other Either is sometimes used for each Two thieves were crucified on either side one Let each esteem others as good as themselves should be Let each esteem others as good as himself There are bodies each of which are so small should be each of which is so small Do not use double superlatives such as most straightest most highest most finest The term worser has gone out of use but lesser is stilt retained The use of such words as chiefest extreamest et cetera has become obsolete because they do not give any superior force to the meanings of the primary words chief extreme et cetera Such expressions as more impossible more indispensable more universal more uncontrollable more unlimited et cetera are objectionable as they really enfeeble the meaning which it is the object of the speaker or writer to strengthen For instance impossible gains no strength by rendering it more impossible This class of error is common with persons who say A great large house A great big animal A little small foot A tiny little hand Here there and where originally denoting place may now by common consent be used to denote other meanings such as There I agree with you Where we differ We find pain where we expected pleasure Here you mistake me Hence whence and thence denoting departure et cetera may be used without the word from The idea of from is included in the word whence therefore it is unnecessary to say From whence Hither thither and whither denoting to a place have generally been superseded by here there and where But there is no good reason why they should not be employed If however they are used it is unnecessary to add the word to because that is implied Whither are you going Where are you going Each of these sentences is complete To say Where are you going to is redundant Two negatives destroy each other and produce an affirmative Nor did he not observe them conveys the idea that he did observe them But negative assertions are allowable His manners are not impolite which implies that his manners are in some degree

printing denotes the syllable upon which the stress or force of the voice should be placed A word may have more than one accent Take as an instance aspiration In uttering the word we give a marked emphasis of the voice upon the first and third syllables and therefore those syllables are said to be accented The first of these accents is less distinguishable than the second upon which we dwell longer therefore the second accent in point of order is called the primary or chief accent of the word When the full accent falls on a vowel that vowel should have a long sound as in vo cal but when it falls on or after a consonant the preceding vowel has a short sound as in hab it To obtain a good knowledge of pronunciation it is advisable for the reader to listen to the examples given by good speakers and by educated persons We learn the pronunciation of words to a great extent by imitation just as birds acquire the notes of other birds which may be near them But it will be very important to bear in mind that there are many words having a double meaning or application and that the difference of meaning is indicated by the difference of the accent Among these words nouns are distinguished from verbs by this means nouns are mostly accented on the first syllabic and verbs on the last Noun signifies name nouns are the names of persons and things as well as of things not material and palpable but of which we have a conception and knowledge such as courage firmness goodness strength and verbs express actions movements et cetera If the word used signifies has been done or is being done or is or is to be done then that word is a verb Thus when we say that anything is an in sult that word is a noun and is accented all the first syllable but when we say he did it to insult another person that word insult implies acting and becomes a verb and should be accented on the last syllable Simple Rules of Pronunciation C before a o and u and in some other situations is a

Goezer Madagascar Zannar Peruvian Puchecammae FACTS ABOUT SPONGES By Albert Hart Sponges belong to the animal kingdom and the principal varieties used commercially are obtained off the coasts of Florida and the West Indies the higher grades are from the Mediterranean Sea and are numerous in variety A sponge in its natural state is a different looking object from what we see in commerce resembling somewhat the appearance of the jelly fish or a mass of liver the entire surface being covered with a thin slimy skin usually of a dark color and perforated to correspond with the apertures of the canals commonly called holes of the sponge The sponge of commerce is in reality only the skeleton of a sponge The composition of this skeleton varies in the different kinds of sponges but in the commercial grades it consists of interwoven horny fibers among and supporting which are epiculae of silicious matter in greater or less numbers and having a variety of forms The fibers consist of a network of fibriles whose softness and elasticity determine the commercial quality of a given sponge The horny framework is perforated externally by very minute pores and by a less number of larger openings These are parts of an interesting double canal system an external and an internal or a centripetal and a centrifugal At the smaller openings on the sponge s surface channels begin which lead into dilated spaces In these in turn channels arise which eventually terminate in the large openings Through these channels or canals definite currents are constantly maintained which are essential to the life of the sponge The currents enter through the small apertures and emerge through the large ones The active part of the sponge that is the part concerned in nutrition and growth is a soft fleshy mass partly filling the meshes and lining the canals It consists largely of cells having different functions some utilized in the formation of the framework some in digestion and others in reproduction Lining the dilated spaces into which different canals lead are cells surmounted by whip like processes The motion of these processes produces and maintains the water currents which carry the minute food products to the digestive cells in the same cavities Sponges multiply by the union of sexual product Certain cells of the fleshy pulp assume the character of ova and others that of spermatozoa Fertilization takes place within the sponge The fertilized eggs which are called larvae pass out into the currents of the water and in the course of twenty four to forty eight hours they settle and become attached to rocks and other hard substances and in time develop into mature sponges The depth of the water in which sponges grow varies from ten to fifty feet in Florida but considerably more in the Mediterranean Sea the finer grades being found in the deepest water having a temperature of fifty to fifty seven degrees DON T BE BURIED ALIVE From time to time we are horrified by learning that some person has been buried alive after assurances have been given of death Under these circumstances the opinion of a rising French physician upon the subject becomes of world wide interest for since the tests which have been in use for years have been found unreliable no means should be left untried to prove beyond a doubt that life is actually extinct before conveying our loved ones to the grave doctor Martinot as reported in the New York Journal asserts that an unfailing test may be made by producing a blister on the hand or foot of the body by holding the flame of a candle to the same for a few seconds or until the blister is formed which will always occur If the blister contains any fluid it is evidence of life and the blister only that produced by an ordinary burn If on the contrary the blister contains only steam it may be asserted that life is extinct The explanation is as follows A corpse says doctor Martinot is nothing more than inert matter under the immediate control of physical laws which cause all liquid heated to a certain temperature to become steam the epidermis is raised the blister produced it breaks with a little noise and the steam escapes But if in spite of all appearances there is any remnant of life the organic mechanism continues to be governed by physiological laws and the blister will contain serous matter as in the case of any ordinary burns The test is as simple as the proof is conclusive Dry blister death Liquid blister life Any one may try it there is no error possible HOW TO SERVE WINE A fine dinner may be spoiled by not serving the proper wine at the proper time and at the proper temperature A white wine Sauterne Riesling Moselle et cetera should be used from the beginning of the meal to the time the roast or game comes on With the roast serve red wine either claret or Burgundy Use sparkling wines after the roast With dessert serve apricot cordial Never serve red wine with soup or fish and never a white wine with game Storage Temperature et cetera Store your wines in the cellar at fifty to sixty degrees All bottles should lie flat so that the cork is continually moist This rule should be specially observed with sparkling wines Sparkling wine should be served ice cold Put the wine on the ice not ice in the wine Serve red wine at only about five degrees cooler than the dining room White wine should be about fifteen degrees cooler than the temperature of the room THE STEPS IN THE GROWTH OF AMERICAN LIBERTY MAGNA CHARTA About seven hundred years ago there was organized a movement which resulted in the great charter of English liberty a movement which foreshadowed the battle of our American forefathers for political independence On the twenty fifth of August twelve thirteen the prelates and Barons tiring of the tyranny and vacillation of King John formed a council and passed measures to secure their rights After two years of contest with many vicissitudes the Barons entered London and the King fled into Hampshire By agreement both parties met at Runnymede on the ninth of June twelve fifteen and after several days debate on June fifteen Magna Charta the Great Charter the glory of England was signed and sealed by the sovereign The Magna Charta is a comprehensive bill of rights and though crude in form and with many clauses of merely local value its spirit still lives and will live Clear and prominent we find the motto No tax without representation The original document is in Latin and contains sixty one articles of which the thirty ninth and fortieth embodying the very marrow of our own State constitutions are here given as translated in the English statutes thirty nine No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or be disseised of his freehold or liberties or free customs or be otherwise destroped damaged nor will be press upon him nor seize upon him condemn him but by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land forty We will sell to no man we will not deny or defer to any man either right or justice The Great Charter recognizes a popular tribunal as a check on the official judges and may be looked upon as the foundation of the writ of Habeas Corpus It provides that no one is to be condemned on rumor or suspicion but only on the evidence of witnesses It affords protection against excessive emercements illegal distresses and various processes for debts and service due to the crown Fines are in all cases to be proportionate to the magnitude of the offense and even the villein or rustic is not to be deprived of his necessary chattels There are provisions regarding the forfeiture of land for felony The testamentary power of the subject is recognized over part of his personal estate and the rest to be divided between his widow and children The independence of the church is also provided for These are the most important features of the Great Charter which exacted by men with arms in their hands from a resisting king occupies so conspicuous a place in history which establishes the supremacy of the law of England over the will of the monarch and which still forms the basis of English liberties THE MECKLENBURG DECLARATION More than a year before the signing of the Declaration of Independence a document was drawn up that was almost a model in phraseology and sentiment of the great charter of American freedom There are various accounts of this matter but the most trustworthy is this At a public meeting of the residents of Mecklenburg County North Carolina held at Charlotte on the twentieth of May seventeen seventy five it was Resolved That whenever directly or indirectly abetted or in any way form or manner countenanced the unchartered and dangerous invasion of our rights as claimed by Great Britain is an enemy to our country to America and to the inherent and inalienable rights of man Resolved That we the citizens of Mecklenburg County do hereby dissolve the political bonds which have connected us to the mother country and hereby absolve ourselves from all allegiance to the British crown and abjure all political connection contract or association with that nation which has wantonly trampled on our rights and liberties and inhumanly shed the blood of American patriots at Lexington Resolved That we do hereby declare ourselves a free and independent people are and of right ought to be a sovereign and self governing association under the control of no power other than that of our God and the general government of the Congress To the maintenance of which independence we solemnly pledge to each other our mutual cooperation our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor There are two other resolutions concerning the militia and the administration of the law but these having no present value are here omitted THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE In Congress July four seventeen seventy six When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of Nature and Nature s God entitle them a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness That to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these States To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature a right inestimable to them formidable to tyrants only He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without and convulsions within He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither and raising conditions of new appropriation of lands He has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws establishing judiciary powers He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the amount and payment of their salaries He has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and to eat out their substance He has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the consent of our legislatures He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us For protecting them by mock trial from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world For imposing taxes on us without our consent For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury For transporting us beyond the seas to be tried for pretended offenses For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies For taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments For suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever He has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us He has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their friends and brethren or to fall themselves by their hands He has excited domestic insurrection among us and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be ruler of a free people Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt our connection and correspondence They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in war in peace friends We therefore the representatives of the United States of America in general Congress assembled appealing to the supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions do in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish and declare that these United Colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent States that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown and that all political connection between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved and that as free and independent States they have full power to levy war conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce and to do all other acts and things which independent States may of right do And for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor The foregoing declaration was by order of the Congress engrossed and signed by the following members JOHN HANCOCK New Hampshire Josiah Bartlett William Whipple Matthew Thornton Massachusetts Bay Samuel Adams John Adams Robert Treat Paine Elbridge Gerry Rhode Island Stephen Hopkins William Ellery Connecticut Roger Sherman Samuel Huntington William Williams Oliver

Hewes John Penn South Carolina Edward Rutledge Thomas Heyward junior Thomas Lynch junior Arthur Middleton Georgia Button Gwinett Lyman Hall George Walton The following clause formed part of the original Declaration of Independence as signed but was finally left out of the printed copies out of respect to South Carolina He King George III has waged cruel war against human nature itself violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him captivating and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES We the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity

FORGETTING A Brief but Comprehensive Treatise Based on Loisette s Famous System of Memory Culture So much has been said about Loisette s memory system the art has been so widely advertised and so carefully guarded from all the profane who do not send five or many dollars to the Professor that a few pages showing how man may be his own Loisette may be both interesting and valuable In the first place the system is a good one and well worth the labor of mastering and if the directions are implicitly followed there can be no doubt that the memory will be greatly strengthened and improved and that the mnemonic feats otherwise impossible may be easily performed Loisette however is not an inventor but an introducer He stands in the same relation to doctor Pick that the retail dealer holds to the manufacturer the one produced the article the other brings it to the public Even this statement is not quite fair to Loisette for he has brought much practical common sense to bear upon Pick s system and in preparing the new art of mnemonics for the market in many ways he has made it his own If each man would reflect upon the method by which he himself remembers things he would find his hand upon the key of the whole mystery For instance I was once trying to remember the word Blythe There occurred to my mind the words Bellman Belle and the verse the peasant upward climbing Hears the bells of Buloss chiming Barcarole Barrack and so on until finally the word Blythe presented itself with a strange insistence long after I had ceased trying to recall it On another occasion when trying to recall the name Richardson I got the words hay rick Robertson Randallstown and finally wealthy from which naturally I got rich and Richardson almost in a breath Still another example Trying to recall the name of an old schoolmate Grady I got Brady grave gaseous gastronome gracious and I finally abandoned the attempt simply saying to myself that it began with a G and there was an a sound after it The next morning when thinking of something entirely different this name Grady came up in my mind with as much distinctness as though someone had whispered it in my ear This remembering was done without any conscious effort on my part and was evidently the result of the exertion made the day before when the mnemonic processes were put to work Every reader must have had a similar experience which he can recall and which will fall in line with the examples given It follows then that when we endeavor without the aid of any system to recall a forgotten fact or name our memory presents to us words of similar sound or meaning in its journey toward the goal to which we have started it This goes to show that our ideas are arranged in groups in whatever secret cavity or recess of the brain they occupy and that the arrangement is not an alphabetical one exactly and not entirely by meaning but after some fashion partaking of both If you are looking for the word meadow you may reach middle before you come to it or Mexico or many words beginning with the m sound or containing the dow as window or dough or you may get field or farm but you are on the right track and if you do not interfere with your intellectual process you will finally come to the idea which you are seeking How often have you heard people say I forget his name it is something like Beadle or Beagle at any rate it begins with a B Each and all of these were unconscious Loisettians and they were practicing blindly and without proper method or direction the excellent system which he teaches The thing then to do and it is the final and simple truth which Loisette teaches is to travel over this ground in the other direction to cement the fact which you wish to remember to some other fact or word which you know will be brought out by the implied conditions and thus you will always be able to travel from your given starting point to the thing which you wish to call to mind It seems as though a channel were cut in our mind stuff along which the memory flows How to construct an easy channel for any event or series of events or facts which one wishes to remember along which the mind will ever afterward travel is the secret of mnemonics Loisette in common with all the mnemonic teachers uses the old device of representing numbers by letters and as this is the first and easiest step in the art this seems to be the most logical place to introduce the accepted equivalents of the Arabic numerals zero is always represented by s z or c soft one is always represented by t th or d two is always represented by n three is always represented by m four is always represented by r five is always represented by l six is always represented by sh j ch soft or g soft seven is always represented by g hard k c hard q or final ng eight is always represented by f or v nine is always represented by p or b All the other letters are used simply to fill up Double letters in a word count only as one In fact the system goes by sound not by spelling For instance this or dizzy would stand for ten catch or gush would stand for seventy six and the only difficulty is to make some word or phrase which will contain only the significant letters in the proper order filled out with non significants into some guise of meaning or intelligibility You can remember the equivalents given above by noting that z is the first letter of zero and c of cipher t has but one stroke n has two m three the script f is very like eight the script p like nine r is the last letter of four l is the Roman numeral for fifty which suggests five The others may be retained by memorizing these nonsense lines Six shy Jewesses chase George Seven great kings came quarreling Suppose you wished to get some phrase or word that would express the number three thousand six hundred eighty five you arrange the letters this way three six eight five a m a sh a f a one e e j e v e i i ch i i o o g o o u u u u h h h h w w w w x x x x y y y y You can make out image of law my shuffle matchville et cetera et cetera as far as you like to work it out Now suppose you wished to memorize the fact that one million dollars in gold weighs three thousand six hundred eighty five pounds you go about it in this way and here is the kernel and crux of Loisette s system How much does one million dollars in gold weigh Weigh scales Scales statue of justice Statue of Justice image of law The process is simplicity itself The thing you wish to recall and that you fear to forget is the weight consequently you cement your chain of suggestion to the idea which is most prominent in your mental question What do you weigh with Scales What does the mental picture of scales suggest The statue of Justice blindfolded and weighing out award and punishment to man Finally what is this statue of Justice but the image of law And the words image of law translated back from the significant letters m g soft f and one give you three six eight five the number of pounds in one million dollars in gold You bind together in your mind each separate step in the journey the one suggests the other and you will find a year from now that the fact will be as fresh in your memory as it is today You cannot lose it It is chained to you by an unbreakable mnemonic tie Mark that it is not claimed that weight will of itself suggest scales and scales statue of Justice et cetera but that having once passed your attention up and down that ladder of ideas your mental tendency will be to take the same route and get to the same goal again and again Indeed beginning with the weight of one million dollars image of law will turn up in your mind without your consciousness of any intermediate station on the way after some iteration and reiteration of the original chain Again so as to fasten the process in the reader s mind even more firmly suppose that it were desired to fix the date of the battle of Hastings A D ten sixty six in the memory ten sixty six may be represented by the words the wise judge th one s zero j six dg six the others are non significants a chain might be made thus Battle of Hastings arbitrament of war Arbitrament of war arbitration Arbitration judgment Judgment the wise judge Make mental pictures connect ideas repeat words and sounds go about it any way you please so that you will form a mental habit of connecting the battle of Hastings with the idea of arbitrament of war and so on for the other links in the chain and the work is done Loisette makes the beginning of his system unnecessarily difficult to say nothing of his illogical arrangement in the grammar of the art of memory which he makes the first of his lessons He analyzes suggestion into one Inclusion two Exclusion three Concurrence All of which looks very scientific and orderly but is really misleading and badly named The truth is that one idea will suggest another one By likeness or opposition of meaning as house suggests room or door et cetera or white suggests black cruel kind et cetera two By likeness of sound as harrow and barrow Henry and Hennepin three By mental juxtaposition a peculiarity different in each person and depending upon each one s own experiences Thus saint Charles suggests railway bridge to me because I was vividly impressed by the breaking of the Wabash bridge at that point Stable and broken leg come near each other in my experience as do cow and shot gun and licking Out of these three sorts of suggestion it is possible to get from anyone fact to another in a chain certain and safe along which the mind may be depended upon afterwards always to follow The chain is of course by no means all Its making and its binding must be accompanied by a vivid methodically directed attention which turns all the mental light gettable in a focus upon the subject passing across the mind s screen Before Loisette was thought of this was known In the old times in England in order to impress upon the mind of the rising generation the parish boundaries in the rural districts the boys were taken to each of the landmarks in succession the position and bearing of each pointed out carefully and in order to deepen the impression the young people were then and there vigorously thrashed a mechanical method of attracting the attention which was said never to have failed This system has had its supporters in many of the old fashioned schools and there are men who will read these lines who can recall with an itching sense of vivid impression the one hundred forty four lickings which were said to go with the multiplication table In default of a thrashing however the student must cultivate as best he can an intense fixity of perception upon every fact or word or date that he wishes to make permanently his own It is easy It is a matter of habit If you will you can photograph an idea upon your cerebral gelatine so that neither years nor events will blot it out or overlay it You must be clearly and distinctly aware of the thing you are putting into your mental treasure house and drastically certain of the cord by which you have tied it to some other thing of which you are sure Unless it is worth your while to do this you might as well abandon any hope of mnemonic improvement which will not come without the hardest kind of hard work although it is work that will grow constantly easier with practice and reiteration You need then one Methodic suggestion two Methodic attention three Methodic reiteration And this is all there is to Loisette and a great deal it is Two of them will not do without the third You do not know how many steps there are from your hall door to your bedroom though you have attended to and often reiterated the journey But if there are twenty of them and you have once bound the word nice or nose or news or hyenas to the fact of the stairway you can never forget it The Professor makes a point and very wisely of the importance of working through some established chain so that the whole may be carried away in the mind not alone for the value of the facts so bound together but for the mental discipline so afforded Here then is the President Series which contains the name and date of inauguration of each President from Washington to Cleveland The manner in which it is to be mastered is this Beginning at the top try to find in your mind some connection between each word and the one following it See how you can at some future time make one suggest the next either by suggestion of sound or sense or by mental juxtaposition When you have found this dwell on it attentively for a moment or two Pass it backward and forward before you and then go on to the next step The chain runs thus the names of the President being in capitals the date words or date phrases being inclosed in parentheses President Chosen for the first word as the one most apt to occur to the mind of anyone wishing to repeat the names of the Presidents Dentist President and dentist Draw What does a dentist do To give up When something is drawn from one it is given up This is a date phrase meaning seventeen eighty nine WASHINGTON Associate

forty five but it is to be supposed that if the student knows that many figures in the date of Polk s inauguration he can guess the other one The curious thing about this system will now become apparent If the reader has learned the series so that he can say it down from President to Taft he can with no effort and without any further preparation say it backwards from Taft up to the commencement There could be no better proof that this is the natural mnemonic system It proves itself by its works The series should be repeated backward and forward every day for a month and should be supplemented by a series of the reader s own making and by this one which gives the numbers from zero to one hundred and which must be chained together before they can be learned zero hoes one

one nineteen twenty twenty two are shown as printed By the use of this table which should be committed as thoroughly as the President series so that it can be repeated backward and forward any date figure or number can be at once constructed and bound by the usual chain to the fact which you wish it to accompany When the student wishes to go farther and attack larger problems than the simple binding of two facts together there is little in Loisette s system that is new although there is much that is good If it is a book that is to be learned as one would prepare for an examination each chapter is to be considered separately Of each an epitome is to be written in which the writer must exercise all of his ingenuity to reduce the matter in hand to its final skeleton of fact This he is to commit to memory both by the use of the chain and the old system of interrogation Suppose after much labor through a wide space of language one boils a chapter or an event down to the final irreducible sediment Magna Charta was exacted by the barons from King John at Runnymede You must now turn this statement this way and that way asking yourself about it every possible and impossible question gravely considering the answers and if you find any part of it especially difficult to remember chaining it to the question which will bring it out Thus What was exacted by the barons from King John at Runnymede Magna Charta By whom was Magna Charta exacted from King John at Runnymede By the barons From whom was et cetera et cetera King John From what king et cetera et cetera King John Where was Magna Charta et cetera et cetera At Runnymede And so on and so on as long as your ingenuity can suggest questions to ask or points of view from which to consider the statement Your mind will be finally saturated with the information and prepared to spill it out at the first squeeze of the examiner This however is not new It was taught in the schools hundreds of years before Loisette was born Old newspaper men will recall in connection with it Horace Greeley s statement that the test of a news item was the clear and satisfactory manner in which a report answered the interrogatories What When Where Who Why In the same way Loisette advises the learning of poetry e g The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold Who came down How did the Assyian come down Like what animal did et cetera And so on and so on until the verses are exhausted of every scrap of information to be had out of them by the most assiduous cross examination Whatever the reader may think of the availability or value of this part of the system there are so many easily applicable tests of the worth of much that Loisette has done that it may be taken with the rest Few people to give an easy example can remember the value of the ratio between the circumference and the diameter of the circle beyond four places of decimals or at most six three point one hundred forty one thousand five hundred ninety two Here is the value to one hundred eight decimal places three point fourteen million one hundred fifty nine thousand two hundred sixty five three billion five hundred eighty nine million seven hundred ninety three thousand two hundred thirty eight point four billion six hundred twenty six million four hundred thirty three thousand eight hundred thirty two seven billion nine hundred fifty million two hundred eighty eight thousand four hundred nineteen point seven billion one hundred sixty nine million three hundred ninety nine thousand three hundred seventy five one billion fifty eight million two hundred nine thousand seven hundred forty nine four billion four hundred fifty nine million two hundred thirty thousand seven hundred eighty one point six billion four hundred six million two hundred eighty six thousand two hundred eight nine billion nine hundred eighty six million two hundred eighty thousand three hundred forty eight point two billion five hundred thirty four million two hundred eleven thousand seven hundred six seven billion nine hundred eighty two million one hundred forty eight thousand eighty six plus By a very simple application of the numerical letter values these one hundred eight decimal places can be carried in the mind and recalled about as fast as you can write them down All that is to be done is to memorize these nonsense lines Mother Day will buy any shawl My love pick up my new muff A Russian jeer may move a woman Cables enough for Utopia Get a cheap ham pie by my cooley The slave knows a bigger ape I rarely hop on my sick foot Cheer a sage in a fashion safe A baby fish now views my wharf Annually Mary Ann did kiss a jay A cabby found a rough savage Now translate each significant into its proper value and you have the task accomplished Mother Day m three th l r four d l and so on Learn the lines one at a time by the method of interrogatories Who will buy any shawl Which missus Day will buy a shawl Is Mother Day particular about the sort of shawl she will buy Has she bought a shawl et cetera et cetera Then cement the end of each line to the beginning of the next one thus Shawl warm garment warmth love my love and go on as before Stupid as the work may seem to you you can memorize the figures in fifteen minutes this way so that you will not forget them in fifteen years Similarly you can take Haydn s Dictionary of Dates and turn fact after fact into nonsense lines like these which you cannot lose And this ought to be enough to show anybody the whole art If you look back across the sands of time and find out that it is that ridiculous old Thirty days hath September which comes to you when you are trying to think of the length of October if you can quote your old prosody O datur ambiguis et cetera with much more certainty than you can serve up your Horace if in fine jingles and alliterations wise and otherwise have stayed with you while solid and serviceable information has faded away you may be certain that here is the key to the enigma of memory You can apply it yourself in a hundred ways If you wish to clinch in your mind the fact that mister Love lives at four hundred eighty five Dearborn Street what is more easy than to turn four hundred eighty five into the word rifle and chain the ideas together say thus Love happiness good time picnic forest wood rangers range rifle range rifle fine weapon costly weapon dearly bought Dearborn Or if you wish to remember mister Bowman s name and you notice he has a mole on his face which is apt to attract your attention when you next see him cement the ideas thus Mole mark target archer Bowman

expected and looked for are faultless symmetry of form and feature and a complexion varying in hue as the mind is affected by internal emotion but with an expression of purity gentleness sensibility refinement and intelligence Moore the poet has given expression to his ideal of beauty in the following lines This was not the beauty Oh nothing like this That to young Nourmahal gave such magic bliss But that loveliness ever in motion which plays Like the light upon autumn s shadowy days Now here and now there giving warmth as it flies From the lips to the cheek from the cheek to the eyes Now melting in mist and now breaking in gleams Like the glimpses a saint has of heavenly dreams Wordsworth expressed himself in the following lines He was among the prime in worth An object beauteous to behold Well born well bred I sent him forth Ingenuous innocent and bold Perhaps you ask how you can attain beauty if you do not possess it or if you have some of its qualities how you may get those you are lacking If you will practice the following rules you will grow more and more beautiful in the eyes of others even if age does bring gray hair and a wrinkled skin First Cleanliness is next to godliness Practice it in every feature of your daily life Second Have some purpose to achieve and steadfastly work to attain it Third Cultivate self discipline be master of your passions under all circumstances Fourth Study to know the laws of life that yield harmony and good health and obey them Look on the bright side of life always Fifth Avoid intemperance in all things Sixth Cultivate every mental and bodily quality that will make you firm in goodness strong and physically able to be useful to your kind generous and broad minded self sacrificing and you will daily and hourly be lovely and grow into the beautiful CARE OF THE SCALP AND HAIR Beautiful hair beautiful skin and a beautiful form are the three graces which are the birthright of every woman but which through lack of good judgment and common sense or through thoughtlessness on the part of mothers of growing children comparatively few possess Beautiful hair is one of nature s greatest gifts and yet we never seem to appreciate it until there is danger of losing it or until it becomes faded and lusterless because we have not used the right means for preserving it The beauty and continuance of the hair depend upon its proper nourishment gained by the circulation of blood through the scalp and this must be maintained to keep the hair in good condition The structure of the hair is very beautiful and each hair is contained in a delicate sheath which fits into a slight depression in the skin called the follicle and around the base of the hair nature has provided glands to secrete oily matter the purpose of which is to keep the hair glossy In early maturity the hair reaches the state of greatest beauty and at this time the greatest care should be given it feeding and nourishing it as we would a plant giving it plenty of air and sunlight carefully shampooing at least once in ten days Massage the scalp to keep it loose and flexible Use electricity a good tonic and occasionally singe the split ends If this process is commenced at the right time the result will be fewer cases of baldness in men and thin poor hair in women The hair should also be worn loosely forming a soft frame for the face which is always more becoming than tightly drawn hair Many women drag their hair out by the roots by tying back too firmly CARE OF THE SKIN A beautiful skin is smooth soft and clear the color varies in different individuals In perfect health it is moist and with the delicate shading of a flower climate hair and eyes of course determining the color and the continued beauty of it depending upon pure blood fresh air and sunlight also perfect cleanliness and care The pores should always be kept free from obstruction and extremes of heat and cold avoided as much as possible In health the care of the skin is a simple matter massage being a great factor assisted always by the use of pure creams A good cleansing cream is a great necessity as it enters the pores and frees them from dirt leaving the skin soft and pliable in which condition it is ready to absorb the skin food when the finger massage is given making it possible for the gentle electric current to force the ointment into the deeper layers of the skin thus effecting the removal of moth patches tan freckles and other discolorations and imperfections The vibratory massage should follow the purpose of which is to stimulate the tissues throwing off worn out particles and increasing the circulation of the blood by giving proper exercise to the facial muscles thereby restoring and preserving the color and contour making the skin beautiful clear eradicating and preventing wrinkles The use of a pure face powder is absolutely necessary Best results are obtained by using a blended powder as the skin tint is thus assured TO DEVELOP THE BUST A beautiful bust is the desire and admiration of every woman If nature has not been kind in this respect any woman can develop a beautiful bust by exercise bathing and gentle massage with a good bust ointment or skin food Electric massage is very beneficial and if properly given brings quick and sure results Swimming and deep breathing are great aids CARE OF THE HANDS A study of the hand is very interesting and if mothers understood more of its beautiful construction many of the little accidents which result in deformed finger nails could be avoided Mothers should attend most carefully to the early cultivation of their children s finger nails as the habit of biting them is so easily formed and is sure to permanently destroy their beauty A perfect hand is rounded and plump soft white and dimpled with tapering finger tips and filbert shaped nails snowing the little half moon It is possible for any woman to have such a hand if she is willing to take time once a week to have the nails treated and to give them a little personal attention each day Great care should be taken in washing the hands A mild soap should be used and particular attention paid to the thorough drying of them after which a good cuticle cream should be applied and well rubbed in The same cream may be used to loosen the cuticle at the base of the nail when it can be gently pushed back thus keeping the half moon exposed An orange wood stick should always be used to clean the nails Massaging the hands at least once a month aids wonderfully in making them symmetrical and keeping the joints flexible and the skin free from dark spots and wrinkles INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT It is of prime importance in feeding an infant to do this at regular intervals since during the first three months of its life the feeding habits of the child should be established and if care be used in this regard the child will wake of its own accord at the proper time The last meal at night should be at eleven p m and if the child is healthy and will sleep it need not be fed until three to five a m the following morning In both breast and artificial feeding the above applies and the same method should be employed namely the child should be held in the arms during the meal which should last from ten to fifteen minutes Both in breast and artificial feeding it is possible to overfeed the child Many infants are systematically overfed The young mother should understand how small an infant s stomach is At birth it will hold a little more than an ounce of fluid or two tablespoonfuls and at the end of two months only three ounces If therefore the mother persists in trying to give the child four ounces of food the child will suffer from an excess Many children during the first few mouths of life bring up their food and the mother fears that there is some inherited tendency to weak digestion It is wrong to feed a child simply because it cries as very frequently it is not a cry of hunger but one caused by indigestion from overfeeding If the child is being fed with the bottle it is important that the food be given at a temperature of one hundred deg F or as nearly that as possible never over and if the child be fed out of doors in its carriage it is well to have a flannel bag of some kind to slip over the bottle to keep it at the same temperature until the meal is finished Many cases of colic are caused by inattention to this point It is a common mistake that when a child cries it needs additional food There are many cases where a little drink of water is the prime need of the child and great care should be taken that this is heated to the proper temperature and especially that no water be given to the child except that which has been boiled A few teaspoonfuls should be given to the child therefore several times a day but aside from that he should have nothing but his regular food until he is at least a year old For the same reason therefore if a child be fed by the bottle the water used in preparing the food should have been previously boiled and care should be exercised not to expose the food to the air during or after its preparation It should be remembered that the food of a child must be nutritious and that in this food especially when at the proper temperature for the infant bacteria from the air will flourish wonderfully fast and therefore the food should not be exposed to possible contamination It is of very great importance that the feeding bottles be always clean and sweet It is an advantage to have several bottles on hand and also two or three brushes for cleaning Keep a special vessel with water in which there is a little bicarbonate of soda so that the moment the bottle is used it may be thoroughly washed and kept in the water Do not use a nipple with a rubber tube but the short black rubber nipples which fit over the mouth of the bottle Do not enlarge the hole in the nipple so as to make it too easy for the baby to draw its food otherwise the food being taken so rapidly into the stomach will often cause pain or vomiting In washing the nipples turn them inside out and see that they are as thoroughly cleaned as possible and keep them for use in a bottle filled with boiled water with a pinch of boric acid added The First Nursing It is very important that the child should be put to the breast immediately after it is washed This is very necessary both for the mother and the child and prevents subsequent troubles The fluid contained in the breast is at this stage called colostrum and is intended by Nature to act upon the child as a laxative This first nursing stimulates the secretion of the milk and causes uterine contraction which is very much needed at this time It is well to wash the infant s mouth out with sterilized water every time it feeds For this purpose use clean water which has been boiled and allowed to cool or a solution of boric acid in boiled water five grains to the ounce of water Infants as a rule should be bathed once a day but never immediately after being nursed or fed In very warm weather a child may be sponged in the evening as well as in the morning The water for the bath of a young baby should be warm and the temperature can be judged by testing it with the elbow which is more sensitive than the hand Lay a small blanket on the lap cover the child with a flannel and sponge it under the clothes This prevents it from taking cold from exposure The room should not be cooler than sixty eight deg F and the door must be kept closed to avoid drafts Use only pure white soap and a soft cloth is better than a sponge The body should be carefully dried and lightly powdered to absorb any moisture that may remain THE NAMES OF THE MONTHS THE DERIVATIONS OF THE NAMES OF THE MONTHS January The Roman god Janus presided over the beginning of everything hence the first month of the year was called after him February The Roman festival Februs was held on the fifteenth day of this month in honor of Lupercus the god of fertility March Named from the Roman god of war Mars April Latin Aprilis probably derived from aperire to open because spring generally begins and the buds open in this month May Lat Maius probably derived from Maia a feminine divinity worshiped at Rome on the first day of this month June Juno a Roman divinity worshiped as the Queen of Heaven July Julius Julius Caesar was born in this month August Named by the Emperor Augustus Caesar B C thirty after himself as he regarded it as a fortunate month being that in which he had gained several victories September septem or seven September was the seventh month in the old Roman calendar October octo or eight Eighth month of the old Roman year November novem or nine November was the ninth month in the old Roman year December decem or ten December was the tenth month of the early Roman year About the twenty first of this month the sun enters the Tropic of Capricorn and forms the winter solstice DAYS OF THE WEEK Sunday Saxon Sunnandaed day of the sun Monday German Montag day or the moon Tuesday Anglo Saxon Tiwesdaeg from Tiw the god of war Wednesday Anglo Saxon Wodnesdaeg from Odin the god of storms Thursday Danish Thor the god of thunder Friday Saxon Frigedaeg day of Freya goddess of marriage Saturday the day of Saturn the god of time The names of the seven days of the week originated with the Egyptian astronomers They gave them the names of the sun moon and five planets viz Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus and Saturn WHAT HOUSEKEEPERS SHOULD REMEMBER That cold rain water and soap will remove machine grease from washable fabrics That fish may be scaled much easier by first dipping them into boiling water for a minute That fresh meat beginning to sour will sweeten if placed outdoors in the cool air over night That milk which has changed may be sweetened or rendered fit for use again by stirring in a little soda That a tablespoonful of turpentine boiled with your white clothes will greatly aid the whitening process That kerosene will soften boots and shoes that have been hardened by water and will render them as pliable as new That thoroughly wetting the hair once or twice with a solution of salt and water will keep it from falling out That salt fish are quickest and best freshened by soaking in sour milk That salt will curdle new milk hence in preparing porridge gravies et cetera salt should not be added until the dish is prepared That one teaspoonful of ammonia to a teacup of water applied with a rag will clean silver or gold jewelry perfectly That paint stains that are dry and old may be removed from cotton and woolen goods with chloroform It is a good plan to first cover the spot with olive oil or butter That clear boiling water will remove tea stains Pour the water through the stain and thus prevent it spreading over the fabric That charcoal is recommended as an absorbent of gases in the milk room where foul gases are present It should be freshly powdered and kept there continually especially in hot weather when unwholesome odors are most liable to infect the milk That applying kerosene with a rag when you are about to put your stoves away for the summer will prevent them from rusting Treat your farming implements in the same way before you lay them aside for the fall That a teaspoonful of borax put in the last water in which clothes are rinsed will whiten them surprisingly Pound the borax so it will dissolve easily This is especially good to remove the yellow that time gives to white garments that have been laid aside for two or three years That a good agency for keeping the air of the cellar sweet and wholesome is whitewash made of good white lime and water only The addition of glue or size or anything of that kind only furnishes organic matter to speedily putrefy The use of lime in whitewash is not only to give a white color but it greatly promotes the complete oxidation of effluvia in the cellar air Any vapors that contain combined nitrogen in the unoxidized form contribute powerfully to the development of disease germs CHARACTER AS SEEN IN FACES Thick lips indicate genius and conservatism Large dilating nostrils are a sign of poetic temperament and a sensitive nature A long forehead denotes liberality Arched eyebrows good ancestry and amiability A bold projecting Roman nose indicates enterprise Delicate nose good nature A large nose strength of will and character An eye that looks one cheerfully and frankly in the face shows honesty and faithfulness Lips slightly curved upward at the ends indicate a fine sense of humor Soft round cheeks denote gentleness and affection dimples in the cheeks roguery in the chin one who falls easily in love A broad chin denotes firmness Straight lips firmly closed resolution Large ears denote generosity BELL TIME ON SHIPBOARD Time on shipboard is divided into periods of four hours from midnight to midnight and the lapse of every half hour is marked by one or more strokes of the bell from one stroke for the end of the first half hour to eight strokes or in nautical language eight bells for the end of the fourth hour Thus twelve thirty a m is one bell one zero a m two bells one thirty a m three bells two zero a m four bells two thirty a m five bells three zero a m six bells three thirty a m seven bells four zero a m eight bells Then four thirty a m is indicated by one bell five zero a m two bells et cetera eight bells being sounded at eight zero a m twelve zero m four zero p m eight zero p m and twelve zero p m Four to eight zero p m is divided into two dog watches called first dog watch and last dog watch so as to change the watches daily otherwise starboard or port watch would be on deck the same hours day after day QUEER ANALOGIES IN NATURE The cocoanut is in many respects like the human skull although it closely resembles the skull of the monkey A sponge may be so held as to remind one of the unfleshed face of the skeleton and the meat of an English walnut is almost the exact representation of the brain Plums and black cherries resemble the human eyes almonds and some other nuts resemble the different varieties of the human nose and an opened oyster and its shell are a perfect image of the human ear The shape of almost any man s body may be found in the various kinds of mammoth pumpkins The open hand may be discerned in the form assumed by scrub willows and growing celery The German turnip and the eggplant resemble the human heart There are other striking resemblances between human organs and certain vegetable forms The forms of many mechanical contrivances in common use may be traced back to the patterns furnished by nature Thus the hog suggested the plow the butterfly the ordinary hinge the toadstool the umbrella the duck the ship the fungous growth on trees the bracket Anyone desirous of proving the oneness of the earthly system will find the resemblances in nature a most amusing study Scientific American MODERN FABLES Luxury Of two cats one thinking to be very fine hunted only humming birds and the other hunted only mice The first had to hunt much longer than the other because humming birds were scarce so that it spent nearly all its life in getting food while the other had little trouble to get all it wanted How unfortunate it is said the first cat that I have formed my liking for what is so hard to get and is so little when I have it Fastidiousness A fastidious ox would not drink while standing in the water with his head turned down stream lest he should soil the water with his feet But once when drinking with his head turned up stream he saw a whole drove of hogs washing in the water above him Attracting Attention A flea which saw many people trying to get the attention of a king and waiting long for that purpose said Though I am but a little thing I will get his attention So he jumped up the throne until he got on the king s head Here he received recognition from the king by a slap and when he boasted to a dog of his success the latter said Some get attention by their merit others by their demerit In making yourself a nuisance you get recognition before the lords of the realm but only as a flea Gambling A monkey playing with a steel trap got his tail cut off He went back the next day to get his tail when he got his foot cut off Now he said I will go back and get both my foot and my tail He went back and the third time he got his head cut off which ended his monkeying with the trap Mugwumpery A mule on one side of a fence was discontented because he was not on the other side He finally jumped over when he was equally discontented because he was not back again Which side of the fence do you want to be on asked a horse It does not matter replied the mule provided I am on the other side The Non Partisan A dog running about in an irregular way was asked where he was going I am not going anywhere replied the dog but only running about to learn where to go Partisanship The swans wishing to drive the peacocks from a park procured a law against big feet The peacocks retaliated by getting a counter law against big necks Soon one side could see nothing but ugly feet and the other nothing but long necks At last they came to think peacocks were all feet and swans all neck NUMBER OF MILES BY WATER FROM NEW YORK To

made with a lunatic is void The act of one partner binds all the others An agreement without consideration is void The law compels no one to do impossibilities Agents are liable to their principals for errors Principals are liable for the acts of their agents A receipt for money paid is not legally conclusive Signatures made with a lead pencil are good in law The seal of a party to a written contract imports consideration A contract made with a minor cannot be enforced against him A note made by a minor is voidable Each individual in a partnership is liable for the whole amount of the debts of the firm A note which does not state on its face that it bears interest will bear interest only after due A lease of land for a longer term than one year is void unless in writing An indorser of a note is exempt from liability if notice of its dishonor is not mailed or served within twenty four hours of its non payment In case of the death of the principal maker of a note the holder is not required to notify a surety that the note is not paid before the settlement of the maker s estate Notes obtained by fraud or made by an intoxicated person are not collectible If no time of payment is specified in a note it is payable on demand An indorser can avoid liability by writing without recourse beneath his signature A check indorsed by the payee is evidence of payment in the drawer s hands An outlawed debt is revived should the debtor make a partial payment If negotiable paper pledged to a bank as security for the payment of a loan or debt falls due and the bank fails to demand payment and have it protested when dishonored the bank is liable to the owner for the full amount of the paper Want of consideration a common defense interposed to the payment of negotiable paper is a good defense between the original parties to the paper but after it has been transferred before maturity to an innocent holder for value it is not a defense Sometimes the holder of paper has the right to demand payment before maturity for instance when a draft has been protested for non acceptance and the proper notices served the holder may at once proceed against the drawer and indorsers Negotiable paper payable to bearer or indorser in blank which has been stolen or lost cannot be collected by the thief or finder but a holder who receives it in good faith before maturity for value can hold it against the owner s claims at the time it was lost If a note or draft is to be paid in the State where it is made the contract will be governed by the laws of that State When negotiable paper is payable in a State other than that in which it is made the laws of that State will govern it Marriage contracts if valid where they are made are valid everywhere Contracts relating to personal property are governed by the laws of the place where made except those relating to real estate which are governed by the laws of the place where the land is situated THE RIGHT OF DOWER Dower is one third of the husband s estate and in general cannot be destroyed by the mere act of the husband Hence in the sale of real estate by the husband his wife must with the husband sign the conveyance to make the title complete to the purchaser In the absence of such signature the widow can claim full dower rights after the husband s death Creditors also seize the property subject to such dower rights The husband in his will sometimes gives his wife property in lieu of dowry In this case she may after his death elect to take either such property or her dower but she cannot take both While the husband lives the wife s right of dower in only inchoate it cannot be enforced Should he sell the land to a stranger she has no right of action or remedy until his death In all cases the law of the State in which the land is situated governs it and as in the case of heirship full information must be sought for in statute which is applicable MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE Marriage may be entered into by any two persons with the following exceptions Idiots lunatics persons of unsound mind persons related by blood or affinity within certain degrees prohibited by law infants under the age of consent which varies in the different States and all persons already married and not legally divorced The causes for which a divorce may be obtained vary greatly in the different States In South Carolina only fraud and force are recognized as invalidating the marriage tie this State having no divorce law In the District of Columbia and all the other States with the exception of Maryland Massachusetts Michigan and Virginia cruelty is a statutory cause and desertion in all but New York In most of the States neglect is also recognized as a valid cause Imprisonment for crime is a cause in all except Florida Maryland Massachusetts New Jersey and New York Physical inability is a cause in all the States except California Connecticut Idaho North Dakota and Texas Intemperance in all but Massachusetts New Jersey North Carolina North Dakotah Rhode Island Vermont Virginia and West Virginia The time of residence required to secure a divorce varies from six months in Idaho Nebraska Nevada and Texas to three to five years in Massachusetts In most States it is one year Remarriage is permitted in all the States having divorce laws except Georgia and alimony is also provided for in all these States RIGHTS OF MARRIED WOMEN Any and all property which a woman owns at her marriage together with rents issues and profits thereof and the property which comes to her by descent devise bequest gift or grant or which she acquires by her trade business labor or services performed on her separate account shall notwithstanding her marriage remain her sole and separate property and may be used collected and invested by her in her own name and shall not be subject to the interference or control of her husband or be liable for his debts unless for such debts as may have been contracted for the support of herself or children by her as his agent A married woman may likewise bargain sell assign transfer and convey such property and enter into contracts regarding the same on her separate trade labor or business with the like effect as if she were unmarried Her husband however is not liable for such contracts and they do not render him or his property in any way liable therefor She may also sue and be sued in all matters having relation to her sale and separate property in the same manner as if she were sole In the following cases a married woman s contract may be enforced against her and her separate estate one When the contract is created in or respecting the carrying on of the trade or business of the wife two When it relates to or is made for the sole benefit of her sole or separate estate three When the intention to charge the separate estate is expressed in the contract creating the liability When a husband receives a principal sum of money belonging to his wife the law presumes he receives it for her use and he must account for it or expend it on her account by her authority or direction or that she gave it to him as a gift If he receives interest or income and spends it with her knowledge and without objection a gift will be presumed from acquiescence Money received by a husband from his wife and expended by him under her direction on his land in improving the home of the family is a gift and cannot be recovered by the wife or reclaimed or an account demanded An appropriation by a wife herself of her separate property to the use and benefit of her husband in the absence of all agreement to repay or any circumstances from which such an agreement can be inferred will not create the relation of debtor and creditor nor render the husband liable to account Though no words of gift be spoken a gift by a wife to her husband may be shown by the very nature of the transaction or appear from the attending circumstances A wife who causelessly deserts her husband is not entitled to the aid of a court of equity in getting possession of such chattels as she has contributed to the furnishing and adornment of her husband s house Her legal title remains and she could convey her interest to a third party by sale and said party would have a good title unless her husband should prove a gift Wife s property is not liable to a lien of a sub contractor for materials furnished to the husband for the erection of a building thereon where it is not shown that the wife was notified of the intention to furnish the materials or a settlement made with the contractor and given to the wife her agent or trustee The common law of the United States has some curious provisions regarding the rights of married women though in all the States there are statutory provisions essentially modifying this law As it now stands the husband is responsible for necessaries supplied to the wife even should he not fail to supply them himself and is held liable if he turn her from his house or otherwise separates himself from her without good cause He is not held liable if the wife deserts him or if he turns her away for good cause If she leaves him through good cause then he is liable If a man lives with a woman as his wife and so represents her even though this representation is made to one who knows she is not he is liable the same way as if she were his wife THE LAW OF FINDING The general rule is that the finder has a clear title against every one but the owner The proprietor of a hotel or a shop has no right to demand property of others found on his premises Such proprietors may make regulations in regard to lost property which will bind their employes but they cannot bind the public The finder has been held to stand in the place of the owner so that he was permitted to prevail in all action against a person who found an article which the plaintiff had originally found but subsequently lost The police have no special rights in regard to articles lost unless those rights are conferred by statute Receivers of articles found are trustees for the owner or finder They have no power in the absence of special statute to keep an article against the finder any more than the finder has to retain an article against the owner THE LAW OF COPYRIGHT The new copyright law which went into effect July one nineteen oh nine differs in many

American soil CHAMOIS SKINS The animal from which the chamois skin derives its name inhabits the high mountains from the Pyrenees to the Caucasus Chamois are most numerous in the Alps where they dwell in small herds and feed on the herbage of the mountain sides They are about the size of a small goat dark chestnut brown in color with the exception of the forehead the sides of the lower jaws and the muzzle which are white Its horns rising above the eyes are black smooth and straight for two thirds of their length when they suddenly curve backward The chamois hunter provided with a gun a bag of provisions an iron shod staff to assist him in climbing and leaping an ax to cut steps in the ice and shoes studded with iron points traverses the mountains and follows his prey not only during the day but also at night Nearly all the chamois skins now in the market are made from the skins of the lamb or sheep This industry has been largely developed in England and France and these countries have supplied the market of the United States almost exclusively until recent years when the manufacture of these goods was commenced in the United States WHAT S IN A NAME ORIGIN AND MEANING OF NAMES

worthy of preservation in the language are often erroneously used The following compact lexicon is therefore both interesting and instructive Aeroplane A generic term applied in common use to all classes of sustaining surfaces strictly applicable only to flat surfaces Adjusting Surfaces Commonly a comparatively small surface usually at the end of a wing tip used to adjust lateral balance preferably restricted to surfaces capable of variable adjustment but not of movement by controlling devices See Stabilizer and Wing tip and compare Aileron Advancing Edge The front edge of a sustaining or other surface Advancing Surface A surface that precedes another through the air as in a double monoplane Aerocurve A proposed substitute for aeroplane Aerodrome A substitute proposed by Langley for aeroplane Strictly applicable to a course rather than to a vehicle Aileron a ler on A small hinged or separated wing tip or surface capable of independent manipulation for the purpose of maintaining lateral balance Aviation a vi a shun Dynamic flight by means of heavier than air mechanisms Aviator a vi a ter The operator or pilot of a heavier than air machine Aerofoil Term used to indicate lifting surface Angle of Incidence The angle which a line drawn from the leading to the trailing edge of the plane makes with the horizontal trailing angle between the tangent to the trailing edge of the plane and the chord or a line drawn from the leading to the trailing edge Arc Any portion of a circle or other curve Aspect The top or plan view of an aeroplane surface Automatic Stability Applied to lateral or longitudinal stability maintained by the action of suitable elements on mechanisms independent of any control exercised by the operator There is a tendency to restrict the term to such stability secured by automatic manipulation of controlling devices rather than to systems in which balance is maintained by the use of dihedral arrangements Biplane bi plane An aeroplane with two superposed main surfaces Balance To maintain equilibrium by hand or automatic movement of balancing surfaces as opposed to equilibrium maintained by stabilizing See Stabilizer Body The center part of an aeroplane or other aerial vehicle in which the motor fuel tanks passenger accommodation et cetera are placed Camber The camber of the ribs is the amount of curvature which is imparted to them in the same way that a motor car spring or a road has a camber or curvature Chassis shas see That part of the main framework of a monoplane to which the main planes and tail planes are fitted and which contains the engine and aviators seat Center of Pressure Really a line of pressure along the under side of a wing or aeroplane surface on either side of which the pressures are equal Center of Gravity The center of weight about which the vehicle balances in all directions Chord A straight line drawn between the ends of the arc of a circle or other curve Dirigible dir igihle Steerable or navigable applied to balloons Derrick A tower in which a falling weight is dropped in starting an aeroplane Diagonal A diagonal brace or stay in a framework Dihedral di he dral Said of wing pairs inclined at an upward angle to each other Elevator A principal supplementary surface usually of a miniature form of the main planes Used for purpose of altering the vertical direction of machine Gap The distance between two main planes in a biplane Gliding Flying down a slant of air without power Gyroscopic Effect The property of any rotating mass whereby it tends to maintain its plane of rotation against disturbing forces Gauchissement or warping Applied to the main planes and produces the same ultimate effect as the use of ailerons Hangar hang ar A shed for housing balloons or aeroplanes generally the latter Horsepower A rate of work equivalent to the lifting of thirty three thousand fort lb a minute Head Resistance The resistance of a surface to movement through the air closely proportionate to its projected area Heavier than air Applied to dynamic flying machines weighing more than the air they displace Horizontal Rudder A horizontally placed rudder for steering in vertical directions Lift The sustaining effect expressed in units of weight of an aeroplane or wing surface Monoplane An aeroplane with one or more main surfaces in the same horizontal plane Main Plane Usually the largest or lowest supporting surface of a multi surfaced aeroplane Mast A spar or strut used for the attachment of wire or other stays to stiffen the wings or other parts of a structure Main Spars Lateral spars upon which the main planes are built Main Landing Wheels In an alighting gear the wheels that take the chief shock in landing Ornithopter A dynamic flying machine of the heavier than air type in which sustension is provided by the effect of reciprocating wing surfaces Pylon A tower to mark the course in aerial racing contests Ribs Supports for the fabric made of ash or spruce and bent to the correct curves Rudder One or more steering planes are invariably fitted to practical machines to control the direction of flight Superposed Planes Arrangement of one plane over the other as in the Wright Voisin and Farman machines Supplementary Planes or surfaces Additional surfaces which are used for stabilization Stabilizer Any surface for automatically maintaining lateral or longitudinal balance Struts Fixtures used in biplane construction to maintain an equal distance between two planes Skids Long skates on which the machine can land in safety Span The distance from tip to tip of the main planes in a transverse direction to that of flight Soaring Flight The flight of certain large birds without wing flapping Its solution and imitation constitute one of the problems of aerial navigation Sustaining Surface Any surface placed in a horizontal or approximately horizontal position primarily for the purpose of affording sustension Triplane An aeroplane with three main surfaces Webs Small blocks of wood placed between the ribs which act as distance pieces Wing Warping A system of maintaining lateral balance by differential twisting of wing tips in such manner as to increase the sustension on one side and decrease it on the other New York Tribune COLLEGE COLORS Amherst Purple and white Beloit Old gold Bowdoin White Brown Brown and white Columbia Light blue and white

system of practice for the cure of every disease to which the human body is liable doctor Andrew T Still who claims to have made the discoveries that led to the establishment of the school of Osteopathy asserts that all diseases and lesions are the result of the luxation dislocation or breakage of some bone or bones this however is not now maintained to any great extent by his followers Osteopathists though do generally claim that all diseases arise from some maladjustment of the bones of the human body and that treatment therefore must be to secure the normal adjustment of the bones and ligaments that form the skeleton They claim that a dislocation is not always necessarily the result of external violence it may be caused by the ulceration of bones the elongation of ligaments or excessive muscular action The constriction of an important artery or vein which may be caused by a very slightly displaced bone an indurated muscle or other organ may produce an excess of blood in one part of the body thereby causing a deficiency in some other part A dislocated member will generally show alteration in the form of the joint and axis of the limb loss of power and proper motion increased length or shortening of the limb prominence at one point and depression at another greatly impaired circulation and pain due to the obstruction of nerve force in the parts involved The osteopathist claims that pain and disease arise mainly from some mal adjustment in some part of the body and that a return to good health involves treatment for the normal adjustment of the skeleton he asserts though any luxation may be only partial it may cause pressure at some point upon a blood vessel or a nerve of which the patient may be unconscious and thus be a barrier to the restoration of good health Osteopathy asserts that trying to heal the body of an ailment caused by a dislocated member be it a bone ligament or nerve by which abnormal pressure is maintained upon a blood vessel or a nerve would be like trying to operate a machine with an important cog out of gear To cure it involves the reduction of a dislocation the breaking up of adhesions and the arousing of the enervated organ or organs partially or wholly failing in the performance of function THE LAW OF TRADEMARKS Any person firm or corporation can obtain protection for any lawful trademark by complying with the following one By causing to be recorded in the Patent Office the name residence and place of business of persons desiring the trademark two The class of merchandise and description of the same three A description of the trademark itself with facsimiles four The length of time that the said mark has already been used five By payment of the required fee six dollars for labels and twenty five dollars for trademarks six By complying with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Commissioner of Patents seven A lawful trademark must consist of some arbitrary word not the name of a person or place indicating or not the use or nature of the thing to which it is applied of some designating symbol or of both said word and symbol HOW TO OBTAIN A PATENT Patents are issued in the name of the United States and under the seal of the Patent Office A patent is a grant by the Government to the inventor his heirs or assigns for a limited period of the exclusive right to make use or sell any new and useful art machine manufacture or composition of matter or any new and useful improvement thereof or any new original and ornamental design for any article of manufacture Every patent contains a grant to the patentee his heirs or assigns for the term of seventeen years of the exclusive right to make use and vend the invention or discovery throughout the United States and the Territories referring to the specification for the particulars thereof If it appears that the inventor at the time of making his application believed himself to be the first inventor or discoverer a patent will not be refused on account of the invention or discovery or any part thereof having been known or used in any foreign country before his invention or discovery thereof if it had not been before patented or described in any printed publication Joint inventors are entitled to a joint patent neither can claim one separately Independent inventors of distinct and independent improvements in the same machine cannot obtain a joint patent for their separate inventions nor does the fact that one furnishes the capital and another makes the invention entitle them to make application as joint inventors but in such case they may become joint patentees Application for a patent must be made in writing to the Commissioner of Patents from whom blanks and printed instructions can be obtained by mail REISSUES A reissue is granted to the original patentee his legal representatives or the assignees of the entire interest when by reason of a defective or insufficient specification or by reason of the patentee claiming as his invention or discovery more than he had a right to claim as new the original patent is inoperative or invalid provided the error has arisen from inadvertence accident or mistake and without any fraudulent or deceptive intention CAVEATS A caveat under the patent law is a notice given to the office of the caveator s claim as inventor in order to prevent the grant of a patent to another for the same alleged invention upon an application filed during the life of the caveat without notice to the caveator Any citizen of the United States who has made a new invention or discovery and desires further time to mature the same may on payment of a fee of ten dollars file in the Patent Office a caveat setting forth the object and the distinguishing characteristics of the invention and praying protection of his right until he shall have matured his invention Such caveat shall be filed in the confidential archives of the office and preserved in secrecy and shall be operative for the term of one year from the filing thereof An alien has the same privilege if he has resided in the United States one year next preceding the filing of his caveat and has made oath of his intention to become a citizen The caveat must comprise a specification oath and when the nature of the case admits of it a drawing and like the application must be limited to a single invention or improvement FEES Fees must be paid in advance and are as follows On filing each original application for a patent fifteen dollars On issuing each original patent twenty dollars In design cases For three years and six months ten dollars for seven years fifteen dollars for fourteen years thirty dollars On filing each caveat ten dollars On every application for the reissue of a patent thirty dollars Added to these are the usual charges of patent solicitors for preparing the application and for drawings et cetera SHAKESPEARE S COUNSEL Polonius Advice to His Son Laertes And these few precepts in thy memory

Thou canst not then be false to any man Hamlet one three POOR RICHARD S SAYINGS Benjamin Franklin Drive thy business Let not thy business drive thee Diligence is the mother of good luck Now I have a sheep and a cow everybody bids me good morrow If you would know the value of money go and try to borrow some Great estates may venture more but little boats should keep near shore What maintains one vice would bring up two children God helps them that help themselves Poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue Tis hard for an empty bag to stand upright Beware of little expenses a small leak will sink a great ship For age and want save while you may No morning sun lasts a whole day HOW TO MAKE CHANGE QUICKLY Always consider the amount of purchase as if that much money were already counted out then add to amount of purchase enough small change to make an even dollar counting out the even dollars last until full amount is made up If the purchase amounts to fifty seven cents and you are handed two dollars in payment count out forty three cents first to make an even dollar Then layout the other dollar Should the purchase be three dollars sixty nine cents to be taken out of twenty dollars begin with three dollars sixty nine cents as the basis and make up even four dollars by laying out thirty one cents This thirty one cents with the amount of the purchase you will consider as four dollars and count out even dollars to make up the twenty dollars which the customer has handed in MERCHANTS COST AND PRICE MARKS All merchants use private cipher marks to note cost or selling price of goods The cipher is usually made up from some short word or sentence of nine or ten letters as C O R N E L I U S A one two three four five six seven eight nine zero Five dollars according to this key would be eaa But generally an extra letter is used to prevent repeating the mark for zero If the sign for a second zero in this case were y we would have eay instead of eaa TIME

seventy two At twelve per cent by thirty At six per cent by sixty At fifteen per cent by twenty four At seven per cent by fifty two At twenty per cent by eighteen At eight per cent by forty five TRADE DISCOUNTS Wholesale houses usually invoice their goods to retailers at list prices List prices were once upon a time supposed to be retail prices but of late a system of long list prices has come into vogue in many lines of trade that is the list price is made exorbitantly high so that wholesalers can give enormous discounts These discounts whether large or small are called trade discounts and are usually deducted at a certain rate per cent from the face of invoice The amount of discount generally depends upon size of bill or terms of settlement or both Sometimes two or more discounts are allowed Thus thirty and five is expressed thirty and five meaning first a discount of thirty and then five from the remainder thirty and five is not thirty five but thirty three one three ten five and three off means three successive discounts A wholesale house allowing ten five and three off gets more for its goods than it would at eighteen off HOW TO DETECT COUNTERFEIT MONEY In the space at disposal here it is impossible of course to give a complete illustrated counterfeit detector but the following simple rules laid down by Bank Note Examiner Geo R Baker will be found extremely valuable Examine the form and features of all human figures if graceful and features distinct examine the drapery Notice whether the folds lie naturally and observe whether the fine strands of the hair are plain and distinct Examine the lettering In a genuine bill is absolutely perfect There has never been a counterfeit put out but was more or less defective in the lettering Counterfeiters rarely if ever get the imprint or engraver s name perfect The shading in the background of the vignette and over and around the letters forming the name of the bank on a good bill is even and perfect on a counterfeit it is uneven and imperfect The die work around the figures of the denomination should be of the same character as the ornamental work surrounding it Never take a bill deficient in any of these points Big Trees Of ninety two redwood trees in Calaveras Grove Cal ten are over thirty feet in diameter and eighty two have a diameter of from fifteen to thirty feet Their ages are estimated at

same time presenting a much more popular aspect as a method whereby the disposition character and natural aptitude of the individual may be ascertained Illustration Side and front view of a head with several numbered areas above the eyes and ears These two features of the subject are quite distinct from each other for while it can serve as a reliable guide for reading character only on the assumption of its truth as a philosophic system yet the possibility of its practical application does not necessarily follow from the establishment of the truth of its theoretical side Two of the earliest founders of the science of anatomy Erasistratus and Herophilus who lived in the age of Ptolemy Soter taught that the brain was the seat of sensation and intellect and that there was therein a certain degree of localization of function Galen later taught that the brain is the seat of the soul and intellect From these facts of history the system of phrenology though formulated by doctor Gall doctor Spurzheim the Fowler Brothers and others rests upon deductions derived from the teachings of the demonstrators of anatomy and students of philosophy The formulated system of phrenology is very generally believed to be a modern expansion of an old empirical philosophy but according to doctor Gall s account it arose with him as the result of independent observations The popularity of phrenology has waned in the public mind and cultivation of the system is confined to a few enthusiasts such as pose as teachers of it as a vocation These claim that phrenology is a practical and important science and that it rests upon the following principles First That the human brain is the organ of the mind Second That the mental powers of man can be analyzed into a definite number of measurably independent faculties Third That these faculties are innate and each has its seat in a definite region of the brain Fourth That the size of each of these regions is the measure of the power of manifesting the faculty associated with it The faculties and their localities as originally constructed by doctor Gall were for the most part identified on slender grounds His procedure was as follows Having selected the place of a faculty he examined the heads of his friends and casts of persons with that peculiarity in common and in them sought for the distinctive feature of their characteristic trait Some of his earlier studies were among low associates in jails and lunatic asylums and some of the qualities located by him were such as tend to perversion to crime These he named after their excessive manifestations and thus mapped out organs of theft murder et cetera This however caused the system to be discredited Later his pupil doctor Spurzheim claimed that the moral and religious features belonging to it greatly modified these characteristics of doctor Gall s work The chart of the human head as invented by doctor Gall represented twenty six organs the chart as improved by doctor Spurzheim makes out thirty five organs This is the chart now generally used and which is shown on a preceding page The number specifies the location of each organ which is followed by its phrenological name and classified as follows Propensities one Amativeness two Philoprogenitiveness three Concentrativeness four Adhesiveness five Combativeness six Destructiveness sixa Alimentiveness seven Secretiveness eight Acquisitiveness nine Constructiveness Lower Sentiments ten Self esteem eleven Love of Approbation twelve Cautiousness Superior Sentiments thirteen Benevolence fourteen Veneration fifteen Conscientiousness sixteen Firmness seventeen Hope eighteen Wonder nineteen Ideality twenty Wit twenty one Imitation Perceptive Faculties twenty two Individuality twenty three Form twenty four Size twenty five Weight twenty six Color twenty seven Locality twenty eight Number twenty nine Order thirty Eventuality thirty one Time thirty two Tune thirty three Language Reflective Faculties thirty four Comparison thirty five Causality The judgment of the phrenologist is determined by the size of the brain in general and by the size of the organs that have been formulated and these are estimated by certain arbitrary rules that render the boundaries of the regions indefinite The controversy over phrenology has served undoubtedly the very useful purpose of stimulating research into the anatomy of the brain It is generally conceded that any psychological theory which correlates brain action and mental phenomena requires a correspondence between the size of the brain and mental power and generally observation shows that the brains of those whose capacities are above the average are larger than those of the general run of their fellow men A study of the cuts and comparison of the sizes of different heads and their shape will prove very entertaining with most any group of persons intellectually inclined and it will be found that persons who are

Stanislaus of Poland then a young man came back from a journey the whole Lescinskian House gathered together at Lissa to receive him The schoolmaster Jablowsky prepared a festival in commemoration of the event and had it end with a ballet performed by thirteen students dressed as cavaliers Each had a shield upon which one of the letters of the words Domus Lescinia The Lescinskian House was written in gold After the first dance they stood in such a manner that their shields read Domus Lescinia after the second dance they changed order making it read Ades incolumnis Unharmed art thou here after the third Mane sidus loci Continue the star of this place after the fourth Sis coumna Dei Be a pillar of God and finally I scade solium Go ascend the throne Indeed these two words allow of one billion five hundred fifty six million seven hundred fifty five thousand two hundred transpositions yet that five of them convey independent and appropriate meanings is certainly very curious POINTS OF CRIMINAL LAW You cannot lawfully condone an offence by receiving back stolen property The exemption of females from arrest applies only in civil not in criminal matters Every man is bound to obey the call of a sheriff for assistance in making an arrest The rule Every man s house is his castle does not hold good when a man is accused of crime Embezzlement can be charged only against a clerk or servant or the officer or agent of a corporation Bigamy cannot be proven in law if one party to a marriage has been absent and not heard from for five years Grand larceny is when the value of property stolen exceeds twenty five dollars When less than that the offence is petit larceny Arson to be in the first degree must have been committed at night and the buildings fired must have been inhabited Drunkenness is not a legal excuse for crime but delirium tremens is considered by the law as a species of insanity In a case of assault it is only necessary to prove an offer or attempt at assault Battery presumes physical violence Mayhem although popularly supposed to refer to injury to the face lip tongue eye or ear applies to any injury done a limb A felony is a crime punishable by imprisonment in a State prison an infamous crime is one punishable with death or State prison A police officer is not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant unless he has personal knowledge of the offense for which the arrest is made An accident is not a crime unless criminal carelessness can be proven A man shooting at a burglar and killing a member of his family is not a murderer Burglary in the first degree can be committed only in the night time Twilight if dark enough to prevent distinguishing a man s face is the same as night in law Murder to be in the first degree must be willful premeditated and malicious or committed while the murderer is engaged in a felonious act The killing of a man in a duel is murder and it is a misdemeanor to accept or give a challenge False swearing is perjury in law only when willfully done and when the oath has been legally administered Such qualifying expressions as to the best of my belief as I am informed may save an averment from being perjured The law is that the false statement sworn to must be absolute Subornation of perjury is a felony TO TELL PURE WATER The color odor taste and purity of water can be ascertained as follows Fill a large bottle made of colorless glass with water look through the water at some black object Pour out some of the water and leave the bottle half full cork the bottle and place it for a few hours in a warm place shake up the water remove the cork and critically smell the air contained in the bottle If it has any smell particularly if the odor is repulsive the water should not be used for domestic purposes By heating the water an odor is evolved that would not otherwise appear Water fresh from the well is usually tasteless even if it contains a large amount of putrescible organic matter All water for domestic purposes should be perfectly tasteless and remain so even after it has been warmed since warming often develops a taste in water which is tasteless when cold HAND GRENADES Take chloride of calcium crude twenty parts common salt five parts and water seventy five parts Mix and put in thin bottles In case of fire a bottle so thrown that it will break in or very near the fire will put it out This mixture is better and cheaper than many of the high priced grenades sold for the purpose of fire protection HOW TO GET RID OF RATS Get a piece of lead pipe and use it as a funnel to introduce about one one two ounces of sulphite of potassium into any outside holes tenanted by rats Not to be used in dwellings To get rid of mice use tartar emetic mingled with any favorite food they will eat sicken and take their leave FRIENDLY ADVICE ON MANY SUBJECTS Tomato in Bright s Disease When Thomas Jefferson brought the tomato from France to America thinking that if it could be induced to grow bountifully it might make good feed for hogs he little dreamed of the benefit he was conferring upon posterity A constant diet of raw tomatoes and skim milk is said to be a certain cure for Bright s disease general Schenck who when Minister to England became a victim to that complaint was restored to health by two years of this regimen Relief for Asthma An old friend of the editor of this book writes I have been a sufferer from asthma for twenty five years and for more than a dozen years have used the following recipe with great benefit It is not a cure but in my case gives almost instant relief Take equal parts of powdered stramonium leaves and powdered belladonna leaves and mix thoroughly to each ten ounces of the mixture add one ounce of powdered saltpeter nitrate of potash mix all thoroughly I always keep some of this in a small tin box When I wish to use it I pour a little of the powder into the cover of the box light it with a match cover the whole with a little paper cone with the point cut off I place the point of the cone in my mouth and breathe the smoke into my lungs with the air The first trial is very hard it almost strangles but if persevered in will give great relief This is much better than stramonium alone The saltpeter makes it burn freely and also helps to give relief When my home was in Northern Indiana I used to buy the leaves in Chicago already powdered Now I send to New York I find it cheaper to do this than to gather and dry the leaves It is also almost impossible to dry and pulverize the leaves at home By using a paper cone and breathing through it little or no smoke is wasted and the box and paper can be carried in the pocket and used as occasion requires For Swollen Feet Policemen mail carriers and others whose occupation keeps them on their feet a great deal often are troubled with chafed sore and blistered feet especially in extremely hot weather no matter how comfortably their shoes may lit A powder

physician how certainly a cold may be broken up by a timely dose of quinine When first symptoms make their appearance when a little languor slight hoarseness and ominous tightening of the nasal membranes follow exposure to draughts or sudden chill by wet five grains of this useful alkaloid are sufficient in many cases to end the trouble But it must be done promptly If the golden moment passes nothing suffices to stop the weary sneezing handkerchief using red nose and woe begone looking periods that certainly follow A Mistaken Idea The old adage Feed a cold and starve a fever is characterized by the Journal of Health as very silly advice If anything the reverse would be nearer right When a person has a severe cold it is best for him to eat very lightly especially during the first few days of the attack Hints on Bathing There has been a great deal written about bathing The surface of the skin is punctured with millions of little holes called pores The duty of these pores is to carry the waste matter off For instance perspiration Now if these pores are stopped up they are of no use and the body has to find some other way to get rid of its impurities Then the liver has more than it can do Then we take a liver pill when we ought to clean out the pores instead The housewife is very particular to keep her sieves in good order after she has strained a substance through them they are washed out carefully with water because water is the best thing known That is the reason water is used to bathe in But the skin is a little different from a sieve because it is willing to help along the process itself All it needs is a little encouragement and it will accomplish wonders What the skin wants is rubbing If you should quietly sit down in a tub of water and as quietly get up and dry off without rubbing your skin wouldn t be much benefited The water would make it a little soft especially if it was warm But rubbing is the great thing Stand where the sunlight strikes a part of your body then take a dry brush and rub it and you will notice that countless little flakes of cuticle fly off Every time one of these flakes is removed from the skin your body breathes a sigh of relief An eminent German authority contends that too much bathing is a bad thing There is much truth in this Soap and water are good things to soften up the skin but rubbing is what the skin wants Every morning or every evening or when it is most convenient wash the body all over with water and a little ammonia or anything which tends to make the water soft then rub dry with a towel and after that go over the body from top to toe with a dry brush Try this for two or three weeks and your skin will be like velvet Tea and Coffee Tea is a nerve stimulant pure and simple acting like alcohol in this respect without any value that the latter may possess as a retarder of waste It has a special influence upon those nerve centers that supply will power exalting their sensibility beyond normal activity and may even produce hysterical symptoms if carried far enough Its active principle theine is an exceedingly powerful drug chiefly employed by nerve specialists as a pain destroyer possessing the singular quality of working toward the surface That is to say when a dose is administered hypodermically for sciatica for example the narcotic influence proceeds outward from the point of injection instead of inward toward the centers as does that of morphia atropia et cetera Tea is totally devoid of nutritive value and the habit of drinking it to excess which so many American women indulge in particularly in the country is to be deplored as a cause of our American nervousness Coffee on the contrary is a nerve food Like other concentrated foods of its class it operates as a stimulant also but upon a different set of nerves from tea Taken strong in the morning it often produces dizziness and that peculiar visual symptom of overstimulus which is called muscae volilantes dancing flies But this is an improper way to take it and rightly used it is perhaps the most valuable liquid addition to the morning meal Its active principle caffeine differs in all physiological respects from theine while it is chemically very closely allied and its limited consumption makes it impotent for harm To Straighten Round Shoulders A stooping figure and a halting gait accompanied by the unavoidable weakness of lungs incidental to a narrow chest may be entirely cured by the very simple and easily performed exercise of raising one s self upon the toes leisurely in a perpendicular position several times daily To take this exercise properly one must take a perfectly upright position With the heels together and the toes at an angle of forty five degrees Then drop the arms lifelessly by the sides animating and raising the chest to its full capacity and muscularity the chin well drawn in and the crown of the head feeling as if attached to a string suspended from the ceiling above Slowly rise upon the balls of both feet to the greatest possible height thereby exercising all the muscles of the legs and body come again into standing position without swaying the body backward out of the perfect line Repeat this same exercise first on one foot then on the other It is wonderful what a straightening out power this exercise has upon round shoulders and crooked backs and one will be surprised to note how soon the lungs begin to show the effect of such expansive development Care of the Eyes In consequence of the increase of affections of the eye a specialist has recently formulated the following rules to be observed in the care of the eyes for school work A comfortable temperature dry and warm feet good ventilation clothing at the neck and on other parts of the body loose posture erect and never read lying down or stooping Little study before breakfast or directly after a heavy meal none at all at twilight or late at night use great caution about studying after recovery from fevers have light abundant but not dazzling not allowing the sun to shine on desks or on objects in front of the scholars and letting the light come from the left hand or left and rear hold book at right angles to the line of sight or nearly so give eyes frequent rest by looking up The distance of the book from the eye should be about fifteen inches The usual indication of strain is redness of the rim of the eyelid betokening a congested state of the inner surface which may be accompanied with some pain When the eye tires easily rest is not the proper remedy but the use of glasses of sufficient power to aid in accommodating the eye to vision How and When to Drink Water According to Doctor Leuf when water is taken into the full or partly full stomach it does not mingle with the food as we are taught but passes along quickly between the food and lesser curvature toward the pylorus through which it passes into the intestines The secretion of mucus by the lining membrane is constant and during the night a considerable amount accumulates in the stomach some of its liquid portion is absorbed and that which remains is thick and tenacious If food is taken into the stomach when in this condition it becomes coated with this mucus and the secretion of the gastric juice and its action are delayed These facts show the value of a goblet of water before breakfast This washes out the tenacious mucus and stimulates the gastric glands to secretion In old and feeble persons water should not be taken cold but it may be with great advantage taken warm or hot This removal of the accumulated mucus from the stomach is probably one of the reasons why taking soup at the beginning of a meal has been found so beneficial What Causes Coughs Cold and coughs are prevalent throughout the country but throat affections are by far more common among business men Every unfortunate one mutters something about the abominable weather and curses the piercing wind Much of the trouble however is caused by overheated rooms and a little more attention to proper ventilation would remove the cause of suffering Doctor J Ewing Mears who was thus afflicted said to an inquirer The huskiness and loss of power of articulation so common among us are largely due to the use of steam for heating The steam cannot be properly regulated and the temperature becomes too high A person living in this atmosphere has all the cells of the lungs open and when he passes into the open air he is unduly exposed The affliction is quite common among the men who occupy offices in the new buildings which are fitted up with all modern improvements The substitution of electric light for gas has wrought a change to which people have not yet adapted themselves The heat arising from a number of gas jets will quickly raise the temperature of a room and unconsciously people rely upon that means of heating to some extent Very little warmth however is produced by the electric light and when a man reads by an incandescent light he at times finds himself becoming chilly and wonders why it is Too hot during the day and too cold at night are conditions which should be avoided PHYSICAL EXERCISE The principal methods of developing the physique now prescribed by trainers are exercise with dumbbells the bar bell and the chest weight The rings and horizontal and parallel bars are also used but not nearly to the extent that they formerly were The movement has been all in the direction of the simplification of apparatus in fact one well known teacher of the Boston Gymnasium when asked his opinion said Four bare walls and a floor with a well posted instructor is all that is really required for a gymnasium Probably the most important as well as the simplest appliance for gymnasium work is the wooden dumbbell which has displaced the ponderous iron bell of former days Its weight is from three quarters of a pound to a pound and a half and with one in each hand a variety of motions can be gone through which are of immense benefit in building up or toning down every muscle and all vital parts of the body The first object of an instructor in taking a beginner in hand is to increase the circulation This is done by exercising the extremities the first movement being one of the hands after which come the wrists then the arms and next the head and feet As the circulation is increased the necessity for a larger supply of oxygen technically called oxygen hunger is created which is only satisfied by breathing exercises which develop the lungs After the circulation is in a satisfactory condition the dumbbell instructor turns his attention to exercising the great muscles of the body beginning with those of the back strengthening which holds the body erect thus increasing the chest capacity invigorating the digestive organs and in fact all the vital functions By the use of very light weights an equal and symmetrical development of all parts of the body is obtained and then there are no sudden demands on the heart and lungs After the dumbbell comes exercise with the round or bar bell This is like the dumbbell with the exception that the bar connecting the balls is four or five feet instead of a few inches in length Bar bells weigh from one to two pounds each and are found most useful in building up the respiratory and digestive systems their especial province being the strengthening of the erector muscles and increasing the flexibility of the chest Of all fixed apparatus in use the pulley weight stands easily first in importance These weights are available for a greater variety of objects than any other gymnastic appliance and can be used either for general exercise or for strengthening such muscles as most require it With them a greater localization is possible than with the dumbbell and for this reason they are recommended as a kind of supplement to the latter As chest developers and correctors of round shoulders they are most effective As the name implies they are simply weights attached to ropes which pass over pulleys and are provided with handles The common pulley is placed at about the height of the shoulder of an average man but recently those which can be adjusted to any desired height have been very generally introduced When more special localization is desired than can be obtained by means of the ordinary apparatus what is known as the double action chest weight is used This differs from the ordinary kind in being provided with several pulleys so that the strain may come at different angles Double action weights may be divided into three classes high low and side pulleys each with its particular use The highest of all known as the giant pulleys are made especially for developing the muscles of the back and chest and by stretching or elongating movements to increase the interior capacity of the chest If the front of the chest is full and the back or side chest deficient the pupil is set to work on the giant pulley To build up the side walls he stands with the back to the pulley box and the left heel resting against it the handle is grasped in the right hand if the right side of the chest is lacking in development and then drawn straight down by the side a step forward with the right foot as long as possible is taken the line brought as far to the front and near the floor as can be done and then the arm held stiff allowed to be drawn solely up by the weight To exercise the left side the same process is gone through with the handle grasped in the left hand Another kind of giant pulley is that which allows the operator to stand directly under it and is used for increasing the lateral diameter of the chest The handles are drawn straight down by the sides the arms are then spread and drawn back by the weights Generally speaking high pulleys are most used for correcting high round shoulders low pulleys for low round shoulders side pulleys for individual high or low shoulders and giant pulleys for the development of the walls of the chest and to correct spinal curvature The traveling rings a line of iron rings covered with rubber and attached to long ropes fastened to the ceiling some ten feet apart are also valuable in developing the muscles of the back arms and sides The first ring is grasped in one hand and a spring taken from an elevated platform The momentum carries the gymnast to the next ring which is seized with the free hand and so the entire length of the line is traversed The parallel bars low and high the flying rings the horizontal bar and the trapeze all have their uses but of late years they have been relegated to a position of distinct inferiority to that now occupied by the dumbbells and pulley weights ACCIDENTS AND EMERGENCIES What To Do If an artery is cut red blood spurts Compress it above the wound If a vein is cut dark blood flows Compress it below and above If choked go upon all fours and cough For slight burns dip the part in cold water if the skin is destroyed cover with varnish or linseed oil For apoplexy raise the head and body for fainting lay the person flat Send for a physician when a serious accident of any kind occurs but treat as directed until he arrives Scalds and Burns The following facts cannot be too firmly impressed on the mind of the reader that in either of these accidents the first best and often the only remedies required are sheets of wadding fine wool or carded cotton and in the default of these violet powder flour magnesia or chalk The object for which these several articles are employed is the same in each instance namely to exclude the air from the injured part for if the air can be effectually shut out from the raw surface and care is taken not to expose the tender part till the new cuticle is formed the cure may be safely left to nature The moment a person is called to a case of scald or burn he should cover the part with a sheet or a portion of a sheet of wadding taking care not to break any blister that may have formed or stay to remove any burnt clothes that may adhere to the surface but as quickly as possible envelop every part of the injury from all access of the air laying one or two more pieces of wadding on the first so as effectually to guard the burn or scald from the irritation of the atmosphere and if the article used is wool or cotton the same precaution of adding more material where the surface is thinly covered must be adopted a light bandage finally securing all in their places Any of the popular remedies recommended below may be employed when neither wool cotton nor wadding are to be procured it being always remembered that that article which will best exclude the air from a burn or scald is the best quickest and least painful mode of treatment And in this respect nothing has surpassed cotton loose or attached to paper as in wadding If the Skin is Much Injured in burns spread some linen pretty thickly with chalk ointment and lay over the part and give the patient some brandy and water if much exhausted then send for a medical man If not much injured and very painful use the same ointment or apply carded cotton dipped in lime water and linseed oil If you please you may lay cloths dipped in ether over the parts or cold lotions Treat scalds in same manner or cover with scraped raw potato but the chalk ointment is the best In the absence of all these cover the injured part with treacle and dust over it plenty of flour BODY IN FLAMES Lay the person down on the floor of the room and throw the table cloth rug or other large cloth over him and roll him on the floor DIRT IN THE EYE Place your forefinger upon the cheek bone having the patient before you then slightly bend the finger this will draw down the lower lid of the eye and you will probably be able to remove the dirt but if this will not enable you to get at it repeat this operation while you have a knitting needle or bodkin placed over the eyelid this will turn it inside out and enable you to remove the sand or eyelash et cetera with the corner of a fine silk handkerchief As soon as the substance is removed bathe the eye with cold water and exclude the light for a day If the inflammation is severe let the patient use a refrigerant lotion LIME IN THE EVE Syringe it well with warm vinegar and water in the proportion of one ounce of vinegar to eight ounces of water exclude light IRON OR STEEL SPICULAE IN THE EYE These occur while turning iron or steel in a lathe and are best remedied by doubling back the upper or lower eyelid according to the situation of the substance and with the flat edge of a silver probe taking up the metallic particle using a lotion made by dissolving six grains of sugar of lead and the same of white vitriol in six ounces of water and bathing the eye three times a day till the inflammation subsides Another plan is Drop a solution of sulphate of copper from one to three grains of salt to one ounce of water into the eye or keep the eye open in a wineglassful of the solution Bathe with cold lotion and exclude light to keep down inflammation DISLOCATED THUMB This is frequently produced by a fall Make a clove hitch by passing two loops of cord over the thumb placing a piece of rag under the cord to prevent it cutting the thumb then pull in the same line as the thumb Afterwards apply a cold lotion CUTS AND WOUNDS Clean cut wounds whether deep or superficial and likely to heal by the first intention should always be washed or cleaned and at once evenly and smoothly closed by bringing both edges close together and securing them in that position by adhesive plaster Cut thin strips of sticking plaster and bring the parts together or if large and deep cut two broad pieces so as to look like the teeth of a comb and place one on each side of the wound which must be cleaned previously These pieces must be arranged so that they shall interlace one another then by laying hold of the pieces on the right side with one hand and those on the other side with the other hand and pulling them from one another the edges of the wounds are brought together without any difficulty Ordinary Cuts are dressed by thin strips applied by pressing down the plaster on one side of the wound and keeping it there and pulling in the opposite direction then suddenly depressing the hand when the edges of the wound are brought together CONTUSIONS are best healed by laying a piece of folded lint well wetted with extract of lead or boracic acid on the part and if there is much pain placing a hot bran poultice over the dressing repeating both if necessary every two hours When the injuries are very severe lay a cloth over the part and suspend a basin over it filled with cold lotion Put a piece of cotton into the basin so that it shall allow the lotion to drop on the cloth and thus keep it always wet HEMORRHAGE when caused by an artery being divided or torn may be known by the blood issuing out of the wound in leaps or jerks and being of a bright scarlet color If a vein is injured the blood is darker and flows continuously To arrest the latter apply pressure by means of a compress and bandage To arrest arterial bleeding get a piece of wood part of a broom handle will do and tie a piece of tape to one end of it Then tie a piece of tape loosely over the arm and pass the other end of the wood under it twist the stick around and around until the tape compresses the arm sufficiently to arrest the bleeding and then confine the other end by tying the string around the arm A compress made by enfolding a penny piece in several folds of lint or linen should however be first placed under the tape and over the artery If the bleeding is very obstinate and it occurs in the arm place a cork underneath the string on the inside of the fleshy part where the artery may be felt beating by any one if in the leg place a cork in the direction of a line drawn from the inner part of the knee toward the outer part of the groin It is an excellent thing to accustom yourself to find out the position of these arteries or indeed any that are superficial and to explain to every person in your house where they are and how to stop bleeding If a stick cannot be got take a handkerchief make a cord bandage of it and tie a knot in the middle the knot acts as a compress and should be placed over the artery while the two ends are c around the thumb Observe always to place the ligature between the wound and the heart Putting your finger into a bleeding wound and making pressure until a surgeon arrives will generally stop violent bleeding BLEEDING FROM THE NOSE from whatever cause may generally be stopped by putting a plug of lint into the nostrils if this does not do apply a cold lotion to the forehead raise the head and place over it both arms so that it will rest on the hands dip the lint plug slightly moistened into some powdered gum arabic and plug the nostrils again or dip the plug into equal parts of powdered gum arabic and alum and plug the nose Or the plug may be dipped in Friar s balsam or tincture of kino Heat should be applied to the feet and in obstinate cases the sudden shock of a cold key or cold water poured down the spine will often instantly stop the bleeding If the bowels are confined take a purgative Injections of alum solution from a small syringe into the nose will often stop hemorrhage VIOLENT SHOCKS will sometimes stun a person and he will remain unconscious Untie strings collars et cetera loosen anything that is tight and interferes with the breathing raise the head see if there is bleeding from any part apply smelling salts to the nose and hot bottles to the feet IN CONCUSSION the surface of the body is cold and pale and the pulse weak and small the breathing slow and gentle and the pupil of the eye generally contracted or small You can get an answer by speaking loud so as to arouse the patient Give a little brandy and water keep the place quiet apply warmth and do not raise the head too high If you tickle the feet the patient feels it IN COMPRESSION OF THE BRAIN from any cause such as apoplexy or a piece of fractured bone pressing on it there is loss of sensation If you tickle the feet of the injured person he does not feel it You cannot arouse him so as to get an answer The pulse is slow and labored the breathing deep labored and snorting the pupil enlarged Raise the head loosen strings or tight things and send for a surgeon If one cannot be got at once apply mustard poultices to the feet and thighs leeches to the temples and hot water to the feet CHOKING When a person has a fish bone in the throat insert the forefinger press upon the root of the tongue so as to induce vomiting if this does not do let him swallow a large piece of potato or soft bread and if these fail give a mustard emetic FAINTING HYSTERICS et cetera Loosen the garments bathe the temples with water or eau de Cologne open the window admit plenty of fresh air dash cold water on the face apply hot bricks to the feet and avoid bustle and excessive sympathy DROWNING Attend to the following essential rules one Lose no time two Handle the body gently three Carry the body face downward with the head gently raised and never hold it up by the feet four Send for medical assistance immediately and in the meantime act as follows five Strip the body rub it dry then wrap it in hot blankets and place it in a warm bed in a warm room six Cleanse away the froth and mucus from the nose and month seven Apply warm bricks bottles bags of sand et cetera to the armpits between the thighs and to the soles of the feet eight Rub the surface of the body with the hands inclosed in warm dry worsted socks nine If possible put the body into a warm bath ten To restore breathing put the pipe of a common bellows into one nostril carefully closing the other and the mouth at the same time drawing downward and pushing gently backward the upper part of the windpipe to allow a more free admission of air blow the bellows gently in order to inflate the lungs till the breast be raised a little then set the month and nostrils free and press gently on the chest repeat this until signs of life appear The body should be covered the moment it is placed on the table except the face and all the rubbing carried on under the sheet or blanket When they can be obtained a number of tiles or bricks should be made tolerably hot in the fire laid in a row on the table covered with a blanket and the body placed in such a manner on them that their heat may enter the spine When the patient revives apply smelling salts to the nose give warm wine or brandy and water Cautions one Never rub the body with salt or spirits two Never roll the body on casks three Continue the remedies for twelve hours without ceasing HANGING Loosen the cord or whatever it may be by which the person has been suspended Open the temporal artery or jugular vein or bleed from the arm employ electricity if at hand and proceed as for drowning APPARENT DEATH FROM DRUNKENNESS Raise the head loosen the clothes maintain warmth of surface and give a mustard emetic as soon as the person can swallow APOPLEXY AND FITS GENERALLY Raise the head loosen all tight clothes strings et cetera apply cold lotions to the head and send for a surgeon SUFFOCATION FROM NOXIOUS GASES et cetera Remove to the fresh air dash cold vinegar and water in the face neck and breast keep up the warmth of the body if necessary apply mustard poultices to the soles of the feet and to the spine and try artificial respirations as in drowning with electricity LIGHTNING AND SUNSTROKE Treat the same as apoplexy POISONS AND THEIR ANTIDOTES General Rules Always send immediately for a medical man Save all fluids vomited and articles of food cups glasses et cetera used by the patient before taken ill and lock them up As a rule give emetics after poisons that cause sleepiness and raving chalk milk eggs butter and warm water or oil after poisons that cause vomiting and pain in the stomach and bowels with purging and when there is no inflammation about the throat tickle it with a feather to excite vomiting Vomiting may be caused by giving warm water with a teaspoonful of mustard to the tumblerful well stirred up Sulphate of zinc white vitriol may be used in place of the mustard or powdered alum Powder of ipecacuanha a teaspoonful rubbed up with molasses may be employed for children Tartar emetic should never be given as it is excessively depressing and uncontrollable in its effects The stomach pump can only be used by skillful hands and even then with caution Opium and other Narcotics After vomiting has occurred cold water should be dashed over the face and head The patient must be kept awake walked about between two strong persons made to grasp the handles of a galvanic battery dosed with strong coffee and vigorously slapped Belladonna is an antidote for opium and for morphia et cetera its active principles and on the other hand the latter counteract the effects of belladonna But a knowledge of medicine is necessary for dealing with these articles Strychnia After emetics have been freely and successfully given the patient should be allowed to breathe the vapor of sulphuric ether poured on a handkerchief and held to the face in such quantities as to keep down the tendency to convulsions Bromide of potassium twenty grains at a dose dissolved in syrup may be given every hour Alcoholic Poisoning should be combated by emetics of which the sulphate of zinc given as above directed is the best After that strong coffee internally and stimulation by heat externally should be used Acids are sometimes swallowed by mistake Alkalies lime water magnesia or common chalk mixed with water may be freely given and afterward mucilaginous drinks such as thick gum water or flaxseed tea Alkalies are less frequently taken in injurious strength or quantity but sometimes children swallow lye by mistake Common vinegar may be given freely and then castor or sweet oil in full doses a tablespoonful at a time repeated every half hour or two Nitrate of silver when swallowed is neutralized by common table salt freely given in solution in water The salts of mercury or arsenic often kept as bedbug poison which are powerful irritants are apt to be very quickly fatal Milk or the whites of eggs may be freely given and afterward a very thin paste of flour and water In these cases an emetic is to be given after the poison is neutralized Phosphorus paste kept for roach poison or in parlor matches is sometimes eaten by children and has been willfully taken for the purpose of suicide It is a powerful irritant The first thing to be done is to give freely of magnesia and water then to give mucilaginous drinks as flaxseed tea gum water or sassafras pith and water and lastly to administer finely powdered bone charcoal either in pill or in mixture with water In no case of poisoning should there be any avoidable delay in obtaining the advice of a physician and meanwhile the friends or bystanders should endeavor to find out exactly what has been taken so that the treatment adopted may be as prompt and effective as possible KEEP STILL Keep still When trouble is brewing keep still Even when slander is getting on its legs keep still When your feelings are hurt keep still till you recover from your excitement at any rate Things look differently through an unagitated eye A doctor relates how once in a commotion he wrote a letter and sent it and wished he had not I had another commotion and wrote a long letter but life had rubbed a little sense into me I kept that letter in my pocket against the day when I could look it over without agitation and without tears I was glad I did Less and less it seemed necessary to send it I was not sure it would do any hurt but in my doubt I leaned to reticence and eventually it was destroyed PHILOSOPHICAL FACTS The greatest height at which visible clouds ever exist does not exceed ten miles Air is about eight hundred and fifteen times lighter than water The pressure of the atmosphere upon every square foot of the earth amounts to two thousand one hundred and sixty pounds The violence of the expansion of water when freezing is sufficient to cleave a globe of copper of such thickness as to require a force of twenty seven thousand pounds to produce the same effect During the conversion of ice into water one hundred and forty degrees of heat are absorbed Water when converted into steam increases in bulk eighteen hundred times In one second of time in one beat of the pendulum of a clock light travels two hundred thousand miles Were a cannon ball shot toward the sun and were it to maintain full speed it would be twenty years in reaching it and yet light travels through this space in seven or eight minutes Strange as it may appear a ball of a ton weight and another of the same material of an ounce weight falling from any height will reach the ground at the same time The heat does not increase as we rise above the earth nearer to the sun but decreases rapidly until beyond the regions of the atmosphere in void it is estimated that the cold is about seventy degrees below zero The line of perpetual frost at the equator is fifteen thousand feet altitude thirteen thousand feet between the tropics and nine thousand to four thousand between the latitudes of forty degrees and forty nine degrees At a depth of forty five feet under ground the temperature of the earth is uniform throughout the year The human ear is so extremely sensitive that it can hear a sound that lasts only the twenty four thousandth part of a second Sound travels at the rate of one thousand one hundred and forty two feet per second about thirteen miles in a minute So that if we hear a clap of thunder half a minute after the flash we may calculate that the discharge of electricity is six and a half miles off ALPHABETICAL INDEX Accent and Pronunciation Accidents and Emergencies Aeronautics Dictionary of Age To Tell of Any Person
