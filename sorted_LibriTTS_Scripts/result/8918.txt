confusion to the man who invented the fifth act of a play He who has edited an extensive work and has concluded his labours by the preparation of a copious index might well be pardoned if he omitted to include the inventor of the Preface among the benefactors of mankind The long and arduous task that years before he had set himself to do is done and the last thing that he desires is to talk about it Liberty is what he asks for liberty to range for a time wherever he pleases in the wide and fair fields of literature Yet with this longing for freedom comes a touch of regret and a doubt lest the fresh woods and pastures new may never wear the friendly and familiar face of the plot of ground within whose narrower confines he has so long been labouring and whose every corner he knows so well May be he finds hope in the thought that should his new world seem strange to him and uncomfortable ere long he may be called back to his old task and in the preparation of a second edition find the quiet and the peace of mind that are often found alone in old use and wont With me the preparation of these volumes has indeed been the work of many years Boswell s Life of Johnson I read for the first time in my boyhood when I was too young for it to lay any hold on me When I entered Pembroke College Oxford though I loved to think that Johnson had been there before me yet I cannot call to mind that I ever opened the pages of Boswell By a happy chance I was turned to the study of the literature of the eighteenth century Every week we were required by the rules of the College to turn into Latin or what we called Latin a passage from The Spectator Many a happy minute slipped by while in forgetfulness of my task I read on and on in its enchanting pages It was always with a sigh that at last I tore myself away and sat resolutely down to write bad Latin instead of reading good English From Addison in the course of time I passed on to the other great writers of his and the succeeding age finding in their exquisitely clear style their admirable common sense and their freedom from all the tricks of affectation a delightful contrast to so many of the eminent authors of our own time Those troublesome doubts doubts of all kinds which since the great upheaval of the French Revolution have harassed mankind had scarcely begun to ruffle the waters of their life Even Johnson s troubled mind enjoyed vast levels of repose The unknown world alone was wrapped in stormy gloom of this world all the complaints which were made were unjust one Though I was now familiar with many of the great writers yet Boswell I had scarcely opened since my boyhood A happy day came just eighteen years ago when in an old book shop almost under the shadow of a great cathedral I bought a second hand copy of a somewhat early edition of the Life in five well bound volumes Of all my books none I cherish more than these In looking at them I have known what it is to feel Bishop Percy s uneasiness at the thoughts of leaving his books in death two They became my almost inseparable companions Before long I began to note the parallel passages and allusions not only in their pages but in the various authors whom I studied Yet in these early days I never dreamt of preparing a new edition It fell to my lot as time went on to criticise in some of our leading publications works that bore both on Boswell and Johnson Such was my love for the subject that on one occasion when I was called upon to write a review that should fall two columns of a weekly newspaper I read a new edition of the Life from beginning to end without I believe missing a single line of the text or a single note At length towering in the confidence three of one who as yet has but set his foot on the threshold of some stately mansion in which he hopes to find for himself a home I was rash enough more than twelve years ago to offer myself as editor of a new edition of Boswell s Life of Johnson Fortunately for me another writer had been already engaged by the publisher to whom I applied and my offer was civilly declined From that time on I never lost sight of my purpose but when in the troubles of life I well nigh lost sight of every kind of hope Everything in my reading that bore on my favourite author was carefully noted till at length I felt that the materials which I had gathered from all sides were sufficient to shield me from a charge of rashness if I now began to raise the building Much of the work of preparation had been done at a grievous disadvantage My health more than once seemed almost hopelessly broken down Nevertheless even then the time was not wholly lost In the sleepless hours of many a winter night I almost forgot my miseries in the delightful pages of Horace Walpole s Letters and with pencil in hand and some little hope still in heart managed to get a few notes taken Three winters I had to spend on the shores of the Mediterranean During two of them my malady and my distress allowed of no rival and my work made scarcely any advance The third my strength was returning and in the six months that I spent three years ago in San Remo I wrote out very many of the notes which 
1271_136861_000027_000005	train-clean-360	I am 
none	none	now submitting to my readers An interval of some years of comparative health that I enjoyed between my two severest illnesses allowed me to try my strength as a critic and an editor In Dr Johnson His Friends and his Critics which I published in the year eighteen seventy eight I reviewed the judgments passed on Johnson and Boswell by Lord Macaulay and mister Carlyle I described Oxford as it was known to Johnson and I threw light on more than one important passage in the Life The following year I edited Boswell s Journal of a Tour to Corsica and his curious correspondence with the honorable Andrew Erskine The somewhat rare little volume in which are contained the lively but impudent letters that passed between these two friends I had found one happy day in an old book stall underneath the town hall of Keswick I hoped that among the almost countless readers of Boswell there would be many who would care to study in one of the earliest attempts of his joyous youth the man whose ripened genius was to place him at the very head of all the biographers of whom the world can boast My hopes were increased by the elegance and the accuracy of the typography with which my publishers Messrs De La Rue company adorned this reprint I was disappointed in my expectations These curious Letters met with a neglect which they did not deserve Twice moreover I was drawn away from the task that I had set before me by other works By the death of my uncle Sir Rowland Hill I was called upon to edit his History of the Penny Postage and to write his Life Later on General Gordon s correspondence during the first six years of his government of the Soudan was entrusted to me to prepare for the press In my Colonel Gordon in Central Africa I attempted to do justice to the rare genius to the wise and pure enthusiasm and to the exalted beneficence of that great man The labour that I gave to these works was as regards my main purpose by no means wholly thrown away I was trained by it in the duties of an editor and by studying the character of two such men who though wide as the poles asunder in many things were as devoted to truth and accuracy as they were patient in their pursuit I was strengthened in my hatred of carelessness and error With all these interruptions the summer of eighteen eighty five was upon me before I was ready for the compositors to make a beginning with my work In revising my proofs very rarely indeed have I contented myself in verifying my quotations with comparing them merely with my own manuscript In almost all instances I have once more examined the originals Diligence and accuracy writes Gibbon are the only merits which an historical writer may ascribe to himself if any merit indeed can be assumed from the performance of an indispensable duty four By diligence and accuracy I have striven to win for myself a place in Johnson s school a school distinguished as Sir Joshua Reynolds said for a love of truth and accuracy five I have steadily set before myself Boswell s example where he says Let me only observe as a specimen of my trouble that I have sometimes been obliged to run half over London in order to fix a date correctly which when I had accomplished I well knew would obtain me no praise though a failure would have been to my discredit six When the variety and the number of my notes are considered when it is known that a great many of the authors I do not myself possess but that they could only be examined in the Bodleian or the British Museum it will be seen that the labour of revising the proofs was indeed unusually severe In the course of the eighteen months during which they have been passing through the press fresh reading has given fresh information and caused many an addition and not a few corrections moreover to be made in passages which I had previously presumed to think already complete Had it been merely the biography of a great man of letters that I was illustrating such anxious care would scarcely have been needful But Boswell s Life of Johnson as its author with just pride boasts on its title page exhibits a view of literature and literary men in Great Britain for near half a century during which Johnson flourished Wide indeed is the gulf by which this half century is separated from us The reaction against the thought and style of the age over which Pope ruled in its prime and Johnson in its decline this reaction wise as it was in many ways and extravagant as it was perhaps in more is very far from having spent its force Young men are still far too often found in our Universities who think that one proof of their originality is a contempt of authors whose writings they have never read Books which were in the hands of almost every reader of the Life when it first appeared are now read only by the curious Allusions and quotations which once fell upon a familiar and a friendly ear now fall dead Men whose names were known to every one now often have not even a line in a Dictionary of Biography Over manners too a change has come and as Johnson justly observes all works which describe manners require notes in sixty or seventy years or less seven But it is not only Boswell s narrative that needs illustration Johnson in his talk ranges over a vast number of subjects In his capacious memory were stored up the fruits of an almost boundless curiosity and a wide and varied reading I have sought to follow him wherever a remark of his required illustration and have read through many a book that I might trace to its source a reference or an allusion I have examined moreover all the minor writings which are attributed to him by Boswell but which are not for the most part included in his collected works In some cases I have ventured to set my judgment against Boswell s and have refused to admit that Johnson was the author of the feeble pieces which were fathered on him Once or twice in the course of my reading I have come upon essays which had escaped the notice of his biographer but which bear the marks of his workmanship To these I have given a reference While the minute examination that I have so often had to make of Boswell s narrative has done nothing but strengthen my trust in his statements and my admiration of his laborious truthfulness yet in one respect I have not found him so accurate as I had expected I have he says been extremely careful as to the exactness of my quotations eight Though in preparing his manuscript he referred in each case to the originals yet he did not I conjecture examine them once more in revising his proof sheets At all events he has allowed errors to slip in These I have pointed out in my notes for in every case where I could I have I believe verified his quotations I have not thought that it was my duty as an editor to attempt to refute or even to criticise Johnson s arguments The story is told that when Peter the Great was on his travels and far from his country some members of the Russian Council of State in saint Petersburgh ventured to withstand what was known to be his wish His walking stick was laid upon the table and silence at once fell upon all In like manner before that editor who should trouble himself and his readers with attempting to refute Johnson s arguments paradoxical as they often were should be placed Reynolds s portrait of that labouring working mind nine It might make him reflect that if the mighty reasoner could rise up and meet him face to face he would be sure on which ever side the right might be even if at first his pistol missed fire to knock him down with the butt end of it ten I have attempted therefore not to criticise but to illustrate Johnson s statements I have compared them with the opinions of the more eminent men among his contemporaries and with his own as they are contained in other parts of his Life and in his writings It is in his written works that his real opinion can be most surely found He owned he sometimes talked for victory he was too conscientious to make error permanent and pernicious by deliberately writing it eleven My numerous extracts from the eleven volumes of his collected works will I trust not only give a truer insight into the nature of the man but also will show the greatness of the author to a generation of readers who have wandered into widely different paths In my attempts to trace the quotations of which both Johnson and Boswell were somewhat lavish I have not in every case been successful though I have received liberal assistance from more than one friend In one case my long search was rewarded by the discovery that Boswell was quoting himself That I have lighted upon the beautiful lines which Johnson quoted when he saw the Highland girl singing at her wheel twelve and have found out who was one Giffard or rather Gifford a parson is to me a source of just triumph I have not known many happier hours than the one in which in the Library of the British Museum my patient investigation was rewarded and I perused Contemplation Fifteen hitherto unpublished letters of Johnson thirteen his college composition in Latin prose fourteen a long extract from his manuscript diary fifteen a suppressed passage in his Journey to the Western Islands sixteen Boswell s letters of acceptance of the office of Secretary for Foreign Correspondence to the Royal Academy seventeen the proposal for the publication of a Geographical Dictionary issued by Johnson s beloved friend doctor Bathurst eighteen and mister Recorder Longley s record of his conversation with Johnson on Greek metres nineteen will I trust throw some lustre on this edition In many notes I have been able to clear up statements in the text which were not fully understood even by the author or were left intentionally dark by him or have become obscure through lapse of time I would particularly refer to the light that I have thrown on Johnson s engaging in politics with William Gerard Hamilton twenty and on Burke s talk of retiring twenty one In many other notes I have established Boswell s accuracy against attacks which had been made on it apparently with success It was with much pleasure that I discovered that the story told of Johnson s listening to doctor Sacheverel s sermon is not in any way improbable twenty two and that Johnson s censure of Lord Kames was quite just twenty three The ardent advocates of total abstinence will not I fear be pleased at finding at the end of my long note on Johnson s wine drinking that I have been obliged to show that he thought that the gout from which he suffered was due to his temperance I hope you persevere in drinking he wrote to his friend doctor Taylor My opinion is that I have drunk too little twenty four In the Appendices I have generally treated of subjects which demanded more space than could be given them in the narrow limits of a foot note In the twelve pages of the essay on Johnson s Debates in Parliament twenty five I have compressed the result of the reading of many weeks In examining the character of George Psalmanazar twenty six I have complied with the request of an unknown correspondent who was naturally interested in the history of that strange man after whom Johnson sought the most twenty seven In my essay on Johnson s Travels and Love of Travelling twenty eight I have in opposition to Lord Macaulay s wild and wanton rhetoric shown how ardent and how elevated was the curiosity with which Johnson s mind was possessed In another essay I have explained I do not say justified his strong feelings towards the founders of the United States twenty nine and in a fifth I have examined the election of the Lord Mayors of London at a time when the City was torn by political strife thirty To the other Appendices it is not needful particularly to refer In my Index which has cost me many months heavy work while I bore burdens with dull patience and beat the track of the alphabet with sluggish resolution thirty one I have I hope shown that I am not unmindful of all that I owe to men of letters To the dead we cannot pay the debt of gratitude that is their due Some relief is obtained from its burthen if we in our turn make the men of our own generation debtors to us The plan on which my Index is made will I trust be found convenient By the alphabetical arrangement in the separate entries of each article the reader I venture to think will be greatly facilitated in his researches Certain subjects I have thought it best to form into groups Under America France Ireland London Oxford Paris and Scotland are gathered together almost all the references to those subjects The provincial towns of France however by some mistake I did not include in the general article One important but intentional omission I must justify In the case of the quotations in which my notes abound I have not thought it needful in the Index to refer to the book unless the eminence of the author required a separate and a second entry My labour would have been increased beyond all endurance and my Index have been swollen almost into a monstrosity had I always referred to the book as well as to the matter which was contained in the passage that I extracted Though in such a variety of subjects there must be many omissions yet I shall be greatly disappointed if actual errors are discovered Every entry I have made myself and every entry I have verified in the proof sheets not by comparing it with my manuscript but by turning to the reference in the printed volumes Some indulgence nevertheless may well be claimed and granted If Homer at times nods an index maker may be pardoned should he in the fourth or fifth month of his task at the end of a day of eight hours work grow drowsy May I fondly hope that to the maker of so large an Index will be extended the gratitude which Lord Bolingbroke says was once shown to lexicographers I approve writes his Lordship the devotion of a studious man at Christ Church who was overheard in his oratory entering into a detail with God and acknowledging the divine goodness in furnishing the world with makers of dictionaries thirty two In the list that I give in the beginning of the sixth volume of the books which I quote the reader will find stated in full the titles which in the notes through regard to space I was forced to compress The Concordance of Johnson s sayings which follows the Index thirty three will be found convenient by the literary man who desires to make use of his strong and pointed utterances Next to Shakespeare he is I believe quoted and misquoted the most frequently of all our writers It is not every man that can carry a bon mot thirty four Bons mots that are miscarried of all kinds of good things suffer the most In this Concordance the general reader moreover may find much to delight him Johnson s trade was wit and wisdom thirty five and some of his best wares are here set out in a small space It was I must confess with no little pleasure that in revising my proof sheets I found that the last line in my Concordance and the last line in my six long volumes is Johnson s quotation of Goldsmith s fine saying I do not love a man who is zealous for nothing In the forward references in the notes to other passages in the book the reader may be surprised at finding that while often I only give the date under which the reference will be found frequently I am able to quote the page and volume The explanation is a simple one two sets of compositors were generally at work and two volumes were passing through the press simultaneously In the selection of the text which I should adopt I hesitated for some time In ordinary cases the edition which received the author s final revision is the one which all future editors should follow The second edition which was the last that was brought out in Boswell s life time could not I became convinced be conveniently reproduced As it was passing through the press he obtained many additional anecdotes and letters These he somewhat awkwardly inserted in an Introduction and an Appendix He was engaged on his third edition when he died He had pointed out where some of these materials should be inserted and in the margin of the copy which he had in part revised he had written notes thirty six His interrupted labours were completed by Edmond Malone to whom he had read aloud almost the whole of his original manuscript and who had helped him in the revision of the first half of the book when it was in type thirty seven These notes says Malone are faithfully preserved He adds that every new remark not written by the author for the sake of distinction has been enclosed within crotchets thirty eight In the third edition therefore we have the work in the condition in which it would have most approved itself to Boswell s own judgment In one point only and that a trifling one had Malone to exercise his judgment But so skilful an editor was very unlikely to go wrong in those few cases in which he was called upon to insert in their proper places the additional material which the author had already published in his second edition Malone did not however correct the proof sheets I thought it my duty therefore in revising my work to have the text of Boswell s second edition read aloud to me throughout Some typographical errors might I feared have crept in In a few unimportant cases early in the book I adopted the reading of the second edition but as I read on I became convinced that almost all the verbal alterations were Boswell s own Slight errors often of the nature of Scotticisms had been corrected and greater accuracy often given Some of the corrections and additions in the third edition that were undoubtedly from his hand were of considerable importance I have retained Boswell s spelling in accordance with the wish that he expressed in the preface to his Account of Corsica If this work he writes should at any future period be reprinted I hope that care will be taken of my orthography thirty nine The punctuation too has been preserved I should be wanting in justice were I not to acknowledge that I owe much to the labours of mister Croker No one can know better than I do his great failings as an editor His remarks and criticisms far too often deserve the contempt that Macaulay so liberally poured on them Without being deeply versed in books he was shallow in himself Johnson s strong character was never known to him Its breadth and length and depth and height were far beyond his measure With his writings even he shows few signs of being familiar Boswell s genius a genius which even to Lord Macaulay was foolishness was altogether hidden from his dull eye No one surely but a blockhead a barren rascal forty could with scissors and paste pot have mangled the biography which of all others is the delight and the boast of the English speaking world He is careless in small matters and his blunders are numerous These I have only noticed in the more important cases remembering what Johnson somewhere points out that the triumphs of one critic over another only fatigue and disgust the reader Yet he has added considerably to our knowledge of Johnson He knew men who had intimately known both the hero and his biographer and he gathered much that but for his care would have been lost for ever He was diligent and successful in his search after Johnson s letters of so many of which Boswell with all his persevering and pushing diligence had not been able to get a sight The editor of mister Croker s Correspondence and Diaries forty one goes however much too far when in writing of Macaulay s criticism he says The attack defeated itself by its very violence and therefore it did the book no harm whatever Between forty and fifty thousand copies have been sold although Macaulay boasted with great glee that he had smashed it The book that Macaulay attacked was withdrawn That monstrous medley reached no second edition In its new form all the worst excrescences had been cleared away and though what was left was not Boswell still less was it unchastened Croker His repentance however was not thorough He never restored the text to its old state wanton transpositions of passages still remain and numerous insertions break the narrative It was my good fortune to become a sound Boswellian before I even looked at his edition It was not indeed till I came to write out my notes for the press that I examined his with any thoroughness Notes says Johnson are often necessary but they are necessary evils forty two To the young reader who for the first time turns over Boswell s delightful pages I would venture to give the advice Johnson gives about Shakespeare Let him that is yet unacquainted with the powers of Shakespeare and who desires to feel the highest pleasure that the drama can give read every play from the first scene to the last with utter negligence of all his commentators When his fancy is once on the wing let it not stoop at correction or explanation When his attention is strongly engaged let it disdain alike to turn aside to the name of Theobald and of Pope Let him read on through brightness and obscurity through integrity and corruption let him preserve his comprehension of the dialogue and his interest in the fable And when the pleasures of novelty have ceased let him attempt exactness and read the commentators forty three So too let him who reads the Life of Johnson for the first time read it in one of the Pre Crokerian editions They are numerous and good With his attention undiverted by notes he will rapidly pass through one of the most charming narratives that the world has ever seen and if his taste is uncorrupted by modern extravagances will recognise the genius of an author who in addition to other great qualities has an admirable eye for the just proportions of an extensive work and who is the master of a style that is as easy as it is inimitable Johnson I fondly believe would have been pleased perhaps would even have been proud could he have foreseen this edition Few distinctions he valued more highly than those which he received from his own great University The honorary degrees that it conferred on him the gown that it entitled him to wear by him were highly esteemed In the Clarendon Press he took a great interest forty four The efforts which that famous establishment has made in the excellence of the typography the quality of the paper and the admirably executed illustrations and facsimiles to do honour to his memory and to the genius of his biographer would have highly delighted him To his own college he was so deeply attached that he would not have been displeased to learn that his editor had been nursed in that once famous nest of singing birds Of Boswell s pleasure I cannot doubt How much he valued any tribute of respect from Oxford is shown by the absurd importance that he gave to a sermon which was preached before the University by an insignificant clergyman more than a year and a half after Johnson s death forty five When Edmund Burke witnessed the long and solemn procession entering the Cathedral of saint Paul s as it followed Sir Joshua Reynolds to his grave he wrote Everything I think was just as our deceased friend would if living have wished it to be for he was as you know not altogether indifferent to this kind of observances forty six It would indeed be presumptuous in me to flatter myself that in this edition everything is as Johnson and Boswell would if living have wished it Yet to this kind of observances the observances that can be shown by patient and long labour and by the famous press of a great University neither man was altogether indifferent Should my work find favour with the world of readers I hope again to labour in the same fields I had indeed at one time intended to enlarge this edition by essays on Boswell Johnson missus Thrale and perhaps on other subjects Their composition would however have delayed publication more than seemed advisable and their length might have rendered the volumes bulky beyond all reason A more favourable opportunity may come I have in hand a Selection of the Wit and Wisdom of doctor Johnson I purpose moreover to collect and edit all of his letters that are not in the Life Some hundreds of these were published by missus Piozzi many more are contained in mister Croker s edition while others have already appeared in Notes and Queries forty seven Not a few doubtless are still lurking in the desks of the collectors of autographs As a letter writer Johnson stands very high While the correspondence of David Garrick has been given to the world in two large volumes it is not right that the letters of his far greater friend should be left scattered and almost neglected He that sees before him to his third dinner says Johnson has a long prospect forty eight My prospect is still longer for if health be spared and a fair degree of public favour shown I see before me to my third book When I have published my Letters I hope to enter upon a still more arduous task in editing the Lives of the Poets In my work I have received much kind assistance not only from friends but also from strangers to whom I had applied in cases where special knowledge could alone throw light on some obscure point My acknowledgments I have in most instances made in my notes In some cases either through want of opportunity or forgetfulness this has not been done I gladly avail myself of the present opportunity to remedy this deficiency The Earl of Crawford and Balcarres I have to thank for so liberally allowing the original of the famous Round Robin which is in his Lordship s possession to be reproduced by a photographic process for this edition It is by the kindness of mister J L G Mowat M A Fellow and Bursar of Pembroke College Oxford that I have been able to make a careful examination of the Johnsonian manuscripts in which our college is so rich If the vigilance with which he keeps guard over these treasures while they are being

none	none	Every liberal motive that can actuate an Authour in the dedication of his labours concurs in directing me to you as the person to whom the following Work should be inscribed If there be a pleasure in celebrating the distinguished merit of a contemporary mixed with a certain degree of vanity not altogether inexcusable in appearing fully sensible of it where can I find one in complimenting whom I can with more general approbation gratify those feelings Your excellence not only in the Art over which you have long presided with unrivalled fame but also in Philosophy and elegant Literature is well known to the present and will continue to be the admiration of future ages Your equal and placid temper fifty one your variety of conversation your true politeness by which you are so amiable in private society and that enlarged hospitality which has long made your house a common centre of union for the great the accomplished the learned and the ingenious all these qualities I can in perfect confidence of not being accused of flattery ascribe to you If a man may indulge an honest pride in having it known to the world that he has been thought worthy of particular attention by a person of the first eminence in the age in which he lived whose company has been universally courted I am justified in availing myself of the usual privilege of a Dedication when I mention that there has been a long and uninterrupted friendship between us Page two Dedication If gratitude should be acknowledged for favours received I have this opportunity my dear Sir most sincerely to thank you for the many happy hours which I owe to your kindness for the cordiality with which you have at all times been pleased to welcome me for the number of valuable acquaintances to whom you have introduced me for the noctes coenaeque Deum fifty two which I have enjoyed under your roof fifty three If a work should be inscribed to one who is master of the subject of it and whose approbation therefore must ensure it credit and success the Life of doctor Johnson is with the greatest propriety dedicated to Sir Joshua Reynolds who was the intimate and beloved friend of that great man the friend whom he declared to be the most invulnerable man he knew whom if he should quarrel with him he should find the most difficulty how to abuse fifty four You my dear Sir studied him and knew him well you venerated and admired him Yet luminous as he was upon the whole you perceived all the shades which mingled in the grand composition all the little peculiarities and slight blemishes which marked the literary Colossus Your very warm commendation of the specimen which I gave in my Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides of my being able to preserve his conversation in an authentick and lively manner which opinion the Publick has confirmed was the best encouragement for me to persevere in my purpose of producing the whole of my stores fifty five In one respect this Work will in some passages be different from the former In my Tour I was almost unboundedly open in my communications and from my eagerness to display the wonderful fertility and readiness of Johnson s wit freely shewed to the world its dexterity even when I was myself the object of it I trusted that I should be liberally understood as knowing very well what I was about and by no means as simply unconscious of the pointed effects of the satire I own indeed that I was arrogant enough to suppose that the tenour of the rest of the book would sufficiently guard me against such a strange imputation But it seems I judged too well of the world for though I could scarcely believe it I have been undoubtedly informed that many persons especially in distant quarters not penetrating enough into Johnson s character so as to understand his mode of treating his friends have arraigned my judgement instead of seeing that I was sensible of all that they could observe It is related of the great doctor Clarke fifty six that when in one of his leisure hours he was unbending himself with a few friends in the most playful and frolicksome manner he observed Beau Nash approaching upon which he suddenly stopped My boys said he let us be grave here comes a fool The world my friend I have found to be a great fool as to that particular on which it has become necessary to speak very plainly I have therefore in this Work been more reserved fifty seven and though I tell nothing but the truth I have still kept in my mind that the whole truth is not always to be exposed This however I have managed so as to occasion no diminution of the pleasure which my book should afford though malignity may sometimes be disappointed of its gratifications Page four Dedication I am My dear Sir Your much obliged friend And faithful humble servant JAMES BOSWELL London April twenty seventeen ninety one ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION I at last deliver to the world a Work which I have long promised and of which I am afraid too high expectations have been raised fifty eight The delay of its publication must be imputed in a considerable degree to the extraordinary zeal which has been shewn by distinguished persons in all quarters to supply me with additional information concerning its illustrious subject resembling in this the grateful tribes of ancient nations of which every individual was eager to throw a stone upon the grave of a departed Hero and thus to share in the pious office of erecting an honourable monument to his memory fifty nine Page six Advertisement to the First Edition The labour and anxious attention with which I have collected and arranged the materials of which these volumes are composed will hardly be conceived by those who read them with careless facility sixty The stretch of mind and prompt assiduity by which so many conversations were preserved sixty one I myself at some distance of time contemplate with wonder and I must be allowed to suggest that the nature of the work in other respects as it consists of innumerable detached particulars all which even the most minute I have spared no pains to ascertain with a scrupulous authenticity has occasioned a degree of trouble far beyond that of any other species of composition Were I to detail the books which I have consulted and the inquiries which I have found it necessary to make by various channels I should probably be thought ridiculously ostentatious Let me only observe as a specimen of my trouble that I have sometimes been obliged to run half over London in order to fix a date correctly which when I had accomplished I well knew would obtain me no praise though a failure would have been to my discredit And after all perhaps hard as it may be I shall not be surprized if omissions or mistakes be pointed out with invidious severity I have also been extremely careful as to the exactness of my quotations holding that there is a respect due to the publick which should oblige every Authour to attend to this and never to presume to introduce them with I think I have read or If I remember right when the originals may be examined sixty two I beg leave to express my warmest thanks to those who have been pleased to favour me with communications and advice in the conduct of my Work But I cannot sufficiently acknowledge my obligations to my friend mister Malone who was so good as to allow me to read to him almost the whole of my manuscript and make such remarks as were greatly for the advantage of the Work sixty three though it is but fair to him to mention that upon many occasions I differed from him and followed my own judgement I regret exceedingly that I was deprived of the benefit of his revision when not more than one half of the book had passed through the press but after having completed his very laborious and admirable edition of Shakspeare for which he generously would accept of no other reward but that fame which he has so deservedly obtained he fulfilled his promise of a long wished for visit to his relations in Ireland from whence his safe return finibus Atticis is desired by his friends here with all the classical ardour of Sic te Diva potens Cypri sixty four for there is no man in whom more elegant and worthy qualities are united and whose society therefore is more valued by those who know him It is painful to me to think that while I was carrying on this Work several of those to whom it would have been most interesting have died Such melancholy disappointments we know to be incident to humanity but we do not feel them the less Let me particularly lament the Reverend 
1271_136861_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Thomas Warton 
none	none	and the Reverend doctor Adams mister Warton amidst his variety of genius and learning was an excellent Biographer His contributions to my Collection are highly estimable and as he had a true relish of my Tour to the Hebrides I trust I should now have been gratified with a larger share of his kind approbation doctor Adams eminent as the Head of a College as a writer sixty five and as a most amiable man had known Johnson from his early years and was his friend through life What reason I had to hope for the countenance of that venerable Gentleman to this Work will appear from what he wrote to me upon a former occasion from Oxford November seventeen seventeen eighty five Dear Sir I hazard this letter not knowing where it will find you to thank you for your very agreeable Tour which I found here on my return from the country and in which you have depicted our friend so perfectly to my fancy in every attitude every scene and situation that I have thought myself in the company and of the party almost throughout It has given very general satisfaction and those who have found most fault with a passage here and there have agreed that they could not help going through and being entertained with the whole I wish indeed some few gross expressions had been softened and a few of our hero s foibles had been a little more shaded but it is useful to see the weaknesses incident to great minds and you have given us doctor Johnson s authority that in history all ought to be told sixty six Such a sanction to my faculty of giving a just representation of doctor Johnson I could not conceal Nor will I suppress my satisfaction in the consciousness that by recording so considerable a portion of the wisdom and wit of the brightest ornament of the eighteenth century sixty seven I have largely provided for the instruction and entertainment of mankind London April twenty seventeen ninety one sixty eight ADVERTISMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION That I was anxious for the success of a Work which had employed much of my time and labour I do not wish to conceal but whatever doubts I at any time entertained have been entirely removed by the very favourable reception with which it has been honoured sixty nine That reception has excited my best exertions to render my Book more perfect and in this endeavour I have had the assistance not only of some of my particular friends but of many other learned and ingenious men by which I have been enabled to rectify some mistakes and to enrich the Work with many valuable additions These I have ordered to be printed separately in quarto for the accommodation of the purchasers of the first edition seventy May I be permitted to say that the typography of both editions does honour to the press of mister Henry Baldwin now Master of the Worshipful Company of Stationers whom I have long known as a worthy man and an obliging friend In the strangely mixed scenes of human existence our feelings are often at once pleasing and painful Of this truth the progress of the present Work furnishes a striking instance It was highly gratifying to me that my friend Sir Joshua Reynolds to whom it is inscribed lived to peruse it and to give the strongest testimony to its fidelity but before a second edition which he contributed to improve could be finished the world has been deprived of that most valuable man seventy one a loss of which the regret will be deep and lasting and extensive proportionate to the felicity which he diffused through a wide circle of admirers and friends seventy two Page eleven Advertisement to the Second Edition In reflecting that the illustrious subject of this Work by being more extensively and intimately known however elevated before has risen in the veneration and love of mankind I feel a satisfaction beyond what fame can afford We cannot indeed too much or too often admire his wonderful powers of mind when we consider that the principal store of wit and wisdom which this Work contains was not a particular selection from his general conversation but was merely his occasional talk at such times as I had the good fortune to be in his company seventy three and without doubt if his discourse at other periods had been collected with the same attention the whole tenor of what he uttered would have been found equally excellent His strong clear and animated enforcement of religion morality loyalty and subordination while it delights and improves the wise and the good will I trust prove an effectual antidote to that detestable sophistry which has been lately imported from France under the false name of Philosophy and with a malignant industry has been employed against the peace good order and happiness of society in our free and prosperous country but thanks be to GOD without producing the pernicious effects which were hoped for by its propagators It seems to me in my moments of self complacency that this extensive biographical work however inferior in its nature may in one respect be assimilated to the ODYSSEY Amidst a thousand entertaining and instructive episodes the HERO is never long out of sight for they are all in some degree connected with him and HE in the whole course of the History is exhibited by the Authour for the best advantage of his readers Quid virtus et quid sapientia possit Utile proposuit nobis exemplar Ulyssen seventy four Should there be any cold blooded and morose mortals who really dislike this Book I will give them a story to apply When the great Duke of Marlborough accompanied by Lord Cadogan was one day reconnoitering the army in Flanders a heavy rain came on and they both called for their cloaks Lord Cadogan s servant a good humoured alert lad brought his Lordship s in a minute The Dukes servant a lazy sulky dog was so sluggish that his Grace being wet to the skin reproved him and had for answer with a grunt I came as fast as I could upon which the Duke calmly said Cadogan I would not for a thousand pounds have that fellow s temper There are some men I believe who have or think they have a very small share of vanity Such may speak of their literary fame in a decorous style of diffidence But I confess that I am so formed by nature and by habit that to restrain the effusion of delight on having obtained such fame to me would be truly painful Why then should I suppress it Why out of the abundance of the heart should I not speak seventy five Let me then mention with a warm but no insolent exultation that I have been regaled with spontaneous praise of my work by many and various persons eminent for their rank learning talents and accomplishments much of which praise I have under their hands to be reposited in my archives at Auchinleck seventy six An honourable and reverend friend speaking of the favourable reception of my volumes even in the circles of fashion and elegance said to me you have made them all talk Johnson Yes I may add I have Johnsonised the land and I trust they will not only talk but think Johnson To enumerate those to whom I have been thus indebted would be tediously ostentatious I cannot however but name one whose praise is truly valuable not only on account of his knowledge and abilities but on account of the magnificent yet dangerous embassy in which he is now employed seventy seven which makes every thing that relates to him peculiarly interesting Lord MACARTNEY favoured me with his own copy of my book with a number of notes of which I have availed myself On the first leaf I found in his Lordship s hand writing an inscription of such high commendation that even I vain as I am cannot prevail on myself to publish it July one seventeen ninety three seventy eight ADVERTISEMENT TO THE THIRD EDITION Several valuable letters and other curious matter having been communicated to the Author too late to be arranged in that chronological order which he had endeavoured uniformly to observe in his work he was obliged to introduce them in his Second Edition by way of ADDENDA as commodiously as he could In the present edition these have been distributed in their proper places In revising his volumes for a new edition he had pointed out where some of these materials should be inserted but unfortunately in the midst of his labours he was seized with a fever of which to the great regret of all his friends he died on the nineteenth of May seventeen ninety five seventy nine All the Notes that he had written in the margin of the copy which he had in part revised are here faithfully preserved and a few new Notes have been added principally by some of those friends to whom the Author in the former editions acknowledged his obligations Those subscribed with the letter B were communicated by doctor Burney those to which the letters J B are annexed by the reverend J Blakeway of Shrewsbury to whom mister Boswell acknowledged himself indebted for some judicious remarks on the first edition of his work and the letters J B O are annexed to some remarks furnished by the Author s second son a Student of Brazen Nose College in Oxford Some valuable observations were communicated by James Bindley esquire First Commissioner in the Stamp Office which have been acknowledged in their proper places For all those without any signature mister Malone is answerable Every new remark not written by the Author for the sake of distinction has been enclosed within crotchets in one instance however the printer by mistake has affixed this mark to a note relative to the reverend Thomas Fysche Palmer which was written by mister Boswell and therefore ought not to have been thus distinguished Page fifteen Advertisement to the Third Edition I have only to add that the proof sheets of the present edition not having passed through my hands I am not answerable for any typographical errours that may be found in it Having however been printed at the very accurate press of mister Baldwin I make no doubt it will be found not less perfect than the former edition the greatest care having been taken by correctness and elegance to do justice to one of the most instructive and entertaining works in the English language EDMOND

JOHNSON LL D To write the Life of him who excelled all mankind in writing the lives of others and who whether we consider his extraordinary endowments or his various works has been equalled by few in any age is an arduous and may be reckoned in me a presumptuous task Had doctor Johnson written his own life in conformity with the opinion which he has given eighty five that every man s life may be best written by himself had he employed in the preservation of his own history that clearness of narration and elegance of language in which he has embalmed so many eminent persons the world would probably have had the most perfect example of biography that was ever exhibited But although he at different times in a desultory manner committed to writing many particulars of the progress of his mind and fortunes he never had persevering diligence enough to form them into a regular composition eighty six Of these memorials a few have been preserved but the greater part was consigned by him to the flames a few days before his death Page twenty six The Author s qualifications As I had the honour and happiness of enjoying his friendship for upwards of twenty years as I had the scheme of writing his life constantly in view as he was well apprised of this circumstance eighty seven and from time to time obligingly satisfied my inquiries by communicating to me the incidents of his early years as I acquired a facility in recollecting and was very assiduous in recording his conversation of which the extraordinary vigour and vivacity constituted one of the first features of his character and as I have spared no pains in obtaining materials concerning him from every quarter where I could discover that they were to be found and have been favoured with the most liberal communications by his friends I flatter myself that few biographers have entered upon such a work as this with more advantages independent of literary abilities in which I am not vain enough to compare myself with some great names who have gone before me in this kind of writing Page twenty seven The Life by Sir J Hawkins Since my work was announced several Lives and Memoirs of doctor Johnson have been published eighty eight the most voluminous of which is one compiled for the booksellers of London by Sir John Hawkins Knight eighty nine a man whom during my long intimacy with doctor Johnson I never saw in his company I think but once and I am sure not above twice Johnson might have esteemed him for his decent religious demeanour and his knowledge of books and literary history but from the rigid formality of his manners it is evident that they never could have lived together with companionable ease and familiarity ninety nor had Sir John Hawkins that nice perception which was necessary to mark the finer and less obvious parts of Johnson s character His being appointed one of his executors gave him an opportunity of taking possession of such fragments of a diary and other papers as were left of which before delivering them up to the residuary legatee whose property they were he endeavoured to extract the substance In this he has not been very successful as I have found upon a perusal of those papers which have been since transferred to me Sir John Hawkins s ponderous labours I must acknowledge exhibit a farrago of which a considerable portion is not devoid of entertainment to the lovers of literary gossiping but besides its being swelled out with long unnecessary extracts from various works even one of several leaves from Osborne s Harleian Catalogue and those not compiled by Johnson but by Oldys a very small part of it relates to the person who is the subject of the book and in that there is such an inaccuracy in the statement of facts as in so solemn an authour is hardly excusable and certainly makes his narrative very unsatisfactory But what is still worse there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable cast by which the most unfavourable construction is put upon almost every circumstance in the character and conduct of my illustrious friend ninety one who I trust will by a true and fair delineation be vindicated both from the injurious misrepresentations of this authour and from the slighter aspersions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him ninety two Page twenty eight Warburton s view of biography Page twenty nine The author s mode of procedure There is in the British Museum a letter from Bishop Warburton to doctor Birch on the subject of biography which though I am aware it may expose me to a charge of artfully raising the value of my own work by contrasting it with that of which I have spoken is so well conceived and expressed that I cannot refrain from here inserting it I shall endeavor says doctor Warburton to give you what satisfaction I can in any thing you want to be satisfied in any subject of Milton and am extremely glad you intend to write his life Almost all the life writers we have had before Toland and Desmaiseaux ninety three are indeed strange insipid creatures and yet I had rather read the worst of them than be obliged to go through with this of Milton s or the other s life of Boileau where there is such a dull heavy succession of long quotations of disinteresting passages that it makes their method quite nauseous But the verbose tasteless Frenchman seems to lay it down as a principle that every life must be a book and what s worse it proves a book without a life for what do we know of Boileau after all his tedious stuff You are the only one and I speak it without a compliment that by the vigour of your stile and sentiments and the real importance of your materials have the art which one would imagine no one could have missed of adding agreements to the most agreeable subject in the world which is literary history ninety four Nov twenty four seventeen thirty seven Page thirty Not a panegyrick but a Life Instead of melting down my materials into one mass and constantly speaking in my own person by which I might have appeared to have more merit in the execution of the work I have resolved to adopt and enlarge upon the excellent plan of mister Mason in his Memoirs of Gray ninety five Wherever narrative is necessary to explain connect and supply I furnish it to the best of my abilities but in the chronological series of Johnson s life which I trace as distinctly as I can year by year I produce wherever it is in my power his own minutes letters or conversation being convinced that this mode is more lively and will make my readers better acquainted with him than even most of those were who actually knew him but could know him only partially whereas there is here an accumulation of intelligence from various points by which his character is more fully understood and illustrated ninety six Indeed I cannot conceive a more perfect mode of writing any man s life than not only relating all the most important events of it in their order but interweaving what he privately wrote and said and thought by which mankind are enabled as it were to see him live and to live o er each scene ninety seven with him as he actually advanced through the several stages of his life Had his other friends been as diligent and ardent as I was he might have been almost entirely preserved As it is I will venture to say that he will be seen in this work more completely than any man who has ever yet lived ninety eight And he will be seen as he really was for I profess to write not his panegyrick which must be all praise but his Life which great and good as he was must not be supposed to be entirely perfect To be as he was is indeed subject of panegyrick enough to any man in this state of being but in every picture there should be shade as well as light and when I delineate him without reserve I do what he himself recommended both by his precept and his example ninety nine Page thirty one Conversation best displays character If the biographer writes from personal knowledge and makes haste to gratify the publick curiosity there is danger lest his interest his fear his gratitude or his tenderness overpower his fidelity and tempt him to conceal if not to invent There are many who think it an act of piety to hide the faults or failings of their friends even when they can no longer suffer by their detection we therefore see whole ranks of characters adorned with uniform panegyrick and not to be known from one another but by extrinsick and casual circumstances Let me remember says Hale when I find myself inclined to pity a criminal that there is likewise a pity due to the country If we owe regard to the memory of the dead there is yet more respect to be paid to knowledge to virtue and to truth one hundred What I consider as the peculiar value of the following work is the quantity it contains of Johnson s conversation which is universally acknowledged to have been eminently instructive and entertaining and of which the specimens that I have given upon a former occasion one hundred one have been received with so much approbation that I have good grounds for supposing that the world will not be indifferent to more ample communications of a similar nature That the conversation of a celebrated man if his talents have been exerted in conversation will best display his character is I trust too well established in the judgment of mankind to be at all shaken by a sneering observation of mister Mason in his Memoirs of mister William Whitehead in which there is literally no Life but a mere dry narrative of facts one hundred two I do not think it was quite necessary to attempt a depreciation of what is universally esteemed because it was not to be found in the immediate object of the ingenious writer s pen for in truth from a man so still and so tame as to be contented to pass many years as the domestick companion of a superannuated lord and lady one hundred three conversation could no more be expected than from a Chinese mandarin on a chimney piece or the fantastick figures on a gilt leather skreen Page thirty two doctor Johnson on biography If authority be required let us appeal to Plutarch the prince of ancient biographers Greek Oute tais epiphanestatais praxesi pantos enesti daelosis aretaes ae kakias alla pragma brachu pollakis kai raema kai paidia tis emphasin aethous epoiaesen mallon ae machai murionekroi kai parataxeis ai megistai kai poliorkiai poleon Nor is it always in the most distinguished atchievements that men s virtues or vices may be best discerned but very often an action of small note a short saying or a jest shall distinguish a person s real character more than the greatest sieges or the most important battles one hundred four To this may be added the sentiments of the very man whose life I am about to exhibit The business of the biographer is often to pass slightly over those performances and incidents which produce vulgar greatness to lead the thoughts into domestick privacies and display the minute details of daily life where exteriour appendages are cast aside and men excel each other only by prudence and by virtue The account of Thuanus is with great propriety said by its authour to have been written that it might lay open to posterity the private and familiar character of that man cujus ingenium et candorem ex ipsius scriptis sunt olim semper miraturi whose candour and genius will to the end of time be by his writings preserved in admiration There are many invisible circumstances which whether we read as enquirers after natural or moral knowledge whether we intend to enlarge our science or increase our virtue are more important than publick occurrences Thus Sallust the great master of nature has not forgot in his account of Catiline to remark that his walk was now quick and again slow as an indication of a mind revolving one hundred five with violent commotion Thus the story of Melanchthon affords a striking lecture on the value of time by informing us that when he had made an appointment he expected not only the hour but the minute to be fixed that the day might not run out in the idleness of suspence and all the plans and enterprises of De Witt are now of less importance to the world than that part of his personal character which represents him as careful of his health and negligent of his life But biography has often been allotted to writers who seem very little acquainted with the nature of their task or very negligent about the performance They rarely afford any other account than might be collected from publick papers but imagine themselves writing a life when they exhibit a chronological series of actions or preferments one hundred six and have so little regard to the manners one hundred six or behaviour of their heroes that more knowledge may be gained of a man s real character by a short conversation with one of his servants than from a formal and studied narrative begun with his pedigree and ended with his funeral Page thirty three Reply to possible objections There are indeed some natural reasons why these narratives are often written by such as were not likely to give much instruction or delight and why most accounts of particular persons are barren and useless If a life be delayed till interest and envy are at an end we may hope for impartiality but must expect little intelligence for the incidents which give excellence to biography are of a volatile and evanescent kind such as soon escape the memory and are transmitted one hundred seven by tradition We know how few can pourtray a living acquaintance except by his most prominent and observable particularities and the grosser features of his mind and it may be easily imagined how much of this little knowledge may be lost in imparting it and how soon a succession of copies will lose all resemblance of the original one hundred eight I am fully aware of the objections which may be made to the minuteness on some occasions of my detail of Johnson s conversation and how happily it is adapted for the petty exercise of ridicule by men of superficial understanding and ludicrous fancy but I remain firm and confident in my opinion that minute particulars are frequently characteristick and always amusing when they relate to a distinguished man I am therefore exceedingly unwilling that any thing however slight which my illustrious friend thought it worth his while to express with any degree of point should perish For this almost superstitious reverence I have found very old and venerable authority quoted by our great modern prelate Secker in whose tenth sermon there is the following passage Rabbi David Kimchi a noted Jewish Commentator who lived about five hundred years ago explains that passage in the first Psalm His leaf also shall not wither from Rabbins yet older than himself thus That even the idle talk so he expresses it of a good man ought to be regarded the most superfluous things he saith are always of some value And other ancient authours have the same phrase nearly in the same sense Page thirty four Johnson s birth and baptism A D seventeen oh nine Of one thing I am certain that considering how highly the small portion which we have of the table talk and other anecdotes of our celebrated writers is valued and how earnestly it is regretted that we have not more I am justified in preserving rather too many of Johnson s sayings than too few especially as from the diversity of dispositions it cannot be known with certainty beforehand whether what may seem trifling to some and perhaps to the collector himself may not be most agreeable to many and the greater number that an authour can please in any degree the more pleasure does there arise to a benevolent mind To those who are weak enough to think this a degrading task and the time and labour which have been devoted to it misemployed I shall content myself with opposing the authority of the greatest man of any age JULIUS CAESAR of whom Bacon observes that in his book of Apothegms which he collected we see that he esteemed it more honour to make himself but a pair of tables to take the wise and pithy words of others than to have every word of his own to be made an apothegm or an oracle one hundred nine Having said thus much by way of introduction I commit the following pages to the candour of the Publick SAMUEL one hundred ten JOHNSON was born at Lichfield in Staffordshire on the eighteenth of September N S seventeen oh nine and his initiation into the Christian Church was not delayed for his baptism is recorded in the register of saint Mary s parish in that city to have been performed on the day of his birth His father is there stiled Gentleman a circumstance of which an ignorant panegyrist has praised him for not being proud when the truth is that the appellation of Gentleman though now lost in the indiscriminate assumption of Esquire one hundred eleven was commonly taken by those who could not boast of gentility His father was Michael Johnson a native of Derbyshire of obscure extraction one hundred twelve who settled in Lichfield as a bookseller and stationer one hundred thirteen Page thirty five His parentage A D seventeen oh nine His mother was Sarah Ford descended of an ancient race of substantial yeomanry in Warwickshire one hundred fourteen They were well advanced in years when they married and never had more than two children both sons Samuel their first born who lived to be the illustrious character whose various excellence I am to endeavour to record and Nathanael who died in his twenty fifth year Page thirty six Character of Michael Johnson A D seventeen oh nine mister Michael Johnson was a man of a large and robust body and of a strong and active mind yet as in the most solid rocks veins of unsound substance are often discovered there was in him a mixture of that disease the nature of which eludes the most minute enquiry though the effects are well known to be a weariness of life an unconcern about those things which agitate the greater part of mankind and a general sensation of gloomy wretchedness one hundred fifteen From him then his son inherited with some other qualities a vile melancholy which in his too strong expression of any disturbance of the mind made him mad all his life at least not sober one hundred sixteen Michael was however forced by the narrowness of his circumstances to be very diligent in business not only in his shop one hundred seventeen but by occasionally resorting to several towns in the neighbourhood one hundred eighteen some of which were at a considerable distance from Lichfield one hundred nineteen At that time booksellers shops in the provincial towns of England were very rare so that there was not one even in Birmingham in which town old mister Johnson used to open a shop every market day He was a pretty good Latin scholar and a citizen so creditable as to be made one of the magistrates of Lichfield one hundred twenty and being a man of good sense and skill in his trade he acquired a reasonable share of wealth of which however he afterwards lost the greatest part by engaging unsuccessfully in a manufacture of parchment one hundred twenty one He was a zealous high church man and royalist and retained his attachment to the unfortunate house of Stuart though he reconciled himself by casuistical arguments of expediency and necessity to take the oaths imposed by the prevailing power one hundred twenty two Page thirty seven An incident in his life A D seventeen oh nine There is a circumstance in his life somewhat romantick but so well authenticated that I shall not omit it A young woman of Leek in Staffordshire while he served his apprenticeship there conceived a violent passion for him and though it met with no favourable return followed him to Lichfield where she took lodgings opposite to the house in which he lived and indulged her hopeless flame When he was informed that it so preyed upon her mind that her life was in danger he with a generous humanity went to her and offered to marry her but it was then too late her vital power was exhausted and she actually exhibited one of the very rare instances of dying for love She was buried in the cathedral of Lichfield and he with a tender regard placed a stone over her grave with this inscription Here lies the body of missus ELIZABETH BLANEY a stranger She departed this life twenty of September sixteen ninety four Page thirty eight Sarah Johnson A D seventeen twelve Johnson s mother was a woman of distinguished understanding I asked his old school fellow mister Hector surgeon of Birmingham if she was not vain of her son He said she had too much good sense to be vain but she knew her son s value Her piety was not inferiour to her understanding and to her must be ascribed those early impressions of religion upon the mind of her son from which the world afterwards derived so much benefit He told me that he remembered distinctly having had the first notice of Heaven a place to which good people went and hell a place to which bad people went communicated to him by her when a little child in bed with her one hundred twenty three and that it might be the better fixed in his memory she sent him to repeat it to Thomas Jackson their man servant he not being in the way this was not done but there was no occasion for any artificial aid for its preservation In following so very eminent a man from his cradle to his grave every minute particular which can throw light on the progress of his mind is interesting That he was remarkable even in his earliest years may easily be supposed for to use his own words in his Life of Sydenham That the strength of his understanding the accuracy of his discernment and ardour of his curiosity might have been remarked from his infancy by a diligent observer there is no reason to doubt For there is no instance of any man whose history has been minutely related that did not in every part of life discover the same proportion of intellectual vigour one hundred twenty four In all such investigations it is certainly unwise to pay too much attention to incidents which the credulous relate with eager satisfaction and the more scrupulous or witty enquirer considers only as topicks of ridicule Yet there is a traditional story of the infant Hercules of toryism so curiously characteristick that I shall not withhold it It was communicated to me in a letter from Miss Mary Adye of Lichfield Page thirty nine Anecdotes of Johnson s childhood When doctor Sacheverel was at Lichfield Johnson was not quite three years old My grandfather Hammond observed him at the cathedral perched upon his father s shoulders listening and gaping at the much celebrated preacher mister Hammond asked mister Johnson how he could possibly think of bringing such an infant to church and in the midst of so great a croud He answered because it was impossible to keep him at home for young as he was he believed he had caught the publick spirit and zeal for Sacheverel and would have staid for ever in the church satisfied with beholding him one hundred twenty five Nor can I omit a little instance of that jealous independence of spirit and impetuosity of temper which never forsook him The fact was acknowledged to me by himself upon the authority of his mother One day when the servant who used to be sent to school to conduct him home had not come in time he set out by himself though he was then so near sighted that he was obliged to stoop down on his hands and knees to take a view of the kennel before he ventured to step over it His school mistress afraid that he might miss his way or fall into the kennel or be run over by a cart followed him at some distance He happened to turn about and perceive her Feeling her careful attention as an insult to his manliness he ran back to her in a rage and beat her as well as his strength would permit Of the power of his memory for which he was all his life eminent to a degree almost incredible one hundred twenty six the following early instance was told me in his presence at Lichfield in seventeen seventy six by his step daughter missus Lucy Porter as related to her by his mother Page forty Johnson s infant precocity A D seventeen twelve When he was a child in petticoats and had learnt to read missus Johnson one morning put the common prayer book into his hands pointed to the collect for the day and said

none	none	you must get this by heart She went up stairs leaving him to study it But by the time she had reached the second floor she heard him following her What s the matter said she I can say it he replied and repeated it distinctly though he could not have read it more than twice But there has been another story of his infant precocity generally circulated and generally believed the truth of which I am to refute upon his own authority It is told one hundred twenty seven that when a child of three years old he chanced to tread upon a duckling the eleventh of a brood and killed it upon which it is said he dictated to his mother the following epitaph Here lies good master duck Whom Samuel Johnson trod on If it had liv d it had been good luck For then we d had an odd one There is surely internal evidence that this little composition combines in it what no child of three years old could produce without an extension of its faculties by immediate inspiration yet missus Lucy Porter doctor Johnson s step daughter positively maintained to me in his presence that there could be no doubt of the truth of this anecdote for she had heard it from his mother So difficult is it to obtain an authentick relation of facts and such authority may there be for errour for he assured me that his father made the verses and wished to pass them for his child s He added my father was a foolish old man one hundred twenty eight that is to say foolish in talking of his children one hundred twenty nine Page forty one His eyesight Page forty two The king s evil Young Johnson had the misfortune to be much afflicted with the scrophula or king s evil which disfigured a countenance naturally well formed and hurt his visual nerves so much that he did not see at all with one of his eyes though its appearance was little different from that of the other There is amongst his prayers one inscribed When my EYE was restored to its use one hundred thirty which ascertains a defect that many of his friends knew he had though I never perceived it one hundred thirty one I supposed him to be only near sighted and indeed I must observe that in no other respect could I discern any defect in his vision on the contrary the force of his attention and perceptive quickness made him see and distinguish all manner of objects whether of nature or of art with a nicety that is rarely to be found When he and I were travelling in the Highlands of Scotland and I pointed out to him a mountain which I observed resembled a cone he corrected my inaccuracy by shewing me that it was indeed pointed at the top but that one side of it was larger than the other one hundred thirty two And the ladies with whom he was acquainted agree that no man was more nicely and minutely critical in the elegance of female dress one hundred thirty three When I found that he saw the romantick beauties of Islam in Derbyshire much better than I did I told him that he resembled an able performer upon a bad instrument one hundred thirty four How false and contemptible then are all the remarks which have been made to the prejudice either of his candour or of his philosophy founded upon a supposition that he was almost blind It has been said that he contracted this grievous malady from his nurse one hundred thirty five His mother yielding to the superstitious notion which it is wonderful to think prevailed so long in this country as to the virtue of the regal touch a notion which our kings encouraged and to which a man of such inquiry and such judgement as Carte one hundred thirty six could give credit carried him to London where he was actually touched by Queen Anne missus Johnson indeed as mister Hector informed me acted by the advice of the celebrated Sir John Floyer one hundred thirty seven then a physician in Lichfield Johnson used to talk of this very frankly and missus Piozzi has preserved his very picturesque description of the scene as it remained upon his fancy Being asked if he could remember Queen Anne He had he said a confused but somehow a sort of solemn recollection of a lady in diamonds and a long black hood one hundred thirty eight This touch however was without any effect I ventured to say to him in allusion to the political principles in which he was educated and of which he ever retained some odour that his mother had not carried him far enough she should have taken him to ROME Page forty three Johnson at a dame s school He was first taught to read English by Dame Oliver one hundred thirty nine a widow who kept a school for young children in Lichfield He told me she could read the black letter and asked him to borrow for her from his father a bible in that character When he was going to Oxford she came to take leave of him brought him in the simplicity of her kindness a present of gingerbread and said he was the best scholar she ever had He delighted in mentioning this early compliment adding with a smile that this was as high a proof of his merit as he could conceive His next instructor in English was a master whom when he spoke of him to me he familiarly called Tom Brown who said he published a spelling book and dedicated it to the UNIVERSE but I fear no copy of it can now be had one hundred forty Page forty four Lichfield School He began to learn Latin one hundred forty one with mister Hawkins usher or under master of Lichfield school a man said he very skilful in his little way With him he continued two years one hundred forty two and then rose to be under the care of mister Hunter the head master who according to his account was very severe and wrong headedly severe He used said he to beat us unmercifully and he did not distinguish between ignorance and negligence for he would beat a boy equally for not knowing a thing as for neglecting to know it He would ask a boy a question and if he did not answer it he would beat him without considering whether he had an opportunity of knowing how to answer it For instance he would call up a boy and ask him Latin for a candlestick which the boy could not expect to be asked Now Sir if a boy could answer every question there would be no need of a master to teach him Page forty five Johnson s school fellows It is however but justice to the memory of mister Hunter to mention that though he might err in being too severe the school of Lichfield was very respectable in his time one hundred forty three The late doctor Taylor Prebendary of Westminster who was educated under him told me that he was an excellent master and that his ushers were most of them men of eminence that Holbrook one of the most ingenious men best scholars and best preachers of his age was usher during the greatest part of the time that Johnson was at school one hundred forty four Then came Hague of whom as much might be said with the addition that he was an elegant poet Hague was succeeded by Green afterwards Bishop of Lincoln whose character in the learned world is well known one hundred forty five In the same form with Johnson was Congreve one hundred forty six who afterwards became chaplain to Archbishop Boulter and by that connection obtained good preferment in Ireland He was a younger son of the ancient family of Congreve in Staffordshire of which the poet was a branch His brother sold the estate There was also Lowe afterwards Canon of Windsor one hundred forty seven Page forty six mister Hunter Indeed Johnson was very sensible how much he owed to mister Hunter mister Langton one day asked him how he had acquired so accurate a knowledge of Latin in which I believe he was exceeded by no man of his time he said My master whipt me very well Without that Sir I should have done nothing He told mister Langton that while Hunter was flogging his boys unmercifully he used to say And this I do to save you from the gallows Johnson upon all occasions expressed his approbation of enforcing instruction by means of the rod one hundred forty eight I would rather said he have the rod to be the general terrour to all to make them learn than tell a child if you do thus or thus you will be more esteemed than your brothers or sisters The rod produces an effect which terminates in itself A child is afraid of being whipped and gets his task and there s an end on t whereas by exciting emulation and comparisons of superiority you lay the foundation of lasting mischief you make brothers and sisters hate each other one hundred forty nine When Johnson saw some young ladies in Lincolnshire who were remarkably well behaved owing to their mother s strict discipline and severe correction one hundred fifty he exclaimed in one of Shakspeare s lines a little varied Rod I will honour thee for this thy duty one hundred fifty one Page forty seven Johnson a King of men That superiority over his fellows which he maintained with so much dignity in his march through life was not assumed from vanity and ostentation but was the natural and constant effect of those extraordinary powers of mind of which he could not but be conscious by comparison the intellectual difference which in other cases of comparison of characters is often a matter of undecided contest being as clear in his case as the superiority of stature in some men above others Johnson did not strut or stand on tip toe He only did not stoop From his earliest years his superiority was perceived and acknowledged one hundred fifty two He was from the beginning Greek anax andron a king of men His schoolfellow mister Hector has obligingly furnished me with many particulars of his boyish days one hundred fifty three and assured me that he never knew him corrected at school but for talking and diverting other boys from their business He seemed to learn by intuition for though indolence and procrastination were inherent in his constitution whenever he made an exertion he did more than any one else In short he is a memorable instance of what has been often observed that the boy is the man in miniature and that the distinguishing characteristicks of each individual are the same through the whole course of life His favourites used to receive very liberal assistance from him and such was the submission and deference with which he was treated such the desire to obtain his regard that three of the boys of whom mister Hector was sometimes one used to come in the morning as his humble attendants and carry him to school One in the middle stooped while he sat upon his back and one on each side supported him and thus he was borne triumphant Such a proof of the early predominance of intellectual vigour is very remarkable and does honour to human nature Talking to me once himself of his being much distinguished at school he told me they never thought to raise me by comparing me to any one they never said Johnson is as good a scholar as such a one but such a one is as good a scholar as Johnson and this was said but of one but of Lowe and I do not think he was as good a scholar Page forty eight Johnson s tenacious memory He discovered a great ambition to excel which roused him to counteract his indolence He was uncommonly inquisitive and his memory was so tenacious that he never forgot any thing that he either heard or read mister Hector remembers having recited to him eighteen verses which after a little pause he repeated verbatim varying only one epithet by which he improved the line He never joined with the other boys in their ordinary diversions his only amusement was in winter when he took a pleasure in being drawn upon the ice by a boy barefooted who pulled him along by a garter fixed round him no very easy operation as his size was remarkably large His defective sight indeed prevented him from enjoying the common sports and he once pleasantly remarked to me how wonderfully well he had contrived to be idle without them Lord Chesterfield however has justly observed in one of his letters when earnestly cautioning a friend against the pernicious effects of idleness that active sports are not to be reckoned idleness in young people and that the listless torpor of doing nothing alone deserves that name one hundred fifty four Of this dismal inertness of disposition Johnson had all his life too great a share mister Hector relates that he could not oblige him more than by sauntering away the hours of vacation in the fields during which he was more engaged in talking to himself than to his companion Page forty nine His fondness for romances doctor Percy one hundred fifty five the Bishop of Dromore who was long intimately acquainted with him and has preserved a few anecdotes concerning him regretting that he was not a more diligent collector informs me that when a boy he was immoderately fond of reading romances of chivalry and he retained his fondness for them through life so that adds his Lordship spending part of a summer one hundred fifty six at my parsonage house in the country he chose for his regular reading the old Spanish romance of Felixmarte of Hircania in folio which he read quite through one hundred fifty seven Yet I have heard him attribute to these extravagant fictions that unsettled turn of mind which prevented his ever fixing in any profession Page fifty Stourbridge School seventeen twenty five AETAT sixteen After having resided for some time at the house of his uncle Cornelius Ford one hundred fifty eight Johnson was at the age of fifteen removed to the school of Stourbridge in Worcestershire of which mister Wentworth was then master This step was taken by the advice of his cousin the Reverend mister Ford a man in whom both talents and good dispositions were disgraced by licentiousness one hundred fifty nine but who was a very able judge of what was right At this school he did not receive so much benefit as was expected It has been said that he acted in the capacity of an assistant to mister Wentworth in teaching the younger boys mister Wentworth he told me was a very able man but an idle man and to me very severe but I cannot blame him much I was then a big boy he saw I did not reverence him and that he should get no honour by me I had brought enough with me to carry me through and all I should get at his school would be ascribed to my own labour or to my former master Yet he taught me a great deal He thus discriminated to doctor Percy Bishop of Dromore his progress at his two grammar schools At one I learnt much in the school but little from the master in the other I learnt much from the master but little in the school The Bishop also informs me that doctor Johnson s father before he was received at Stourbridge applied to have him admitted as a scholar and assistant to the Reverend Samuel Lea M A head master of Newport school in Shropshire a very diligent good teacher at that time in high reputation under whom mister Hollis one hundred sixty is said in the Memoirs of his Life to have been also educated one hundred sixty one This application to mister Lea was not successful but Johnson had afterwards the gratification to hear that the old gentleman who lived to a very advanced age mentioned it as one of the most memorable events of his life that he was very near having that great man for his scholar He remained at Stourbridge little more than a year and then returned home where he may be said to have loitered for two years in a state very unworthy his uncommon abilities He had already given several proofs of his poetical genius both in his school exercises and in other occasional compositions Of these I have obtained a considerable collection by the favour of mister Wentworth son of one of his masters and of mister Hector his school fellow and friend from which I select the following specimens Page fifty one Johnson s youthful compositions Translation of VIRGIL Pastoral I MELIBOEUS Now Tityrus you supine and careless laid Play on your pipe beneath this beechen shade While wretched we about the world must roam And leave our pleasing fields and native home Here at your ease you sing your amorous flame And the wood rings with Amarillis name TITYRUS Those blessings friend a deity bestow d For I shall never think him less than God Oft on his altar shall my firstlings lie Their blood the consecrated stones shall dye He gave my flocks to graze the flowery meads And me to tune at ease th unequal reeds MELIBOEUS My admiration only I exprest No spark of envy harbours in my breast That when confusion o er the country reigns To you alone this happy state remains Here I though faint myself must drive my goats Far from their ancient fields and humble cots This scarce I lead who left on yonder rock Two tender kids the hopes of all the flock Had we not been perverse and careless grown This dire event by

he spent at home after his return from Stourbridge he passed in what he thought idleness one hundred sixty seven and was scolded by his father for his want of steady application one hundred sixty eight He had no settled plan of life nor looked forward at all but merely lived from day to day Yet he read a great deal in a desultory manner without any scheme of study as chance threw books in his way and inclination directed him through them He used to mention one curious instance of his casual reading when but a boy Having imagined that his brother had hid some apples behind a large folio upon an upper shelf in his father s shop he climbed up to search for them There were no apples but the large folio proved to be Petrarch whom he had seen mentioned in some preface as one of the restorers of learning His curiosity having been thus excited he sat down with avidity and read a great part of the book What he read during these two years he told me was not works of mere amusement not voyages and travels but all literature Sir all ancient writers all manly though but little Greek only some of Anacreon and Hesiod but in this irregular manner added he I had looked into a great many books which were not commonly known at the Universities where they seldom read any books but what are put into their hands by their tutors so that when I came to Oxford doctor Adams now master of Pembroke College told me I was the best qualified for the University that he had ever known come there one hundred sixty nine In estimating the progress of his mind during these two years as well as in future periods of his life we must not regard his own hasty confession of idleness for we see when he explains himself that he was acquiring various stores and indeed he himself concluded the account with saying I would not have you think I was doing nothing then He might perhaps have studied more assiduously but it may be doubted whether such a mind as his was not more enriched by roaming at large in the fields of literature than if it had been confined to any single spot The analogy between body and mind is very general and the parallel will hold as to their food as well as any other particular The flesh of animals who feed excursively is allowed to have a higher flavour than that of those who are cooped up May there not be the same difference between men who read as their taste prompts and men who are confined in cells and colleges to stated tasks Page fifty eight Johnson enters Oxford A D seventeen twenty eight That a man in mister Michael Johnson s circumstances should think of sending his son to the expensive University of Oxford at his own charge seems very improbable The subject was too delicate to question Johnson upon But I have been assured by doctor Taylor that the scheme never would have taken place had not a gentleman of Shropshire one of his schoolfellows spontaneously undertaken to support him at Oxford in the character of his companion though in fact he never received any assistance whatever from that gentleman one hundred seventy He however went to Oxford and was entered a Commoner of Pembroke College on the thirty first of October seventeen twenty eight one hundred seventy one being then in his nineteenth year one hundred seventy two Page fifty nine His first tutor AETAT nineteen The Reverend doctor Adams who afterwards presided over Pembroke College with universal esteem told me he was present and gave me some account of what passed on the night of Johnson s arrival at Oxford one hundred seventy three On that evening his father who had anxiously accompanied him found means to have him introduced to mister Jorden who was to be his tutor His being put under any tutor reminds us of what Wood says of Robert Burton authour of the Anatomy of Melancholy when elected student of Christ Church for form s sake though he wanted not a tutor he was put under the tuition of doctor John Bancroft afterwards Bishop of Oxon one hundred seventy four His father seemed very full of the merits of his son and told the company he was a good scholar and a poet and wrote Latin verses His figure and manner appeared strange to them but he behaved modestly and sat silent till upon something which occurred in the course of conversation he suddenly struck in and quoted Macrobius and thus he gave the first impression of that more extensive reading in which he had indulged himself His tutor mister Jorden fellow of Pembroke was not it seems a man of such abilities as we should conceive requisite for the instructor of Samuel Johnson who gave me the following account of him He was a very worthy man but a heavy man and I did not profit much by his instructions Indeed I did not attend him much one hundred seventy five The first day after I came to college I waited upon him and then staid away four On the sixth mister Jorden asked me why I had not attended I answered I had been sliding in Christ Church meadow one hundred seventy six And this I said with as much nonchalance as I am now one hundred seventy seven talking to you I had no notion that I was wrong or irreverent to my tutor one hundred seventy eight BOSWELL That Sir was great fortitude of mind JOHNSON No Sir stark insensibility one hundred seventy nine Page sixty The fifth of November A D seventeen twenty eight The fifth of November one hundred eighty was at that time kept with great solemnity at Pembroke College and exercises upon the subject of the day were required one hundred eighty one Johnson neglected to perform his which is much to be regretted for his vivacity of imagination and force of language would probably have produced something sublime upon the gunpowder plot one hundred eighty two To apologise for his neglect he gave in a short copy of verses entitled Somnium containing a common thought that the Muse had come to him in his sleep and whispered that it did not become him to write on such subjects as politicks he should confine himself to humbler themes but the versification was truly Virgilian one hundred eighty three Page sixty one Johnson s version of Pope s Messiah AETAT nineteen He had a love and respect for Jorden not for his literature but for his worth Whenever said he a young man becomes Jorden s pupil he becomes his son Having given such a specimen of his poetical powers he was asked by mister Jorden to translate Pope s Messiah into Latin verse as a Christmas exercise He performed it with uncommon rapidity and in so masterly a manner that he obtained great applause from it which ever after kept him high in the estimation of his College and indeed of all the University one hundred eighty four It is said that mister Pope expressed himself concerning it in terms of strong approbation one hundred eighty five doctor Taylor told me that it was first printed for old mister Johnson without the knowledge of his son who was very angry when he heard of it A Miscellany of Poems collected by a person of the name of Husbands was published at Oxford in seventeen thirty one one hundred eighty six In that Miscellany Johnson s Translation of the Messiah appeared with this modest motto from Scaliger s Poeticks Ex alieno ingenio Poeta ex suo tantum versificator Page sixty two mister Courtenays eulogy A D seventeen twenty eight I am not ignorant that critical objections have been made to this and other specimens of Johnson s Latin Poetry one hundred eighty seven I acknowledge myself not competent to decide on a question of such extreme nicety But I am satisfied with the just and discriminative eulogy pronounced upon it by my friend mister Courtenay And with like ease his vivid lines assume The garb and dignity of ancient Rome Let college verse men trite conceits express Trick d out in splendid shreds of Virgil s dress From playful Ovid cull the tinsel phrase And vapid notions hitch in pilfer d lays Then with mosaick art the piece combine And boast the glitter of each dulcet line Johnson adventur d boldly to transfuse His vigorous sense into the Latian muse Aspir d to shine by unreflected light And with a Roman s ardour think and write He felt the tuneful Nine his breast inspire And like a master wak d the soothing lyre Horatian strains a grateful heart proclaim While Sky s wild rocks resound his Thralia s name one hundred eighty eight Hesperia s plant in some less skilful hands To bloom a while factitious heat demands Though glowing Maro a faint warmth supplies The sickly blossom in the hot house dies By Johnson s genial culture art and toil Its root strikes deep and owns the fost ring soil Imbibes our sun through all its swelling veins And grows a native of Britannia s plains one hundred eighty nine Page sixty three Johnson s morbid melancholy AEtat nineteen The morbid melancholy which was lurking in his constitution and to which we may ascribe those particularities and that aversion to regular life which at a very early period marked his character gathered such strength in his twentieth year as to afflict him in a dreadful manner While he was at Lichfield in the college vacation of the year seventeen twenty nine one hundred ninety he felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible hypochondria with perpetual irritation fretfulness and impatience and with a dejection gloom and despair which made existence misery one hundred ninety one From this dismal malady he never afterwards was perfectly relieved and all his labours and all his enjoyments were but temporary interruptions of its baleful influence one hundred ninety two How wonderful how unsearchable are the ways of GOD Johnson who was blest with all the powers of genius and understanding in a degree far above the ordinary state of human nature was at the same time visited with a disorder so afflictive that they who know it by dire experience will not envy his exalted endowments That it was in some degree occasioned by a defect in his nervous system that inexplicable part of our frame appears highly probable He told mister Paradise one hundred ninety three that he was sometimes so languid and inefficient that he could not distinguish the hour upon the town clock Page sixty four Johnson consults doctor Swinfen A D seventeen twenty nine Johnson upon the first violent attack of this disorder strove to overcome it by forcible exertions one hundred ninety four He frequently walked to Birmingham and back again one hundred ninety five and tried many other expedients but all in vain His expression concerning it to me was I did not then know how to manage it His distress became so intolerable that he applied to doctor Swinfen physician in Lichfield his god father and put into his hands a state of his case written in Latin doctor Swinfen was so much struck with the extraordinary acuteness research and eloquence of this paper that in his zeal for his godson he shewed it to several people His daughter missus Desmoulins who was many years humanely supported in doctor Johnson s house in London told me that upon his discovering that doctor Swinfen had communicated his case he was so much offended that he was never afterwards fully reconciled to him He indeed had good reason to be offended for though doctor Swinfen s motive was good he inconsiderately betrayed a matter deeply interesting and of great delicacy which had been entrusted to him in confidence and exposed a complaint of his young friend and patient which in the superficial opinion of the generality of mankind is attended with contempt and disgrace one hundred ninety six Page sixty five Johnson an hypochondriack AETAT twenty But let not little men triumph upon knowing that Johnson was an HYPOCHONDRIACK was subject to what the learned philosophical and pious doctor Cheyne has so well treated under the title of The English Malady one hundred ninety seven Though he suffered severely from it he was not therefore degraded The powers of his great mind might be troubled and their full exercise suspended at times but the mind itself was ever entire As a proof of this it is only necessary to consider that when he was at the very worst he composed that state of his own case which shewed an uncommon vigour not only of fancy and taste but of judgement I am aware that he himself was too ready to call such a complaint by the name of madness one hundred ninety eight in conformity with which notion he has traced its gradations with exquisite nicety in one of the chapters of his RASSELAS one hundred ninety nine But there is surely a clear distinction between a disorder which affects only the imagination and spirits while the judgement is sound and a disorder by which the judgement itself is impaired This distinction was made to me by the late Professor Gaubius of Leyden physician to the Prince of Orange in a conversation which I had with him several years ago and he expanded it thus If said he a man tells me that he is grievously disturbed for that he imagines he sees a ruffian coming against him with a drawn sword though at the same time he is conscious it is a delusion I pronounce him to have a disordered imagination but if a man tells me that he sees this and in consternation calls to me to look at it I pronounce him to be mad Page sixty six Johnson s dread of insanity A D seventeen twenty nine It is a common effect of low spirits or melancholy to make those who are afflicted with it imagine that they are actually suffering those evils which happen to be most strongly presented to their minds Some have fancied themselves to be deprived of the use of their limbs some to labour under acute diseases others to be in extreme poverty when in truth there was not the least reality in any of the suppositions so that when the vapours were dispelled they were convinced of the delusion To Johnson whose supreme enjoyment was the exercise of his reason the disturbance or obscuration of that faculty was the evil most to be dreaded Insanity therefore was the object of his most dismal apprehension two hundred and he fancied himself seized by it or approaching to it at the very time when he was giving proofs of a more than ordinary soundness and vigour of judgement That his own diseased imagination should have so far deceived him is strange but it is stranger still that some of his friends should have given credit to his groundless opinion when they had such undoubted proofs that it was totally fallacious though it is by no means surprising that those who wish to depreciate him should since his death have laid hold of this circumstance and insisted upon it with very unfair aggravation two hundred one Amidst the oppression and distraction of a disease which very few have felt in its full extent but many have experienced in a slighter degree Johnson in his writings and in his conversation never failed to display all the varieties of intellectual excellence In his march through this world to a better his mind still appeared grand and brilliant and impressed all around him with the truth of Virgil s noble sentiment Igneus est ollis vigor et coelestis origo two hundred two Page sixty seven His reluctance to go to church AEtat twenty The history of his mind as to religion is an important article I have mentioned the early impressions made upon his tender imagination by his mother who continued her pious care with assiduity but in his opinion not with judgement Sunday said he was a heavy day to me when I was a boy My mother confined me on that day and made me read The Whole Duty of Man from a great part of which I could derive no instruction When for instance I had read the chapter on theft which from my infancy I had been taught was wrong I was no more convinced that theft was wrong than before so there was no accession of knowledge A boy should be introduced to such books by having his attention directed to the arrangement to the style and other excellencies of composition that the mind being thus engaged by an amusing variety of objects may not grow weary Page sixty eight Law s Serious Call A D seventeen twenty nine Page sixty nine Johnson grounded in religion AEtat twenty He communicated to me the following particulars upon the subject of his religious progress I fell into an inattention to religion or an indifference about it in my ninth year The church at Lichfield in which we had a seat wanted reparation two hundred three so I was to go and find a seat in other churches and having bad eyes and being awkward about this I used to go and read in the fields on Sunday This habit continued till my fourteenth year and still I find a great reluctance to go to church two hundred four I then became a sort of lax talker against religion for I did not much think against it and this lasted till I went to Oxford where it would not be suffered two hundred five When at Oxford I took up Law s Serious Call to a Holy Life two hundred six expecting to find it a dull book as such books generally are and perhaps to laugh at it But I found Law quite an overmatch for me and this was the first occasion of my thinking in earnest of religion after I became capable of rational inquiry two hundred seven From this time forward religion was the predominant object of his thoughts two hundred eight though with the just sentiments of a conscientious Christian he lamented that his practice of its duties fell far short of what it ought to be This instance of a mind such as that of Johnson being first disposed by an unexpected incident to think with anxiety of the momentous concerns of eternity and of what he should do to be saved two hundred nine may for ever be produced in opposition to the superficial and sometimes profane contempt that has been thrown upon those occasional impressions which it is certain many Christians have experienced though it must be acknowledged that weak minds from an erroneous supposition that no man is in a state of grace who has not felt a particular conversion have in some cases brought a degree of ridicule upon them a ridicule of which it is inconsiderate or unfair to make a general application Page seventy Johnson s studies at Oxford A D seventeen twenty nine How seriously Johnson was impressed with a sense of religion even in the vigour of his youth appears from the following passage in his minutes kept by way of diary Sept seven two hundred ten seventeen thirty six I have this day entered upon my twenty eighth year Mayest thou O God enable me for JESUS CHRIST S sake to spend this in such a manner that I may receive comfort from it at the hour of death and in the day of judgement Amen Page seventy one His rapid reading and composition AEtat twenty The particular course of his reading while at Oxford and during the time of vacation which he passed at home cannot be traced Enough has been said of his irregular mode of study He told me that from his earliest years he loved to read poetry but hardly ever read any poem to an end that he read Shakspeare at a period so early that the speech of the ghost in Hamlet terrified him when he was alone two hundred eleven that Horace s Odes were the compositions in which he took most delight and it was long before he liked his Epistles and Satires He told me what he read solidly at Oxford was Greek not the Grecian historians but Homer two hundred twelve and Euripides and now and then a little Epigram that the study of which he was the most fond was Metaphysicks but he had not read much even in that way I always thought that he did himself injustice in his account of what he had read and that he must have been speaking with reference to the vast portion of study which is possible and to which a few scholars in the whole history of literature have attained for when I once asked him whether a person whose name I have now forgotten studied hard he answered No Sir I do not believe he studied hard I never knew a man who studied hard I conclude indeed from the effects that some men have studied hard as Bentley and Clarke Trying him by that criterion upon which he formed his judgement of others we may be absolutely certain both from his writings and his conversation that his reading was very extensive doctor Adam Smith than whom few were better judges on this subject once observed to me that Johnson knew more books than any man alive He had a peculiar facility in seizing at once what was valuable in any book without submitting to the labour of perusing it from beginning to end two hundred thirteen He had from the irritability of his constitution at all times an impatience and hurry when he either read or wrote A certain apprehension arising from novelty made him write his first exercise at College twice over two hundred fourteen but he never took that trouble with any other composition and we shall see that his most excellent works were struck off at a heat with rapid exertion two hundred fifteen Page seventy two Johnson s rooms in College A D seventeen twenty nine Yet he appears from his early notes or memorandums in my possession to have at various times attempted or at least planned a methodical course of study according to computation of which he was all his life fond as it fixed his attention steadily upon something without and prevented his mind from preying upon itself two hundred sixteen Thus I find in his hand writing the number of lines in each of two of Euripides Tragedies of the Georgicks of Virgil of the first six books of the AEneid of Horace s Art of Poetry of three of the books of Ovid s Metamorphosis of some parts of Theocritus and of the tenth Satire of Juvenal and a table shewing at the rate of various numbers a day I suppose verses to be read what would be in each case the total amount in a week month and year two hundred seventeen No man had a more ardent love of literature or a higher respect for it than Johnson His apartment in Pembroke College was that upon the second floor over the gateway The enthusiasts of learning will ever contemplate it with veneration One day while he was sitting in it quite alone doctor Panting two hundred eighteen then master of the College whom he called a fine Jacobite fellow overheard two hundred nineteen him uttering this soliloquy in his strong emphatick voice Well I have a mind to see what is done in other places of learning I ll go and visit the Universities abroad I ll go to France and Italy I ll go to Padua two hundred twenty And I ll mind my business For an Athenian blockhead is the worst of all blockheads two hundred twenty one Page seventy three Johnson a frolicksome fellow AEtat twenty doctor Adams told me that Johnson while he was at Pembroke College was caressed and loved by all about him was a gay and frolicksome two hundred twenty two fellow and passed there the happiest part of his life But this is a striking proof of the fallacy of appearances and how little any of us know of the real internal state even of those whom we see most frequently for the truth is that he was then depressed by poverty and irritated by disease When I mentioned to him this account as given me by doctor Adams he said Ah Sir I was mad and violent It was bitterness which they mistook for frolick two hundred twenty three I was miserably poor and I thought to fight my way by my literature and my wit so I disregarded all power and all authority two hundred twenty four Page seventy four doctor Adams A D seventeen thirty The Bishop of Dromore observes in a letter to me The pleasure he took in vexing the tutors and fellows has been often mentioned But I have heard him say what ought to be recorded to the honour of the present venerable master of that College the Reverend William Adams D D who was then very young and one of the junior fellows that the mild but judicious expostulations of this worthy man whose virtue awed him and whose learning he revered made him really ashamed of himself though I fear said he I was too proud to own it I have heard from some of his cotemporaries that he was generally seen lounging at the College gate with a circle of young students round him whom he was entertaining with wit and keeping from their studies if not spiriting them up to rebellion against the College discipline which in his maturer years he so much extolled He very early began to attempt keeping notes or memorandums by way of a diary of his life I find in a parcel of loose leaves the following spirited resolution to contend against his natural indolence Oct seventeen twenty nine Desidiae valedixi syrenis istius cantibus surdam posthac aurem obversurus I bid farewell to Sloth being resolved henceforth not to listen to her syren strains I have also in my possession a few leaves of another Libellus or little book entitled ANNALES in which some of the early particulars of his history are registered in Latin Page seventy five A nest of singing birds AEtat twenty one I do not find that he formed any close intimacies with his fellow collegians But doctor Adams told me that he contracted a love and regard for Pembroke College which he retained to the last A short time before his death he sent to that College a present of all his works to be deposited in their library two hundred twenty five and he had thoughts of leaving to it his house at Lichfield but his friends who were about him very properly dissuaded him from it and he bequeathed it to some poor relations two hundred twenty six He took a pleasure in boasting of the many eminent men who had been educated at Pembroke In this list are found the names of mister Hawkins the Poetry Professor two hundred twenty seven mister Shenstone Sir William Blackstone and others two hundred twenty eight not forgetting the celebrated popular preacher mister George Whitefield of whom though doctor Johnson did not think very highly two hundred twenty nine it must be acknowledged that his eloquence was powerful his views pious and charitable his assiduity almost incredible and that since his death the integrity of his character has been fully vindicated Being himself a poet Johnson was peculiarly happy in mentioning how many of the sons of Pembroke were poets adding with a smile of sportive triumph Sir we are a nest of singing birds two hundred thirty Page seventy six doctor Taylor at Christ Church A D seventeen thirty Page seventy seven Johnson s worn out shoes AEtat twenty one He was not however blind to what he thought the defects of his own College and I have from the information of doctor Taylor a very strong instance of that rigid honesty which he ever inflexibly preserved Taylor had obtained his father s consent to be entered of Pembroke that he might be with his schoolfellow Johnson with whom though some years older than himself he was very intimate This would have been a great comfort to Johnson But he fairly told Taylor that he could not in conscience suffer him to enter where he knew he could not have an able tutor He then made inquiry all round the University and having found that mister Bateman of Christ Church was the tutor of highest reputation Taylor was entered of that College two hundred thirty one mister Bateman s lectures were so excellent that Johnson used to come and get them at second hand from Taylor till his poverty being so extreme that his shoes were worn out and his feet appeared through them he saw that this humiliating circumstance was perceived by the Christ Church men and he came no more two hundred thirty two He was too proud to accept of money and somebody having set a pair of new shoes at his door he threw them away with indignation two hundred thirty three How must we feel when we read such an anecdote of Samuel Johnson His spirited refusal of an eleemosynary supply of shoes arose no doubt from a proper pride But considering his ascetick disposition at times as acknowledged by himself in his Meditations and the exaggeration with which some have treated the peculiarities of his character I should not wonder to hear it ascribed to a principle of superstitious mortification as we are told by Tursellinus in his Life of saint Ignatius Loyola that this intrepid founder of the order of Jesuits when he arrived at Goa after having made a severe pilgrimage through the Eastern deserts persisted in wearing his miserable shattered shoes and when new ones were offered him rejected them as an unsuitable indulgence Page seventy eight Johnson leaves Oxford A D seventeen thirty one The res angusta domi two hundred thirty four prevented him from having the advantage of a complete academical education two hundred thirty five The friend to whom he had trusted for support had deceived him His debts in College though not great were increasing two hundred thirty six and his scanty remittances from Lichfield which had all along been made with great difficulty could be supplied no longer his father having fallen into a state of insolvency Compelled therefore by irresistible necessity he left the College in autumn seventeen thirty one without a degree having been a member of it little more than three years two hundred thirty seven Page seventy nine His destitute state AEtat twenty two doctor Adams the worthy and respectable master of Pembroke College has generally had the reputation of being Johnson s tutor The fact however is that in seventeen thirty one mister Jorden quitted the College and his pupils were transferred to doctor Adams so that had Johnson returned doctor Adams would have been his tutor It is to be wished that this connection had taken place His equal temper mild disposition and politeness of manners might have insensibly softened the harshness of Johnson and infused into him those more delicate charities those petites morales in which it must be confessed our great moralist was more deficient than his best friends could fully justify doctor Adams paid Johnson this high compliment He said to me at Oxford in seventeen seventy six I was his nominal tutor two hundred thirty eight but he was above my mark When I repeated it to Johnson his eyes flashed with grateful satisfaction and he exclaimed That was liberal and noble Page eighty Michael Johnson s death A D seventeen thirty one And now I had almost said poor Samuel Johnson returned to his native city destitute and not knowing how he should gain even a decent livelihood His father s misfortunes in trade rendered him unable to support his son two hundred thirty nine and for some time there appeared no means by which he could maintain himself In the December of this year his father died The state of poverty in which he died appears from a note in one of Johnson s little diaries of the following year which strongly displays his spirit and virtuous dignity of mind seventeen thirty two Julii fifteen Undecim aureos deposui quo die quicquid ante matris funus quod serum sit precor de paternis bonis sperari licet viginti scilicet libras accepi Usque adeo mihi fortuna fingenda est Interea ne paupertate vires animi languescant nee in flagilia egestas abigat cavendum I layed by eleven guineas on this day when I received twenty pounds being all that I have reason to hope for out of my father s effects previous to the death of my mother an event which I pray GOD may be very remote I now therefore see that I must make my own fortune Meanwhile let me take care that the powers of my mind may not be debilitated by poverty and that indigence do not force me into any criminal act Johnson was so far fortunate that the respectable character of his parents and his own merit had from his earliest years secured him a kind reception in the best families at Lichfield Among these I can mention mister Howard two hundred forty doctor Swinfen mister Simpson mister Levett two hundred forty one Captain Garrick father of the great ornament of the British stage but above all mister Gilbert Walmsley two hundred forty two Register of the Prerogative Court of Lichfield whose character long after his decease doctor Johnson has in his Life of Edmund Smith two hundred forty three thus drawn in the glowing colours of gratitude Page eighty one Gilbert Walmsley AEtat twenty two Of Gilbert Walmsley two hundred forty four thus presented to my mind let me indulge myself in the remembrance I knew him very early he was one of the first friends that literature procured me and I hope that at least my gratitude made me worthy of his notice He was of an advanced age and I was only not a boy yet he never received my notions with contempt He was a whig with all the virulence and malevolence of his party yet difference of opinion did not keep us apart I honoured him and he endured me He had mingled with the gay world without exemption from its vices or its follies but had never neglected the cultivation of his mind His belief of revelation was unshaken his learning preserved his principles he grew first regular and then pious His studies had been so various that I am not able to name a man of equal knowledge His acquaintance with books was great and what he did not immediately know he could at least tell where to find Such was his amplitude of learning and such his copiousness of communication that it may be doubted whether a day now passes in which I have not some advantage from his friendship At this man s table I enjoyed many cheerful and instructive hours with companions such as are not often found with one who has lengthened and one who has gladdened life with doctor James two hundred forty five whose skill in physick will be long remembered and with David Garrick whom I hoped to have gratified with this character of our common friend But what are the hopes of man I am disappointed by that stroke of death which has eclipsed the gaiety of nations and impoverished the publick stock of harmless pleasure two hundred forty six Page eighty two Lichfield society A D seventeen thirty two In these families he passed much time in his early years In most of them he was in the company of ladies particularly at mister Walmsley s whose wife and sisters in law of the name of Aston and daughters of a Baronet were remarkable for good breeding so that the notion which has been industriously circulated and believed that he never was in good company till late in life and consequently had been confirmed in coarse and ferocious manners by long habits is wholly without foundation Some of the ladies have assured me they recollected him well when a young man as distinguished for his complaisance And that this politeness was not merely occasional and temporary or confined to the circles of Lichfield is ascertained by the testimony of a lady who in a paper with which I have been favoured by a daughter of his intimate friend and physician doctor Lawrence thus describes doctor Johnson some years afterwards As the particulars of the former part of doctor Johnson s life do not seem to be very accurately known a lady hopes that the following information may not be unacceptable Page eighty three Molly Aston AEtat twenty three She remembers doctor Johnson on a visit to doctor Taylor at Ashbourn some time between the end of the year thirty seven and the middle of the year forty she rather thinks it to have been after he and his wife were removed to London two hundred forty seven During his stay at Ashbourn he made frequent visits to mister Meynell two hundred forty eight at Bradley where his company was much desired by the ladies of the family who were perhaps in point of elegance and accomplishments inferiour to few of those with whom he was afterwards acquainted mister Meynell s eldest daughter was afterwards married to mister Fitzherbert two hundred forty nine father to mister Alleyne Fitzherbert lately minister to the court of Russia Of her doctor Johnson said in doctor Lawrence s study that she had the best understanding he ever met with in any human being two hundred fifty At mister Meynell s he also commenced that friendship with missus Hill Boothby two hundred fifty one sister to the present Sir Brook Boothby which continued till her death The young woman whom he used to call Molly Aston two hundred fifty two was sister to Sir Thomas Aston and daughter to a Baronet she was also sister to the wife of his friend mister Gilbert Walmsley two hundred fifty three Besides his intimacy with the above mentioned persons who were surely people of rank and education while he was yet at Lichfield he used to be frequently at the house of doctor Swinfen a gentleman of a very ancient family in Staffordshire from which after the death of his elder brother he inherited a good estate He was besides a physician of very extensive practice but for want of due attention to the management of his domestick concerns left a very large family in indigence One of his daughters missus Desmoulins afterwards found an asylum in the house of her old friend whose doors were always open to the unfortunate and who well observed the precept of the Gospel for he was kind to the unthankful and to the evil two hundred fifty four Page eighty four Johnson an usher A D seventeen thirty two In the forlorn state of his circumstances he accepted of an offer to be employed as usher in the school of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire to which it appears from one of his little fragments of a diary that he went on foot on the sixteenth of July Julii sixteen Bosvortiam pedes petii two hundred fifty five But it is not true as has been erroneously related that he was assistant to the famous Anthony Blackwall whose merit has been honoured by the testimony of Bishop Hurd two hundred fifty six who was his scholar for mister Blackwall died on the eighth of April seventeen thirty two hundred fifty seven more than a year before Johnson left the University two hundred fifty eight This employment was very irksome to him in every respect and he complained grievously of it in his letters to his friend mister Hector who was now settled as a surgeon at Birmingham The letters are lost but mister Hector recollects his writing that the poet had described the dull sameness of his existence in these words Vitam continet una dies one day contains the whole of my life that it was unvaried as the note of the cuckow and that he did not know whether it was more disagreeable for him to teach or the boys to learn the grammar rules His general aversion to this painful drudgery was greatly enhanced by a disagreement between him and Sir Wolstan Dixey the patron of the school in whose house I have been told he officiated as a kind of domestick chaplain so far at least as to say grace at table but was treated with what he represented as intolerable harshness two hundred fifty nine and after suffering for a few months such complicated misery two hundred sixty he relinquished a situation which all his life afterwards he recollected with the strongest aversion and even a degree of horrour two hundred sixty one But it is probable that at this period whatever uneasiness he may have endured he laid the foundation of much future eminence by application to his studies Page eighty five His life in Birmingham AEtat twenty three Being now again totally unoccupied he was invited by mister Hector to pass some time with him at Birmingham as his guest at the house of mister Warren with whom mister Hector lodged and boarded mister Warren was the first established bookseller in Birmingham and was very attentive to Johnson who he soon found could be of much service to him in his trade by his knowledge of literature and he even obtained the assistance of his pen in furnishing some numbers of a periodical Essay printed in the news paper of which Warren was proprietor two hundred sixty two After very diligent inquiry I have not been able to recover those early specimens of that particular mode of writing by which Johnson afterwards so greatly distinguished himself Page eighty six Lobo s Voyage to Abyssinia A D seventeen thirty three He continued to live as mister Hector s guest for about six months and then hired lodgings in another part of the town two hundred sixty three finding himself as well situated at Birmingham two hundred sixty four as he supposed he could be any where while he had no settled plan of life and very scanty means of subsistence He made some valuable acquaintances there amongst whom were mister Porter a mercer whose widow he afterwards married and mister Taylor two hundred sixty five who by his ingenuity in mechanical inventions and his success in trade acquired an immense fortune But the comfort of being near mister Hector his old school fellow and intimate friend was Johnson s chief inducement to continue here In what manner he employed his pen at this period or whether he derived from it any pecuniary advantage I have not been able to ascertain He probably got a little money from mister Warren and we are certain that he executed here one piece of literary labour of which mister Hector has favoured me with a minute account Having mentioned that he had read at Pembroke College a Voyage to Abyssinia by Lobo a Portuguese Jesuit and that he thought an abridgment and translation of it from the French into English might be an useful and profitable publication mister Warren and mister Hector joined in urging him to undertake it He accordingly agreed and the book not being to be found in Birmingham he borrowed it of Pembroke College A part of the work being very soon done one Osborn who was mister Warren s printer was set to work with what was ready and Johnson engaged to supply the press with copy as it should be wanted but his constitutional indolence soon prevailed and the work was at a stand mister Hector who knew that a motive of humanity would be the most prevailing argument with his friend went to Johnson and represented to him that the printer could have no other employment till this undertaking was finished and that the poor man and his family were suffering Johnson upon this exerted the powers of his mind though his body was relaxed He lay in bed with the book which was a quarto before him and dictated while Hector wrote mister Hector carried the sheets to the press and corrected almost all the proof sheets very few of which were even seen by Johnson In this manner with the aid of mister Hector s active friendship the book was completed and was published in seventeen thirty five with LONDON upon the title page though it was in reality printed at Birmingham a device too common with provincial publishers For this work he had from mister Warren only the sum of five guineas two hundred sixty six This being the first prose work of Johnson it is a curious object of inquiry how much may be traced in it of that style which marks his subsequent writings with such peculiar excellence with so happy an union of force vivacity and perspicuity I have perused the book with this view and have found that here as I believe in every other translation there is in the work itself no vestige of the translator s own style for the language of translation being adapted to the thoughts of another person insensibly follows their cast and as it were runs into a mould that is ready prepared two hundred sixty seven Thus for instance taking the first sentence that occurs at the opening of the book p four I lived here above a year and completed my studies in divinity in which time some letters were received from the fathers of Ethiopia with an account that Sultan Segned two hundred sixty eight Emperour of Abyssinia was converted to the church of Rome that many of his subjects had followed his example and that there was a great want of missionaries to improve these prosperous beginnings Every body was very desirous of seconding the zeal of our fathers and of sending them the assistance they requested to which we were the more encouraged because the Emperour s letter informed our Provincial that we might easily enter his dominions by the way of Dancala but unhappily the secretary wrote Geila two hundred sixty nine for Dancala which cost two of our fathers their lives Every one acquainted with Johnson s manner will be sensible that there is nothing of it here but that this sentence might have been composed by any other man But in the Preface the Johnsonian style begins to appear and though use had not yet taught his wing a permanent and equable flight there are parts of it which exhibit his best manner in full vigour I had once the pleasure of examining it with mister Edmund Burke who confirmed me in this opinion by his superiour critical sagacity and was I remember much delighted with the following specimen The Portuguese traveller contrary to the general vein of his countrymen has amused his reader with no romantick absurdity or incredible fictions whatever he relates whether true or not is at least probable and he who tells nothing exceeding the bounds of probability has a right to demand that they should believe him who cannot contradict him He appears by his modest and unaffected narration to have described things as he saw them to have copied nature from the life and to have consulted his senses not his imagination He meets with no basilisks that destroy with their eyes his crocodiles devour their prey without tears and his cataracts fall from the rocks without deafening the neighbouring inhabitants two hundred seventy The reader will here find no regions cursed with irremediable barrenness or blessed with spontaneous fecundity no perpetual gloom or unceasing sunshine nor are the nations here described either devoid of all sense of humanity or consummate in all private or social virtues Here are no Hottentots without religious polity or articulate language two hundred seventy one no Chinese perfectly polite and completely skilled in all sciences he will discover what will always be discovered by a diligent and impartial enquirer that wherever human nature is to be found there is a mixture of vice and virtue a contest of passion and reason and that the Creator doth not appear partial in his distributions but has balanced in most countries their particular inconveniencies by particular favours Here we have an early example of that brilliant and energetick expression which upon innumerable occasions in his subsequent life justly impressed the world with the highest admiration Nor can any one conversant with the writings of Johnson fail to discern his hand in this passage of the Dedication to John Warren esquire of Pembrokeshire though it is ascribed to Warren the bookseller A generous and elevated mind is distinguished by nothing more certainly than an eminent degree of curiosity two hundred seventy two nor is that curiosity ever more agreeably or usefully employed than in examining the laws and customs of foreign nations I hope therefore the present I now presume to make will not be thought improper which however it is not my business as a dedicator to commend nor as a bookseller to depreciate It is reasonable to suppose that his having been thus accidentally led to a particular study of the history and manners of Abyssinia was the remote occasion of his writing many years afterwards his admirable philosophical tale two hundred seventy three the principal scene of which is laid in that country Page ninety Proposals to print Politian A D seventeen thirty four Johnson returned to Lichfield early in seventeen thirty four and in August two hundred seventy four that year he made an attempt to procure some little subsistence by his pen for he published proposals for printing by subscription the Latin Poems of Politian two hundred seventy five Angeli Politiani Poemata Latina quibus Notas cum historia Latinae poeseos a Petrarchae aevo ad Politiani tempora deducta et vita Politiani fusius quam antehac enarrata addidit SAM JOHNSON two hundred seventy six It appears that his brother Nathanael two hundred seventy seven had taken up his father s trade for it is mentioned that subscriptions are taken in by the Editor or N Johnson bookseller of Lichfield Notwithstanding the merit of Johnson and the cheap price at which this book was offered there were not subscribers enough to insure a sufficient sale so the work never appeared and probably never was executed Page ninety one First letter to Edward Cave AEtat twenty five We find him again this year at Birmingham and there is preserved the following letter from him to mister Edward Cave two hundred seventy eight the original compiler and editor of the Gentleman s Magazine TO mister CAVE Nov twenty five seventeen thirty four Sir As you appear no less sensible than your readers of the defects of your poetical article you will not be displeased if in order to the improvement of it I communicate to you the sentiments of a person who will undertake on reasonable terms sometimes to fill a column His opinion is that the publick would not give you a bad reception if beside the current wit of the month which a critical examination would generally reduce to a narrow compass you admitted not only poems inscriptions c never printed before which he will sometimes supply you with but likewise short literary dissertations in Latin or English critical remarks on authours ancient or modern forgotten poems that deserve revival or loose pieces like Floyer s two hundred seventy nine worth preserving By this method your literary article for so it might be called will he thinks be better recommended to the publick than by low jests awkward buffoonery or the dull scurrilities of either party If such a correspondence will be agreeable to you be pleased to inform me in two posts what the conditions are on which you shall expect it Your late offer two hundred eighty gives me no reason to distrust your generosity If you engage in any literary projects besides this paper I have other designs to impart if I could be secure from having others reap the advantage of what I should hint Page ninety two Verses on a sprig of myrtle A D seventeen thirty four Your letter by being directed to S Smith to be left at the Castle in two hundred eighty one Birmingham Warwickshire will reach Your humble servant mister Cave has put a note on this letter Answered Dec two But whether any thing was done in consequence of it we are not informed Johnson had from his early youth been sensible to the influence of female charms When at Stourbridge school he was much enamoured of Olivia Lloyd a young quaker to whom he wrote a copy of verses which I have not been able to recover but with what facility and elegance he could warble the amorous lay will appear from the following lines which he wrote for his friend mister Edmund Hector Page ninety three Boswell s controversy with Miss Seward AEtat twenty five VERSES to a LADY on receiving from her a SPRIG of MYRTLE What hopes what terrours does thy gift create Ambiguous emblem of uncertain fate The myrtle ensign of supreme command Consign d by Venus to Melissa s hand Not less capricious than a reigning fair Now grants and now rejects a lover s prayer In myrtle shades oft sings the happy swain In myrtle shades despairing ghosts complain The myrtle crowns the happy lovers heads The unhappy lovers grave the myrtle spreads O then the meaning of thy gift impart And ease the throbbings of an anxious heart Soon must this bough as you shall fix his doom Adorn Philander s head or grace his tomb two hundred eighty two Page ninety four Johnson s personal appearance A D seventeen thirty four His juvenile attachments to the fair sex were however very transient and it is certain that he formed no criminal connection whatsoever mister Hector who lived with him in his younger days in the utmost intimacy and social freedom has assured me that even at that ardent season his conduct was strictly virtuous in that respect two hundred eighty three and that though he loved to exhilarate himself with wine he never knew him intoxicated but once two hundred eighty four Page ninety five missus Porter AEtat twenty five In a man whom religious education has secured from licentious indulgences the passion of love when once it has seized him is exceedingly strong being unimpaired by dissipation and totally concentrated in one object This was experienced by Johnson when he became the fervent admirer of missus Porter after her first husband s death two hundred eighty five Miss Porter told me that when he was first introduced to her mother his appearance was very forbidding he was then lean and lank so that his immense structure of bones was hideously striking to the eye and the scars of the scrophula were deeply visible two hundred eighty six He also wore his hair two hundred eighty seven which was straight and stiff and separated behind and he often had seemingly convulsive starts and odd gesticulations which tended to excite at once surprize and ridicule two hundred eighty eight missus Porter was so much engaged by his conversation that she overlooked all these external disadvantages and said to her daughter this is the most sensible man that I ever saw in my life Though missus Porter was double the age of Johnson two hundred eighty nine and her person and manner as described to me by the late mister Garrick were by no means pleasing to others she must have had a superiority of understanding and talents as she certainly inspired him with a more than ordinary passion and she having signified her willingness to accept of his hand he went to Lichfield to ask his mother s consent to the marriage which he could not but be conscious was a very imprudent scheme both on account of their disparity of years and her want of fortune two hundred ninety But missus Johnson knew too well the ardour of her son s temper and was too tender a parent to oppose his inclinations Page ninety six Johnson s marriage A D seventeen thirty six I know not for what reason the marriage ceremony was not performed at Birmingham but a resolution was taken that it should be at Derby for which place the bride and bridegroom set out on horseback I suppose in very good humour But though mister Topham Beauclerk used archly to mention Johnson s having told him with much gravity Sir it was a love marriage on both sides I have had from my illustrious friend the following curious account of their journey to church upon the nuptial morn ninth July Sir she had read the old romances and had got into her head the fantastical notion that a woman of spirit should use her lover like a dog So Sir at first she told me that I rode too fast and she could not keep up with me and when I rode a little slower she passed me and complained that I lagged behind I was not to be made the slave of caprice and I resolved to begin as I meant to end I therefore pushed on briskly till I was fairly out of her sight The road lay between two hedges so I was sure she could not miss it and I contrived that she should soon come up with me When she did I observed her to be in tears This it must be allowed was a singular beginning of connubial felicity but there is no doubt that Johnson though he thus shewed a manly firmness proved a most affectionate and indulgent husband to the last moment of missus Johnson s life and in his Prayers and Meditations we find very remarkable evidence that his regard and fondness for her never ceased even after her death Page ninety seven His School at Edial AEtat twenty seven He now set up a private academy two hundred ninety one for which purpose he hired a large house well situated near his native city In the Gentleman s Magazine for seventeen thirty six there is the following advertisement At Edial near Lichfield two hundred ninety two in Staffordshire young gentlemen are boarded and taught the Latin and Greek languages by SAMUEL JOHNSON But the only pupils that were put under his care were the celebrated David Garrick and his brother George and a mister Offely a young gentleman of good fortune who died early As yet his name had nothing of that celebrity which afterwards commanded the highest attention and respect of mankind Had such an advertisement appeared after the publication of his London or his Rambler or his Dictionary how would it have burst upon the world with what eagerness would the great and the wealthy have embraced an opportunity of putting their sons under the learned tuition of SAMUEL JOHNSON The truth however is that he was not so well qualified for being a teacher of elements and a conductor in learning by regular gradations as men of inferiour powers of mind His own acquisitions had been made by fits and starts by violent irruptions into the regions of knowledge and it could not be expected that his impatience would be subdued and his impetuosity restrained so as to fit him for a quiet guide to novices The art of communicating instruction of whatever kind is much to be valued and I have ever thought that those who devote themselves to this employment and do their duty with diligence and success are entitled to very high respect from the community as Johnson himself often maintained two hundred ninety three Yet I am of opinion that the greatest abilities are not only not required for this office but render a man less fit for it Page ninety eight Garrick Johnson s pupil A D seventeen thirty six While we acknowledge the justness of Thomson s beautiful remark Delightful task to rear the tender thought And teach two hundred ninety four the young idea how to shoot we must consider that this delight is perceptible only by a mind at ease a mind at once calm and clear but that a mind gloomy and impetuous like that of Johnson cannot be fixed for any length of time in minute attention and must be so frequently irritated by unavoidable slowness and errour in the advances of scholars as to perform the duty with little pleasure to the teacher and no great advantage to the pupils two hundred ninety five Good temper is a most essential requisite in a Preceptor Horace paints the character as bland Ut pueris olim dant crustula blandi Doctores elementa velint ut discere two hundred ninety six Page ninety nine missus Johnson AEtat twenty seven Johnson was not more satisfied with his situation as the master of an academy than with that of the usher of a school we need not wonder therefore that he did not keep his academy above a year and a half From mister Garrick s account he did not appear to have been profoundly reverenced by his pupils His oddities of manner and uncouth gesticulations could not but be the subject of merriment to them and in particular the young rogues used to listen at the door of his bed chamber and peep through the key hole that they might turn into ridicule his tumultuous and awkward fondness for missus Johnson whom he used to name by the familiar appellation of Tetty or Tetsey which like Betty or Betsey is provincially used as a contraction for Elisabeth her Christian name but which to us seems ludicrous when applied to a woman of her age and appearance mister Garrick described her to me as very fat with a bosom of more than ordinary protuberance with swelled cheeks of a florid red produced by thick painting and increased by the liberal use of cordials flaring and fantastick in her dress and affected both in her speech and her general behaviour I have seen Garrick exhibit her by his exquisite talent of mimickry so as to excite the heartiest bursts of laughter but he probably as is the case in all such representations considerably aggravated the picture two hundred ninety seven That Johnson well knew the most proper course to be pursued in the instruction of youth is authentically ascertained by the following paper two hundred ninety eight in his own hand writing given about this period to a relation and now in the possession of mister John Nichols SCHEME for the CLASSES of a GRAMMAR SCHOOL When the introduction or formation of nouns and verbs is perfectly mastered let them learn Corderius by mister Clarke beginning at the same time to translate out of the introduction that by this means they may learn the syntax Then let them proceed to Erasmus with an English translation by the same authour Class II Learns Eutropius and Cornelius Nepos or Justin with the translation N B The first class gets for their part every morning the rules which they have learned before and in the afternoon learns the Latin rules of the nouns and verbs Page one hundred A scheme of study A D seventeen thirty six They are examined in the rules which they have learned every Thursday and Saturday The second class does the same whilst they are in Eutropius afterwards their part is in the irregular nouns and verbs and in the rules for making and scanning verses They are examined as the first Class III Ovid s Metamorphoses in the morning and Caesar s Commentaries in the afternoon Practise in the Latin rules till they are perfect in them afterwards in mister Leeds s Greek Grammar Examined as before Afterwards they proceed to Virgil beginning at the same time to write themes and verses and to learn Greek from thence passing on to Horace c as shall seem most proper I know not well what books to direct you to because you have not informed me what study you will apply yourself to I believe it will be most for your advantage to apply yourself wholly to the languages till you go to the University The Greek authours I think it best for you to read are these Cebes AElian Lucian by Leeds Attick Xenophon Homer Ionick Theocritus Dorick Euripides Attick and Dorick Thus you will be tolerably skilled in all the dialects beginning with the Attick to which the rest must be referred In the study of Latin it is proper not to read the latter authours till you are well versed in those of the purest ages as Terence Tully Caesar Sallust Nepos Velleius Paterculus Virgil Horace Phaedrus The greatest and most necessary task still remains to attain a habit of expression without which knowledge is of little use This is necessary in Latin and more necessary in English and can only be acquired by a daily imitation of the best and correctest authours SAM JOHNSON While Johnson kept his academy there can be no doubt that he was insensibly furnishing his mind with various knowledge but I have not discovered that he wrote any thing except a great part of his tragedy of Irene mister Peter Garrick the elder brother of David told me that he remembered Johnson s borrowing the Turkish History two hundred ninety nine of him in order to form his play from it When he had finished some part of it he read what he had done to mister Walmsley who objected to his having already brought his heroine into great distress and asked him how can you possibly contrive to plunge her into deeper calamity Johnson in sly allusion to the supposed oppressive proceedings of the court of which mister Walmsley was register replied Sir I can put her into the Spiritual Court Page one hundred one Johnson tries his fortune in London AEtat twenty seven mister Walmsley however was well pleased with this proof of Johnson s abilities as a dramatick writer and advised him to finish the tragedy and produce it on the stage Johnson now thought of trying his fortune in London the great field of genius and exertion where talents of every kind have the fullest scope and the highest encouragement It is a memorable circumstance that his pupil David Garrick went thither at the same time three hundred with intention to complete his education and follow the profession of the law from which he was soon diverted by his decided preference for the stage This joint expedition of those two eminent men to the metropolis was many years afterwards noticed in an allegorical poem on Shakspeare s Mulberry Tree by mister Lovibond the ingenious authour of The Tears of Old May day three hundred one They were recommended to mister Colson three hundred two an eminent mathematician and master of an academy by the following letter from mister Walmsley Page one hundred two mister Walmsley s Letter A D seventeen thirty seven To THE REVEREND mister COLSON Lichfield March two seventeen thirty seven DEAR SIR I had the favour of yours and am extremely obliged to you but I cannot say I had a greater affection for you upon it than I had before being long since so much endeared to you as well by an early friendship as by your many excellent and valuable qualifications and had I a son of my own it would be my ambition instead of sending him to the University to dispose of him as this young gentleman is He and another neighbour of mine one mister Samuel Johnson set out this morning for London together Davy Garrick is to be with you early the next week and mister Johnson to try his fate with a tragedy and to see to get himself employed in some translation either from the Latin or the French Johnson is a very good scholar and poet and I have great hopes will turn out a fine tragedy writer If it should any way lie in your way doubt three hundred three not but you would be ready to recommend and assist your countryman G WALMSLEY Page one hundred three Like in London AEtat twenty eight How he employed himself upon his first coming to London is not particularly known three hundred four I never heard that he found any protection or encouragement by the means of mister Colson to whose academy David Garrick went missus Lucy Porter told me that mister Walmsley gave him a letter of introduction to Lintot three hundred five his bookseller and that Johnson wrote some things for him but I imagine this to be a mistake for I have discovered no trace of it and I am pretty sure he told me that mister Cave was the first publisher by whom his pen was engaged in London He had a little money when he came to town and he knew how he could live in the cheapest manner His first lodgings were at the house of mister Norris a staymaker in Exeter street adjoining Catharine street in the Strand I dined said he very well for eight pence with very good company at the Pine Apple in New street just by Several of them had travelled They expected to meet every day but did not know one another s names It used to cost the rest a shilling for they drank wine but I had a cut of meat for six pence and bread for a penny and gave the waiter a penny so that I was quite well served nay better than the rest for they gave the waiter nothing three hundred six Page one hundred four Abstinence from wine A D seventeen thirty seven He at this time I believe abstained entirely from fermented liquors a practice to which he rigidly conformed for many years together at different periods of his life three hundred seven Page one hundred five An Irish Ofellus AEtat twenty eight His Ofellus in the Art of Living in London I have heard him relate was an Irish painter whom he knew at Birmingham and who had practised his own precepts of oeconomy for several years in the British capital three hundred eight He assured Johnson who I suppose was then meditating to try his fortune in London but was apprehensive of the expence that thirty pounds a year was enough to enable a man to live there without being contemptible He allowed ten pounds for clothes and linen He said a man might live in a garret at eighteen pence a week few people would inquire where he lodged and if they did it was easy to say Sir I am to be found at such a place By spending three pence in a coffee house he might be for some hours every day in very good company he might dine for six pence breakfast on bread and milk for a penny and do without supper On clean shirt day he went abroad and paid visits I have heard him more than once talk of this frugal friend whom he recollected with esteem and kindness and did not like to have one smile at the recital This man said he gravely was a very sensible man who perfectly understood common affairs a man of a great deal of knowledge of the world fresh from life not strained through books three hundred nine He borrowed a horse and ten pounds at Birmingham Finding himself master of so much money he set off for West Chester three hundred ten in order to get to Ireland He returned the horse and probably the ten pounds too after he got home Page one hundred six mister Henry Hervey A D seventeen thirty seven Considering Johnson s narrow circumstances in the early part of his life and particularly at the interesting aera of his launching into the ocean of London it is not to be wondered at that an actual instance proved by experience of the possibility of enjoying the intellectual luxury of social life upon a very small income should deeply engage his attention and be ever recollected by him as a circumstance of much importance He amused himself I remember by computing how much more expence was absolutely necessary to live upon the same scale with that which his friend described when the value of money was diminished by the progress of commerce It maybe estimated that double the money might now with difficulty be sufficient Amidst this cold obscurity there was one brilliant circumstance to cheer him he was well acquainted with mister Henry Hervey three hundred eleven one of the branches of the noble family of that name who had been quartered at Lichfield as an officer of the army and had at this time a house in London where Johnson was frequently entertained and had an opportunity of meeting genteel company Not very long before his death he mentioned this among other particulars of his life which he was kindly communicating to me and he described this early friend Harry Hervey thus He was a vicious man but very kind to me If you call a dog HERVEY I shall love him He told me he had now written only three acts of his Irene and that he retired for some time to lodgings at Greenwich where he proceeded in it somewhat further and used to compose walking in the Park three hundred twelve but did not stay long enough at that place to finish it At this period we find the following letter from him to mister Edward Cave which as a link in the chain of his literary history it is proper to insert Page one hundred seven Johnson returns to Lichfield AEtat twenty eight To mister CAVE Greenwich next door to the Golden Heart Church street July twelve seventeen thirty seven SIR Having observed in your papers very uncommon offers of encouragement to men of letters I have chosen being a stranger in London to communicate to you the following design which I hope if you join in it will be of advantage to both of us The History of the Council of Trent having been lately translated into French and published with large Notes by doctor Le Courayer three hundred thirteen the reputation of that book is so much revived in England that it is presumed a new translation of it from the Italian together with Le Courayer s Notes from the French could not fail of a favourable reception If it be answered that the History is already in English it must be remembered that there was the same objection against Le Courayer s undertaking with this disadvantage that the French had a version by one of their best translators whereas you cannot read three pages of the English History without discovering that the style is capable of great improvements but whether those improvements are to be expected from the attempt you must judge from the specimen which if you approve the proposal I shall submit to your examination Suppose the merit of the versions equal we may hope that the addition of the Notes will turn the balance in our favour considering the reputation of the Annotator Be pleased to favour me with a speedy answer if you are not willing to engage in this scheme and appoint me a day to wait upon you if you are I am Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON It should seem from this letter though subscribed with his own name that he had not yet been introduced to mister Cave We shall presently see what was done in consequence of the proposal which it contains Page one hundred eight Irene A D seventeen thirty seven In the course of the summer he returned to Lichfield where he had left missus Johnson and there he at last finished his tragedy which was not executed with his rapidity of composition upon other occasions but was slowly and painfully elaborated A few days before his death while burning a great mass of papers he picked out from among them the original unformed sketch of this tragedy in his own hand writing and gave it to mister Langton by whose favour a copy of it is now in my possession It contains fragments of the intended plot and speeches for the different persons of the drama partly in the raw materials of prose partly worked up into verse as also a variety of hints for illustration borrowed from the Greek Roman and modern writers The hand writing is very difficult to be read even by those who were best acquainted with Johnson s mode of penmanship which at all times was very particular The King having graciously accepted of this manuscript as a literary curiosity mister Langton made a fair and distinct copy of it which he ordered to be bound up with the original and the printed tragedy and the volume is deposited in the King s library three hundred fourteen His Majesty was pleased to permit mister Langton to take a copy of it for himself The whole of it is rich in thought and imagery and happy expressions and of the disjecta membra three hundred fifteen scattered throughout and as yet unarranged a good dramatick poet might avail himself with considerable advantage I shall give my readers some specimens of different kinds distinguishing them by the Italick character Nor think to say here will I stop Here will I fix the limits of transgression Nor farther tempt the avenging rage of heaven When guilt like this once harbours in the breast Those holy beings whose unseen direction Guides through the maze of life the steps of man Fly the detested mansions of impiety And quit their charge to horrour and to ruin A small part only of this interesting admonition is preserved in the play and is varied I think not to advantage The soul once tainted with so foul a crime No more shall glow with friendship s hallow d ardour Those holy beings whose superior care Guides erring mortals to the paths of virtue Affrighted

spreads The clouds a signal of impending showers To warn the wand ring linnet to the shade Beheld without concern expiring Greece And not one prodigy foretold our fate DEMETRIUS A thousand horrid prodigies foretold it A feeble government eluded laws A factious populace luxurious nobles And all the maladies of sinking States When publick villainy too strong for justice Shows his bold front the harbinger of ruin Can brave Leontius call for airy wonders Which cheats interpret and which fools regard When some neglected fabrick nods beneath The weight of years and totters to the tempest Must

flowing robe And add new roses to the faded cheek three hundred eighteen I shall select one other passage on account of the doctrine which it illustrates IRENE observes That the Supreme Being will accept of virtue whatever outward circumstances it may be accompanied with and may be delighted with varieties of worship but is answered that variety cannot affect that Being who infinitely happy in his own perfections wants no external gratifications nor can infinite truth be delighted with falsehood that though he may guide or pity those he leaves in darkness he abandons those who shut their eyes against the beams of day Johnson s residence at Lichfield on his return to it at this time was only for three months and as he had as yet seen but a small part of the wonders of the Metropolis he had little to tell his townsmen He related to me the following minute anecdote of this period In the last age when my mother lived in London there were two sets of people those who gave the wall and those who took it the peaceable and the quarrelsome When I returned to Lichfield after having been in London my mother asked me whether I was one of those who gave the wall or those who took it Now it is fixed that every man keeps to the right or if one is taking the wall another yields it and it is never a dispute three hundred nineteen He now removed to London with missus Johnson but her daughter who had lived with them at Edial was left with her relations in the country three hundred twenty His lodgings were for some time in Woodstock street near Hanover square and afterwards in Castle street near Cavendish square As there is something pleasingly interesting to many in tracing so great a man through all his different habitations I shall before this work is concluded present my readers with an exact list of his lodgings and houses in order of time which in placid condescension to my respectful curiosity he one evening dictated to me three hundred twenty one but without specifying how long he lived at each In the progress of his life I shall have occasion to mention some of them as connected with particular incidents or with the writing of particular parts of his works To some this minute attention may appear trifling but when we consider the punctilious exactness with which the different houses in which Milton resided have been traced by the writers of his life a similar enthusiasm may be pardoned in the biographer of Johnson Page one hundred eleven The Gentleman s Magazine AEtat twenty eight His tragedy being by this time as he thought completely finished and fit for the stage he was very desirous that it should be brought forward mister Peter Garrick told me that Johnson and he went together to the Fountain tavern and read it over and that he afterwards solicited mister Fleetwood the patentee of Drury lane theatre to have it acted at his house but mister Fleetwood would not accept it probably because it was not patronized by some man of high rank three hundred twenty two and it was not acted till seventeen forty nine when his friend David Garrick was manager of that theatre The Gentleman s Magazine begun and carried on by mister Edward Cave under the name of SYLVANUS URBAN three hundred twenty three had attracted the notice and esteem of Johnson in an eminent degree before he came to London as an adventurer in literature He told me that when he first saw saint John s Gate the place where that deservedly popular miscellany three hundred twenty four was originally printed he beheld it with reverence three hundred twenty five I suppose indeed that every young authour has had the same kind of feeling for the magazine or periodical publication which has first entertained him and in which he has first had an opportunity to see himself in print without the risk of exposing his name I myself recollect such impressions from The Scots Magazine which was begun at Edinburgh in the year seventeen thirty nine and has been ever conducted with judgement accuracy and propriety I yet cannot help thinking of it with an affectionate regard Johnson has dignified the Gentleman s Magazine by the importance with which he invests the life of Cave but he has given it still greater lustre by the various admirable Essays which he wrote for it Page one hundred twelve A list of Johnson s writings A D seventeen thirty eight Though Johnson was often solicited by his friends to make a complete list of his writings and talked of doing it I believe with a serious intention that they should all be collected on his own account he put it off from year to year and at last died without having done it perfectly I have one in his own handwriting which contains a certain number three hundred twenty six I indeed doubt if he could have remembered every one of them as they were so numerous so various and scattered in such a multiplicity of unconnected publications nay several of them published under the names of other persons

1601-136848-0018	train-other-500	that you will favour me with a letter to morrow that I may know what you can afford to allow him that he may either part with it to you or find out which I do not expect some other way more to his satisfaction I have only to add
1601-136848-0019	train-other-500	that as I am sensible I have transcribed it very coarsely which after having altered it I was obliged to do I will if you please to transmit the sheets from the press correct it for you

1601-136848-0022	train-other-500	if it can be set immediately about I will be so much the authour s friend as not to content myself with mere solicitations in his favour I propose if my calculation be near the truth
1601-136848-0023	train-other-500	to engage for the reimbursement of all that you shall lose by an impression of five hundred provided as you very generously propose that the profit if any be set aside for the authour s use excepting the present you made which
1601-136848-0024	train-other-500	if he be a gainer it is fit he should repay I beg that you will let one of your servants write an exact account of the expense of such an impression and send it with the poem that I may know what I engage for

none	none	 which as the town empties we cannot be too quick with I am Sir Your s c SAM JOHNSON Page one hundred twenty four Payment for London A D seventeen thirty eight To us who have long known the manly force bold spirit and masterly versification of this poem it is a matter of curiosity to observe the diffidence with which its authour brought it forward into publick notice 
1601-136848-0031	train-other-500	while he is so cautious as not to avow it to be his own production
none	none	 and with what humility he offers to allow the printer to alter any stroke of satire which he might dislike three hundred fifty five That any such alteration was made we do not know 
1601-136848-0032	train-other-500	If we did we could not but feel an indignant regret
none	none	 but how painful is it to see that a writer of such vigorous powers of mind was actually in such distress that the small profit which so short a poem however excellent could yield was courted as a relief It has been generally said I know not with what truth that Johnson offered his London to several booksellers none of whom would purchase it To this circumstance mister Derrick alludes in the following lines of his Fortune a Rhapsody Will no kind patron JOHNSON own Shall JOHNSON friendless range the town And every publisher refuse The offspring of his happy Muse three hundred fifty six But we have seen that the worthy modest and ingenious mister Robert Dodsley three hundred fifty seven had taste enough to perceive its uncommon merit and thought it creditable to have a share in it The fact is that at a future conference he bargained for the whole property of it for which he gave Johnson ten guineas three hundred fifty eight who told me I might perhaps have accepted of less but that Paul Whitehead had a little before got ten guineas for a poem and I would not take less than Paul Whitehead Page one hundred twenty five Paul Whitehead AEtat twenty nine I may here observe that Johnson appeared to me to undervalue Paul Whitehead upon every occasion when he was mentioned and in my opinion did not do him justice but when it is considered that Paul Whitehead was a member of a riotous and profane club three hundred fifty nine we may account for Johnson s having a prejudice against him Paul Whitehead was indeed unfortunate in being not only slighted by Johnson but violently attacked by Churchill who utters the following imprecation May I can worse disgrace on manhood fall Be born a Whitehead and baptiz d a Paul three hundred sixty yet I shall never be persuaded to think meanly of the authour of so brilliant and pointed a satire as Manners three hundred sixty one Page one hundred twenty six Was Richard Savage Thales A D seventeen thirty eight Johnson s London was published in May seventeen thirty eight three hundred sixty two and it is remarkable that it came out on the same morning with Pope s satire entitled seventeen thirty eight three hundred sixty three so that England had at once its Juvenal and Horace three hundred sixty four as poetical monitors The Reverend doctor Douglas now Bishop of Salisbury to whom I am indebted for some obliging communications was then a student at Oxford and remembers well the effect which London produced Every body was delighted with it and there being no name to it the first buz of the literary circles was here is an unknown poet greater even than Pope And it is recorded in the Gentleman s Magazine of that year three hundred sixty five that it got to the second edition in the course of a week Page one hundred twenty seven General Oglethorpe AEtat twenty nine One of the warmest patrons of this poem on its first appearance was General Oglethorpe whose strong benevolence of soul three hundred sixty six was unabated during the course of a very long life three hundred sixty seven though it is painful to think that he had but too much reason to become cold and callous and discontented with the world from the neglect which he experienced of his publick and private worth by those in whose power it was to gratify so gallant a veteran with marks of distinction This extraordinary person was as remarkable for his learning and taste as for his other eminent qualities and no man was more prompt active and generous in encouraging merit I have heard Johnson gratefully acknowledge in his presence the kind and effectual support which he gave to his London though unacquainted with its authour Page one hundred twenty eight Pope admires London A D seventeen thirty eight Pope who then filled the poetical throne without a rival it may reasonably be presumed must have been particularly struck by the sudden appearance of such a poet and to his credit let it be remembered that his feelings and conduct on the occasion were candid and liberal He requested mister Richardson son of the painter three hundred sixty eight to endeavour to find out who this new authour was mister Richardson after some inquiry having informed him that he had discovered only that his name was Johnson and that he was some obscure man Pope said he will soon be deterre three hundred sixty nine We shall presently see from a note written by Pope that he was himself afterwards more successful in his inquiries than his friend Page one hundred twenty nine Johnson a true born Englishman AEtat twenty nine That in this justly celebrated poem may be found a few rhymes three hundred seventy which the critical precision of English prosody at this day would disallow cannot be denied but with this small imperfection which in the general blaze of its excellence is not perceived till the mind has subsided into cool attention it is undoubtedly one of the noblest productions in our language both for sentiment and expression The nation was then in that ferment against the court and the ministry which some years after ended in the downfall of Sir Robert Walpole and as it has been said that Tories are Whigs when out of place and Whigs Tories when in place so as a Whig administration ruled with what force it could a Tory opposition had all the animation and all the eloquence of resistance to power aided by the common topicks of patriotism liberty and independence Accordingly we find in Johnson s London the most spirited invectives against tyranny and oppression the warmest predilection for his own country and the purest love of virtue interspersed with traits of his own particular character and situation not omitting his prejudices as a true born Englishman three hundred seventy one not only against foreign countries but against Ireland and Scotland three hundred seventy two On some of these topicks I shall quote a few passages Page one hundred thirty Passages from LONDON A D seventeen thirty eight The cheated nation s happy fav rites see Mark whom the great caress who frown on me Has heaven reserv d in pity to the poor No pathless waste or undiscover d shore No secret island in the boundless main No peaceful desert yet unclaim d by Spain Quick let us rise the happy seats explore And bear Oppression s insolence no more three hundred seventy three How when competitors like these contend Can surly Virtue hope to fix a friend This mournful truth is every where confess d SLOW RISES WORTH BY POVERTY DEPRESS D three hundred seventy four We may easily conceive with what feeling a great mind like his cramped and galled by narrow circumstances uttered this last line which he marked by capitals The whole of the poem is eminently excellent and there are in it such proofs of a knowledge of the world and of a mature acquaintance with life as cannot be contemplated without wonder when we consider that he was then only in his twenty ninth year and had yet been so little in the busy haunts of men three hundred seventy five Page one hundred thirty one Sir Robert Walpole AEtat twenty nine Yet while we admire the poetical excellence of this poem candour obliges us to allow that the flame of patriotism and zeal for popular resistance with which it is fraught had no just cause There was in truth no oppression the nation was not cheated Sir Robert Walpole was a wise and a benevolent minister who thought that the happiness and prosperity of a commercial country like ours would be best promoted by peace which he accordingly maintained with credit during a very long period Johnson himself afterwards honestly acknowledged the merit of Walpole whom he called a fixed star while he characterised his opponent Pitt as a meteor three hundred seventy six But Johnson s juvenile poem was naturally impregnated with the fire of opposition and upon every account was universally admired Page one hundred thirty two Appleby School A D seventeen thirty eight Though thus elevated into fame and conscious of uncommon powers he had not that bustling confidence or I may rather say that animated ambition which one might have supposed would have urged him to endeavour at rising in life But such was his inflexible dignity of character that he could not stoop to court the great without which hardly any man has made his way to a high station three hundred seventy seven He could not expect to produce many such works as his London and he felt the hardships of writing for bread he was therefore willing to resume the office of a schoolmaster so as to have a sure though moderate income for his life and an offer being made to him of the mastership of a school three hundred seventy eight provided he could obtain the degree of Master of Arts doctor Adams was applied to by a common friend to know whether that could be granted him as a favour from the University of Oxford But though he had made such a figure in the literary world it was then thought too great a favour to be asked Hawkins Life p sixty one says that Johnson went to Appleby in Aug seventeen thirty eight and offered himself as a candidate for the mastership The date of seventeen thirty eight seems to be Hawkins s inference If Johnson went at all it was in seventeen thirty nine Pope the friend of Swift would not of course have sought Lord Gower s influence with Swift He applied to his lordship no doubt as a great midland county landowner likely to have influence with the trustees Why when the difficulty about the degree of M A was discovered Pope was not asked to solicit Swift cannot be known See post beginning of seventeen eighty in BOSWELL S account of the Life of Swift Page one hundred thirty three Pope s letter of recommendation Pope without any knowledge of him but from his London recommended him to Earl Gower who endeavoured to procure for him a degree from Dublin by the following letter to a friend of Dean Swift SIR mister Samuel Johnson authour of London a satire and some other poetical pieces is a native of this country and much respected by some worthy gentlemen in his neighbourhood who are trustees of a charity school now vacant the certain salary is sixty pounds a year of which they are desirous to make him master but unfortunately he is not capable of receiving their bounty which would make him happy for life by not being a Master of Arts which by the statutes of this school the master of it must be Now these gentlemen do me the honour to think that I have interest enough in you to prevail upon you to write to Dean Swift to persuade the University of Dublin to send a diploma to me constituting this poor man Master of Arts in their University They highly extol the man s learning and probity and will not be persuaded that the University will make any difficulty of conferring such a favour upon a stranger if he is recommended by the Dean They say he is not afraid of the strictest examination though he is of so long a journey and will venture it if the Dean thinks it necessary choosing rather to die upon the road than be starved to death in translating for booksellers which has been his only subsistence for some time past I fear there is more difficulty in this affair than those good natured gentlemen apprehend especially as their election cannot be delayed longer than the eleventh of next month If you see this matter in the same light that it appears to me I hope you will burn this and pardon me for giving you so much trouble about an impracticable thing but if you think there is a probability of obtaining the favour asked I am sure your humanity and propensity to relieve merit in distress will incline you to serve the poor man without my adding any more to the trouble I have already given you than assuring you that I am with great truth Sir Your faithful servant GOWER Trentham Aug one seventeen thirty nine Page one hundred thirty four Johnson s wish to practise law A D seventeen thirty eight It was perhaps no small disappointment to Johnson that this respectable application had not the desired effect yet how much reason has there been both for himself and his country to rejoice that it did not succeed as he might probably have wasted in obscurity those hours in which he afterwards produced his incomparable works About this time he made one other effort to emancipate himself from the drudgery of authourship He applied to doctor Adams to consult doctor Smalbroke of the Commons whether a person might be permitted to practice as an advocate there without a doctor s degree in Civil Law I am said he a total stranger to these studies but whatever is a profession and maintains numbers must be within the reach of common abilities and some degree of industry doctor Adams was much pleased with Johnson s design to employ his talents in that manner being confident he would have attained to great eminence And indeed I cannot conceive a man better qualified to make a distinguished figure as a lawyer for he would have brought to his profession a rich store of various knowledge an uncommon acuteness and a command of language in which few could have equalled and none have surpassed him three hundred seventy nine He who could display eloquence and wit in defence of the decision of the House of Commons upon mister Wilkes s election for Middlesex three hundred eighty and of the unconstitutional taxation of our fellow subjects in America three hundred eighty one must have been a powerful advocate in any cause But here also the want of a degree was an insurmountable bar Page one hundred thirty five Paul Sarpi s History AEtat twenty nine He was therefore under the necessity of persevering in that course into which he had been forced and we find that his proposal from Greenwich to mister Cave for a translation of Father Paul Sarpi s History was accepted three hundred eighty two Some sheets of this translation were printed off but the design was dropt for it happened oddly enough that another person of the name of Samuel Johnson Librarian of saint Martin s in the Fields and Curate of that parish engaged in the same undertaking and was patronised by the Clergy particularly by doctor Pearce afterwards Bishop of Rochester Several light skirmishes passed between the rival translators in the newspapers of the day and the consequence was that they destroyed each other for neither of them went on with the work It is much to be regretted that the able performance of that celebrated genius FRA PAOLO lost the advantage of being incorporated into British literature by the masterly hand of Johnson Page one hundred thirty six mister Cave s insinuation A D seventeen thirty eight I have in my possession by the favour of mister John Nichols a paper in Johnson s hand writing entitled Account between mister Edward Cave and Sam Johnson in relation to a version of Father Paul c begun August the twod seventeen thirty eight by which it appears that from that day to the twenty first of April seventeen thirty nine Johnson received for this work Lforty nine seven s in sums of one two three and sometimes four guineas at a time most frequently two And it is curious to observe the minute and scrupulous accuracy with which Johnson has pasted upon it a slip of paper which he has entitled Small Account and which contains one article Sept ninth mister Cave laid down twos sixd There is subjoined to this account a list of some subscribers to the work partly in Johnson s handwriting partly in that of another person and there follows a leaf or two on which are written a number of characters which have the appearance of a short hand which perhaps Johnson was then trying to learn To mister CAVE Wednesday SIR I did not care to detain your servant while I wrote an answer to your letter in which you seem to insinuate that I had promised more than I am ready to perform If I have raised your expectations by any thing that may have escaped my memory I am sorry and if you remind me of it shall thank you for the favour If I made fewer alterations than usual in the Debates it was only because there appeared and still appears to be less need of alteration The verses to Lady Firebrace three hundred eighty three may be had when you please for you know that such a subject neither deserves much thought nor requires it The Chinese Stories three hundred eighty four may be had folded down when you please to send in which I do not recollect that you desired any alterations to be made An answer to another query I am very willing to write and had consulted with you about it last night if there had been time for I think it the most proper way of inviting such a correspondence as may be an advantage to the paper not a load upon it As to the Prize Verses a backwardness to determine their degrees of merit is not peculiar to me You may if you please still have what I can say but I shall engage with little spirit in an affair which I shall hardly end to my own satisfaction and certainly not to the satisfaction of the parties concerned three hundred eighty five As to Father Paul I have not yet been just to my proposal but have met with impediments which I hope are now at an end and if you find the progress hereafter not such as you have a right to expect you can easily stimulate a negligent translator If any or all of these have contributed to your discontent I will endeavour to remove it and desire you to propose the question to which you wish for an answer I am Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON Page one hundred thirty seven Impransus AEtat twenty nine To mister CAVE No date SIR I am pretty much of your opinion that the Commentary cannot be prosecuted with any appearance of success for as the names of the authours concerned are of more weight in the performance than its own intrinsick merit the publick will be soon satisfied with it And I think the Examen should be pushed forward with the utmost expedition Thus This day c An Examen of mister Pope s Essay c containing a succinct Account of the Philosophy of mister Leibnitz on the System of the Fatalists with a Confutation of their Opinions and an Illustration of the Doctrine of Free will with what else you think proper It will above all be necessary to take notice that it is a thing distinct from the Commentary I was so far from imagining they stood still three hundred eighty six that I conceived them to have a good deal before hand and therefore was less anxious in providing them more But if ever they stand still on my account it must doubtless be charged to me and whatever else shall be reasonable I shall not oppose but beg a suspense of judgment till morning when I must entreat you to send me a dozen proposals and you shall then have copy to spare I am Sir Your s impransus three hundred eighty seven SAM JOHNSON Pray muster up the Proposals if you can or let the boy recall them from the booksellers Page one hundred thirty eight mister Macbean A D seventeen thirty eight But although he corresponded with mister Cave concerning a translation of Crousaz s Examen of Pope s Essay on Man and gave advice as one anxious for its success I was long ago convinced by a perusal of the Preface that this translation was erroneously ascribed to him and I have found this point ascertained beyond all doubt by the following article in doctor Birch s Manuscripts in the British Museum ELISAE CARTERAE S P D THOMAS BIRCH Versionem tuam Examinis Crousasiani jam perlegi Summam styli et elegantiam et in re difficillima proprietatem admiratus Dabam Novemb twenty seven deg seventeen thirty eight three hundred eighty eight Indeed missus Carter has lately acknowledged to mister Seward that she was the translator of the Examen It is remarkable that Johnson s last quoted letter to mister Cave concludes with a fair confession that he had not a dinner and it is no less remarkable that though in this state of want himself his benevolent heart was not insensible to the necessities of an humble labourer in literature as appears from the very next letter To mister CAVE No date DEAR SIR You may remember I have formerly talked with you about a Military Dictionary The eldest mister Macbean three hundred eighty nine who was with mister Chambers three hundred ninety has very good materials for such a work which I have seen and will do it at a very low rate three hundred ninety one I think the terms of War and Navigation might be comprised with good explanations in one eightvo Pica which he is willing to do for twelve shillings a sheet to be made up a guinea at the second impression If you think on it I will wait on you with him I am Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON Pray lend me Topsel on Animals three hundred ninety two Page one hundred thirty nine Boethius De Consolatione AEtat twenty nine I must not omit to mention that this mister Macbean was a native of Scotland In the Gentleman s Magazine of this year Johnson gave a Life of Father Paul and he wrote the Preface to the Volume three hundred ninety three dagger which though prefixed to it when bound is always published with the Appendix and is therefore the last composition belonging to it The ability and nice adaptation with which he could draw up a prefatory address was one of his peculiar excellencies It appears too that he paid a friendly attention to missus Elizabeth Carter for in a letter from mister Cave to doctor Birch November twenty eight this year I find mister Johnson advises Miss C to undertake a translation of Boethius de Cons because there is prose and verse and to put her name to it when published This advice was not followed probably from an apprehension that the work was not sufficiently popular for an extensive sale How well Johnson himself could have executed a translation of this philosophical poet we may judge from the following specimen which he has given in the Rambler Motto to No seven O qui perpetua mundum ratione gubernas Terrarum caelique sator Disjice terrenae nebulas et pondera molis Atque tuo splendore mica Tu namque serenum Tu requies tranquilla piis Te cernere finis Principium vector dux semita terminus idem O thou whose power o er moving worlds presides Whose voice created and whose wisdom guides On darkling man in pure effulgence shine And cheer the clouded mind with light divine Tis thine alone to calm the pious breast With silent confidence and holy rest From thee great God we spring to thee we tend Path motive guide original and end Page one hundred forty Abridgments A D seventeen thirty nine Page one hundred forty one Marmor Norfolciensc AEtat thirty In seventeen thirty nine beside the assistance which he gave to the Parliamentary Debates his writings in the Gentleman s Magazine three hundred ninety four were The Life of Boerhaave in which it is to be observed that he discovers that love of chymistry three hundred ninety five which never forsook him An Appeal to the publick in behalf of the Editor dagger An Address to the Reader dagger An Epigram both in Greek and Latin to Eliza three hundred ninety six and also English verses to her three hundred ninety seven and A Greek Epigram to doctor Birch three hundred ninety eight It has been erroneously supposed that an Essay published in that Magazine this year entitled The Apotheosis of Milton was written by Johnson and on that supposition it has been improperly inserted in the edition of his works by the Booksellers after his decease Were there no positive testimony as to this point the style of the performance and the name of Shakspeare not being mentioned in an Essay professedly reviewing the principal English poets would ascertain it not to be the production of Johnson But there is here no occasion to resort to internal evidence for my Lord Bishop of Salisbury doctor Douglas has assured me that it was written by Guthrie His separate publications were three hundred ninety nine A Complete Vindication of the Licensers of the Stage from the malicious and scandalous Aspersions of mister Brooke Authour of Gustavus Vasa being an ironical Attack upon them for their Suppression of that Tragedy four hundred and Marmor Norfolciense or an Essay on an ancient prophetical Inscription in monkish Rhyme lately discovered near Lynne in Norfolk by PROBUS BRITANNICUS In this performance he in a feigned inscription supposed to have been found in Norfolk the county of Sir Robert Walpole then the obnoxious prime minister of this country inveighs against the Brunswick succession and the measures of government consequent upon it four hundred one To this supposed prophecy he added a Commentary making each expression apply to the times with warm Anti Hanoverian zeal This anonymous pamphlet I believe did not make so much noise as was expected and therefore had not a very extensive circulation four hundred two Sir John Hawkins relates four hundred three that warrants were issued and messengers employed to apprehend the authour who though he had forborne to subscribe his name to the pamphlet the vigilance of those in pursuit of him had discovered and we are informed that he lay concealed in Lambeth marsh till the scent after him grew cold This however is altogether without foundation for mister Steele one of the Secretaries of the Treasury who amidst a variety of important business politely obliged me with his attention to my inquiry informed me that he directed every possible search to be made in the records of the Treasury and Secretary of State s Office but could find no trace whatever of any warrant having been issued to apprehend the authour of this pamphlet Page one hundred forty two Reprint of Marmor Norfolciensc A D seventeen thirty nine Marmor Norfolciense became exceedingly scarce so that I for many years endeavoured in vain to procure a copy of it At last I was indebted to the malice of one of Johnson s numerous petty adversaries who in seventeen seventy five published a new edition of it with Notes and a Dedication to SAMUEL JOHNSON LL D by TRIBUNUS in which some puny scribbler invidiously attempted to found upon it a charge of inconsistency against its authour because he had accepted of a pension from his present Majesty and had written in support of the measures of government As a mortification to such impotent malice of which there are so many instances towards men of eminence I am happy to relate that this telum imbelle four hundred four did not reach its exalted object till about a year after it thus appeared when I mentioned it to him supposing that he knew of the re publication To my surprize he had not yet heard of it He requested me to go directly and get it for him which I did He looked at it and laughed and seemed to be much diverted with the feeble efforts of his unknown adversary who I hope is alive to read this account Now said he here is somebody who thinks he has vexed me sadly yet if it had not been for you you rogue I should probably never have seen it Page one hundred forty three Paper sparing Pope AEtat thirty As mister Pope s note concerning Johnson alluded to in a former page refers both to his London and his Marmor Norfolciense I have deferred inserting it till now I am indebted for it to doctor Percy the Bishop of Dromore who permitted me to copy it from the original in his possession It was presented to his Lordship by Sir Joshua Reynolds to whom it was given by the son of mister Richardson the painter the person to whom it is addressed I have transcribed it with minute exactness that the peculiar mode of writing and imperfect spelling of that celebrated poet may be exhibited to the curious in literature It justifies Swift s epithet of paper sparing Pope four hundred five for it is written on a slip no larger than a common message card and was sent to mister Richardson along with the Imitation of Juvenal This is imitated by one Johnson who put in for a Publick school in Shropshire four hundred six but was disappointed He has an infirmity of the convulsive kind that attacks him sometimes so as to make him a sad Spectacle mister P from the Merit of this Work which was all the knowledge he had of him endeavour d to serve him without his own application wrote to my Ld gore but he did not succeed mister Johnson published afterwds another Poem in Latin with Notes the whole very Humerous call d the Norfolk Prophecy four hundred seven P Johnson had been told of this note and Sir Joshua Reynolds informed him of the compliment which it contained but from delicacy avoided shewing him the paper itself When Sir Joshua observed to Johnson that he seemed very desirous to see Pope s note he answered Who would not be proud to have such a man as Pope so solicitous in inquiring about him Page one hundred forty four Johnson s tricks of body A D seventeen thirty nine The infirmity to which mister Pope alludes appeared to me also as I have elsewhere four hundred eight observed to be of the convulsive kind and of the nature of that distemper called saint Vitus s dance and in this opinion I am confirmed by the description which Sydenham gives of that disease This disorder is a kind of convulsion It manifests itself by halting or unsteadiness of one of the legs which the patient draws after him like an ideot If the hand of the same side be applied to the breast or any other part of the body he cannot keep it a moment in the same posture but it will be drawn into a different one by a convulsion notwithstanding all his efforts to the contrary Sir Joshua Reynolds however was of a different opinion and favoured me with the following paper Page one hundred forty five His dread of solitude AEtat thirty Those motions or tricks of doctor Johnson are improper y called convulsions four hundred nine He could sit motionless when he was told so to do as well as any other man my opinion is that it proceeded from a habit which he had indulged himself in of accompanying his thoughts with certain untoward actions and those actions always appeared to me as if they were meant to reprobate some part of his past conduct Whenever he was not engaged in conversation such thoughts were sure to rush into his mind and for this reason any company any employment whatever he preferred to being alone four hundred ten The great business of his life he said was to escape from himself this disposition he considered as the disease of his mind which nothing cured but company One instance of his absence and particularity as it is characteristick of the man may be worth relating When he and I took a journey together into the West we visited the late mister Banks of Dorsetshire the conversation turning upon pictures which Johnson could not well see he retired to a corner of the room stretching out his right leg as far as he could reach before him then bringing up his left leg and stretching his right still further on The old gentleman observing him went up to him and in a very courteous manner assured him that though it was not a new house the flooring was perfectly safe The Doctor started from his reverie like a person waked out of his sleep but spoke not a word While we are on this subject my readers may not be displeased with another anecdote communicated to me by the same friend from the relation of mister Hogarth Page one hundred forty six Hogarth meets Johnson A D seventeen thirty nine Page one hundred forty seven George the Second s cruelty AEtat thirty Johnson used to be a pretty frequent visitor at the house of mister Richardson authour of Clarissa and other novels of extensive reputation mister Hogarth came one day to see Richardson soon after the execution of doctor Cameron for having taken arms for the house of Stuart in seventeen forty five six and being a warm partisan of George the Second he observed to Richardson four hundred eleven that certainly there must have been some very unfavourable circumstances lately discovered in this particular case which had induced the King to approve of an execution for rebellion so long after the time when it was committed as this had the appearance of putting a man to death in cold blood four hundred twelve and was very unlike his Majesty s usual clemency While he was talking he perceived a person standing at a window in the room shaking his head and rolling himself about in a strange ridiculous manner He concluded that he was an ideot whom his relations had put under the care of mister Richardson as a very good man To his great surprize however this figure stalked forwards to where he and mister Richardson were sitting and all at once took up the argument and burst out into an invective against George the Second as one who upon all occasions was unrelenting and barbarous four hundred thirteen mentioning many instances particularly that when an officer of high rank had been acquitted by a Court Martial George the Second had with his own hand struck his name off the list In short he displayed such a power of eloquence that Hogarth looked at him with astonishment and actually imagined that this ideot had been at the moment inspired Neither Hogarth nor Johnson were made known to each other at this interview four hundred fourteen seventeen forty four hundred fifteen AETAT thirty one In seventeen forty he wrote for the Gentleman s Magazine the Preface four hundred sixteen dagger Life of Sir Francis Drake and the first parts of those of Admiral Blake four hundred seventeen and of Philip Baretier four hundred eighteen both which he finished the following year He also wrote an Essay on Epitaphs four hundred nineteen and an Epitaph on Philips a Musician four hundred twenty which was afterwards published with some other pieces of his in missus Williams s Miscellanies This Epitaph is so exquisitely beautiful that I remember even Lord Kames strangely prejudiced as he was against doctor Johnson was compelled to allow it very high praise It has been ascribed to mister Garrick from its appearing at first with the signature G but I have heard mister Garrick declare that it was written by doctor Johnson and give the following account of the manner in which it was composed Johnson and he were sitting together when amongst other things Garrick repeated an Epitaph upon this Philips by a doctor Wilkes in these words Page one hundred forty eight Epitaph on Philips A D seventeen forty Exalted soul whose harmony could please The love sick virgin and the gouty ease Could jarring discord like Amphion move To beauteous order and harmonious love Rest here in peace till angels bid thee rise And meet thy blessed Saviour in the skies Johnson shook his head at these common place funereal lines and said to Garrick I think Davy I can make a better Then stirring about his tea for a little while in a state of meditation he almost extempore produced the following verses Page one hundred forty nine Epigram on Cibber AEtat thirty one Philips whose touch harmonious could remove The pangs of guilty power or four hundred twenty one hapless love Rest here distress d by poverty no more Here find that calm thou gav saint so oft before Sleep undisturb d within this peaceful shrine Till angels wake thee with a note like thine four hundred twenty two At the same time that mister Garrick favoured me with this anecdote he repeated a very pointed Epigram by Johnson on George the Second and Colley Cibber which has never yet appeared and of which I know not the exact date four hundred twenty three doctor Johnson afterwards gave it to me himself four hundred twenty four Augustus still survives in Maro s strain And Spenser s verse prolongs Eliza s reign Great George s acts let tuneful Cibber sing For Nature form d the Poet for the King Page one hundred fifty One of Cromwell s speeches A D seventeen forty one In seventeen forty one four hundred twenty five he wrote for the Gentleman s Magazine the Preface Conclusion of his lives of Drake and Baretier dagger A free translation of the Jests of Hierocles four hundred twenty six with an Introduction dagger and I think the following pieces Debate on the Proposal of Parliament to Cromwell to assume the Title of King abridged modified and digested four hundred twenty seven dagger Translation of Abbe Guyon s Dissertation on the Amazons dagger Translation of Fontenelle s Panegyrick on doctor Morin dagger Two notes upon this appear to me undoubtedly his He this year and the two following wrote the Parliamentary Debates He told me himself that he was the sole composer of them for those three years only He was not however precisely exact in his statement which he mentioned from hasty recollection for it is sufficiently evident that his composition of them began November nineteen seventeen forty and ended February twenty three seventeen forty two three four hundred twenty eight It appears from some of Cave s letters to doctor Birch that Cave had better assistance for that branch of his Magazine than has been generally supposed and that he was indefatigable in getting it made as perfect as he could Page one hundred fifty one Cave s Parliamentary Debates AEtat thirty two Thus twenty first July seventeen thirty five I trouble you with the inclosed because you said you could easily correct what is here given for Lord C ld s four hundred twenty nine speech I beg you will do so as soon as you can for me because the month is far advanced And fifteenth July seventeen thirty seven As you remember the debates so far as to perceive the speeches already printed are not exact I beg the favour that you will peruse the inclosed and in the best manner your memory will serve correct the mistaken passages or add any thing that is omitted I should be very glad to have something of the Duke of N le s four hundred thirty speech which would be particularly of service A gentleman has Lord Bathurst s speech to add something to And July three seventeen forty four You will see what stupid low abominable stuff is put four hundred thirty one upon your noble and learned friend s four hundred thirty two character such as I should quite reject and endeavour to do something better towards doing justice to the character But as I cannot expect to attain my desires in that respect it would be a great satisfaction as well as an honour to our work to have the favour of the genuine speech It is a method that several have been pleased to take as I could show but I think myself under a restraint I shall say so far that I have had some by a third hand which I understood well enough to come from the first others by penny post four hundred thirty three and others by the speakers themselves who have been pleased to visit saint John s Gate and show particular marks of their being pleased four hundred thirty four Page one hundred fifty two Johnson s Parliamentary Debates A D seventeen forty one There is no reason I believe to doubt the veracity of Cave It is however remarkable that none of these letters are in the years during which Johnson alone furnished the Debates and one of them is in the very year after he ceased from that labour Johnson told me that as soon as he found that the speeches were thought genuine he determined that he would write no more of them for he would not be accessary to the propagation of falsehood And such was the tenderness of his conscience that a short time before his death he expressed his regret for his having been the authour of fictions which had passed for realities four hundred thirty five He nevertheless agreed with me in thinking that the debates which he had framed were to be valued as orations upon questions of publick importance They have accordingly been collected in volumes properly arranged and recommended to the notice of parliamentary speakers by a preface written by no inferior hand four hundred thirty six I must however observe that although there is in those debates a wonderful store of political information and very powerful eloquence I cannot agree that they exhibit the manner of each particular speaker as Sir John Hawkins seems to think But indeed what opinion can we have of his judgement and taste in publick speaking who presumes to give as the characteristicks of two celebrated orators the deep mouthed rancour of Pulteney four hundred thirty seven and the yelping pertinacity of Pitt four hundred thirty eight This year I find that his tragedy of Irene had been for some time ready for the stage and that his necessities made him desirous of getting as much as he could for it without delay for there is the following letter from mister Cave to doctor Birch in the same volume of manuscripts in the British Museum from which I copied those above quoted They were most obligingly pointed out to me by Sir William Musgrave one of the Curators of that noble repository Page one hundred fifty three Bibliotheca Harleiana AEtat thirty two Sept nine seventeen forty one I have put mister Johnson s play into mister Gray s four hundred thirty nine hands in order to sell it to him if he is inclined to buy it but I doubt whether he will or not He would dispose of the copy and whatever advantage may be made by acting it Would your society four hundred forty or any gentleman or body of men that you know take such a bargain He and I are very unfit to deal with theatrical persons Fleetwood was to have acted it last season but Johnson s diffidence or four hundred forty one prevented it I have already mentioned that Irene was not brought into publick notice till Garrick was manager of Drury lane theatre Page one hundred fifty four Osborne the bookseller A D seventeen forty two seventeen forty two AETAT thirty three In seventeen forty two four hundred forty two he wrote for the Gentleman s Magazine the Preface dagger the Parliamentary Debates Essay on the Account of the conduct of the Duchess of Marlborough then the popular topick of conversation This Essay is a short but masterly performance We find him in No thirteen of his Rambler censuring a profligate sentiment in that Account four hundred forty three and again insisting upon it strenuously in conversation four hundred forty four An account of the Life of Peter Burman I believe chiefly taken from a foreign publication as indeed he could not himself know much about Burman Additions to his Life of Baretier The Life of Sydenham afterwards prefixed to doctor Swan s edition of his works Proposals for Printing Bibliotheca Harleiana or a Catalogue of the Library of the Earl of Oxford four hundred forty five His account of that celebrated collection of books in which he displays the importance to literature of what the French call a catalogue raisonne when the subjects of it are extensive and various and it is executed with ability cannot fail to impress all his readers with admiration of his philological attainments It was afterwards prefixed to the first volume of the Catalogue in which the Latin accounts of books were written by him He was employed in this business by mister Thomas Osborne the bookseller who purchased the library for thirteen thousandL a sum which mister Oldys four hundred forty six says in one of his manuscripts was not more than the binding of the books had cost yet as doctor Johnson assured me the slowness of the sale was such that there was not much gained by it It has been confidently related with many embellishments that Johnson one day knocked Osborne down in his shop with a folio and put his foot upon his neck The simple truth I had from Johnson himself Sir he was impertinent to me and I beat him But it was not in his shop it was in my own chamber four hundred forty seven Page one hundred fifty five A projected parliamentary history AEtat thirty three A very diligent observer may trace him where we should not easily suppose him to be found I have no doubt that he wrote the little abridgement entitled Foreign History in the Magazine for December To prove it I shall quote the Introduction As this is that season of the year in which Nature may be said to command a suspension of hostilities and which seems intended by putting a short stop to violence and slaughter to afford time for malice to relent and animosity to subside we can scarce expect any other accounts than of plans negotiations and treaties of proposals for peace and preparations for war As also this passage Let those who despise the capacity of the Swiss tell us by what wonderful policy or by what happy conciliation of interests it is brought to pass that in a body made up of different communities and different religions there should be no civil commotions four hundred forty eight though the people are so warlike that to nominate and raise an army is the same I am obliged to mister Astle four hundred forty nine for his ready permission to copy the two following letters of which the originals are in his possession Their contents shew that they were written about this time and that Johnson was now engaged in preparing an historical account of the British Parliament To mister CAVE No date Sir I believe I am going to write a long letter and have therefore taken a whole sheet of paper The first thing to be written about is our historical design You mentioned the proposal of printing in numbers as an alteration in the scheme but I believe you mistook some way or other my meaning I had no other view than that you might rather print too many of five sheets than of five and thirty With regard to what I shall say on the manner of proceeding I would have it understood as wholly indifferent to me and my opinion only not my resolution Emptoris sit eligere I think the insertion of the exact dates of the most important events in the margin or of so many events as may enable the reader to regulate the order of facts with sufficient exactness the proper medium between a journal which has regard only to time and a history which ranges facts according to their dependence on each other and postpones or anticipates according to the convenience of narration I think the work ought to partake of the spirit of history which is contrary to minute exactness and of the regularity of a journal which is inconsistent with spirit For this reason I neither admit numbers or dates nor reject them Page one hundred fifty six Payment for work A D seventeen forty two I am of your opinion with regard to placing most of the resolutions c in the margin and think we shall give the most complete account of Parliamentary proceedings that can be contrived The naked papers without an historical treatise interwoven require some other book to make them understood I will date the succeeding facts with some exactness but I think in the margin You told me on Saturday that I had received money on this work and found set down thirteenL twos sixd reckoning the half guinea of last Saturday As you hinted to me that you had many calls for money I would not press you too hard and therefore shall desire only as I send it in two guineas for a sheet of copy the rest you may pay me when it may be more convenient and even by this sheet payment I shall for some time be very expensive The Life of Savage four hundred fifty I am ready to go upon and in Great Primer and Pica notes I reckon on sending in half a sheet a day but the money for that shall likewise lye by in your hands till it is done With the debates shall not I have business enough if I had but good pens Towards mister Savage s Life what more have you got I would willingly have his trial c and know whether his defence be at Bristol and would have his collection of poems on account of the Preface The Plain Dealer four hundred fifty one all the magazines that have anything of his or relating to him I thought my letter would be long but it is now ended and I am Sir Yours c SAM JOHNSON The boy found me writing this almost in the dark when I could not quite easily read yours I have read the Italian nothing in it is well I had no notion of having any thing for the Inscription four hundred fifty two I hope you don t think I kept it to extort a price I could think of nothing till to day If you could spare me another guinea for the history I should take it very kindly to night but if you do not I shall not think it an injury I am almost well again To mister CAVE SIR You did not tell me your determination about the Soldier s Letter four hundred fifty three which I am confident was never printed I think it will not do by itself or in any other place so well as the Mag Extraordinary four hundred fifty four If you will have it at all I believe you do not think I set it high and I will be glad if what you give you will give quickly Page one hundred fifty seven Ad Lauram pariluram Epigramma AEtat thirty three You need not be in care about something to print for I have got the State Trials and shall extract Layer Atterbury and Macclesfield from them and shall bring them to you in a fortnight after which I will try to get the South Sea Report No date nor signature I would also ascribe to him an Essay on the Description of China from the French of Du Halde four hundred fifty five dagger His writings in the Gentleman s Magazine in seventeen forty three are the Preface four hundred fifty six dagger the Parliamentary Debates dagger Considerations on the Dispute between Crousaz four hundred fifty seven and Warburton on Pope s Essay on Man dagger in which while he defends Crousaz he shews an admirable metaphysical acuteness and temperance in controversy four hundred fifty eight Ad Lauram parituram Epigramma four hundred fifty nine and A Latin Translation of Pope s Verses on his Grotto four hundred sixty and as he could employ his pen with equal success upon a small matter as a great I suppose him to be the authour of an advertisement for Osborne concerning the great Harlcian Catalogue four hundred sixty one Page one hundred fifty eight Friendship an Ode A D seventeen forty three But I should think myself much wanting both to my illustrious friend and my readers did I not introduce here with more than ordinary respect an exquisitely beautiful Ode which has not been inserted in any of the collections of Johnson s poetry written by him at a very early period as mister Hector informs me and inserted in the Gentleman s Magazine of this year FRIENDSHIP an ODE Friendship peculiar boon of heav n The noble mind s delight

Mead AEtat thirty four Johnson had now an opportunity of obliging his schoolfellow doctor James of whom he once observed no man brings more mind to his profession four hundred sixty two James published this year his Medicinal Dictionary in three volumes folio Johnson as I understood from him had written or assisted in writing the proposals for this work and being very fond of the study of physick in which James was his master he furnished some of the articles four hundred sixty three He however certainly wrote for it the Dedication to doctor Mead dagger which is conceived with great address to conciliate the patronage of that very eminent man four hundred sixty four Page one hundred sixty doctor Birch A D seventeen forty three It has been circulated I know not with what authenticity that Johnson considered doctor Birch as a dull writer and said of him Tom Birch is as brisk as a bee in conversation but no sooner does he take a pen in his hand than it becomes a torpedo to him and benumbs all his faculties four hundred sixty five That the literature of this country is much indebted to Birch s activity and diligence must certainly be acknowledged We have seen that Johnson honoured him with a Greek Epigram four hundred sixty six and his correspondence with him during many years proves that he had no mean opinion of him To doctor BIRCH Thursday Sept twenty nine seventeen forty three SIR I hope you will excuse me for troubling you on an occasion on which I know not whom else I can apply to I am at a loss for the Lives and Characters of Earl Stanhope the two Craggs and the minister Sunderland and beg that you will inform me where I may find them and send any pamphlets c relating to them to mister Cave to be perused for a few days by Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON His circumstances were at this time much embarrassed yet his affection for his mother was so warm and so liberal that he took upon himself a debt of her s which though small in itself was then considerable to him This appears from the following letter which he wrote to mister Levett of Lichfield the original of which lies now before me To mister LEVETT IN LICHFIELD December one seventeen forty three SIR I am extremely sorry that we have encroached so much upon your forbearance with respect to the interest which a great perplexity of affairs hindered me from thinking of with that attention that I ought and which I am not immediately able to remit to you but will pay it I think twelve pounds in two months I look upon this and on the future interest of that mortgage as my own debt and beg that you will be pleased to give me directions how to pay it and not mention it to my dear mother If it be necessary to pay this in less time I believe I can do it but I take two months for certainty and beg an answer whether you can allow me so much time I think myself very much obliged to your forbearance and shall esteem it a great happiness to be able to serve you I have great opportunities of dispersing any thing that you may think it proper to make publick four hundred sixty seven I will give a note for the money payable at the time mentioned to any one here that you shall appoint I am Sir Your most obedient And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON At mister Osborne s bookseller in Gray s Inn Page one hundred sixty one The Life of Savage AEtat thirty five Page one hundred sixty two Johnson s friendship with Savage A D seventeen forty four seventeen forty four AETAT thirty five It does not appear that he wrote any thing in seventeen forty four for the Gentleman s Magazine but the Preface Dagger His Life of Baretier was now re published in a pamphlet by itself But he produced one work this year fully sufficient to maintain the high reputation which he had acquired This was The Life of Richard Savage a man of whom it is difficult to speak impartially without wondering that he was for some time the intimate companion of Johnson four hundred sixty eight for his character was marked by profligacy insolence and ingratitude four hundred sixty nine yet as he undoubtedly had a warm and vigorous though unregulated mind had seen life in all its varieties and been much in the company of the statesmen and wits of his time four hundred seventy he could communicate to Johnson an abundant supply of such materials as his philosophical curiosity most eagerly desired and as Savage s misfortunes and misconduct had reduced him to the lowest state of wretchedness as a writer for bread four hundred seventy one his visits to saint John s Gate naturally brought Johnson and him together four hundred seventy two Page one hundred sixty three Dining behind the screen AEtat thirty five It is melancholy to reflect that Johnson and Savage were sometimes in such extreme indigence four hundred seventy three that they could not pay for a lodging so that they have wandered together whole nights in the streets four hundred seventy four Yet in these almost incredible scenes of distress we may suppose that Savage mentioned many of the anecdotes with which Johnson afterwards enriched the life of his unhappy companion and those of other Poets Page one hundred sixty four Johnson in want of a lodging A D seventeen forty four He told Sir Joshua Reynolds that one night in particular when Savage and he walked round saint James s square for want of a lodging they were not at all depressed by their situation but in high spirits and brimful of patriotism traversed the square for several hours inveighed against the minister and resolved they would stand by their country four hundred seventy five I am afraid however that by associating with Savage who was habituated to the dissipation and licentiousness of the town Johnson though his good principles remained steady did not entirely preserve that conduct for which in days of greater simplicity he was remarked by his friend mister Hector but was imperceptibly led into some indulgencies which occasioned much distress to his virtuous mind four hundred seventy six That Johnson was anxious that an authentick and favourable account of his extraordinary friend should first get possession of the publick attention is evident from a letter which he wrote in the Gentleman s Magazine for August of the year preceding its publication mister URBAN As your collections show how often you have owed the ornaments of your poetical pages to the correspondence of the unfortunate and ingenious mister Savage I doubt not but you have so much regard to his memory as to encourage any design that may have a tendency to the preservation of it from insults or calumnies and therefore with some degree of assurance intreat you to inform the publick that his life will speedily be published by a person who was favoured with his confidence and received from himself an account of most of the transactions which he proposes to mention to the time of his retirement to Swansea in Wales From that period to his death in the prison of Bristol the account will be continued from materials still less liable to objection his own letters and those of his friends some of which will be inserted in the work and abstracts of others subjoined in the margin It may be reasonably imagined that others may have the same design but as it is not credible that they can obtain the same materials it must be expected they will supply from invention the want of intelligence and that under the title of The Life of Savage they will publish only a novel filled with romantick adventures and imaginary amours You may therefore perhaps gratify the lovers of truth and wit by giving me leave to inform them in your Magazine that my account will be published in eightvo by mister Roberts in Warwick lane four hundred seventy seven No signature Page one hundred sixty five Reynolds reads THE LIFE OF SAVAGE AEtat thirty five In February seventeen forty four it accordingly came forth from the shop of Roberts between whom and Johnson I have not traced any connection except the casual one of this publication four hundred seventy eight In Johnson s Life of Savage although it must be allowed that its moral is the reverse of Respicere exemplar vita morumque jubebo four hundred seventy nine a very useful lesson is inculcated to guard men of warm passions from a too free indulgence of them and the various incidents are related in so clear and animated a manner and illuminated throughout with so much philosophy that it is one of the most interesting narratives in the English language Sir Joshua Reynolds told me that upon his return from Italy four hundred eighty he met with it in Devonshire knowing nothing of its authour and began to read it while he was standing with his arm leaning against a chimney piece It seized his attention so strongly that not being able to lay down the book till he had finished it when he attempted to move he found his arm totally benumbed The rapidity with which this work was composed is a wonderful circumstance Johnson has been heard to say I wrote forty eight of the printed octavo pages of the Life of Savage at a sitting but then I sat up all night four hundred eighty one Page one hundred sixty six Resemblance of Johnson to Savage A D seventeen forty four He exhibits the genius of Savage to the best advantage in the specimens of his poetry which he has selected some of which are of uncommon merit We indeed occasionally find such vigour and such point as might make us suppose that the generous aid of Johnson had been imparted to his friend mister Thomas Warton made this remark to me and in support of it quoted from the poem entitled The Bastard a line in which the fancied superiority of one stamped in Nature s mint with extasy four hundred eighty two is contrasted with a regular lawful descendant of some great and ancient family No tenth transmitter of a foolish face four hundred eighty three But the fact is that this poem was published some years before Johnson and Savage were acquainted four hundred eighty four Page one hundred sixty seven Johnson s prejudice against players AEtat thirty five It is remarkable that in this biographical disquisition there appears a very strong symptom of Johnson s prejudice against players four hundred eighty five a prejudice which may be attributed to the following causes first the imperfection of his organs which were so defective that he was not susceptible of the fine impressions which theatrical excellence produces upon the generality of mankind secondly the cold rejection of his tragedy and lastly the brilliant success of Garrick who had been his pupil who had come to London at the same time with him not in a much more prosperous state than himself and whose talents he undoubtedly rated low compared with his own His being outstripped by his pupil in the race of immediate fame as well as of fortune probably made him feel some indignation as thinking that whatever might be Garrick s merits in his art the reward was too great when compared with what the most successful efforts of literary labour could attain At all periods of his life Johnson used to talk contemptuously of players four hundred eighty six but in this work he speaks of them with peculiar acrimony for which perhaps there was formerly too much reason from the licentious and dissolute manners of those engaged in that profession four hundred eighty seven It is but justice to add that in our own time such a change has taken place that there is no longer room for such an unfavourable distinction four hundred eighty eight Page one hundred sixty eight Garrick s mistakes in emphasis A D seventeen forty four His schoolfellow and friend doctor Taylor told me a pleasant anecdote of Johnson s triumphing over his pupil David Garrick When that great actor had played some little time at Goodman s fields Johnson and Taylor went to see him perform and afterwards passed the evening at a tavern with him and old Giffard four hundred eighty nine Johnson who was ever depreciating stage players after censuring some mistakes in emphasis which Garrick had committed in the course of that night s acting said the players Sir have got a kind of rant with which they run on without any regard either to accent or emphasis four hundred ninety Both Garrick and Giffard were offended at this sarcasm and endeavoured to refute it upon which Johnson rejoined Well now I ll give you something to speak with which you are little acquainted and then we shall see how just my observation is That shall be the criterion Let me hear you repeat the ninth Commandment Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour Both tried at it said doctor Taylor and both mistook the emphasis which should be upon not and false witness four hundred ninety one Johnson put them right and enjoyed his victory with great glee Page one hundred sixty nine A review in THE CHAMPION AEtat thirty five His Life of Savage was no sooner published than the following liberal praise was given to it in The Champion a periodical paper This pamphlet is without flattery to its authour as just and well written a piece as of its kind I ever saw so that at the same time that it highly deserves it certainly stands very little in need of this recommendation As to the history of the unfortunate person whose memoirs compose this work it is certainly penned with equal accuracy and spirit of which I am so much the better judge as I know many of the facts mentioned to be strictly true and very fairly related Besides it is not only the story of mister Savage but innumerable incidents relating to other persons and other affairs which renders this a very amusing and withal a very instructive and valuable performance The author s observations are short significant and just as his narrative is remarkably smooth and well disposed His reflections open to all the recesses of the human heart and in a word a more just or pleasant a more engaging or a more improving treatise on all the excellencies and defects of human nature is scarce to be found in our own or perhaps any other language four hundred ninety two Page one hundred seventy Parentage of Richard Savage A D seventeen forty four Johnson s partiality for Savage made him entertain no doubt of his story however extraordinary and improbable It never occurred to him to question his being the son of the Countess of Macclesfield of whose unrelenting barbarity he so loudly complained and the particulars of which are related in so strong and affecting a manner in Johnson s life of him Johnson was certainly well warranted in publishing his narrative however offensive it might be to the lady and her relations because her alledged unnatural and cruel conduct to her son and shameful avowal of guilt were stated in a Life of Savage now lying before me which came out so early as seventeen twenty seven and no attempt had been made to confute it or to punish the authour or printer as a libeller but for the honour of human nature we should be glad to find the shocking tale not true and from a respectable gentleman four hundred ninety three connected with the lady s family I have received such information and remarks as joined to my own inquiries will I think render it at least somewhat doubtful especially when we consider that it must have originated from the person himself who went by the name of Richard Savage If the maxim falsum in uno falsum in omnibus were to be received without qualification the credit of Savage s narrative as conveyed to us would be annihilated for it contains some assertions which beyond a question are not true four hundred ninety four one In order to induce a belief that Earl Rivers on account of a criminal connection with whom Lady Macclesfield is said to have been divorced from her husband by Act of Parliament four hundred ninety five had a peculiar anxiety about the child which she bore to him it is alledged that his Lordship gave him his own name and had it duly recorded in the register of saint Andrew s Holborn four hundred ninety six I have carefully inspected that register but no such entry is to be found four hundred ninety seven Page one hundred seventy one Lady Macclesfield s divorce AEtat thirty five two It is stated that Lady Macclesfield having lived for some time upon very uneasy terms with her husband thought a publick confession of adultery the most obvious and expeditious method of obtaining her liberty four hundred ninety eight and Johnson assuming this to be true stigmatises her with indignation as the wretch who had without scruple proclaimed herself an adulteress four hundred ninety nine But I have perused the Journals of both houses of Parliament at the period of her divorce and there find it authentically ascertained that so far from voluntarily submitting to the ignominious charge of adultery she made a strenuous defence by her Counsel the bill having been first moved fifteenth January sixteen ninety seven in the House of Lords and proceeded on with various applications for time to bring up witnesses at a distance c at intervals till the threed of March when it passed It was brought to the Commons by a message from the Lords the fifth of March proceeded on the seventh tenth eleventh fourteenth and fifteenth on which day after a full examination of witnesses on both sides and hearing of Counsel it was reported without amendments passed and carried to the Lords Page one hundred seventy two Lady Macclesfield s alleged cruelty A D seventeen forty four That Lady Macclesfield was convicted of the crime of which she was accused cannot be denied but the question now is whether the person calling himself Richard Savage was her son It has been said five hundred that when Earl Rivers was dying and anxious to provide for all his natural children he was informed by Lady Macclesfield that her son by him was dead Whether then shall we believe that this was a malignant lie invented by a mother to prevent her own child from receiving the bounty of his father which was accordingly the consequence if the person whose life Johnson wrote was her son or shall we not rather believe that the person who then assumed the name of Richard Savage was an impostor being in reality the son of the shoemaker under whose wife s care five hundred one Lady Macclesfield s child was placed that after the death of the real Richard Savage he attempted to personate him and that the fraud being known to Lady Macclesfield he was therefore repulsed by her with just resentment There is a strong circumstance in support of the last supposition though it has been mentioned as an aggravation of Lady Macclesfield s unnatural conduct and that is her having prevented him from obtaining the benefit of a legacy left to him by missus Lloyd his god mother For if there was such a legacy left his not being able to obtain payment of it must be imputed to his consciousness that he was not the real person The just inference should be that by the death of Lady Macclesfield s child before its god mother the legacy became lapsed and therefore that Johnson s Richard Savage was an impostor If he had a title to the legacy he could not have found any difficulty in recovering it for had the executors resisted his claim the whole costs as well as the legacy must have been paid by them if he had been the child to whom it was given five hundred two Page one hundred seventy three Lord Tyrconnel AEtat thirty five The talents of Savage and the mingled fire rudeness pride meanness and ferocity of his character five hundred three concur in making it credible that he was fit to plan and carry on an ambitious and daring scheme of imposture similar instances of which have not been wanting in higher spheres in the history of different countries and have had a considerable degree of success Yet on the other hand to the companion of Johnson who through whatever medium he was conveyed into this world be it ever so doubtful To whom related or by whom begot five hundred four was unquestionably a man of no common endowments we must allow the weight of general repute as to his Status or parentage though illicit and supposing him to be an impostor it seems strange that Lord Tyrconnel the nephew of Lady Macclesfield should patronise him and even admit him as a guest in his family five hundred five Lastly it must ever appear very suspicious that three different accounts of the Life of Richard Savage one published in The Plain Dealer in seventeen twenty four another in seventeen twenty seven and another by the powerful pen of Johnson in seventeen forty four and all of them while Lady Macclesfield was alive should notwithstanding the severe attacks upon her five hundred six have been suffered to pass without any publick and effectual contradiction Page one hundred seventy four Lady Macclesfield s latter career A D seventeen forty four I have thus endeavoured to sum up the evidence upon the case as fairly as I can and the result seems to be that the world must vibrate in a state of uncertainty as to what was the truth This digression I trust will not be censured as it relates to a matter exceedingly curious and very intimately connected with Johnson both as a man and an authour five hundred seven Page one hundred seventy five Observations of Shakespeare AEtat thirty eight He this year wrote the Preface to the Harleian Miscellany five hundred eight The selection of the pamphlets of which it was composed was made by mister Oldys five hundred nine a man of eager curiosity and indefatigable diligence who first exerted that spirit of inquiry into the literature of the old English writers by which the works of our great dramatick poet have of late been so signally illustrated In seventeen forty five he published a pamphlet entitled Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth with remarks on Sir T H s Sir Thomas Hammer s Edition of Shakspeare To which he affixed proposals for a new edition of that poet five hundred ten As we do not trace any thing else published by him during the course of this year we may conjecture that he was occupied entirely with that work But the little encouragement which was given by the publick to his anonymous proposals for the execution of a task which Warburton was known to have undertaken probably damped his ardour His pamphlet however was highly esteemed and was fortunate enough to obtain the approbation even of the supercilious Warburton himself who in the Preface to his Shakspeare published two years afterwards thus mentioned it As to all those things which have been published under the titles of Essays Remarks Observations c on Shakspeare if you except some critical notes on Macbeth given as a specimen of a projected edition and written as appears by a man of parts and genius the rest are absolutely below a serious notice Of this flattering distinction shewn to him by Warburton a very grateful remembrance was ever entertained by Johnson who said He praised me at a time when praise was of value to me Page one hundred seventy six The Rebellion of seventeen forty five A D seventeen forty six seventeen forty six AETAT thirty seven In seventeen forty six it is probable that he was still employed upon his Shakspeare which perhaps he laid aside for a time upon account of the high expectations which were formed of Warburton s edition of that great poet five hundred eleven It is somewhat curious that his literary career appears to have been almost totally suspended in the years seventeen forty five and seventeen forty six those years which were marked by a civil war in Great Britain when a rash attempt was made to restore the House of Stuart to the throne That he had a tenderness for that unfortunate House is well known and some may fancifully imagine that a sympathetick anxiety impeded the exertion of his intellectual powers but I am inclined to think that he was during this time sketching the outlines of his great philological work five hundred twelve Page one hundred seventy seven Johnson not an ardent Jacobite AEtat thirty eight None of his letters during those years are extant so far as I can discover This is much to be regretted It might afford some entertainment to see how he then expressed himself to his private friends concerning State affairs doctor Adams informs me that at this time a favourite object which he had in contemplation was The Life of Alfred in which from the warmth with which he spoke about it he would I believe had he been master of his own will have engaged himself rather than on any other subject Page one hundred seventy eight Poems wrongly assigned to Johnson A D seventeen forty seven seventeen forty seven AETAT thirty eight In seventeen forty seven it is supposed that the Gentleman s Magazine for May was enriched by him with five five hundred thirteen short poetical pieces distinguished by three asterisks The first is a translation or rather a paraphrase of a Latin Epitaph on Sir Thomas Hanmer Whether the Latin was his or not I have never heard though I should think it probably was if it be certain that he wrote the English five hundred fourteen as to which my only cause of doubt is that his slighting character of Hanmer as an editor in his Observations on Macbeth is very different from that in the Epitaph It may be said that there is the same contrariety between the character in the Observations and that in his own Preface to Shakspeare five hundred fifteen but a considerable time elapsed between the one publication and the other whereas the Observations and the Epitaph came close together The others are To Miss on her giving the Authour a gold and silk net work Purse of her own weaving Stella in Mourning The Winter s Walk An Ode and To Lyce an elderly Lady I am not positive that all these were his productions five hundred sixteen but as The Winter s Walk has never been controverted to be his and all of them have the same mark it is reasonable to conclude that they are all written by the same hand Yet to the Ode in which we find a passage very characteristick of him being a learned description of the gout Unhappy whom to beds of pain Arthritick tyranny consigns there is the following note The authour being ill of the gout but Johnson was not attacked with that distemper till at a very late period of his life five hundred seventeen May not this however be a poetical fiction Why may not a poet suppose himself to have the gout as well as suppose himself to be in love of which we have innumerable instances and which has been admirably ridiculed by Johnson in his Life of Cowley five hundred eighteen I have also some difficulty to believe that he could produce such a group of conceits five hundred nineteen as appear in the verses to Lyce in which he claims for this ancient personage as good a right to be assimilated to heaven as nymphs whom other poets have flattered he therefore ironically ascribes to her the attributes of the sky in such stanzas as this Her teeth the night with darkness dies She s starr d with pimples o er Her tongue like nimble lightning plies And can with thunder roar But as at a very advanced age he could condescend to trifle in namby pamby five hundred twenty rhymes to please missus Thrale and her daughter he may have in his earlier years composed such a piece as this It is remarkable that in this first edition of The Winters Walk the concluding line is much more Johnsonian than it was afterwards printed for in subsequent editions after praying Stella to snatch him to her arms he says And shield me from the ills of life Page one hundred eighty Verses on Lord Lovat A D seventeen forty seven Whereas in the first edition it is And hide me from the sight of life A horrour at life in general is more consonant with Johnson s habitual gloomy cast of thought I have heard him repeat with great energy the following verses which appeared in the Gentleman s Magazine for April this year but I have no authority to say they were his own Indeed one of the best criticks of our age five hundred twenty one suggests to me that the word indifferently being used in the sense of without concern and being also very unpoetical renders it improbable that they should have been his composition On Lord LOVAT S Execution Pity d by gentle minds KILMARNOCK died The brave BALMERINO were on thy side RADCLIFFE unhappy in his crimes of youth five hundred twenty two Steady in what he still mistook for truth Beheld his death so decently unmov d The soft lamented and the brave approv d But LOVAT S fate five hundred twenty three indifferently we view True to no King to no religion true No fair forgets the ruin he has done No child laments the tyrant of his son No tory pities thinking what he was No whig compassions for he left the cause The brave regret not for he was not brave The honest mourn not knowing him a knave five hundred twenty four Page one hundred eighty one A Prologue by Johnson AEtat thirty eight This year his old pupil and friend David Garrick having become joint patentee and manager of Drury lane theatre Johnson honoured his opening of it with a Prologue five hundred twenty five which for just and manly dramatick criticism on the whole range of the English stage as well as for poetical excellence five hundred twenty six is unrivalled Like the celebrated Epilogue to the Distressed Mother five hundred twenty seven it was during the season often called for by the audience The most striking and brilliant passages of it have been so often repeated and are so well recollected by all the lovers of the drama and of poetry that it would be superfluous to point them out In the Gentleman s Magazine for December this year he inserted an Ode on Winter which is I think an admirable specimen of his genius for lyrick poetry five hundred twenty eight Page one hundred eighty two The Plan of the Dictionary A D seventeen forty seven But the year seventeen forty seven is distinguished as the epoch when Johnson s arduous and important work his DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE was announced to the world by the publication of its Plan or Prospectus How long this immense undertaking had been the object of his contemplation I do not know I once asked him by what means he had attained to that astonishing knowledge of our language by which he was enabled to realise a design of such extent and accumulated difficulty He told me that it was not the effect of particular study but that it had grown up in his mind insensibly I have been informed by mister James Dodsley that several years before this period when Johnson was one day sitting in his brother Robert s shop he heard his brother suggest to him that a Dictionary of the English Language would be a work that would be well received by the publick five hundred twenty nine that Johnson seemed at first to catch at the proposition but after a pause said in his abrupt decisive manner I believe I shall not undertake it That he however had bestowed much thought upon the subject before he published his Plan is evident from the enlarged clear and accurate views which it exhibits and we find him mentioning in that tract that many of the writers whose testimonies were to be produced as authorities were selected by Pope five hundred thirty which proves that he had been furnished probably by mister Robert Dodsley with whatever hints that eminent poet had contributed towards a great literary project that had been the subject of important consideration in a former reign Page one hundred eighty three Address of the Earl of Chesterfield AEtat thirty eight The booksellers who contracted with Johnson single and unaided for the execution of a work which in other countries has not been effected but by the company operating exertions of many were mister Robert Dodsley mister Charles Hitch five hundred thirty one mister Andrew Millar the two Messieurs Longman and the two Messieurs Knapton The price stipulated was fifteen hundred and seventy five pounds five hundred thirty two The Plan was addressed to Philip Dormer Earl of Chesterfield then one of his Majesty s Principal Secretaries of State five hundred thirty three a nobleman who was very ambitious of literary distinction and who upon being informed of the design had expressed himself in terms very favourable to its success There is perhaps in every thing of any consequence a secret history which it would be amusing to know could we have it authentically communicated Johnson told me five hundred thirty four Sir the way in which the Plan of my Dictionary came to be inscribed to Lord Chesterfield was this I had neglected to write it by the time appointed Dodsley suggested a desire to have it addressed to Lord Chesterfield I laid hold of this as a pretext for delay that it might be better done and let Dodsley have his desire I said to my friend doctor Bathurst Now if any good comes of my addressing to Lord Chesterfield it will be ascribed to deep policy when in fact it was only a casual excuse for laziness Page one hundred eighty four The style of the PLAN A D seventeen forty seven It is worthy of observation that the Plan has not only the substantial merit of comprehension perspicuity and precision but that the language of it is unexceptionably excellent it being altogether free from that inflation of style and those uncommon but apt and energetick words five hundred thirty five which in some of his writings have been censured with more petulance than justice and never was there a more dignified strain of compliment than that in which he courts the attention of one who he had been persuaded to believe would be a respectable patron With regard to questions of purity or propriety says he I was once in doubt whether I should not attribute to myself too much in attempting to decide them and whether my province was to extend beyond the proposition of the question and the display of the suffrages on each side but I have been since determined by your Lordship s opinion to interpose my own judgement and shall therefore endeavour to support what appears to me most consonant to grammar and reason Ausonius thought that modesty forbade him to plead inability for a task to which Caesar had judged him equal Cur me pesse negem posse quod ille putat five hundred thirty six And I may hope my Lord that since you whose authority in our language is so generally acknowledged have commissioned me to declare my own opinion I shall be considered as exercising a kind of vicarious jurisdiction and that the power which might have been denied to my own claim will be readily allowed me as the delegate of your Lordship Page one hundred eighty five The Earl of Orrery AEtat thirty eight This passage proves that Johnson s addressing his Plan to Lord Chesterfield was not merely in consequence of the result of a report by means of Dodsley that the Earl favoured the design but that there had been a particular communication with his Lordship concerning it doctor Taylor told me that Johnson sent his Plan to him in manuscript for his perusal and that when it was lying upon his table mister William Whitehead five hundred thirty seven happened to pay him a visit and being shewn it was highly pleased with such parts of it as he had time to read and begged to take it home with him which he was allowed to do that from him it got into the hands of a noble Lord who carried it to Lord Chesterfield five hundred thirty eight When Taylor observed this might be an advantage Johnson replied No Sir it would have come out with more bloom if it had not been seen before by any body The opinion conceived of it by another noble authour appears from the following extract of a letter from the Earl of Orrery to doctor Birch Caledon Dec thirty seventeen forty seven I have just now seen the specimen of mister Johnson s Dictionary addressed to Lord Chesterfield I am much pleased with the plan and I think the specimen is one of the best that I have ever read Most specimens disgust rather than prejudice us in favour of the work to follow but the language of mister Johnson s is good and the arguments are properly and modestly expressed However some expressions may be cavilled at but they are trifles I ll mention one The barren Laurel The laurel is not barren in any sense whatever it bears fruits and flowers five hundred thirty nine Sed hae sunt nugae and I have great expectation from the performance five hundred forty That he was fully aware of the arduous nature of the undertaking he acknowledges and shews himself perfectly sensible of it in the conclusion of his Plan five hundred forty one but he had a noble consciousness of his own abilities which enabled him to go on with undaunted spirit five hundred forty two Page one hundred eighty six The Dictionary of the French Academy A D seventeen forty eight doctor Adams found him one day busy at his Dictionary when the following dialogue ensued ADAMS This is a great work Sir How are you to get all the etymologies JOHNSON Why Sir here is a shelf with Junius and Skinner five hundred forty three and others and there is a Welch gentleman who has published a collection of Welch proverbs who will help me with the Welch five hundred forty four ADAMS But Sir how can you do this in three years JOHNSON Sir I have no doubt that I can do it in three years ADAMS But the French Academy which consists of forty members took forty years to compile their Dictionary JOHNSON Sir thus it is This is the proportion Let me see forty times forty is sixteen hundred As three to sixteen hundred so is the proportion of an Englishman to a Frenchman With so much ease and pleasantry could he talk of that prodigious labour which he had undertaken to execute The publick has had from another pen five hundred forty five a long detail of what had been done in this country by prior Lexicographers and no doubt Johnson was wise to avail himself of them so far as they went but the learned yet judicious research of etymology five hundred forty six the various yet accurate display of definition and the rich collection of authorities were reserved for the superior mind of our great philologist five hundred forty seven For the mechanical part he employed as he told me six amanuenses and let it be remembered by the natives of North Britain to whom he is supposed to have been so hostile that five of them were of that country There were two Messieurs Macbean mister Shiels who we shall hereafter see partly wrote the Lives of the Poets to which the name of Cibber is affixed five hundred forty eight mister Stewart son of mister George Stewart bookseller at Edinburgh and a mister Maitland The sixth of these humble assistants was mister Peyton who I believe taught French and published some elementary tracts Page one hundred eighty seven Johnson s amanuenses AEtat thirty eight To all these painful labourers Johnson shewed a never ceasing kindness so far as they stood in need of it The elder mister Macbean had afterwards the honour of being Librarian to Archibald Duke of Argyle for many years but was left without a shilling Johnson wrote for him a Preface to A System of Ancient Geography and by the favour of Lord Thurlow got him admitted a poor brother of the Charterhouse five hundred forty nine For Shiels who died of a consumption he had much tenderness and it has been thought that some choice sentences in the Lives of the Poets were supplied by him five hundred fifty Peyton when reduced to penury had frequent aid from the bounty of Johnson who at last was at the expense of burying both him and his wife five hundred fifty one Page one hundred eighty eight The upper room in Gough square A D seventeen forty eight Page one hundred eighty nine Authours quoted in THE DICTIONARY AEtat thirty nine While the Dictionary was going forward Johnson lived part of the time in Holborn part in Gough square Fleet street and he had an upper room fitted up like a counting house for the purpose in which he gave to the copyists their several tasks five hundred fifty two The words partly taken from other dictionaries and partly supplied by himself having been first written down with spaces left between them he delivered in writing their etymologies definitions and various significations five hundred fifty three The authorities were copied from the books themselves in which he had marked the passages with a black lead pencil the traces of which could easily be effaced five hundred fifty four I have seen several of them in which that trouble had not been taken so that they were just as when used by the copyists five hundred fifty five It is remarkable that he was so attentive in the choice of the passages in which words were authorised that one may read page after page of his Dictionary with improvement and pleasure and it should not pass unobserved that he has quoted no authour whose writings had a tendency to hurt sound religion and morality five hundred fifty six

none	none	 Johnson was at first very obstinate Sir said he the fellow wants me to make Mahomet run mad that he may have an opportunity of tossing his hands and kicking his heels five hundred seventy seven He was however at last with difficulty prevailed on to comply with Garrick s wishes so as to allow of some changes but still there were not enough Page one hundred ninety seven The Epilogue to IRENE AEtat forty doctor Adams was present the first night of the representation of Irene and gave me the following account Before the curtain drew up there were catcalls whistling which alarmed Johnson s friends The Prologue which was written by himself in a manly strain soothed the audience five hundred seventy eight and the play went off tolerably till it came to the conclusion when missus Pritchard five hundred seventy nine the heroine of the piece was to be strangled upon the stage and was to speak two lines with the bow string round her neck The audience cried out Murder Murder five hundred eighty She several times attempted to speak but in vain At last she was obliged to go off the stage alive This passage was afterwards struck out and she was carried off to be put to death behind the scenes as the play now has it five hundred eighty one The Epilogue as Johnson informed me was written by Sir William Yonge five hundred eighty two I know not how his play came to be thus graced by the pen of a person then so eminent in the political world Notwithstanding all the support of such performers as Garrick Barry missus Cibber missus Pritchard and every advantage of dress and decoration the tragedy of Irene did not please the publick five hundred eighty three mister Garrick s zeal carried it through for nine nights five hundred eighty four so that the authour had his three nights profits and from a receipt signed by him now in the hands of mister James Dodsley it appears that his friend mister Robert Dodsley gave him one hundred pounds for the copy with his usual reservation of the right of one edition five hundred eighty five Page one hundred ninety eight IRENE as a poem A D seventeen forty nine Page one hundred ninety nine Johnson no tragedy writer AEtat forty Irene considered as a poem is intitled to the praise of superiour excellence five hundred eighty six Analysed into parts it will furnish a rich store of noble sentiments fine imagery and beautiful language but it is deficient in pathos in that delicate power of touching the human feelings which is the principal end of the drama five hundred eighty seven Indeed Garrick has complained to me that Johnson not only had not the faculty of producing the impressions of tragedy but that he had not the sensibility to perceive them His great friend mister Walmsley s prediction that he would turn out a fine tragedy writer five hundred eighty eight was therefore ill founded Johnson was wise enough to be convinced that he had not the talents necessary to write successfully for the stage and never made another attempt in that species of composition five hundred eighty nine Page two hundred Deference for the general opinion A D seventeen forty nine When asked how he felt upon the ill success of his tragedy he replied Like the Monument five hundred ninety meaning that he continued firm and unmoved as that column And let it be remembered as an admonition to the genus irritabile five hundred ninety one of dramatick writers that this great man instead of peevishly complaining of the bad taste of the town submitted to its decision without a murmur He had indeed upon all occasions a great deference for the general opinion five hundred ninety two A man said he who writes a book thinks himself wiser or wittier than the rest of mankind he supposes that he can instruct or amuse them and the publick to whom he appeals must after all be the judges of his pretensions Page two hundred one Johnson in the Green Room AEtat forty one On occasion of his play being brought upon the stage Johnson had a fancy that as a dramatick authour his dress should be more gay than what he ordinarily wore he therefore appeared behind the scenes and even in one of the side boxes in a scarlet waistcoat with rich gold lace and a gold laced hat five hundred ninety three He humourously observed to mister Langton that when in that dress he could not treat people with the same ease as when in his usual plain clothes five hundred ninety four Dress indeed we must allow has more effect even upon strong minds than one should suppose without having had the experience of it His necessary attendance while his play was in rehearsal and during its performance brought him acquainted with many of the performers of both sexes which produced a more favourable opinion of their profession than he had harshly expressed in his Life of Savage five hundred ninety five With some of them he kept up an acquaintance as long as he and they lived and was ever ready to shew them acts of kindness He for a considerable time used to frequent the Green Room and seemed to take delight in dissipating his gloom by mixing in the sprightly chit chat of the motley circle then to be found there five hundred ninety six mister David Hume related to me from mister Garrick that Johnson at last denied himself this amusement from considerations of rigid virtue saying I ll come no more behind your scenes David for the silk stockings and white bosoms of your actresses excite my amorous propensities Page two hundred two The Rambler A D seventeen fifty seventeen fifty AETAT forty one In seventeen fifty he came forth in the character for which he was eminently qualified a majestick teacher of moral and religious wisdom The vehicle which he chose was that of a periodical paper which he knew had been upon former occasions employed with great success The Tatler Spectator and Guardian were the last of the kind published in England which had stood the test of a long trial five hundred ninety seven and such an interval had now elapsed since their publication as made him justly think that to many of his readers this form of instruction would in some degree have the advantage of novelty A few days before the first of his Essays came out there started another competitor for fame in the same form under the title of The Tatler Revived five hundred ninety eight which I believe was born but to die five hundred ninety nine Johnson was I think not very happy in the choice of his title The Rambler which certainly is not suited to a series of grave and moral discourses which the Italians have literally but ludicrously translated by Il Vagabondo six hundred and which has been lately assumed as the denomination of a vehicle of licentious tales The Rambler s Magazine He gave Sir Joshua Reynolds the following account of its getting this name What must be done Sir will be done When I was to begin publishing that paper I was at a loss how to name it I sat down at night upon my bedside and resolved that I would not go to sleep till I had fixed its title The Rambler seemed the best that occurred and I took it six hundred one With what devout and conscientious sentiments this paper was undertaken is evidenced by the following prayer which he composed and offered up on the occasion Almighty GOD the giver of all good things without whose help all labour is ineffectual and without whose grace all wisdom is folly grant I beseech Thee that in this undertaking six hundred two thy Holy Spirit may not be with held from me but that I may promote thy glory and the salvation of myself and others grant this O LORD for the sake of thy son JESUS CHRIST Amen six hundred three Page two hundred three Revision of The Rambler AEtat forty one The first paper of the Rambler was published on Tuesday the twentieth of March seventeen fifty and its authour was enabled to continue it without interruption every Tuesday and Friday till Saturday the seventeenth of March seventeen fifty two six hundred four on which day it closed This is a strong confirmation of the truth of a remark of his which I have had occasion to quote elsewhere six hundred five that a man may write at any time if he will set himself doggedly to it six hundred six for notwithstanding his constitutional indolence his depression of spirits and his labour in carrying on his Dictionary he answered the stated calls of the press twice a week from the stores of his mind during all that time having received no assistance except four billets in No ten by Miss Mulso now missus Chapone six hundred seven No thirty by missus Catharine Talbot six hundred eight No ninety seven by mister Samuel Richardson whom he describes in an introductory note as An author who has enlarged the knowledge of human nature and taught the passions to move at the command of virtue and Nos forty four and one hundred by missus Elizabeth Carter Page two hundred four Johnson s rapid composition A D seventeen fifty Posterity will be astonished when they are told upon the authority of Johnson himself that many of these discourses which we should suppose had been laboured with all the slow attention of literary leisure were written in haste as the moment pressed without even being read over by him before they were printed six hundred nine It can be accounted for only in this way that by reading and meditation and a very close inspection of life he had accumulated a great fund of miscellaneous knowledge which by a peculiar promptitude of mind was ever ready at his call and which he had constantly accustomed himself to clothe in the most apt and energetick expression Sir Joshua Reynolds once asked him by what means he had attained his extraordinary accuracy and flow of language He told him that he had early laid it down as a fixed rule to do his best on every occasion and in every company to impart whatever he knew in the most forcible language he could put it in and that by constant practice and never suffering any careless expressions to escape him or attempting to deliver his thoughts without arranging them in the clearest manner it became habitual to him six hundred ten Page two hundred five Hints for the Rambler AEtat forty two Yet he was not altogether unprepared as a periodical writer for I have in my possession a small duodecimo volume in which he has written in the form of mister Locke s Common Place Book a variety of hints for essays on different subjects He has marked upon the first blank leaf of it To the one hundred and twenty eighth page collections for the Rambler and in another place In fifty two there were seventeen provided in ninety seven twenty one in one hundred ninety twenty five At a subsequent period probably after the work was finished he added In all taken of provided materials thirty six hundred eleven Sir John Hawkins who is unlucky upon all occasions tells us that this method of accumulating intelligence had been practised by mister Addison and is humourously described in one of the Spectators six hundred twelve wherein he feigns to have dropped his paper of notanda consisting of a diverting medley of broken sentences and loose hints which he tells us he had collected and meant to make use of Much of the same kind is Johnson s Adversaria six hundred thirteen But the truth is that there is no resemblance at all between them Addison s note was a fiction in which unconnected fragments of his lucubrations were purposely jumbled together in as odd a manner as he could in order to produce a laughable effect Whereas Johnson s abbreviations are all distinct and applicable to each subject of which the head is mentioned For instance there is the following specimen Youth s Entry c Baxter s account of things in which he had changed his mind as he grew up Voluminous No wonder If every man was to tell or mark on how many subjects he has changed it would make vols but the changes not always observed by man s self From pleasure to bus business to

Here we see the embryo of Number forty five of the Adventurer and it is a confirmation of what I shall presently have occasion to mention six hundred twenty one that the papers in that collection marked T were written by Johnson Page two hundred eight The Rambler s slow sale A D seventeen fifty This scanty preparation of materials will not however much diminish our wonder at the extraordinary fertility of his mind for the proportion which they bear to the number of essays which he wrote is very small and it is remarkable that those for which he had made no preparation are as rich and as highly finished as those for which the hints were lying by him It is also to be observed that the papers formed from his hints are worked up with such strength and elegance that we almost lose sight of the hints which become like drops in the bucket Indeed in several instances he has made a very slender use of them so that many of them remain still unapplied six hundred twenty two As the Rambler was entirely the work of one man there was of course such a uniformity in its texture as very much to exclude the charm of variety six hundred twenty three and the grave and often solemn cast of thinking which distinguished it from other periodical papers made it for some time not generally liked So slowly did this excellent work of which twelve editions have now issued from the press gain upon the world at large that even in the closing number the authour says I have never been much a favourite of the publick six hundred twenty four Page two hundred nine George II not an Augustus AEtat forty one Yet very soon after its commencement there were who felt and acknowledged its uncommon excellence Verses in its praise appeared in the newspapers and the editor of the Gentleman s Magazine mentions in October his having received several letters to the same purpose from the learned six hundred twenty five The Student or Oxford and Cambridge Miscellany in which mister Bonnell Thornton and mister Colman were the principal writers describes it as a work that exceeds anything of the kind ever published in this kingdom some of the Spectators excepted if indeed they may be excepted And afterwards May the publick favours crown his merits and may not the English under the auspicious reign of GEORGE the Second neglect a man who had he lived in the first century would have been one of the greatest favourites of Augustus This flattery of the monarch had no effect It is too well known that the second George never was an Augustus to learning or genius six hundred twenty six Page two hundred ten missus Johnson s praise of The Rambler A D seventeen fifty Johnson told me with an amiable fondness a little pleasing circumstance relative to this work missus Johnson in whose judgement and taste he had great confidence said to him after a few numbers of the Rambler had come out I thought very well of you before but I did not imagine you could have written any thing equal to this six hundred twenty seven Distant praise from whatever quarter is not so delightful as that of a wife whom a man loves and esteems Her approbation may be said to come home to his bosom and being so near its effect is most sensible and permanent mister James Elphinston six hundred twenty eight who has since published various works and who was ever esteemed by Johnson as a worthy man happened to be in Scotland while the Rambler was coming out in single papers at London With a laudable zeal at once for the improvement of his countrymen and the reputation of his friend he suggested and took the charge of an edition of those Essays at Edinburgh which followed progressively the London publication six hundred twenty nine The following letter written at this time though not dated will show how much pleased Johnson was with this publication and what kindness and regard he had for mister Elphinston Page two hundred eleven Letters to mister Elphinston AEtat forty one To mister JAMES ELPHINSTON No date DEAR SIR I cannot but confess the failures of my correspondence but hope the same regard which you express for me on every other occasion will incline you to forgive me I am often very often ill and when I am well am obliged to work and indeed have never much used myself to punctuality You are however not to make unkind inferences when I forbear to reply to your kindness for be assured I never receive a letter from you without great pleasure and a very warm sense of your generosity and friendship which I heartily blame myself for not cultivating with more care In this as in many other cases I go wrong in opposition to conviction for I think scarce any temporal good equally to be desired with the regard and familiarity of worthy men I hope we shall be some time nearer to each other and have a more ready way of pouring out our hearts I am glad that you still find encouragement to proceed in your publication and shall beg the favour of six more volumes to add to my former six when you can with any convenience send them me Please to present a set in my name to mister Ruddiman six hundred thirty of whom I hear that his learning is not his highest excellence I have transcribed the mottos and returned them I hope not too late of which I think many very happily performed mister Cave has put the last in the magazine six hundred thirty one in which I think he did well I beg of you to write soon and to write often and to write long letters which I hope in time to repay you but you must be a patient creditor I have however this of gratitude that I think of you with regard when I

mister JAMES ELPHINSTON September twenty five seventeen fifty DEAR SIR You have as I find by every kind of evidence lost an excellent mother and I hope you will not think me incapable of partaking of your grief I have a mother now eighty two years of age whom therefore I must soon lose six hundred thirty two unless it please GOD that she rather should mourn for me I read the letters in which you relate your mother s death to missus Strahan six hundred thirty three and think I do myself honour when I tell you that I read them with tears but tears are neither to you nor to me of any further use when once the tribute of nature has been paid The business of life summons us away from useless grief and calls us to the exercise of those virtues of which we are lamenting our deprivation The greatest benefit which one friend can confer upon another is to guard and excite and elevate his virtues This your mother will still perform if you diligently preserve the memory of her life and of her death a life so far as I can learn useful wise and innocent and a death resigned peaceful and holy I cannot forbear to mention that neither reason nor revelation denies you to hope that you may increase her happiness by obeying her precepts and that she may in her present state look with pleasure upon every act of virtue to which her instructions or example have contributed Whether this be more than a pleasing dream or a just opinion of separate spirits is indeed of no great importance to us when we consider ourselves as acting under the eye of GOD yet surely there is something pleasing in the belief that our separation from those whom we love is merely corporeal and it may be a great incitement to virtuous friendship if it can be made probable that that union that has received the divine approbation shall continue to eternity There is one expedient by which you may in some degree continue her presence If you write down minutely what you remember of her from your earliest years you will read it with great pleasure and receive from it many hints of soothing recollection when time shall remove her yet farther from you and your grief shall be matured to veneration To this however painful for the present I cannot but advise you as to a source of comfort and satisfaction in the time to come for all comfort and all satisfaction is sincerely wished you by dear Sir Your most obliged most obedient And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Page two hundred thirteen Goldsmith s debt to Johnson AEtat forty one The Rambler has increased in fame as in age Soon after its first folio edition was concluded it was published in six duodecimo volumes six hundred thirty four and its authour lived to see ten numerous editions of it in London beside those of Ireland and Scotland six hundred thirty five I profess myself to have ever entertained a profound veneration for the astonishing force and vivacity of mind which the Rambler exhibits That Johnson had penetration enough to see and seeing would not disguise the general misery of man in this state of being may have given rise to the superficial notion of his being too stern a philosopher But men of reflection will be sensible that he has given a true representation of human existence and that he has at the same time with a generous benevolence displayed every consolation which our state affords us not only those arising from the hopes of futurity but such as may be attained in the immediate progress through life He has not depressed the soul to despondency and indifference He has every where inculcated study labour and exertion Nay he has shewn in a very odious light a man whose practice is to go about darkening the views of others by perpetual complaints of evil and awakening those considerations of danger and distress which are for the most part lulled into a quiet oblivion This he has done very strongly in his character of Suspirius six hundred thirty six from which Goldsmith took that of Croaker in his comedy of The Good Natured Man six hundred thirty seven as Johnson told me he acknowledged to him and which is indeed very obvious six hundred thirty eight Page two hundred fourteen The Beauties of doctor Johnson A D seventeen fifty To point out the numerous subjects which the Rambler treats with a dignity and perspicuity which are there united in a manner which we shall in vain look for any where else would take up too large a portion of my book and would I trust be superfluous considering how universally those volumes are now disseminated Even the most condensed and brilliant sentences which they contain and which have very properly been selected under the name of Beauties six hundred thirty nine are of considerable bulk But I may shortly observe that the Rambler furnishes such an assemblage of discourses on practical religion and moral duty of critical investigations and allegorical and oriental tales that no mind can be thought very deficient that has by constant study and meditation assimilated to itself all that may be found there No seven written in Passion week on abstraction and self examination six hundred forty and No one hundred ten on penitence and the placability of the Divine Nature cannot be too often read No fifty four on the effect which the death of a friend should have upon us though rather too dispiriting may be occasionally very medicinal to the mind Every one must suppose the writer to have been deeply impressed by a real scene but he told me that was not the case which shews how well his fancy could conduct him to the house of mourning six hundred forty one Some of these more solemn papers I doubt not particularly attracted the notice of doctor Young the authour of The Night Thoughts of whom my estimation is such as to reckon his applause an honour even to Johnson I have seen some volumes of doctor Young s copy of the Rambler in which he has marked the passages which he thought particularly excellent by folding down a corner of the page and such as he rated in a super eminent degree are marked by double folds I am sorry that some of the volumes are lost Johnson was pleased when told of the minute attention with which Young had signified his approbation of his Essays Page two hundred fifteen A Club in Essex AEtat forty one I will venture to say that in no writings whatever can be found more bark and steel for the mind if I may use the expression more that can brace and invigorate every manly and noble sentiment No thirty two on patience even under extreme misery is wonderfully lofty and as much above the rant of stoicism as the Sun of Revelation is brighter than the twilight of Pagan philosophy I never read the following sentence without feeling my frame thrill I think there is some reason for questioning whether the body and mind are not so proportioned that the one can bear all which can be inflicted on the other whether virtue cannot stand its ground as long as life and whether a soul well principled will not be sooner separated than subdued six hundred forty two Page two hundred sixteen The character of Prospero A D seventeen fifty Page two hundred seventeen The Style of The Rambler AEtat forty one Though instruction be the predominant purpose of the Rambler yet it is enlivened with a considerable portion of amusement Nothing can be more erroneous than the notion which some persons have entertained that Johnson was then a retired authour ignorant of the world and of consequence that he wrote only from his imagination when he described characters and manners He said to me that before he wrote that work he had been running about the world as he expressed it more than almost any body and I have heard him relate with much satisfaction that several of the characters in the Rambler were drawn so naturally that when it first circulated in numbers a club in one of the towns in Essex imagined themselves to be severally exhibited in it and were much incensed against a person who they suspected had thus made them objects of publick notice nor were they quieted till authentick assurance was given them that the Rambler was written by a person who had never heard of any one of them six hundred forty three Some of the characters are believed to have been actually drawn from the life particularly that of Prospero from Garrick six hundred forty four who never entirely forgave its pointed satire six hundred forty five For instances of fertility of fancy and accurate description of real life I appeal to No nineteen a man who wanders from one profession to another with most plausible reasons for every change No thirty four female fastidiousness and timorous refinement No eighty two a Virtuoso who has collected curiosities No eighty eight six hundred forty six petty modes of entertaining a company and conciliating kindness No one hundred eighty two fortune hunting No one hundred ninety four one hundred ninety five a tutor s account of the follies of his pupil No one hundred ninety seven one hundred ninety eight legacy hunting He has given a specimen of his nice observation of the mere external appearances of life in the following passage in No one hundred seventy nine against affectation that frequent and most disgusting quality He that stands to contemplate the crouds that fill the streets of a populous city will see many passengers whose air and motion it will be difficult to behold without contempt and laughter but if he examine what are the appearances that thus powerfully excite his risibility he will find among them neither poverty nor disease nor any involuntary or painful defect The disposition to derision and insult is awakened by the softness of foppery the swell of insolence the liveliness of levity or the solemnity of grandeur by the sprightly trip the stately stalk the formal strut and the lofty mien by gestures intended to catch the eye and by looks elaborately formed as evidences of importance Every page of the Rambler shews a mind teeming with classical allusion and poetical imagery illustrations from other writers are upon all occasions so ready and mingle so easily in his periods that the whole appears of one uniform vivid texture Page two hundred eighteen Johnson s masters in style A D seventeen fifty Page two hundred nineteen A Great Personage AEtat forty one The style of this work has been censured by some shallow criticks as involved and turgid and abounding with antiquated and hard words So ill founded is the first part of this objection that I will challenge all who may honour this book with a perusal to point out any English writer whose language conveys his meaning with equal force and perspicuity It must indeed be allowed that the structure of his sentences is expanded and often has somewhat of the inversion of Latin and that he delighted to express familiar thoughts in philosophical language being in this the reverse of Socrates who it was said reduced philosophy to the simplicity of common life But let us attend to what he himself says in his concluding paper When common words were less pleasing to the ear or less distinct in their signification I have familiarised the terms of philosophy by applying them to popular ideas six hundred forty seven And as to the second part of this objection upon a late careful revision of the work I can with confidence say that it is amazing how few of those words for which it has been unjustly characterised are actually to be found in it I am sure not the proportion of one to each paper This idle charge has been echoed from one babbler to another who have confounded Johnson s Essays with Johnson s Dictionary and because he thought it right in a Lexicon of our language to collect many words which had fallen into disuse but were supported by great authorities it has been imagined that all of these have been interwoven into his own compositions That some of them have been adopted by him unnecessarily may perhaps be allowed but in general they are evidently an advantage for without them his stately ideas would be confined and cramped He that thinks with more extent than another will want words of larger meaning six hundred forty eight He once told me that he had formed his style upon that of Sir William Temple six hundred forty nine and upon Chambers s Proposal for his Dictionary six hundred fifty He certainly was mistaken or if he imagined at first that he was imitating Temple he was very unsuccessful for nothing can be more unlike than the simplicity of Temple and the richness of Johnson Their styles differ as plain cloth and brocade Temple indeed seems equally erroneous in supposing that he himself had formed his style upon Sandys s View of the State of Religion in the Western parts of the World The style of Johnson was undoubtedly much formed upon that of the great writers in the last century Hooker Bacon Sanderson Hakewell and others those GIANTS six hundred fifty one as they were well characterised by A GREAT PERSONAGE six hundred fifty two whose authority were I to name him would stamp a reverence on the opinion Page two hundred twenty The motto to the Dictionary A D seventeen fifty We may with the utmost propriety apply to his learned style that passage of Horace a part of which he has taken as the motto to his Dictionary six hundred fifty

not a coiner of words AEtat forty one To so great a master of thinking to one of such vast and various knowledge as Johnson might have been allowed a liberal indulgence of that licence which Horace claims in another place Si forte necesse est Indiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum Fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis Continget dabiturque licentia sumpta pudenter Et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem si Graeco fonte cadant parce detorta Quid autem Caecilio Plautoque dabit Romanus ademptum Virgilio Varioque Ego cur acquirere pauca Si possum invideor cum lingua Catonis et Enni Sermonem patrium ditaverit et nova rerum Nomina protulerit Licuit semperque licebit Signatum praesente nota producere nomen six hundred fifty five Yet Johnson assured me that he had not taken upon him to add more than four or five words to the English language of his own formation six hundred fifty six and he was very much offended at the general licence by no means modestly taken in his time not only to coin new words but to use many words in senses quite different from their established meaning and those frequently very fantastical six hundred fifty seven Page two hundred twenty two Johnson s influence on style A D seventeen fifty Sir Thomas Brown six hundred fifty eight whose life Johnson wrote was remarkably fond of Anglo Latian diction and to his example we are to ascribe Johnson s sometimes indulging himself in this kind of phraseology Johnson s comprehension of mind was the mould for his language Had his conceptions been narrower his expression would have been easier His sentences have a dignified march and it is certain that his example has given a general elevation to the language of his country for many of our best writers have approached very near to him and from the influence which he has had upon our composition scarcely any thing is written now that is not better expressed than was usual before he appeared to lead the national taste Page two hundred twenty three Courtenay s lines on Johnson s school AEtat forty one This circumstance the truth of which must strike every critical reader has been so happily enforced by mister Courtenay in his Moral and Literary Character of doctor Johnson that I cannot prevail on myself to withhold it notwithstanding his perhaps too great partiality for one of his friends By nature s gifts ordain d mankind to rule He like a Titian form d his brilliant school And taught congenial spirits to excel While from his lips impressive wisdom fell Our boasted GOLDSMITH felt the sovereign sway From him deriv d the sweet

even to ridicule and are well denominated by the names which he has given them as Misella six hundred sixty Zozima Properantia Rhodoclia Page two hundred twenty four The styles of addison and Johnson A D seventeen fifty It has of late been the fashion to compare the style of Addison and Johnson and to depreciate I think very unjustly the style of Addison as nerveless and feeble six hundred sixty one because it has not the strength and energy of that of Johnson Their prose may be balanced like the poetry of Dryden and Pope Both are excellent though in different ways Addison writes with the ease of a gentleman His readers fancy that a wise and accomplished companion is talking to them so that he insinuates his sentiments and taste into their minds by an imperceptible influence Johnson writes like a teacher He dictates to his readers as if from an academical chair They attend with awe and admiration and his precepts are impressed upon them by his commanding eloquence Addison s style like a light wine pleases everybody from the first Johnson s like a liquor of more body seems too strong at first but by degrees is highly relished and such is the melody of his periods so much do they captivate the ear and seize upon the attention that there is scarcely any writer however inconsiderable who does not aim in some degree at the same species of excellence But let us not ungratefully undervalue that beautiful style which has pleasingly conveyed to us much instruction and entertainment Though comparatively weak opposed to Johnson s Herculean vigour let us not call it positively feeble Let us remember the character of his style as given by Johnson himself six hundred sixty two What he attempted he performed he is never feeble and he did not wish to be energetick he is never rapid and he never stagnates His sentences have neither studied amplitude nor affected brevity his periods though not diligently rounded are voluble and easy six hundred sixty three Whoever wishes to attain an English style familiar but not coarse and elegant but not ostentatious must give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison six hundred sixty four Page two hundred twenty five Boswell s projected works AEtat forty one Page two hundred twenty six The last Rambler A D seventeen fifty Though the Rambler was not concluded till the year seventeen fifty two I shall under this year say all that I have to observe upon it Some of the translations of the mottos by himself are admirably done He acknowledges to have received elegant translations of many of them from mister James Elphinston and some are very happily translated by a mister F Lewis six hundred sixty five of whom I never heard more except that Johnson thus described him to mister Malone Sir he lived in London and hung loose upon society The concluding paper of his Rambler is at once dignified and pathetick I cannot however but wish that he had not ended it with an unnecessary Greek verse translated also into an English couplet six hundred sixty six It is too much like the conceit of those dramatick poets who used to conclude each act with a rhyme and the expression in the first line of his couplet Celestial powers though proper in Pagan poetry is ill suited to Christianity with a conformity six hundred sixty seven to which he consoles himself How much better would it have been to have ended with the prose sentence I shall never envy the honours which wit and learning obtain in any other cause if I can be numbered among the writers who have given ardour to virtue and confidence to truth six hundred sixty eight His friend doctor Birch being now engaged in preparing an edition of Ralegh s smaller pieces doctor Johnson wrote the following letter to that gentleman To doctor BIRCH Gough square May twelve seventeen fifty SIR Knowing that you are now preparing to favour the publick with a new edition of Ralegh s six hundred sixty nine miscellaneous pieces I have taken the liberty to send you a Manuscript which fell by chance within my notice I perceive no proofs of forgery in my examination of it and the owner tells me that as he six hundred seventy has heard the handwriting is Sir Walter s If you should find reason to conclude it genuine it will be a kindness to the owner a blind person six hundred seventy one to recommend it to the booksellers I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Page two hundred twenty seven Milton s grand daughter AEtat forty one Page two hundred twenty eight Lauder s imposition A D seventeen fifty one His just abhorrence of Milton s political notions was ever strong But this did not prevent his warm admiration of Milton s great poetical merit to which he has done illustrious justice beyond all who have written upon the subject And this year he not only wrote a Prologue which was spoken by mister Garrick before the acting of Comus at Drury lane theatre for the benefit of Milton s grand daughter but took a very zealous interest in the success of the charity six hundred seventy two On the day preceding the performance he published the following letter in the General Advertiser addressed to the printer of that paper SIR That a certain degree of reputation is acquired merely by approving the works of genius and testifying a regard to the memory of authours is a truth too evident to be denied and therefore to ensure a participation of fame with a celebrated poet many who would perhaps have contributed to starve him when alive have heaped expensive pageants upon his grave six hundred seventy three It must indeed be confessed that this method of becoming known to posterity with honour is peculiar to the great or at least to the wealthy but an opportunity now offers for almost every individual to secure the praise of paying a just regard to the illustrious dead united with the pleasure of doing good to the living To assist industrious indigence struggling with distress and debilitated by age is a display of virtue and an acquisition of happiness and honour Whoever then would be thought capable of pleasure in reading the works of our incomparable Milton and not so destitute of gratitude as to refuse to lay out a trifle in rational and elegant entertainment for the benefit of his living remains for the exercise of their own virtue the increase of their reputation and the pleasing consciousness of doing good should appear at Drury lane theatre to morrow April five when Comus will be performed for the benefit of missus Elizabeth Foster grand daughter to the author and the only surviving branch of his family N B There will be a new prologue on the occasion written by the author of Irene six hundred seventy four and spoken by mister Garrick and by particular desire there will be added to the Masque a dramatick satire called Lethe in which mister Garrick will perform Page two hundred twenty nine Douglas s MILTON NO PLAGIARY AEtat forty two seventeen fifty one AETAT forty two In seventeen fifty one six hundred seventy five we are to consider him as carrying on both his Dictionary and Rambler But he also wrote The Life of Cheynel six hundred seventy six in the miscellany called The Student and the Reverend doctor Douglas having with uncommon acuteness clearly detected a gross forgery and imposition upon the publick by William Lauder a Scotch schoolmaster who had with equal impudence and ingenuity represented Milton as a plagiary from certain modern Latin poets Johnson who had been so far imposed upon as to furnish a Preface and Postscript to his work now dictated a letter for Lauder addressed to doctor Douglas acknowledging his fraud in terms of suitable contrition six hundred seventy seven Page two hundred thirty Johnson tricked by Lander A D seventeen fifty one This extraordinary attempt of Lauder was no sudden effort He had brooded over it for many years and to this hour it is uncertain what his principal motive was unless it were a vain notion of his superiority in being able by whatever means to deceive mankind To effect this he produced certain passages from Grotius Masenius and others which had a faint resemblance to some parts of the Paradise Lost In these he interpolated some fragments of Hog s Latin translation of that poem alledging that the mass thus fabricated was the archetype from which Milton copied six hundred seventy eight These fabrications he published from time to time in the Gentleman s Magazine and exulting in his fancied success he in seventeen fifty ventured to collect them into a pamphlet entitled An Essay on Milton s Use and Imitation of the Moderns in his Paradise Lost To this pamphlet Johnson wrote a Preface six hundred seventy nine in full persuasion of Lauder s honesty and a Postscript recommending in the most persuasive terms six hundred eighty a subscription for the relief of a grand daughter of Milton of whom he thus speaks It is yet in the power of a great people to reward the poet whose name they boast and from their alliance to whose genius they claim some kind of superiority to every other nation of the earth that poet whose works may possibly be read when every other monument of British greatness shall be obliterated to reward him not with pictures or with medals which if he sees he sees with contempt but with tokens of gratitude which he perhaps may even now consider as not unworthy the regard of an immortal spirit Page two hundred thirty one Johnson s admiration of Milton AEtat forty two Surely this is inconsistent with enmity towards Milton which Sir John Hawkins six hundred eighty one imputes to Johnson upon this occasion adding I could all along observe that Johnson seemed to approve not only of the design but of the argument and seemed to exult in a persuasion that the reputation of Milton was likely to suffer by this discovery That he was not privy to the imposture I am well persuaded but that he wished well to the argument may be inferred from the Preface which indubitably was written by Johnson Is it possible for any man of clear judgement to suppose that Johnson who so nobly praised the poetical excellence of Milton in a Postscript to this very discovery as he then supposed it could at the same time exult in a persuasion that the great poet s reputation was likely to suffer by it This is an inconsistency of which Johnson was incapable nor can any thing more be fairly inferred from the Preface than that Johnson who was alike distinguished for ardent curiosity and love of truth was pleased with an investigation by which both were gratified That he was actuated by these motives and certainly by no unworthy desire to depreciate our great epick poet is evident from his own words for after mentioning the general zeal of men of genius and literature to advance the honour and distinguish the beauties of Paradise Lost he says Among the inquiries to which this ardour of criticism has naturally given occasion none is more obscure in itself or more worthy of rational curiosity than a retrospect six hundred eighty two of the progress of this mighty genius in the construction of his work a view of the fabrick gradually rising perhaps from small beginnings till its foundation rests in the centre and its turrets sparkle in the skies to trace back the structure through all its varieties to the simplicity of its first plan to find what was first projected whence the scheme was taken how it was improved by what assistance it was executed and from what stores the materials were collected whether its founder dug them from the quarries of Nature or demolished other buildings to embellish his own Is this the language of one who wished to blast the laurels of Milton six hundred eighty three Page two hundred thirty two missus Anna Williams A D seventeen fifty one Though Johnson s circumstances were at this time far from being easy his humane and charitable disposition was constantly exerting itself missus Anna Williams daughter of a very ingenious Welsh physician and a woman of more than ordinary talents and literature having come to London in hopes of being cured of a cataract in both her eyes which afterwards ended in total blindness was kindly received as a constant visitor at his house while missus Johnson lived and after her death having come under his roof in order to have an operation upon her eyes performed with more comfort to her than in lodgings she had an apartment from him during the rest of her life at all times when he had a house six hundred eighty four Page two hundred thirty three Johnson s pleasure in her company AEtat forty three Page two hundred thirty four Death of Johnson s wife A D seventeen fifty two seventeen fifty two AETAT forty three In seventeen fifty two he was almost entirely occupied with his Dictionary The last paper of his Rambler was published March two six hundred eighty five this year after which there was a cessation for some time of any exertion of his talents as an essayist But in the same year doctor Hawkesworth who was his warm admirer and a studious imitator of his style six hundred eighty six and then lived in great intimacy with him began a periodical paper entitled The Adventurer in connection with other gentlemen one of whom was Johnson s much loved friend doctor Bathurst and without doubt they received many valuable hints from his conversation most of his friends having been so assisted in the course of their works Page two hundred thirty five Communications by dreams AEtat forty three That there should be a suspension of his literary labours during a part of the year seventeen fifty two will not seem strange when it is considered that soon after closing his Rambler he suffered a loss which there can be no doubt affected him with the deepest distress six hundred eighty seven For on the seventeenth of March O S his wife died Why Sir John Hawkins should unwarrantably take upon him even to suppose that Johnson s fondness for her was dissembled meaning simulated or assumed and to assert that if it was not the case it was a lesson he had learned by rote six hundred eighty eight I cannot conceive unless it proceeded from a want of similar feelings in his own breast To argue from her being much older than Johnson or any other circumstances that he could not really love her is absurd for love is not a subject of reasoning but of feeling and therefore there are no common principles upon which one can persuade another concerning it Every man feels for himself and knows how he is affected by particular qualities in the person he admires the impressions of which are too minute and delicate to be substantiated in language The following very solemn and affecting prayer was found after doctor Johnson s decease by his servant mister Francis Barber who delivered it to my worthy friend the Reverend mister Strahan six hundred eighty nine Vicar of Islington who at my earnest request has obligingly favoured me with a copy of it which he and I compared with the original I present it to the world as an undoubted proof of a circumstance in the character of my illustrious friend which though some whose hard minds I never shall envy may attack as superstitious will I am sure endear him more to numbers of good men six hundred ninety I have an additional and that a personal motive for presenting it because it sanctions what I myself have always maintained and am fond to indulge April twenty six seventeen fifty two being after twelve at Night of the twenty fifth O Lord Governour of heaven and earth in whose hands are embodied and departed Spirits if thou hast ordained the Souls of the Dead to minister to the Living and appointed my departed Wife to have care of me grant that I may enjoy the good effects of her attention and ministration whether exercised by appearance impulses dreams six hundred ninety one or in any other manner agreeable to thy Government Forgive my presumption enlighten my ignorance and however meaner agents are employed grant me the blessed influences of thy holy Spirit through Jesus Christ our Lord Amen Page two hundred thirty six Johnson s love for his wife A D seventeen fifty two What actually followed upon this most interesting piece of devotion by Johnson we are not informed but I whom it has pleased GOD to afflict in a similar manner to that which occasioned it have certain experience of benignant communication by dreams six hundred ninety two That his love for his wife was of the most ardent kind and during the long period of fifty years was unimpaired by the lapse of time is evident from various passages in the series of his Prayers and Meditations published by the Reverend mister Strahan as well as from other memorials two of which I select as strongly marking the tenderness and sensibility of his mind March twenty eight seventeen fifty three I kept this day six hundred ninety three as the anniversary of my Tetty s death six hundred ninety four with prayer and tears in the morning In the evening I prayed for her conditionally if it were lawful Page two hundred thirty seven Her wedding ring AEtat forty three April twenty three seventeen fifty three I know not whether I do not too much indulge the vain longings of affection but I hope they intenerate my heart and that when I die like my Tetty this affection will be acknowledged in a happy interview and that in the mean time I am incited by it to piety I will however not deviate too much from common and received methods of devotion Her wedding ring when she became his wife was after her death preserved by him as long as he lived with an affectionate care in a little round wooden box in the inside of which he pasted a slip of paper thus inscribed by him in fair characters as follows Eheu Eliz Johnson Nupta Jul nine deg seventeen thirty six Mortua eheu Mart seventeen deg seventeen fifty two six hundred ninety five After his death mister Francis Barber his faithful servant and residuary legatee offered this memorial of tenderness to missus Lucy Porter missus Johnson s daughter but she having declined to accept of it he had it enamelled as a mourning ring for his old master and presented it to his wife missus Barber who now has it The state of mind in which a man must be upon the death of a woman whom he sincerely loves had been in his contemplation many years before In his Irene we find the following fervent and tender speech of Demetrius addressed to his Aspasia From those bright regions of eternal day Where now thou shin saint amongst thy fellow saints Array d in purer light look down on me In pleasing visions and delusive dreams O sooth my soul and teach me how to lose thee six hundred ninety six Page two hundred thirty eight The shock of separation A D seventeen fifty two I have indeed been told by missus Desmoulins who before her marriage lived for some time with missus Johnson at Hampstead six hundred ninety seven that she indulged herself in country air and nice living at an unsuitable expense six hundred ninety eight while her husband was drudging in the smoke of London and that she by no means treated him with that complacency which is the most engaging quality in a wife But all this is perfectly compatible with his fondness for her especially when it is remembered that he had a high opinion of her understanding and that the impressions which her beauty real or imaginary had originally made upon his fancy being continued by habit had not been effaced though she herself was doubtless much altered for the worse The dreadful shock of separation took place in the night and he immediately dispatched a letter to his friend the Reverend doctor Taylor which as Taylor told me expressed grief in the strongest manner he had ever read so that it is much to be regretted it has not been preserved six hundred ninety nine The letter was brought to doctor Taylor at his house in the Cloisters Westminster about three in the morning and as it signified an earnest desire to see him he got up and went to Johnson as soon as he was dressed and found him in tears and in extreme agitation After being a little while together Johnson requested him to join with him in prayer He then prayed extempore as did doctor Taylor and thus by means of that piety which was ever his primary object his troubled mind was in some degree soothed and composed The next day he wrote as follows To The Revernd doctor Taylor Dear Sir Let me have your company and instruction Do not live away from me My distress is great Pray desire missus Taylor to inform me what mourning I should buy for my mother and Miss Porter and bring a note in writing with you Remember me in your prayers for vain is the help of man I am dear Sir c SAM JOHNSON March eighteen seventeen fifty two Page two hundred thirty nine Francis Barber AEtat forty three Page two hundred forty Prayers for the dead A D seventeen fifty two That his sufferings upon the death of his wife were severe beyond what are commonly endured I have no doubt from the information of many who were then about him to none of whom I give more credit than to mister Francis Barber his faithful negro servant seven hundred who came into his family about a fortnight after the dismal event These sufferings were aggravated by the melancholy inherent in his constitution and although he probably was not oftener in the wrong than she was in the little disagreements which sometimes troubled his married state seven hundred one during which he owned to me that the gloomy irritability of his existence was more painful to him than ever he might very naturally after her death be tenderly disposed to charge himself with slight omissions and offences the sense of which would give him much uneasiness seven hundred two Accordingly we find about a year after her decease that he thus addressed the Supreme Being O LORD who givest the grace of repentance and hearest the prayers of the penitent grant that by true contrition I may obtain forgiveness of all the sins committed and of all duties neglected in my union with the wife whom thou hast taken from me for the neglect of joint devotion patient exhortation and mild instruction seven hundred three The kindness of his heart notwithstanding the impetuosity of his temper is well known to his friends and I cannot trace the smallest foundation for the following dark and uncharitable assertion by Sir John Hawkins The apparition of his departed wife was altogether of the terrifick kind and hardly afforded him a hope that she was in a state of happiness seven hundred four That he in conformity with the opinion of many of the most able learned and pious Christians in all ages supposed that there was a middle state after death previous to the time at which departed souls are finally received to eternal felicity appears I think unquestionably from his devotions seven hundred five And O LORD so far as it may be lawful in me seven hundred six I commend to thy fatherly goodness the soul of my departed wife beseeching thee to grant her whatever is best in her present state and finally to receive her to eternal happiness seven hundred seven But this state has not been looked upon with horrour but only as less gracious Page two hundred forty one The funeral sermon on missus Johnson AEtat forty three He deposited the remains of missus Johnson in the church of Bromley in Kent seven hundred eight to which he was probably led by the residence of his friend Hawkesworth at that place The funeral sermon which he composed for her which was never preached but having been given to doctor Taylor has been published since his death seven hundred nine is a performance of uncommon excellence and full of rational and pious comfort to such as are depressed by that severe affliction which Johnson felt when he wrote it When it is considered that it was written in such an agitation of mind and in the short interval between her death and burial it cannot be read without wonder seven hundred ten From mister Francis Barber I have had the following authentick and artless account of the situation in which he found him recently after his wife s death Page two hundred forty two Johnson s friends in seventeen fifty two He was in great affliction missus Williams was then living in his house which was in Gough square He was busy with the Dictionary mister Shiels and some others of the gentlemen who had formerly written for him used to come about him He had then little for himself but frequently sent money to mister Shiels when in distress seven hundred eleven The friends who visited him at that time were chiefly doctor Bathurst seven hundred twelve and mister Diamond an apothecary in Cork street Burlington gardens with whom he and missus Williams generally dined every Sunday There was a talk of his going to Iceland with him which would probably have happened had he lived There were also mister Cave doctor Hawkesworth mister Ryland seven hundred thirteen merchant on Tower Hill missus Masters the poetess seven hundred fourteen who lived with mister Cave missus Carter and sometimes missus Macaulay seven hundred fifteen also missus Gardiner wife of a tallow chandler on Snow hill not in the learned way but a worthy good woman seven hundred sixteen mister now Sir Joshua Reynolds seven hundred seventeen mister Millar mister Dodsley mister Bouquet mister Payne of Paternoster row booksellers mister Strahan the printer the Earl of Orrery seven hundred eighteen Lord Southwell seven hundred nineteen mister Garrick Page two hundred forty three Robert Levet AEtat forty three Many are no doubt omitted in this catalogue of his friends and in particular his humble friend mister Robert Levet an obscure practiser in physick amongst the lower people his fees being sometimes very small sums sometimes whatever provisions his patients could afford him but of such extensive practice in that way that missus Williams has told me his walk was from Hounsditch to Marybone It appears from Johnson s diary that their acquaintance commenced about the year seventeen forty six and such was Johnson s predilection for him and fanciful estimation of his moderate abilities that I have heard him say he should not be satisfied though attended by all the College of Physicians unless he had mister Levet with him Ever since I was acquainted with doctor Johnson and many years before as I have been assured by those who knew him earlier mister Levet had an apartment in his house or his chambers and waited upon him every morning through the whole course of his late and tedious breakfast He was of a strange grotesque appearance stiff and formal in his manner and seldom said a word while any company was present seven hundred twenty Page two hundred forty four Sir Joshua Reynolds A D seventeen fifty two Page two hundred forty five One of doctor Johnson s school AEtat forty three The circle of his friends indeed at this time was extensive and various far beyond what has been generally imagined To trace his acquaintance with each particular person if it could be done would be a task of which the labour would not be repaid by the advantage But exceptions are to be made one of which must be a friend so eminent as Sir Joshua Reynolds who was truly his dulce decus seven hundred twenty one and with whom he maintained an uninterrupted intimacy to the last hour of his life When Johnson lived in Castle street Cavendish square he used frequently to visit two ladies who lived opposite to him Miss Cotterells daughters of Admiral Cotterell Reynolds used also to visit there and thus they met seven hundred twenty two mister Reynolds as I have observed above seven hundred twenty three had from the first reading of his Life of Savage conceived a very high admiration of Johnson s powers of writing His conversation no less delighted him and he cultivated his acquaintance with the laudable zeal of one who was ambitious of general improvement seven hundred twenty four Sir Joshua indeed was lucky enough at their very first meeting to make a remark which was so much above the common place style of conversation that Johnson at once perceived that Reynolds had the habit of thinking for himself The ladies were regretting the death of a friend to whom they owed great obligations upon which Reynolds observed You have however the comfort of being relieved from a burthen of gratitude seven hundred twenty five They were shocked a little at this alleviating suggestion as too selfish but Johnson defended it in his clear and forcible manner and was much pleased with the mind the fair view of human nature which it exhibited like some of the reflections of Rochefaucault The consequence was that he went home with Reynolds and supped with him Page two hundred forty six The Miss Cotterells A D seventeen fifty two Sir Joshua told me a pleasant characteristical anecdote of Johnson about the time of their first acquaintance When they were one evening together at the Miss Cotterells the then Duchess of Argyle and another lady of high rank came in Johnson thinking that the Miss Cotterells were too much engrossed by them and that he and his friend were neglected as low company of whom they were somewhat ashamed grew angry and resolving to shock their supposed pride by making their great visitors imagine that his friend and he were low indeed he addressed himself in a loud tone to mister Reynolds saying How much do you think you and I could get in a week if we were to work as hard as we could as if they had been common mechanicks seven hundred twenty six Page two hundred forty seven Bennet Langton AEtat forty three His acquaintance with Bennet Langton esquire of Langton in Lincolnshire another much valued friend commenced soon after the conclusion of his Rambler which that gentleman then a youth had read with so much admiration that he came to London chiefly with the view of endeavouring to be introduced to its authour seven hundred twenty seven By a fortunate chance he happened to take lodgings in a house where mister Levet frequently visited and having mentioned his wish to his landlady she introduced him to mister Levet who readily obtained Johnson s permission to bring mister Langton to him seven hundred twenty eight as indeed Johnson during the whole course of his life had no shyness real or affected but was easy of access to all who were properly recommended and even wished to see numbers at his levee seven hundred twenty nine as his morning circle of company might with strict propriety be called mister Langton was exceedingly surprised when the sage first appeared He had not received the smallest intimation of his figure dress or manner From perusing his writings he fancied he should see a decent well drest in short a remarkably decorous philosopher Instead of which down from his bedchamber about noon came as newly risen a huge uncouth figure with a little dark wig which scarcely covered his head and his clothes hanging loose about him But his conversation was so rich so animated and so forcible and his religious and political notions so congenial with those in which Langton had been educated that he conceived for him that veneration and attachment which he ever preserved Johnson was not the less ready to love mister Langton for his being of a very ancient family for I have heard him say with pleasure Langton Sir has a grant of free warren from Henry the Second and Cardinal Stephen Langton in King John s reign was of this family seven hundred thirty Page two hundred forty eight Topham Beauclerk A D seventeen fifty two mister Langton afterwards went to pursue his studies at Trinity College Oxford where he formed an acquaintance with his fellow student mister Topham Beauclerk seven hundred thirty one who though their opinions and modes of life were so different that it seemed utterly improbable that they should at all agree had so ardent a love of literature so acute an understanding such elegance of manners and so well discerned the excellent qualities of mister Langton a gentleman eminent not only for worth and learning but for an inexhaustible fund of entertaining conversation seven hundred thirty two that they became intimate friends Page two hundred forty nine Topham Beauclerk AEtat forty three Johnson soon after this acquaintance began passed a considerable time at Oxford seven hundred thirty three He at first thought it strange that Langton should associate so much with one who had the character of being loose both in his principles and practice but by degrees he himself was fascinated mister Beauclerk s being of the saint Alban s family and having in some particulars a resemblance to Charles the Second contributed in Johnson s imagination to throw a lustre upon his other qualities seven hundred thirty four and in a short time the moral pious Johnson and the gay dissipated Beauclerk were companions What a coalition said Garrick when he heard of this I shall have my old friend to bail out of the Round house seven hundred thirty five But I can bear testimony that it was a very agreeable association Beauclerk was too polite and valued learning and wit too much to offend Johnson by sallies of infidelity or licentiousness and Johnson delighted in the good qualities of Beauclerk and hoped to correct the evil Innumerable were the scenes in which Johnson was amused by these young men Beauclerk could take more liberty with him than any body with whom I ever saw him but on the other hand Beauclerk was not spared by his respectable companion when reproof was proper Beauclerk had such a propensity to satire that at one time Johnson said to him You never open your mouth but with intention to give pain and you have often given me pain not from the power of what you said but from seeing your intention At another time applying to him with a slight alteration a line of Pope he said Thy love of folly and thy scorn of fools seven hundred thirty six Every thing thou dost shews the one and every thing thou say saint the other At another time he said to him Thy body is all vice and thy mind all virtue Beauclerk not seeming to relish the compliment Johnson said Nay Sir Alexander the Great marching in triumph into Babylon could not have desired to have had more said to him Page two hundred fifty Johnson the Idle Apprentice A D seventeen fifty two Johnson was some time with Beauclerk at his house at Windsor where he was entertained with experiments in natural philosophy seven hundred thirty seven One Sunday when the weather was very fine Beauclerk enticed him insensibly to saunter about all the morning They went into a church yard in the time of divine service and Johnson laid himself down at his ease upon one of the tomb stones Now Sir said Beauclerk you are like Hogarth s Idle Apprentice When Johnson got his pension Beauclerk said to him in the humorous phrase of Falstaff I hope you ll now purge and live cleanly like a gentleman seven hundred thirty eight Page two hundred fifty one A frisk with Beuclerk and Langton AEtat forty four One night when Beauclerk and Langton had supped at a tavern in London and sat till about three in the morning it came into their heads to go and knock up Johnson and see if they could prevail on him to join them in a ramble They rapped violently at the door of his chambers in the Temple till at last he appeared in his shirt with his little black wig on the top of his head instead of a nightcap and a poker in his hand imagining probably that some ruffians were coming to attack him When he discovered who they were and was told their errand he smiled and with great good humour agreed to their proposal What is it you you dogs I ll have a frisk with you He was soon drest and they sallied forth together into Covent Garden where the greengrocers and fruiterers were beginning to arrange their hampers just come in from the country Johnson made some attempts to help them but the honest gardeners stared so at his figure and manner and odd interference that he soon saw his services were not relished They then repaired to one of the neighbouring taverns and made a bowl of that liquor called Bishop seven hundred thirty nine which Johnson had always liked while in joyous contempt of sleep from which he had been roused he repeated the festive lines Short O short then be thy reign And give us to the world again seven hundred forty They did not stay long but walked down to the Thames took a boat and rowed to Billingsgate Beauclerk and Johnson were so well pleased with their amusement that they resolved to persevere in dissipation for the rest of the day but Langton deserted them being engaged to breakfast with some young Ladies Johnson scolded him for leaving his social friends to go and sit with a set of wretched un idea d girls Garrick being told of this ramble said to him smartly I heard of your frolick t other night You ll be in the Chronicle Upon which Johnson afterwards observed He durst not do such a thing His wife would not let him Page two hundred fifty two The Adventurer A D seventeen fifty three seventeen fifty three AETAT forty four He entered upon this year seventeen fifty three with his usual piety as appears from the following prayer which I transcribed from that part of his diary which he burnt a few days before his death seven hundred forty one Jan one seventeen fifty three N S which I shall use for the future Almighty God who hast continued my life to this day grant that by the assistance of thy Holy Spirit I may improve the time which thou shall grant me to my eternal salvation Make me to remember to thy glory thy judgements and thy mercies Make me so to consider the loss of my wife whom thou hast taken from me that it may dispose me by thy grace to lead the residue of my life in thy fear Grant this O LORD for JESUS CHRIST S sake Amen He now relieved the drudgery of his Dictionary and the melancholy of his grief by taking an active part in the composition of The Adventurer in which he began to write April ten seven hundred forty two marking his essays with the signature T seven hundred forty three by which most of his papers in that collection are distinguished those however which have that signature and also that of Mysargyrus were not written by him but as I suppose by doctor Bathurst Indeed Johnson s energy of thought and richness of language are still more decisive marks than any signature As a proof of this my readers I imagine will not doubt that Number thirty nine on sleep is his for it not only has the general texture and colour of his style but the authours with whom he was peculiarly conversant are readily introduced in it in cursory allusion The translation of a passage in Statius seven hundred forty four quoted in that paper and marked C B has been erroneously ascribed to doctor Bathurst whose Christian name was Richard How much this amiable man actually contributed to The Adventurer cannot be known Let me add that Hawkesworth s imitations of Johnson are sometimes so happy that it is extremely difficult to distinguish them with certainty from the compositions of his great archetype Hawkesworth was his closest imitator a circumstance of which that writer would once have been proud to be told though when he had become elated by having risen into some degree of consequence he in a conversation with me had the provoking effrontery to say he was not sensible of it seven hundred forty five Page two hundred fifty three A letter to doctor Warton AEtat forty four Johnson was truly zealous for the success of The Adventurer and very soon after his engaging in it he wrote the following letter TO THE REVEREND doctor JOSEPH WARTON DEAR SIR I ought to have written to you before now but I ought to do many things which I do not nor can I indeed claim any merit from this letter for being desired by the authours and proprietor of The Adventurer to look out for another hand my thoughts necessarily fixed upon you whose fund of literature will enable you to assist them with very little interruption of your studies They desire you to engage to furnish one paper a month at two guineas a paper which you may very readily perform We have considered that a paper should consist of pieces of imagination pictures of life and disquisitions of literature The part which depends on the imagination is very well supplied as you will find when you read the paper for descriptions of life there is now a treaty almost made with an authour and an authouress and the province of criticism and literature they are very desirous to assign to the commentator on Virgil I hope this proposal will not be rejected and that the next post will bring us your compliance I speak as one of the fraternity though I have no part in the paper beyond now and then a motto but two of the writers are my particular friends and I hope the pleasure of seeing a third united to them will not be denied to dear Sir Your most obedient And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON March eight seventeen fifty three The consequence of this letter was doctor Warton s enriching the collection with several admirable essays Page two hundred fifty four Bathurst s papers in the Adventurer A D seventeen fifty three Johnson s saying I have no part in the paper beyond now and then a motto may seem inconsistent with his being the authour of the papers marked T But he had at this time written only one number seven hundred forty six and besides even at any after period he might have used the same expression considering it as a point of honour not to own them for missus Williams told me that as he had given those Essays to doctor Bathurst who sold them at two guineas each he never would own them nay he used to say he did not write them but the fact was that he dictated them while Bathurst wrote I read to him missus Williams s account he smiled and said nothing seven hundred forty seven Page two hundred fifty five missus Lennox AEtat forty five I am not quite satisfied with the casuistry by which the productions of one person are thus passed upon the world for the productions of another I allow that not only knowledge but powers and qualities of mind may be communicated but the actual effect of individual exertion never can be transferred with truth to any other than its own original cause One person s child may be made the child of another person by adoption as among the Romans or by the ancient Jewish mode of a wife having children born to her upon her knees by her handmaid But these were children in a different sense from that of nature It was clearly understood that they were not of the blood of their nominal parents So in literary children an authour may give the profits and fame of his composition to another man but cannot make that other the real authour A Highland gentleman a younger branch of a family once consulted me if he could not validly purchase the Chieftainship of his family from the Chief who was willing to sell it I told him it was impossible for him to acquire by purchase a right to be a different person from what he really was for that the right of Chieftainship attached to the blood of primogeniture and therefore was incapable of being transferred I added that though Esau sold his birth right or the advantages belonging to it he still remained the first born of his parents and that whatever agreement a Chief might make with any of the clan the Herald s Office could not admit of the metamorphosis or with any decency attest that the younger was the elder but I did not convince the worthy gentleman Johnson s papers in The Adventurer are very similar to those of The Rambler but being rather more varied in their subjects and being mixed with essays by other writers upon topicks more generally attractive than even the most elegant ethical discourses the sale of the work at first was more extensive Without meaning however to depreciate The Adventurer I must observe that as the value of The Rambler came in the progress of time to be better known it grew upon the publick estimation and that its sale has far exceeded that of any other periodical papers since the reign of Queen Anne In one of the books of his diary I find the following entry Apr three seventeen fifty three I began the second vol of my Dictionary room being left in the first for Preface Grammar and History none of them yet begun O GOD who hast hitherto supported me enable me to proceed in this labour and in the whole task of my present state that when I shall render up at the last day an account of the talent committed to me I may receive pardon for the sake of JESUS CHRIST Amen He this year favoured missus Lennox seven hundred forty eight with a Dedication to the Earl of Orrery of her Shakspeare Illustrated Page two hundred fifty six The Life of Edward Cave A D seventeen fifty four seventeen fifty four AETAT forty five IN seventeen fifty four I can trace nothing published by him except his numbers of The Adventurer and The Life of Edward Cave in the Gentleman s Magazine for February In biography there can be no question that he excelled beyond all who have attempted that species of composition upon which indeed he set the highest value To the minute selection of characteristical circumstances for which the ancients were remarkable he added a philosophical research and the most perspicuous and energetick language Cave was certainly a man of estimable qualities and was eminently diligent and successful in his own business seven hundred forty nine which doubtless entitled him to respect But he was peculiarly fortunate in being recorded by Johnson who of the narrow life of a printer and publisher without any digressions or adventitious circumstances has made an interesting and agreeable narrative seven hundred fifty The Dictionary we may believe afforded Johnson full occupation this year As it approached to its conclusion he probably worked with redoubled vigour as seamen increase their exertion and alacrity when they have a near prospect of their haven Page two hundred fifty seven Lord Chesterfield s neglect Page two hundred fifty eight Lord Chesterfield s flattery A D seventeen fifty four Lord Chesterfield to whom Johnson had paid the high compliment of addressing to his Lordship the Plan of his Dictionary had behaved to him in such a manner as to excite his contempt and indignation The world has been for many years amused with a story confidently told and as confidently repeated with additional circumstances seven hundred fifty one that a sudden disgust was taken by Johnson upon occasion of his having been one day kept long in waiting in his Lordship s antechamber for which the reason assigned was that he had company with him and that at last when the door opened out walked Colley Gibber and that Johnson was so violently provoked when he found for whom he had been so long excluded that he went away in a passion and never would return I remember having mentioned this story to George Lord Lyttelton who told me he was very intimate with Lord Chesterfield and holding it as a well known truth defended Lord Chesterfield by saying that Gibber who had been introduced familiarly by the back stairs had probably not been there above ten minutes It may seem strange even to entertain a doubt concerning a story so long and so widely current and thus implicitly adopted if not sanctioned by the authority which I have mentioned but Johnson himself assured me that there was not the least foundation for it He told me that there never was any particular incident which produced a quarrel between Lord Chesterfield and him but that his Lordship s continued neglect was the reason why he resolved to have no connection with him seven hundred fifty two When the Dictionary was upon the eve of publication Lord Chesterfield who it is said had flattered himself with expectations that Johnson would dedicate the work to him seven hundred fifty three attempted in a courtly manner to sooth and insinuate himself with the Sage conscious as it should seem of the cold indifference with which he had treated its learned authour and further attempted to conciliate him by writing two papers in The World seven hundred fifty four in recommendation of the work and it must be confessed that they contain some studied compliments so finely turned that if there had been no previous offence it is probable that Johnson would have been highly delighted seven hundred fifty five Praise in general was pleasing to him but by praise from a man of rank and elegant accomplishments he was peculiarly gratified His Lordship says I think the publick in general and the republick of letters in particular are greatly obliged to mister Johnson for having undertaken and executed so great and desirable a work Perfection is not to be expected from man but if we are to judge by the various works of Johnson seven hundred fifty six already published we have good reason to believe that he will bring this as near to perfection as any man could do The Plan of it which he published some years ago seems to me to be a proof of it Nothing can be more rationally imagined or more accurately and elegantly expressed I therefore recommend the previous perusal of it to all those who intend to buy the Dictionary and who I suppose are all those who can afford it It must be owned that our language is at present in a state of anarchy and hitherto perhaps it may not have been the worse for it During our free and open trade many words and expressions have been imported adopted and naturalized from other languages which have greatly enriched our own Let it still preserve what real strength and beauty it may have borrowed from others but let it not like the Tarpeian maid be overwhelmed and crushed by unnecessary ornaments seven hundred fifty seven The time for discrimination seems to be now come Page two hundred fifty nine Lord Chesterfield s flattery AEtat forty five Toleration adoption and naturalization have run their lengths Good order and authority are now necessary But where shall we find them and at the same time the obedience due to them We must have recourse to the old Roman expedient in times of confusion and chuse a dictator Upon this principle I give my vote for mister Johnson to fill that great and arduous post And I hereby declare that I make a total surrender of all my rights and privileges in the English language as a free born British subject to the said mister Johnson during the term of his dictatorship Nay more I will not only obey him like an old Roman as my dictator but like a modern Roman I will implicitly believe in him as my Pope and hold him to be infallible while in the chair but no longer More than this he cannot well require for I presume that obedience can never be expected when there is neither terrour to enforce nor interest to invite it But a Grammar a Dictionary and a History of our Language through its several stages were still wanting at home and importunately called for from abroad mister Johnson s labours will now I dare say seven hundred fifty eight very fully supply that want and greatly contribute to the farther spreading of our language in other countries Learners were discouraged by finding no standard to resort to and consequently thought it incapable of any They will now be undeceived and encouraged This courtly device failed of its effect seven hundred fifty nine Johnson who thought that all was false and hollow seven hundred sixty despised the honeyed words and was even indignant that Lord Chesterfield should for a moment imagine that he could be the dupe of such an artifice His expression to me concerning Lord Chesterfield upon this occasion was Sir after making great professions seven hundred sixty one he had for many years taken no notice of me but when my Dictionary was coming out he fell a scribbling in The World about it Upon which I wrote him a letter expressed in civil terms but such as might shew him that I did not mind what he said or wrote and that I had done with him seven hundred sixty two Page two hundred sixty Johnson s spelling A D seventeen fifty four This is that celebrated letter of which so much has been said and about which curiosity has been so long excited without being gratified I for many years solicited Johnson to favour me with a copy of it seven hundred sixty three that so excellent a composition might not be lost to posterity He delayed from time to time to give it me seven hundred sixty four till at last in seventeen eighty one when we were on a visit at mister Dilly s at Southill in Bedfordshire he was pleased to dictate it to me from memory seven hundred sixty five He afterwards found among his papers a copy of it which he had dictated to mister Baretti with its title and corrections in his own handwriting This he gave to mister Langton adding that if it were to come into print he wished it to be from that copy By mister Langton s kindness I am enabled to enrich my work with a perfect transcript seven hundred sixty six of what the world has so eagerly desired to see Page two hundred sixty one Johnson s letter to Lord Chesterfield AEtat forty five TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF CHESTERFIELD February seven seventeen fifty five MY LORD I have been lately informed by the proprietor of the World that two papers in which my Dictionary is recommended to the publick were written by your Lordship To be so distinguished is an honour which being very little accustomed to favours from the great I know not well how to receive or in what terms to acknowledge When upon some slight encouragement I first visited your Lordship I was overpowered like the rest of mankind by the enchantment of your address and could not forbear to wish that I might boast myself Le vainqueur du vainqueur de la terre seven hundred sixty seven that I might obtain that regard for which I saw the world contending but I found my attendance so little encouraged that neither pride nor modesty would suffer me to continue it When I had once addressed your Lordship in publick I had exhausted all the art of pleasing which a retired and uncourtly scholar can possess I had done all that I could and no man is well pleased to have his all neglected be it ever so little Seven years my Lord have now past since I waited in your outward rooms or was repulsed from your door during which time I have been pushing on my work through difficulties of which it is useless to complain and have brought it at last to the verge of publication without one act of assistance seven hundred sixty eight one word of encouragement or one smile of favour Such treatment I did not expect for I never had a Patron before The shepherd in Virgil grew at last acquainted with Love and found him a native of the rocks Is not a Patron my Lord one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water and when he has reached ground encumbers him with help The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours had it been early had been kind but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it till I am solitary and cannot impart it seven hundred sixty nine till I am known and do not want it I hope it is no very cynical asperity not to confess obligations where no benefit has been received or to be unwilling that the Publick should consider me as owing that to a Patron which Providence has enabled me to do for myself Page two hundred sixty three His high opinion of Warburton AEtat forty five Having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any favourer of learning seven hundred seventy I shall not be disappointed though I should conclude it if less be possible with less for I have been long wakened from that dream of hope in which I once boasted myself with so much exultation My Lord Your Lordship s most humble Most obedient servant SAM JOHNSON seven hundred seventy one While this was the talk of the town says doctor Adams in a letter to me I happened to visit doctor Warburton who finding that I was acquainted with Johnson desired me earnestly to carry his compliments to him and to tell him that he honoured him for his manly behaviour in rejecting these condescensions of Lord Chesterfield and for resenting the treatment he had received from him with a proper spirit Johnson was visibly pleased with this compliment for he had always a high opinion of Warburton seven hundred seventy two Indeed the force of mind which appeared in this letter was congenial with that which Warburton himself amply possessed seven hundred seventy three Page two hundred sixty four For garret read patron A D seventeen fifty four There is a curious minute circumstance which struck me in comparing the various editions of Johnson s imitations of Juvenal In the tenth Satire one of the couplets upon the vanity of wishes even for literary distinction stood thus Yet think seven hundred seventy four what ills the scholar s life assail Pride seven hundred seventy five envy want the garret and the jail But after experiencing the uneasiness which Lord Chesterfield s fallacious patronage made him feel he dismissed the word garret from the sad group and in all the subsequent editions the line stands Pride envy want the Patron seven hundred seventy six and the jail Page two hundred sixty five Defensive pride AEtat forty five That Lord Chesterfield must have been mortified by the lofty contempt and polite yet keen satire with which Johnson exhibited him to himself in this letter it is impossible to doubt He however with that glossy duplicity which was his constant study affected to be quite unconcerned doctor Adams mentioned to mister Robert Dodsley that he was sorry Johnson had written his letter to Lord Chesterfield Dodsley with the true feelings of trade said he was very sorry too for that he had a property in the Dictionary to which his Lordship s patronage might have been of consequence He then told doctor Adams that Lord Chesterfield had shewn him the letter I should have imagined replied doctor Adams that Lord Chesterfield would have concealed it Poh said Dodsley do you think a letter from Johnson could hurt Lord Chesterfield Not at all Sir It lay upon his table where any body might see it He read it to me said this man has great powers pointed out the severest passages and observed how well they were expressed This air of indifference which imposed upon the worthy Dodsley was certainly nothing but a specimen of that dissimulation which Lord Chesterfield inculcated as one of the most essential lessons for the conduct of life seven hundred seventy seven His Lordship endeavoured to justify himself to Dodsley from the charges brought against him by Johnson but we may judge of the flimsiness of his defence from his having excused his neglect of Johnson by saying that he had heard he had changed his lodgings and did not know where he lived as if there could have been the smallest difficulty to inform himself of that circumstance by inquiring in the literary circle with which his Lordship was well acquainted and was indeed himself one of its ornaments doctor Adams expostulated with Johnson and suggested that his not being admitted when he called on him was probably not to be imputed to Lord Chesterfield for his Lordship had declared to Dodsley that he would have turned off the best servant he ever had if he had known that he denied him to a man who would have been always more than welcome and in confirmation of this he insisted on Lord Chesterfield s general affability and easiness of access especially to literary men Sir said Johnson that is not Lord Chesterfield he is the proudest man this day existing seven hundred seventy eight No said doctor Adams there is one person at least as proud I think by your own account you are the prouder man of the two But mine replied Johnson instantly was defensive pride This as doctor Adams well observed was one of those happy turns for which he was so remarkably ready Page two hundred sixty six A wit among Lords A D seventeen fifty four Johnson having now explicitly avowed his opinion of Lord Chesterfield did not refrain from expressing himself concerning that nobleman with pointed freedom This man said he I thought had been a Lord among wits but I find he is only a wit among Lords seven hundred seventy nine And when his Letters to his natural son were published he observed that they teach the morals of a whore and the manners of a dancing master seven hundred eighty Page two hundred sixty seven Chesterfield s Respectable Hottentot AEtat forty five The character of a respectable Hottentot in Lord Chesterfield s letters seven hundred eighty one has been generally understood to be meant for Johnson and I have no doubt that it was But I remember when the Literary Property of those letters was contested in the Court of Session in Scotland and mister Henry Dundas seven hundred eighty two one of the counsel for the proprietors read this character as an exhibition of Johnson Sir David Dalrymple Lord Hailes one of the Judges maintained with some warmth that it was not intended as a portrait of Johnson but of a late noble Lord distinguished for abstruse science seven hundred eighty three I have heard Johnson himself talk of the character and say that it was meant for George Lord Lyttelton in which I could by no means agree for his Lordship had nothing of that violence which is a conspicuous feature in the composition Finding that my illustrious friend could bear to have it supposed that it might be meant for him I said laughingly that there was one trait which unquestionably did not belong to him he throws his meat any where but down his throat Sir said he Lord Chesterfield never saw me eat in his life seven hundred eighty four Page two hundred sixty eight A beggarly Scotchman A D seventeen fifty four On the sixth of March came out Lord Bolingbroke s works published by mister David Mallet seven hundred eighty five The wild and pernicious ravings under the name of Philosophy which were thus ushered into the world gave great offence to all well principled men Johnson hearing of their tendency seven hundred eighty six which nobody disputed was roused with a just indignation and pronounced this memorable sentence upon the noble authour and his editor Sir he was a scoundrel and a coward seven hundred eighty seven a scoundrel for charging a blunderbuss against religion and morality a coward because he had not resolution to fire it off himself but left half a crown to a beggarly Scotchman to draw the trigger after his death seven hundred eighty eight Garrick who I can attest from my own knowledge had his mind seasoned with pious reverence and sincerely disapproved of the infidel writings of several whom in the course of his almost universal gay intercourse with men of eminence he treated with external civility distinguished himself upon this occasion mister Pelham having died on the very day on which Lord Bolingbroke s works came out he wrote an elegant Ode on his death beginning Let others hail the rising sun I bow to that whose course is run in which is the following stanza The same sad morn to Church and State So for our sins twas fix d by fate A double stroke was given Black as the whirlwinds of the North saint John s fell genius issued forth And Pelham fled to heaven seven hundred eighty nine Page two hundred seventy Thomas Warton A D seventeen fifty four Johnson this year found an interval of leisure to make an excursion to Oxford for the purpose of consulting the libraries there Of this and of many interesting circumstances concerning him during a part of his life when he conversed but little with the world I am enabled to give a particular account by the liberal communications of the Reverend mister Thomas Warton seven hundred ninety who obligingly furnished me with several of our common friend s letters which he illustrated with notes These I shall insert in their proper places To THE REVEREND mister THOMAS WARTON SIR It is but an ill return for the book with which you were pleased to favour me seven hundred ninety one to have delayed my thanks for it till now I am too apt to be negligent but I can never deliberately shew my disrespect to a man of your character and I now pay you a very honest acknowledgement for the advancement of the literature of our native country You have shewn to all who shall hereafter attempt the study of our ancient authours the way to success by directing them to the perusal of the books which those authours had read Of this method Hughes seven hundred ninety two and men much greater than Hughes seem never to have thought The reason why the authours which are yet read of the sixteenth century are so little understood is that they are read alone and no help is borrowed from those who lived with them or before them Some part of this ignorance I hope to remove by my book seven hundred ninety three which now draws towards its end but which I cannot finish to my mind without visiting the libraries at Oxford which I therefore hope to see in a fortnight seven hundred ninety four I know not how long I shall stay or where I shall lodge but shall be sure to look for you at my arrival and we shall easily settle the rest I am dear Sir Your most obedient c SAM JOHNSON London July sixteen seventeen fifty four Page two hundred seventy one Johnson s visit to Oxford AEtat forty five Of his conversation while at Oxford at this time mister Warton preserved and communicated to me the following memorial which though not written with all the care and attention which that learned and elegant writer bestowed on those compositions which he intended for the publick eye is so happily expressed in an easy style that I should injure it by any alteration When Johnson came to Oxford in seventeen fifty four seven hundred ninety five the long vacation was beginning and most people were leaving the place This was the first time of his being there after quitting the University The next morning after his arrival he wished to see his old College Pembroke I went with him He was highly pleased to find all the College servants seven hundred ninety six which he had left there still remaining particularly a very old butler seven hundred ninety seven and expressed great satisfaction at being recognised by them and conversed with them familiarly He waited on the master doctor Radcliffe who received him very coldly Johnson at least expected that the master would order a copy of his Dictionary now near publication but the master did not choose to talk on the subject never asked Johnson to dine nor even to visit him while he stayed at Oxford After we had left the lodgings Johnson said to me There lives a man who lives by the revenues of literature and will not move a finger to support it If I come to live at Oxford I shall take up my abode at Trinity We then called on the Reverend mister Meeke one of the fellows and of Johnson s standing Here was a most cordial greeting on both sides On leaving him Johnson said I used to think Meeke had excellent parts when we were boys together at the College but alas Lost in a convent s solitary gloom seven hundred ninety eight I remember at the classical lecture in the Hall I could not bear Meeke s superiority and I tried to sit as far from him as I could that I might not hear him construe Page two hundred seventy two Stories of old college days A D seventeen fifty four As we were leaving the College he said Here I translated Pope s Messiah Which do you think is the best line in it My own favourite is Vallis aromalicas fundit Saronica nubes seven hundred ninety nine I told him I thought it a very sonorous hexameter I did not tell him it was not in the Virgilian style eight hundred He much regretted that his first tutor eight hundred one was dead for whom he seemed to retain the greatest regard He said I once had been a whole morning sliding in Christ Church Meadow and missed his lecture in logick After dinner he sent for me to his room I expected a sharp rebuke for my idleness and went with a beating heart When we were seated he told me he had sent for me to drink a glass of wine with him and to tell me he was not angry with me for missing his lecture This was in fact a most severe reprimand Some more of the boys were then sent for and we spent a very pleasant afternoon Besides mister Meeke there was only one other Fellow of Pembroke now resident from both of whom Johnson received the greatest civilities during this visit and they pressed him very much to have a room in the College In the course of this visit seventeen fifty four Johnson and I walked three or four times to Ellsfield a village beautifully situated about three miles from Oxford to see mister Wise Radclivian librarian with whom Johnson was much pleased At this place mister Wise had fitted up a house and gardens in a singular manner but with great taste Here was an excellent library particularly a valuable collection of books in Northern literature with which Johnson was often very busy One day mister Wise read to us a dissertation which he was preparing for the press intitled A History and Chronology of the fabulous Ages Some old divinities of Thrace related to the Titans and called the CABIRI made a very important part of the theory of this piece and in conversation afterwards mister Wise talked much of his CABIRI As we returned to Oxford in the evening I out walked Johnson and he cried out Suffiamina a Latin word which came from his mouth with peculiar grace and was as much as to say Put on your drag chain Before we got home I again walked too fast for him and he now cried out Why you walk as if you were pursued by all the CABIRI in a body In an evening we frequently took long walks from Oxford into the country returning to supper Once in our way home we viewed the ruins of the abbies of Oseney and Rewley near Oxford After at least half an hour s silence Johnson said I viewed them with indignation eight hundred two We had then a long conversation on Gothick buildings and in talking of the form of old halls he said In these halls the fire place was anciently always in the middle of the room eight hundred three till the Whigs removed it on one side About this time there had been an execution of two or three criminals at Oxford on a Monday Soon afterwards one day at dinner I was saying that mister Swinton the chaplain of the gaol and also a frequent preacher before the University a learned man but often thoughtless and absent preached the condemnation sermon on repentance before the convicts on the preceding day Sunday and that in the close he told his audience that he should give them the remainder of what he had to say on the subject the next Lord s Day Upon which one of our company a Doctor of Divinity and a plain matter of fact man by way of offering an apology for mister Swinton gravely remarked that he had probably preached the same sermon before the University Yes Sir says Johnson but the University were not to be hanged the next morning Page two hundred seventy four reverend mister Meeke A D seventeen fifty four I forgot to observe before that when he left mister Meeke as I have told above he added About the same time of life Meeke was left behind at Oxford to feed on a Fellowship and I went to London to get my living now Sir see the difference of our literary characters The following letter was written by doctor Johnson to mister Chambers of Lincoln College afterwards Sir Robert Chambers one of the judges in India eight hundred four To mister CHAMBERS OF LINCOLN COLLEGE DEAR SIR The commission which I delayed to trouble you with at your departure I am now obliged to send you and beg that you will be so kind as to carry it to mister Warton of Trinity to whom I should have written immediately but that I know not if he be yet come back to Oxford In the Catalogue of MSS of Gr Brit see vol I

obtained for him at an early period of his life was now considered as an honour of considerable importance in order to grace the title page of his Dictionary and his character in the literary world being by this time deservedly high his friends thought that if proper exertions were made the University of Oxford would pay him the compliment eight hundred seven To THE REVEREND mister THOMAS WARTON DEAR SIR I am extremely obliged to you and to mister Wise for the uncommon care which you have taken of my interest eight hundred eight if you can accomplish your kind design I shall certainly take me a little habitation among you The books which I promised to mister Wise eight hundred nine I have not been able to procure but I shall send him a Finnick Dictionary the only copy perhaps in England which was presented me by a learned Swede but I keep it back that it may make a set of my own books eight hundred ten of the new edition with which I shall accompany it more welcome You will assure him of my gratitude Page two hundred seventy six Collins the Poet A D seventeen fifty four Poor dear Collins eight hundred eleven Would a letter give him any pleasure I have a mind to write I am glad

the end of which are a number of Eglogues so he writes it from Egloga eight hundred sixteen which are probably the first in our language If you cannot find the book I will get mister Dodsley to send it you I shall be extremely glad to hear from you again to know if the affair proceeds eight hundred seventeen I have mentioned it to none of my friends for fear of being laughed at for my

TO THE REVEREND mister THOMAS WARTON DEAR SIR I wrote to you some weeks ago but believe did not direct accurately and therefore know not whether you had my letter I would likewise write to your

know not whether the sound of bells and acclamations of the people which Ariosto talks of in his last Canto eight hundred nineteen or a general murmur of dislike I know not whether I shall find upon the coast a Calypso that will court or a Polypheme that will resist But if Polypheme comes have at his eye I hope however the criticks will let me be at peace for though I do not much fear their skill and strength I am a little afraid of myself and would not willingly feel so much ill will in my bosom as literary quarrels are apt to excite mister Baretti is about a work for which he is in great want of Crescimbeni which you may have again when you please There is nothing considerable done or doing among us here We are not perhaps as innocent as villagers but most of us seem to be as idle I

sent some time ago and if he has it not you must enquire after it However do not let your letter stay for that Your brother who is a better correspondent than you and not much better sends me word

Vice Chancellor and sent another to mister Wise but have heard from nobody since and begin to think myself forgotten It is true I sent you a double letter eight hundred thirty three and you may fear an expensive correspondent but I would have taken it kindly if you had returned it treble and what is a double letter to a petty king that having fellowship and fines can sleep without a Modus in his head eight hundred thirty four Dear mister Warton let me hear from you and tell me something I care not what so I hear it but from you Something I will tell you I hope to see my Dictionary bound and lettered next week vasta mole superbus And I have a great mind to come to Oxford at Easter but you will not invite me Shall I come uninvited or stay here where nobody perhaps would miss me if I went A hard choice But such is the world to dear Sir Your c SAM JOHNSON London March twenty seventeen fifty five Page two hundred eighty three A projected Review AEtat forty six To THE SAME DEAR SIR Though not to write when a man can write so well is an offence sufficiently heinous yet I shall pass it by I am very glad that the Vice Chancellor was pleased with my note I shall impatiently expect you at London that we may consider what to do next I intend in the winter to open a Bibliotheque and remember that you are to subscribe a sheet a year let us try likewise if we cannot persuade your brother to subscribe another My book is now coming in luminis oras eight hundred thirty five What will be its fate I know not nor think much because thinking is to no purpose It must stand the censure of the great vulgar and the small eight hundred thirty six of those that understand it and that understand it not But in all this I suffer not alone every writer has the same difficulties and perhaps every writer talks of them more than he thinks Page two hundred eighty four doctor Maty A D seventeen fifty five You will be pleased to make my compliments to all my friends and be so kind at every idle hour as to remember dear Sir Your c SAM JOHNSON London March twenty five seventeen fifty five doctor Adams told me that this scheme of a Bibliotheque was a serious one for upon his visiting him one day he found his parlour floor covered with parcels of foreign and English literary journals and he told doctor Adams he meant to undertake a Review How Sir said doctor Adams can you think of doing it alone All branches of knowledge must be considered in it Do you know Mathematicks Do you know Natural History Johnson answered Why Sir I must do as well as I can My chief purpose is to give my countrymen a view of what is doing in literature upon the continent and I shall have in a good measure the choice of my subject for I shall select such books as I best understand doctor Adams suggested that as doctor Maty had just then finished his Bibliotheque Britannique eight hundred thirty seven which was a well executed work giving foreigners an account of British publications he might with great advantage assume him as an assistant He said Johnson the little black dog I d throw him into the Thames eight hundred thirty eight The scheme however was dropped Page two hundred eighty five doctor Birch s letter AEtat forty six In one of his little memorandum books I find the following hints for his intended Review or Literary Journal The Annals of Literature foreign as welt as domestick Imitate Le Clerk Bayle Barbeyrac Infelicity of Journals in England Works of the learned We cannot take in all Sometimes copy from foreign Journalists Always tell To doctor BIRCH March twenty nine seventeen fifty five SIR I have sent some parts of my Dictionary such as were at hand for your inspection The favour which I beg is that if you do not like them you will say nothing I am Sir Your most affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON To mister SAMUEL JOHNSON Norfolk street April twenty three seventeen fifty five Sir The part of your Dictionary which you have favoured me with the sight of has given me such an idea of the whole that I most sincerely congratulate the publick upon the acquisition of a work long wanted and now executed with an industry accuracy and judgement equal to the importance of the subject You might perhaps have chosen one in which your genius would have appeared to more advantage but you could not have fixed upon any other in which your labours would have done such substantial service to the present age and to posterity I am glad that your health has supported the application necessary to the performance of so vast a task and can undertake to promise you as one though perhaps the only reward of it the approbation and thanks of every well wisher to the honour of the English language I am with the greatest regard Sir Your most faithful and Most affectionate humble servant THO BIRCH mister Charles Burney who has since distinguished himself so much in the science of Musick and obtained a Doctor s degree from the University of Oxford had been driven from the capital by bad health and was now residing at Lynne Regis in Norfolk eight hundred thirty nine He had been so much delighted with Johnson s Rambler and the Plan of his Dictionary that when the great work was announced in the news papers as nearly finished he wrote to doctor Johnson begging to be informed when and in what manner his Dictionary would be published intreating if it should be by subscription or he should have any books at his own disposal to be favoured with six copies for himself and friends Page two hundred eighty six Johnson s letter to mister Burney A D seventeen fifty five In answer to this application doctor Johnson wrote the following letter of which to use doctor Burney s own words if it be remembered that it was written to an obscure young man who at this time had not much distinguished himself even in his own profession but whose name could never have reached the authour of The Rambler the politeness and urbanity may be opposed to some of the stories which have been lately circulated of doctor Johnson s natural rudeness and ferocity To mister BURNKY IN LYNNE REGIS NORFOLK SIR If you imagine that by delaying my answer I intended to shew any neglect of the notice with which you have favoured me you will neither think justly of yourself nor of me Your civilities were offered with too much elegance not to engage attention and I have too much pleasure in pleasing men like you not to feel very sensibly the distinction which you have bestowed upon me Few consequences of my endeavours to please or to benefit mankind have delighted me more than your friendship thus voluntarily offered which now I have it I hope to keep because I hope to continue to deserve it I have no Dictionaries to dispose of for myself but shall be glad to have you direct your friends to mister Dodsley because it was by his recommendation that I was employed in the work When you have leisure to think again upon me let me be favoured with another letter and another yet when you have looked into my Dictionary If you find faults I shall endeavour to mend them if you find none I shall think you blinded by kind partiality but to have made you partial in his favour will very much gratify the ambition of Sir Your most obliged And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Cough square Fleet street April eight seventeen fifty five Page two hundred eighty seven Andrew Millar AEtat forty six mister Andrew Millar bookseller in the Strand took the principal charge of conducting the publication of Johnson s Dictionary and as the patience of the proprietors was repeatedly tried and almost exhausted by their expecting that the work would be completed within the time which Johnson had sanguinely supposed the learned authour was often goaded to dispatch more especially as he had received all the copy money by different drafts a considerable time before he had finished his task eight hundred forty When the messenger who carried the last sheet to Millar returned Johnson asked him Well what did he say Sir answered the messenger he said thank GOD I have done with him I am glad replied Johnson with a smile that he thanks GOD for any thing eight hundred forty one It is remarkable that those with whom Johnson chiefly contracted for his literary labours were Scotchmen mister Millar and mister Strahan Millar though himself no great judge of literature had good sense enough to have for his friends very able men to give him their opinion and advice in the purchase of copyright the consequence of which was his acquiring a very large fortune with great liberality eight hundred forty two Johnson said of him I respect Millar Sir he has raised the price of literature The same praise may be justly given to Panckoucke the eminent bookseller of Paris mister Strahan s liberality judgement and success are well known Page two hundred eighty eight An Excursion to Langton deferred A D seventeen fifty five To BENNET LANGTON esquire AT LANGTON NEAR SPILSBY LINCOLNSHIRE SIR It has been long observed that men do not suspect faults which they do not commit your own elegance of manners and punctuality of complaisance did not suffer you to impute to me that negligence of which I was guilty and which I have not since atoned I received both your letters and received them with pleasure proportionate to the esteem which so short an acquaintance strongly impressed and which I hope to confirm by nearer knowledge though I am afraid that gratification will be for a time withheld I have indeed published my Book eight hundred forty three of which I beg to know your father s judgement and yours and I have now staid long enough to watch its progress into the world It has you see no patrons and I think has yet had no opponents except the criticks of the coffee house whose outcries are soon dispersed into the air and are thought on no more from this therefore I am at liberty and think of taking the opportunity of this interval to make an excursion and why not then into Lincolnshire or to mention a stronger attraction why not to dear mister Langton I will give the true reason which I know you will approve I have a mother more than eighty years old who has counted the days to the publication of my book in hopes of seeing me and to her if I can disengage myself here I resolve to go As I know dear Sir that to delay my visit for a reason like this will not deprive me of your esteem I beg it may not lessen your kindness I have very seldom received an offer of friendship which I so earnestly desire to cultivate and mature I shall rejoice to hear from you till I can see you and will see you as soon as I can for when the duty that calls me to Lichfield is discharged my inclination will carry me to Langton I shall delight to hear the ocean roar or see the stars twinkle in the company of men to whom Nature does not spread her volumes or utter her voice in vain Do not dear Sir make the slowness of this letter a precedent for delay or imagine that I approved the incivility that I have committed for I have known you enough to love you and sincerely to wish a further knowledge and I assure you once more that to live in a house that contains such a father and such a son will be accounted a very uncommon degree of pleasure by dear Sir your most obliged and Most humble servant SAM JOHNSON May six seventeen fifty five Page two hundred eighty nine Letters to mister Warton AEtat forty six To THE REVEREND mister THOMAS WARTON DEAR SIR I am grieved that you should think me capable of neglecting your letters and beg you will never admit any such suspicion again I purpose to come down next week if you shall be there or any other week that shall be more agreeable to you Therefore let me know I can stay this visit but a week but intend to make preparations for a longer stay next time being resolved not to lose sight of the University How goes Apollonius eight hundred forty four Don t let him be forgotten Some things of this kind must be done to keep us up Pay my compliments to mister Wise and all my other friends I think to come to Kettel Hall eight hundred forty five I am Sir Your most affectionate c SAM JOHNSON London May thirteen seventeen fifty five To THE SAME DEAR SIR It is strange how many things will happen to intercept every pleasure though it be only that of two friends meeting together I have promised myself every day to inform you when you might expect me at Oxford and have not been able to fix a time The time however is I think at last come and I promise myself to repose in Kettel Hall one of the first nights of the next week I am afraid my stay with you cannot be long but what is the inference We must endeavour to make it chearful I wish your brother could meet us that we might go and drink tea with mister Wise in a body I hope he will be at Oxford or at his nest of British and Saxon antiquities eight hundred forty six I shall expect to see Spenser finished and many other things begun Dodsley is gone to visit the Dutch The Dictionary sells well eight hundred forty seven The rest of the world goes on as it did Dear Sir Page two hundred ninety Letters to mister Warton A D seventeen fifty five Your most affectionate c SAM JOHNSON London June ten seventeen fifty five TO THE SAME DEAR SIR To talk of coming to you and not yet to come has an air of trifling which I would not willingly have among you and which I believe you will not willingly impute to me when I have told you that since my promise two of our partners eight hundred forty eight are dead and that I was solicited to suspend my excursion till we could recover from our confusion I have not laid aside my purpose for every day makes me more impatient of staying from you But death you know hears not supplications nor pays any regard to the convenience of mortals I hope now to see you next week but next week is but another name for to morrow which has been noted for promising and deceiving I am c SAM JOHNSON London June twenty four seventeen fifty five To THE SAME DEAR SIR I told you that among the manuscripts are some things of Sir Thomas More I beg you to pass an hour in looking on them and procure a transcript of the ten or twenty first lines of each to be compared with what I have that I may know whether they are yet published The manuscripts are these Catalogue of Bodl MS pag one hundred twenty two F three Sir Thomas More one Fall of angels two Creation and fall of mankind three Determination of the Trinity for the rescue of mankind four Five lectures of our

bookseller to pay him what you shall think proper Be pleased to make my compliments to mister Wise and all my friends I am Sir Your affectionate c SAM JOHNSON London Aug seven seventeen fifty five Page two hundred ninety one Publication of the DICTIONARY AEtat forty six The Dictionary with a Grammar and History of the English Language being now at length published in two volumes folio the world contemplated with wonder so stupendous a work achieved by one man while other countries had thought such undertakings fit only for whole academies Vast as his powers were I cannot but think that his imagination deceived him when he supposed that by constant application he might have performed the task in three years Let the Preface be attentively perused in which is given in a clear strong and glowing style a comprehensive yet particular view of what he had done and it will be evident that the time he employed upon it was comparatively short I am unwilling to swell my book with long quotations from what is in every body s hands and I believe there are few prose compositions in the English language that are read with more delight or are more impressed upon the memory than that preliminary discourse One of its excellencies has always struck me with peculiar admiration I mean the perspicuity with which he has expressed abstract scientifick notions As an instance of this I shall quote the following sentence When the radical idea branches out into parallel ramifications how can a consecutive series be formed of senses in their own eight hundred forty nine nature collateral We have here an example of what has been often said and I believe with justice that there is for every thought a certain nice adaptation of words which none other could equal and which when a man has been so fortunate as to hit he has attained in that particular case the perfection of language Page two hundred ninety two The Preface to the Dictionary A D seventeen fifty five The extensive reading which was absolutely necessary for the accumulation of authorities and which alone may account for Johnson s retentive mind being enriched with a very large and various store of knowledge and imagery must have occupied several years The Preface furnishes an eminent instance of a double talent of which Johnson was fully conscious Sir Joshua Reynolds heard him say There are two things which I am confident I can do very well one is an introduction to any literary work stating what it is to contain and how it should be executed in the most perfect manner the other is a conclusion shewing from various causes why the execution has not been equal to what the authour promised to himself and to the publick How should puny scribblers be abashed and disappointed when they find him displaying a perfect theory of lexicographical excellence yet at the same time candidly and modestly allowing that he had not satisfied his own expectations eight hundred fifty Here was a fair occasion for the exercise of Johnson s modesty when he was called upon to compare his own arduous performance not with those of other individuals in which case his inflexible regard to truth would have been violated had he affected diffidence but with speculative perfection eight hundred fifty one as he who can outstrip all his competitors in the race may yet be sensible of his deficiency when he runs against time Well might he say that the English Dictionary was written with little assistance of the learned eight hundred fifty two for he told me that the only aid which he received was a paper containing twenty etymologies sent to him by a person then unknown who he was afterwards informed was doctor Pearce Bishop of Rochester eight hundred fifty three The etymologies though they exhibit learning and judgement are not I think entitled to the first praise amongst the various parts of this immense work The definitions have always appeared to me such astonishing proofs of acuteness of intellect and precision of language as indicate a genius of the highest rank eight hundred fifty four This it is which marks the superiour excellence of Johnson s Dictionary over others equally or even more voluminous and must have made it a work of much greater mental labour than mere Lexicons or Word books as the Dutch call them They who will make the experiment of trying how they can define a few words of whatever nature will soon be satisfied of the unquestionable justice of this observation which I can assure my readers is founded upon much study and upon communication with more minds than my own Page two hundred ninety three Erroneous definitions AEtat forty six A few of his definitions must be admitted to be erroneous Thus Windward and Leeward eight hundred fifty five though directly of opposite meaning are defined identically the same way as to which inconsiderable specks it is enough to observe that his Preface announces that he was aware there might be many such in so immense a work eight hundred fifty six nor was he at all disconcerted when an instance was pointed out to him A lady once asked him how he came to define Pastern the knee of a horse instead of making an elaborate defence as she expected he at once answered Ignorance Madam pure ignorance eight hundred fifty seven His definition of Network eight hundred fifty eight has been often quoted with sportive malignity eight hundred fifty nine as obscuring a thing in itself very plain But to these frivolous censures no other answer is necessary than that with which we are furnished by his own Preface Page two hundred ninety four Humorous definitions A D seventeen fifty five To explain requires the use of terms less abstruse than that which is to be explained and such terms cannot always be found For as nothing can be proved but by supposing something intuitively known and evident without proof so nothing can be defined but by the use of words too plain to admit of definition eight hundred sixty Sometimes easier words are changed into harder as burial into sepulture or interment dry eight hundred sixty one into desiccative dryness into siccity or aridity fit into paroxism for the easiest word whatever it be can never be translated into one more easy Page two hundred ninety five Humorous definitions His introducing his own opinions and even prejudices under general definitions of words while at the same time the original meaning of the words is not explained as his Tory eight hundred sixty two Whig eight hundred sixty three Pension eight hundred sixty four Oats eight hundred sixty five Excise eight hundred sixty six and a few more cannot be fully defended and must be placed to the account of capricious and humorous indulgence eight hundred sixty seven Talking to me upon this subject when we were at Ashbourne in seventeen seventy seven he mentioned a still stronger instance of the predominance of his private feelings in the composition of this work than any now to be found in it You know Sir Lord Gower forsook the old Jacobite interest When I came to the word Renegado after telling that it meant one who deserts to the enemy a revolter I added Sometimes we say a GOWER eight hundred sixty eight Thus it went to the press but the printer had more wit than I and struck it out Page two hundred ninety six Humorous definitions A D seventeen fifty six Let it however be remembered that this indulgence does not display itself only in sarcasm towards others but sometimes in playful allusion to the notions commonly entertained of his own laborious task Thus Grub street the name of a street in London much inhabited by writers of small histories dictionaries and temporary poems whence any mean production is called Grub street eight hundred sixty nine Lexicographer a writer of dictionaries a harmless drudge eight hundred seventy Page two hundred ninety seven The gloom of solitude AEtat forty six At the time when he was concluding his very eloquent Preface Johnson s mind appears to have been in such a state of depression eight hundred seventy one that we cannot contemplate without wonder the vigorous and splendid thoughts which so highly distinguish that performance I says he may surely be contented without the praise of perfection which if I could obtain in this gloom of solitude what would it avail me I have protracted my work till most of those whom I wished to please have sunk into the grave and success and miscarriage are empty sounds I therefore dismiss it with frigid tranquillity having little to fear or hope from censure or from praise eight hundred seventy two That this indifference was rather a temporary than an habitual feeling appears I think from his letters to mister Warton eight hundred seventy three and however he may have been affected for the moment certain it is that the honours which his great work procured him both at home and abroad were very grateful to him eight hundred seventy four His friend the Earl of Corke and Orrery being at Florence presented it to the Academia della Crusca That Academy sent Johnson their Vocabulario and the French Academy sent him their Dictionnaire which mister Langton had the pleasure to convey to him eight hundred seventy five Page two hundred ninety eight His melancholy at its meridian A D seventeen fifty five It must undoubtedly seem strange that the conclusion of his Preface should be expressed in terms so desponding when it is considered that the authour was then only in his forty sixth year But we must ascribe its gloom to that miserable dejection of spirits to which he was constitutionally subject and which was aggravated by the death of his wife two years before eight hundred seventy six I have heard it ingeniously observed by a lady of rank and elegance that his melancholy was then at its meridian eight hundred seventy seven It pleased GOD to grant him almost thirty years of life after this time and once when he was in a placid frame of mind he was obliged to own to me that he had enjoyed happier days and had many more friends since that gloomy hour than before eight hundred seventy eight Page two hundred ninety nine Johnson s happiest days last AEtat forty six It is a sad saying that most of those whom he wished to please had sunk into the grave and his case at forty five was singularly unhappy unless the circle of his friends was very narrow I have often thought that as longevity is generally desired and I believe generally expected it would be wise to be continually adding to the number of our friends that the loss of some may be supplied by others Friendship the wine of life eight hundred seventy nine should like a well stocked cellar be thus continually renewed and it is consolatory to think that although we can seldom add what will equal the generous first growths of our youth yet friendship becomes insensibly old in much less time than is commonly imagined and not many years are required to make it very mellow and pleasant Warmth will no doubt make a considerable difference Men of affectionate temper and bright fancy will coalesce a great deal sooner than those who are cold and dull Page three hundred Garrick s complimentary epigram A D seventeen fifty five The proposition which I have now endeavoured to illustrate was at a subsequent period of his life the opinion of Johnson himself He said to Sir Joshua Reynolds If a man does not make new acquaintance as he advances through life he will soon find himself left alone A man Sir should keep his friendship in constant repair The celebrated mister Wilkes whose notions and habits of life were very opposite to his but who was ever eminent for literature and vivacity sallied forth with a little Jeu d Esprit upon the following passage in his Grammar of the English Tongue prefixed to the Dictionary H seldom perhaps never begins any but the first syllable In an Essay printed in The Publick Advertiser this lively writer enumerated many instances in opposition to this remark for example The authour of this observation must be a man of a quick apprehension and of a most compre hensive genius The position is undoubtedly expressed with too much latitude This light sally we may suppose made no great impression on our Lexicographer for we find that he did not alter the passage till many years afterwards eight hundred eighty He had the pleasure of being treated in a very different manner by his old pupil mister Garrick in the following complimentary Epigram eight hundred eighty one On JOHNSON S DICTIONARY Talk of war with a Briton he ll boldly advance That one English soldier will beat ten of France Would we alter the boast from the sword to the pen Our odds are still greater still greater our men In the deep mines of science though Frenchmen may toil Can their strength be compar d to Locke Newton and Boyle Let them rally their heroes send forth all their pow rs Their verse men and prose men then match them with ours First Shakspeare and Milton eight hundred eighty two like gods in the fight Have put their whole drama and epick to flight In satires epistles and odes would they cope Their numbers retreat before Dryden and Pope And Johnson well arm d like a hero of yore Has beat forty French eight hundred eighty three and will beat forty more Page three hundred one Zachariah Williams AEtat forty six Johnson this year gave at once a proof of his benevolence quickness of apprehension and admirable art of composition in the assistance which he gave to mister Zachariah Williams father of the blind lady whom he had humanely received under his roof mister Williams had followed the profession of physick in Wales but having a very strong propensity to the study of natural philosophy had made many ingenious advances towards a discovery of the longitude and repaired to London in hopes of obtaining the great parliamentary reward eight hundred eighty four He failed of success but Johnson having made himself master of his principles and experiments wrote for him a pamphlet published in quarto with the following title An Account of an Attempt to ascertain the Longitude at Sea by an exact Theory of the Variation of the Magnetical Needle with a Table of the Variations at the most remarkable Cities in Europe from the year sixteen sixty to sixteen eighty Dagger To diffuse it more extensively it was accompanied with an Italian translation on the opposite page which it is supposed was the work of Signor Baretti eight hundred eighty five an Italian of considerable literature who having come to England a few years before had been employed in the capacity both of a language master and an authour and formed an intimacy with doctor Johnson This pamphlet Johnson presented to the Bodleian Library eight hundred eighty six On a blank leaf of it is pasted a paragraph cut out of a news paper containing an account of the death and character of Williams plainly written by Johnson eight hundred eighty seven Page three hundred two Joseph Baretti A D seventeen fifty five Page three hundred three A scheme of life for Sunday AEtat forty seven In July this year he had formed some scheme of mental improvement the particular purpose of which does not appear But we find in his Prayers and Meditations p twenty five a prayer entitled On the Study of Philosophy as an Instrument of living and after it follows a note This study was not pursued On the thirteenth of the same month he wrote in his Journal the following scheme of life for Sunday Having lived as he with tenderness of conscience expresses himself not without an habitual reverence for the Sabbath yet without that attention to its religious duties which Christianity requires one To rise early and in order to it to go to sleep early on Saturday two To use some extraordinary devotion in the morning three To examine the tenour of my life and particularly the last week and to mark my advances in religion or recession from it four To read the Scripture methodically with such helps as are at hand five To go to church twice six To read books of Divinity either speculative or practical seven To instruct my family eight To wear off by meditation any worldly soil contracted in the week seventeen fifty six AETAT forty seven In seventeen fifty six Johnson found that the great fame of his Dictionary had not set him above the necessity of making provision for the day that was passing over him eight hundred eighty eight Page three hundred four Payment for the DICTIONARY A D seventeen fifty six No royal or noble patron extended a munificent hand to give independence to the man who had conferred stability on the language of his country We may feel indignant that there should have been such unworthy neglect but we must at the same time congratulate ourselves when we consider that to this very neglect operating to rouse the natural indolence of his constitution we owe many valuable productions which otherwise perhaps might never have appeared He had spent during the progress of the work the money for which he had contracted to write his Dictionary We have seen that the reward of his labour was only fifteen hundred and seventy five pounds and when the expence of amanuenses and paper and other articles are deducted his clear profit was very inconsiderable I once said to him I am sorry Sir you did not get more for your Dictionary His answer was I am sorry too But it was very well The booksellers are generous liberal minded men eight hundred eighty nine He upon all occasions did ample justice to their character in this respect eight hundred ninety He considered them as the patrons of literature and indeed although they have eventually been considerable gainers by his Dictionary it is to them that we owe its having been undertaken and carried through at the risk of great expence for they were not absolutely sure of being indemnified Page three hundred five Johnson s opinion of booksellers AEtat forty seven On the first day of this year we find from his private devotions that he had then recovered from sickness eight hundred ninety one and in February that his eye was restored to its use eight hundred ninety two The pious gratitude with which he acknowledges mercies upon every occasion is very edifying as is the humble submission which he breathes when it is the will of his heavenly Father to try him with afflictions As such dispositions become the state of man here and are the true effects of religious discipline we cannot but venerate in Johnson one of the most exercised minds that our holy religion hath ever formed If there be any thoughtless enough to suppose such exercise the weakness of a great understanding let them look up to Johnson and be convinced that what he so earnestly practised must have a rational foundation Page three hundred six Christopher Smart A D seventeen fifty six His works this year were an abstract or epitome in octavo of his folio Dictionary and a few essays in a monthly publication entitled The Universal Visiter Christopher Smart with whose unhappy vacillation of mind he sincerely sympathised was one of the stated undertakers of this miscellany and it was to assist him that Johnson sometimes employed his pen eight hundred ninety three All the essays marked with two asterisks have been ascribed to him but I am confident from internal evidence that of these neither The Life of Chaucer Reflections on the State of Portugal nor an Essay on Architecture were written by him I am equally confident upon the same evidence that he wrote Further Thoughts on Agriculture eight hundred ninety four Dagger being the sequel of a very inferiour essay on the same subject and which though carried on as if by the same hand is both in thinking and expression so far above it and so strikingly peculiar as to leave no doubt of its true parent and that he also wrote A Dissertation on the State of Literature and Authours eight hundred ninety five Dagger and A Dissertation on the Epitaphs written by Pope Dagger The last of these indeed he afterwards added to his Idler eight hundred ninety six Why the essays truly written by him are marked in the same manner with some which he did not write I cannot explain but with deference to those who have ascribed to him the three essays which I have rejected they want all the characteristical marks of Johnsonian composition Page three hundred seven The Literary Magazine AEtat forty seven He engaged also to superintend and contribute largely to another monthly publication entitled The Literary Magazine or Universal Review the first number of which came out in May this year eight hundred ninety seven What were his emoluments from this undertaking and what other writers were employed in it I have not discovered He continued to write in it with intermissions till the fifteenth number and I think that he never gave better proofs of the force acuteness and vivacity of his mind than in this miscellany whether we consider his original essays or his reviews of the works of others The Preliminary Address Dagger to the Publick is a proof how this great man could embellish with the graces of superiour composition even so trite a thing as the plan of a magazine His original essays are An Introduction to the Political State of Great Britain eight hundred ninety eight Dagger Remarks on the Militia Bill eight hundred ninety nine Dagger Observations on his Britannick Majesty s Treaties with the Empress of Russia and the Landgrave of Hesse Cassel nine hundred Dagger Observations on the Present State of Affairs nine hundred one Dagger and Memoirs of Frederick III King of Prussia nine hundred two Dagger In all these he displays extensive political knowledge and sagacity expressed with uncommon energy and perspicuity without any of those words which he sometimes took a pleasure in adopting in imitation of Sir Thomas Browne of whose Christian Morals he this year gave an edition with his Life prefixed to it which is one of Johnson s best biographical performances In one instance only in these essays has he indulged his Brownism nine hundred three doctor Robertson the historian mentioned it to me as having at once convinced him that Johnson was the author of the Memoirs of the King of Prussia Speaking of the pride which the old King the father of his hero took in being master of the tallest regiment in Europe he says To review this towering regiment was his daily pleasure and to perpetuate it was so much his care that when he met a tall woman he immediately commanded one of his Titanian retinue to marry her that they might propagate procerity nine hundred four For this Anglo Latian word procerity Johnson had however the authority of Addison nine hundred five Page three hundred nine The earthquake of Lisbon AEtat forty seven His reviews are of the following books Birch s History of the Royal Society Dagger Murphy s Gray s Inn Journal Dagger Warton s Essay on the Writings and Genius of Pope Vol I Dagger Hampton s Translation of Polybius Dagger Blackwell s Memoirs of the Court of Augustus Dagger Russel s Natural History of Aleppo nine hundred six Dagger Sir Isaac Newton s Arguments in Proof of a Deity Dagger Borlase s History of the Isles of Scilly Dagger Home s Experiments on Bleaching Dagger Browne s Christian Morals

Jamaica Dagger Philosophical Transactions Vol XLIX Dagger missus Lennox s Translation of Sully s Memoirs Miscellanies by Elizabeth Harrison Dagger Evans s Map and Account of the Middle Colonies in America nine hundred seven Dagger Letter on the Case of Admiral Byng Appeal to the People concerning Admiral Byng Hanway s Eight Days Journey and Essay on Tea The Cadet a Military Treatise Dagger Some further Particulars in Relation to the Case of Admiral Byng by a Gentleman of Oxford The Conduct of the Ministry relating to the present War impartially examined Dagger A Free Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil All these from internal evidence were written by Johnson some of them I know he avowed and have marked them with an asterisk accordingly nine hundred eight Page three hundred ten Johnson s ardour for liberty A D seventeen fifty mister Thomas Davies indeed ascribed to him the Review of mister Burke s Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful and Sir John Hawkins with equal discernment has inserted it in his collection of Johnson s works whereas it has no resemblance to Johnson s composition and is well known to have been written by mister Murphy who has acknowledged it to me and many others It is worthy of remark in justice to Johnson s political character which has been misrepresented as abjectly submissive to power that his Observations on the present State of Affairs glow with as animated a spirit of constitutional liberty as can be found any where Thus he begins The time is now come in which every Englishman expects to be informed of the national affairs and in which he has a right to have that expectation gratified For whatever may be urged by Ministers or those whom vanity or interest make the followers of ministers concerning the necessity of confidence in our governours and the presumption of prying with profane eyes into the recesses of policy it is evident that this reverence can be claimed only by counsels yet unexecuted and projects suspended in deliberation But when a design has ended in miscarriage or success when every eye and every ear is witness to general discontent or general satisfaction it is then a proper time to disentangle confusion and illustrate obscurity to shew by what causes every event was produced and in what effects it is likely to terminate to lay down with distinct particularity what rumour always huddles in general exclamation or perplexes by indigested nine hundred nine narratives to shew whence happiness or calamity is derived and whence it may be expected and honestly to lay before the people what inquiry can gather of the past and conjecture can estimate of the future nine hundred ten Page three hundred eleven doctor Lucas AEtat forty seven Here we have it assumed as an incontrovertible principle that in this country the people are the superintendants of the conduct and measures of those by whom government is administered of the beneficial effect of which the present reign afforded an illustrious example when addresses from all parts of the kingdom controuled an audacious attempt to introduce a new power subversive of the crown nine hundred eleven A still stronger proof of his patriotick spirit appears in his review of an Essay on Waters by doctor Lucas of whom after describing him as a man well known to the world for his daring defiance of power when he thought it exerted on the side of wrong he thus speaks The Irish ministers drove him from his native country by a proclamation in which they charged him with crimes of which they never intended to be called to the proof and oppressed by methods equally irresistible by guilt and innocence Let the man thus driven into exile for having been the friend of his country be received in every other place as a confessor of liberty and let the tools of power be taught in time that they may rob but cannot impoverish nine hundred twelve Some of his reviews in this Magazine are very short accounts of the pieces noticed and I mention them only that doctor Johnson s opinion of the works may be known but many of them are examples of elaborate criticism in the most masterly style In his review of the Memoirs of the Court of Augustus he has the resolution to think and speak from his own mind regardless of the cant transmitted from age to age in praise of the ancient Romans nine hundred thirteen Thus I know not why any one but a school boy in his declamation should whine over the Common wealth of Rome which grew great only by the misery of the rest of mankind The Romans like others as soon as they grew rich grew corrupt and in their corruption sold the lives and freedoms of themselves and of one another nine hundred fourteen Page three hundred twelve doctor Watts A D seventeen fifty six Again A people who while they were poor robbed mankind and as soon as they became rich robbed one another nine hundred fifteen In his review of the Miscellanies in prose and verse published by Elizabeth Harrison but written by many hands he gives an eminent proof at once of his orthodoxy and candour The authours of the essays in prose seem generally to have imitated or tried to imitate the copiousness and luxuriance of missus Rowe nine hundred sixteen This however is not all their praise they have laboured to add to her brightness of imagery her purity of sentiments The poets have had doctor Watts before their eyes a writer who if he stood not in the first class of genius compensated that defect by a ready application of his powers to the promotion of piety The attempt to employ the ornaments of romance in the decoration of religion was I think first made by mister Boyle s Martyrdom of Theodora but Boyle s philosophical studies did not allow him time for the cultivation of style and the Completion of the great design was reserved for missus Rowe doctor Watts was one of the first who taught the Dissenters to write and speak like other men by shewing them that elegance might consist with piety nine hundred seventeen They would have both done honour to a better society nine hundred eighteen for they had that charity which might well make their failings be forgotten and with which the whole Christian world might wish for communion They were pure from all the heresies of an age to which every opinion is become a favourite that the universal church has hitherto detested Page three hundred thirteen Johnson s defence of tea AEtat forty seven This praise the general interest of mankind requires to be given to writers who please and do not corrupt who instruct and do not weary But to them all human eulogies are vain whom I believe applauded by angels and numbered with the just nine hundred nineteen Page three hundred fourteen Johnson s reply to Hanway s attack A D seventeen fifty six His defence of tea against mister Jonas Hartway s violent attack upon that elegant and popular beverage nine hundred twenty shews how very well a man of genius can write upon the slightest subject when he writes as the Italians say con amore I suppose no person ever enjoyed with more relish the infusion of that fragrant leaf than Johnson nine hundred twenty one The quantities which he drank of it at all hours were so great that his nerves must have been uncommonly strong not to have been extremely relaxed by such an intemperate use of it nine hundred twenty two He assured me that he never felt the least inconvenience from it which is a proof that the fault of his constitution was rather a too great tension of fibres than the contrary mister Hanway wrote an angry answer to Johnson s review of his Essay on Tea and Johnson after a full and deliberate pause made a reply to it the only instance I believe in the whole course of his life when he condescended to oppose any thing that was written against him nine hundred twenty three I suppose when he thought of any of his little antagonists he was ever justly aware of the high sentiment of Ajax in Ovid Iste tulit pretium jam nunc certaminis hujus Qui cum victus erit mecum certasse feretur nine hundred twenty four But indeed the good mister Hanway laid himself so open to ridicule that Johnson s animadversions upon his attack were chiefly to make sport nine hundred twenty five Page three hundred fifteen Admiral Byng AEtat forty seven The generosity with which he pleads the cause of Admiral Byng is highly to the honour of his heart and spirit Though Voltaire affects to be witty upon the fate of that unfortunate officer observing that he was shot pour encourager les autres nine hundred twenty six the nation has long been satisfied that his life was sacrificed to the political fervour of the times In the vault belonging to the Torrington family in the church of Southill nine hundred twenty seven in Bedfordshire there is the following Epitaph upon his monument which I have transcribed TO THE PERPETUAL DISGRACE OF PUBLIC JUSTICE THE HONOURABLE JOHN BYNG esquire ADMIRAL OF THE BLUE FELL A MARTYR TO POLITICAL PERSECUTION MARCH fourteen IN THE YEAR seventeen fifty seven WHEN BRAVERY AND LOYALTY WERE INSUFFICIENT SECURITIES FOR THE LIFE AND HONOUR OF A NAVAL OFFICER Johnson s most exquisite critical essay in the Literary Magazine and indeed any where is his review nine hundred twenty eight of Soame Jenyns s Inquiry into the Origin of Evil Jenyns was possessed of lively talents and a style eminently pure and easy and could very happily play with a light subject either in prose or verse but when he speculated on that most difficult and excruciating question the Origin of Evil he ventured far beyond his depth nine hundred twenty nine and accordingly was exposed by Johnson both with acute argument and brilliant wit I remember when the late mister Bicknell s humourous performance entitled The Musical Travels of Joel Collyer nine hundred thirty in which a slight attempt is made to ridicule Johnson was ascribed to Soame Jenyns Ha said Johnson I thought I had given him enough of it Page three hundred sixteen Soame Jenyns A D seventeen fifty six His triumph over Jenyns is thus described by my friend mister Courtenay in his Poetical Review of the literary and moral Character of doctor Johnson a performance of such merit that had I not been honoured with a very kind and partial notice in it nine hundred thirty one I should echo the sentiments of men of the first taste loudly in its praise When specious sophists with presumption scan The source of evil hidden still from man Revive Arabian tales and vainly hope To rival saint John and his scholar Pope Though metaphysicks spread the gloom of night By reason s star he guides our aching sight The bounds of knowledge marks and points the way To pathless wastes where wilder d sages stray Where like a farthing link boy Jenyns stands And the dim torch drops from his feeble hands nine hundred thirty two Page three hundred seventeen Draughts and cards AEtat forty seven This year mister William Payne brother of the respectable Bookseller nine hundred thirty three of that name published An Introduction to the Game of Draughts to which Johnson contributed a Dedication to the Earl of Rochford and a Preface both of which are admirably adapted to the treatise to which they are prefixed Johnson I believe did not play at draughts after leaving College nine hundred thirty four by which he suffered for it would have afforded him an innocent soothing relief from the melancholy which distressed him so often I have heard him regret that he had not learnt to play at cards nine hundred thirty five and the game of draughts we know is peculiarly calculated to fix the attention without straining it There is a composure and gravity in draughts which insensibly tranquillises the mind and accordingly the Dutch are fond of it as they are of smoaking of the sedative influence of which though he himself never smoaked he had a high opinion nine hundred thirty six Besides there is in draughts some exercise of the faculties and accordingly Johnson wishing to dignify the subject in his Dedication with what is most estimable in it observes Triflers may find or make any thing a trifle but since it is the great characteristick of a wise man to see events in their courses to obviate consequences and ascertain contingencies your Lordship will think nothing a trifle by which the mind is inured to caution foresight and circumspection nine hundred thirty seven As one of the little occasional advantages which he did not disdain to take by his pen as a man whose profession was literature he this year accepted of a guinea nine hundred thirty eight from mister Robert Dodsley for writing the introduction to The London Chronicle an evening news paper and even in so slight a performance exhibited peculiar talents 
1271_136861_000001_000001	train-clean-360	This Chronicle still subsists and from what I observed when I was abroad has a more extensive circulation upon the Continent than any of the English newspapers 
none	none	It was constantly read by Johnson himself nine hundred thirty nine and it is but just to observe that it has all along been distinguished for good sense accuracy moderation and delicacy Page three hundred eighteen doctor Madden A D seventeen fifty six Another instance of the same nature has been communicated to me by the Reverend doctor Thomas Campbell who has done himself considerable credit by his own writings nine hundred forty Sitting with doctor Johnson one morning alone he asked me if I had known doctor Madden who was authour of the premium scheme in Ireland nine hundred forty one On my answering in the affirmative and also that I had for some years lived in his neighbourhood c he begged of me that when I returned to Ireland I would endeavour to procure for him a poem of doctor Madden s called Boulter s Monument 
1271_136861_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The reason said he why I wish for it is this when doctor Madden came to London he submitted that work to my castigation and I remember I blotted a great many lines and might have blotted many more without making the poem worse 
none	none	However the Doctor was very thankful and very generous for he gave me ten guineas which was to me at that time a great sum nine hundred forty two Page three hundred nineteen Johnson s SHAKSPEARE AEtat forty seven He this year resumed his scheme of giving an edition of Shakspeare with notes nine hundred forty three He issued Proposals of considerable length nine hundred forty four in which he shewed that he perfectly well knew what a variety of research such an undertaking required but his indolence prevented him from pursuing it with that diligence which alone can collect those scattered facts that genius however acute penetrating and luminous cannot discover by its own force It is remarkable that at this time his fancied activity was for the moment so vigorous that he promised his work should be published before Christmas seventeen fifty seven nine hundred forty five Yet nine years elapsed before it saw the light nine hundred forty six His throes in bringing it forth had been severe and remittent and at last we may almost conclude that the Caesarian operation was performed by the knife of Churchill whose upbraiding satire I dare say made Johnson s friends urge him to dispatch nine hundred forty seven He for subscribers bates his hook And takes your cash but where s the book No matter where wise fear you know Forbids the robbing of a foe But what to serve our private ends Forbids the cheating of our friends nine hundred forty eight Page three hundred twenty Johnson refuses a country living A D seventeen fifty seven

none	none	It was a rectory in the gift of mister Langton the father of his much valued friend But he did not accept of it partly I believe from a conscientious motive being persuaded that his temper and habits rendered him unfit for that assiduous and familiar instruction of the vulgar and ignorant which he held to be an essential duty in a clergyman nine hundred forty nine and partly because his love of a London life was so strong that he would have thought himself an exile in any other place particularly if residing in the country nine hundred fifty Whoever would wish to see his thoughts upon that subject displayed in their full force may peruse The Adventurer Number one hundred twenty six nine hundred fifty one seventeen fifty seven AETAT forty eight In seventeen fifty seven it does not appear that he published any thing except some of those articles in The Literary Magazine which have been mentioned That magazine after Johnson ceased to write in it gradually declined though the popular epithet of Antigallican nine hundred fifty two was added to it and in July seventeen fifty eight it expired He probably prepared a part of his Shakspeare this year and he dictated a speech on the subject of an Address to the Throne after the expedition to Rochfort which was delivered by one of his friends I know not in what publick meeting nine hundred fifty three It is printed in The Gentleman s Magazine for October seventeen eighty five as his and bears sufficient marks of authenticity Page three hundred twenty one Irish literature AEtat forty eight By the favour of mister Joseph Cooper Walker of the Treasury Dublin I have obtained a copy of the following letter from Johnson to the venerable authour of Dissertations on the History of Ireland Page three hundred twenty two The affinities of language A D seventeen fifty seven To CHARLES O CONNOR esquire nine hundred fifty four SIR I have lately by the favour of mister Faulkner nine hundred fifty five seen your account of Ireland and cannot forbear to solicit a prosecution of your design Sir William Temple complains that Ireland is less known than any other country as to its ancient state nine hundred fifty six The natives have had little leisure and little encouragement for enquiry and strangers not knowing the language have had no ability I have long wished that the Irish literature were cultivated nine hundred fifty seven Ireland is known by tradition to have been once the seat of piety and learning nine hundred fifty eight and surely it would be very acceptable to all those who are curious either in the original of nations or the affinities of languages to be further informed of the revolution of a people so ancient and once so illustrious

1601-136862-0016	train-other-500	it would have been in vain to deny that the scheme of that which came latest was taken from the other Though the proposition illustrated by both these works was the same namely that in our present state there is more evil than good the intention of the writers was very different
none	none	 Voltaire I am afraid meant only by wanton profaneness to obtain a sportive victory over religion and to discredit the belief of a superintending Providence Johnson meant by shewing the unsatisfactory nature of things temporal to direct the hopes of man to things eternal Rasselas as was observed to me by a very accomplished lady may be considered as a more enlarged and more deeply philosophical discourse in prose upon the interesting truth which in his Vanity of Human Wishes he had so successfully enforced in verse The fund of thinking which this work contains is such that almost every sentence of it may furnish a subject of long meditation I am not satisfied if a year passes without my having read it through and at every perusal my admiration of the mind which produced it is so highly raised that I can scarcely believe that I had the honour of enjoying the intimacy of such a man Page three hundred forty three Apparitions AEtat fifty I restrain myself from quoting passages from this excellent work or even referring to them because I should not know what to select or rather what to omit I shall however transcribe one as it shews how well he could state the arguments of those who believe in the appearance

1601-136862-0023	train-other-500	Yet whatever additional shade his own particular sensations may have thrown on his representation of life attentive observation and close enquiry have convinced me that there is too much of reality in the gloomy picture

1885_136863_000028_000010	train-clean-360	But he gave a more eminent proof of it in our sister kingdom as doctor Johnson informed me

DEAR SIR I make haste to answer your kind letter in hope of hearing again from you before you leave us I cannot but regret that a man of your qualifications should find it necessary to seek an establishment in Guadaloupe which if a peace should restore to the French ten eighty eight I shall think it some alleviation of the loss that it must restore likewise doctor Staunton to the English It is a melancholy consideration that so much of our time is necessarily to be spent upon the care of living and that we can seldom obtain ease in one respect but by resigning it in another yet I suppose we are by this dispensation not less happy in the whole than if the spontaneous bounty of Nature poured all that we want into our hands A few if they were thus left to themselves would perhaps spend their time in laudable pursuits but the greater part would prey upon the quiet of each other or in the want of other objects would prey upon themselves This however is our condition which we must improve and solace as we can and though we cannot choose always our place of residence we may in every place find rational amusements and possess in every place the comforts of piety and a pure conscience In America there is little to be observed except natural curiosities The new world must have many vegetables and animals with which philosophers are but little acquainted I hope you will furnish yourself with some books of natural history and some glasses and other instruments of observation Trust as little as you can to report examine all you can by your own senses I do not doubt but

that you had formed Hope is itself a species of happiness and perhaps the chief happiness which this world affords ten ninety one but like all other pleasures immoderately enjoyed the excesses of hope must be expiated by pain and expectations improperly indulged must end in disappointment If it be asked what is the improper expectation which it is dangerous to indulge experience will quickly answer that it is such expectation as is dictated not by reason but by desire expectation raised not by the common occurrences of life but by the wants of the expectant an expectation that requires the common course of things to be changed and the general rules of action to be broken Page three hundred sixty nine Johnson s second letter to Baretti AEtat fifty three When you made your request to me you should have considered Madam what you were asking You ask me to solicit a great man to whom I never spoke for a young person whom I had never seen upon a supposition which I had no means of knowing to be true There is no reason why amongst all the great I should chuse to supplicate the Archbishop nor why among all the possible objects of his bounty the Archbishop should chuse your son I know Madam how unwillingly conviction is admitted when interest opposes it but surely Madam you must allow that there is no reason why that should be done by me which every other man may do with equal reason and which indeed no man can do properly without some very particular relation both to the Archbishop and to you If I could help you in this exigence by any proper means it would give me pleasure but this proposal is so very remote from all usual methods that I cannot comply with it but at the risk of such answer and suspicions as I believe you do not wish me to undergo I have seen your son this morning he seems a pretty youth and will perhaps find some better friend than I can procure him but though he should at last miss the University he may still be wise useful and happy I

make up the general mass of life and as nothing is little to him that feels it with great sensibility a mind able to see common incidents in their real state is disposed by very common incidents to very serious contemplations Let us trust that a time will come when the present moment shall be no longer irksome when we shall not borrow all our happiness from hope which at last is to end in disappointment I beg that you will shew mister Beauclerk all the civilities which you have in your power for he has always been kind to me I have lately seen mister Stratico Professor of Padua who has

person who first mentioned this subject to him eleven oh six Lord Loughborough told me that the pension was granted to Johnson solely as the reward of his literary merit without any stipulation

seventeen sixty two mister Thomas Sheridan and mister Murphy who then lived a good deal both with him and mister Wedderburne told me that they previously talked with Johnson upon this matter and that it was perfectly understood by all parties that the pension was merely honorary Sir Joshua Reynolds told me that Johnson called on him after his Majesty s intention had been notified to him and said he wished to consult his friends as to the propriety of his accepting this mark of the royal favour after the definitions which he had given in his Dictionary of pension and pensioners eleven oh eight He said he would not have Sir Joshua s answer till next day when he would call again and desired he might think of it Sir Joshua answered that he was clear to give his opinion then that there could be no objection to his receiving from the King a reward for literary merit and that certainly the definitions in his Dictionary were not applicable to him Johnson it should seem was satisfied for he did not call again till he had accepted the pension and had waited on Lord Bute to thank him He then told Sir Joshua that Lord Bute said to him expressly It is not given you for anything you are to do but for what you have done His Lordship he said behaved in the handsomest manner He repeated the words twice that he might be sure Johnson heard them and thus set his mind perfectly at ease This nobleman who has been so virulently abused acted with great honour in this instance and displayed a mind truly liberal A minister of a more narrow and selfish disposition would have availed himself of such an opportunity to fix an implied obligation on a man of Johnson s powerful talents to give him his support Page three hundred seventy five Murphy s account of the pension AEtat fifty three mister Murphy and the late mister Sheridan severally contended for the distinction of having been the first who mentioned to mister Wedderburne that Johnson ought to have a pension When I spoke of this to Lord Loughborough wishing to know if he recollected the prime mover in the business he said All his friends assisted and when I told him that mister Sheridan strenuously asserted his claim to it his Lordship said He rang the bell And it is but just to add that mister Sheridan told me that when he communicated to doctor Johnson that a pension was to be granted him he replied in a fervour of gratitude The English language does not afford me terms adequate to my feelings on this occasion I must have recourse to the French I am penetre with his Majesty s goodness When I repeated this to doctor Johnson he did not contradict it eleven oh nine His definitions of pension and pensioner partly founded on the satirical verses of Pope eleven ten which he quotes may be generally true and yet every body must allow that there may be and have been instances of pensions given and received upon liberal and honourable terms Thus then it is clear that there was nothing inconsistent or humiliating in Johnson s accepting of a pension so unconditionally and so honourably offered to him Page three hundred seventy six Johnson s letter to Lord Bute A D seventeen sixty two But I shall not detain my readers longer by any words of my own on a subject on which I am happily enabled by the favour of the Earl of Bute to present them with what Johnson himself wrote his lordship having been pleased to communicate to me a copy of the following letter to his late father eleven eleven which does great honour both to the writer and to the noble person to whom it is addressed TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF BUTE MY LORD When the bills eleven twelve were yesterday delivered to me by mister Wedderburne I was informed by him of the future favours which his Majesty has by your Lordship s recommendation been induced to intend for me Bounty always receives part of its value from the manner in which it is bestowed your Lordship s kindness includes every circumstance that can gratify delicacy or enforce obligation You have conferred your favours on a man who has neither alliance nor interest who has not merited them by services nor courted them by officiousness you have spared him the shame of solicitation and the anxiety of suspense Page three hundred seventy seven A visit to Devonshire AEtat fifty three What has been thus elegantly given will I hope not be reproachfully enjoyed I shall endeavour to give your Lordship the only recompense which generosity desires the gratification of finding that your benefits are not improperly bestowed I am my Lord Your Lordship s most obliged Most obedient and most humble servant SAM JOHNSON July twenty seventeen sixty two This year his friend Sir Joshua Reynolds paid a visit of some weeks to his native country Devonshire in which he was accompanied by Johnson who was much pleased with this jaunt and declared he had derived from it a great accession of new ideas eleven thirteen He was entertained at the seats of several noblemen and gentlemen in the West of England eleven fourteen but the greatest part of the time was passed at Plymouth where the magnificence of the navy the ship building and all its circumstances afforded him a grand subject of contemplation The Commissioner of the Dock yard paid him the compliment of ordering the yacht to convey him and his friend to the Eddystone to which they accordingly sailed But the weather was so tempestuous that they could not land eleven fifteen Page three hundred seventy eight Johnson at Plymouth A D seventeen sixty two Reynolds and he were at this time the guests of doctor Mudge eleven sixteen the celebrated surgeon and now physician of that place not more distinguished for quickness of parts and variety of knowledge than loved and esteemed for his amiable manners and here Johnson formed an acquaintance with doctor Mudge s father that very eminent divine the Reverend Zachariah Mudge eleven seventeen Prebendary of Exeter who was idolised in the west both for his excellence as a preacher and the uniform perfect propriety of his private conduct He preached a sermon purposely that Johnson might hear him and we shall see afterwards that Johnson honoured his memory by drawing his character eleven eighteen While Johnson was at Plymouth he saw a great many of its inhabitants and was not sparing of his very entertaining conversation It was here that he made that frank and truly original confession that ignorance pure ignorance was the cause of a wrong definition in his Dictionary of the word pastern eleven nineteen to the no small surprise of the Lady who put the question to him who having the most profound reverence for his character so as almost to suppose him endowed with infallibility expected to hear an explanation of what to be sure seemed strange to a common reader drawn from some deep learned source with which she was unacquainted Page three hundred seventy nine An enemy of the Dockers AEtat fifty three Sir Joshua Reynolds to whom I was obliged for my information concerning this excursion mentions a very characteristical anecdote of Johnson while at Plymouth Having observed that in consequence of the Dock yard a new town eleven twenty had arisen about two miles off as a rival to the old and knowing from his sagacity and just observation of human nature that it is certain if a man hates at all he will hate his next neighbour he concluded that this new and rising town could not but excite the envy and jealousy of the old in which conjecture he was very soon confirmed he therefore set himself resolutely on the side of the old town the established town in which his lot was cast considering it as a kind of duty to stand by it He accordingly entered warmly into its interests and upon every occasion talked of the dockers as the inhabitants of the new town were called as upstarts and aliens Plymouth is very plentifully supplied with water by a river brought into it from a great distance which is so abundant that it runs to waste in the town The Dock or New town being totally destitute of water petitioned Plymouth that a small portion of the conduit might be permitted to go to them and this was now under consideration Johnson affecting to entertain the passions of the place was violent in opposition and half laughing at himself for his pretended zeal where he had no concern exclaimed No no I am against the dockers I am a Plymouth man Rogues let them die of thirst They shall not have a drop eleven twenty one Page three hundred eighty Johnson s third letter to Baretti A D seventeen sixty two Lord Macartney obligingly favoured me with a copy of the following letter in his own hand writing from the original which was found by the present Earl of Bute among his father s papers To THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF BUTE MY LORD That generosity by which I was recommended to the favour of his Majesty will not be offended at a solicitation necessary to make that favour permanent and effectual The pension appointed to be paid me at Michaelmas I have not received and know not where or from whom I am to ask it I beg therefore that your Lordship will be pleased to supply mister Wedderburne with such directions as may be necessary which I believe his friendship will make him think it no trouble to convey to me To interrupt your Lordship at a time like this with such petty difficulties is improper and unseasonable but your knowledge of the world has long since taught you that every man s affairs however little are important to himself Every man hopes that he shall escape neglect and with reason may every man whose vices do not preclude his claim expect favour from that beneficence which has been extended to My Lord Your Lordship s Most obliged And Most humble servant Temple Lane SAM JOHNSON Nov three seventeen sixty two TO mister JOSEPH BARETTI AT MILAN London Dec twenty one seventeen sixty two SIR Page three hundred eighty one Love and marriage AEtat fifty three You are not to suppose with all your conviction of my idleness that I have passed all this time without writing to my Baretti I gave a letter to mister Beauclerk who in my opinion and in his own was hastening to Naples for the recovery of his health eleven twenty two but he has stopped at Paris and I know not when he will proceed Langton is with him I will not trouble you with speculations about peace and war The good or ill success of battles and embassies extends itself to a very small part of domestick life we all have good and evil which we feel more sensibly than our petty part of publick miscarriage or prosperity eleven twenty three I am sorry for your disappointment with which you seem more touched than I should expect a man of your resolution and experience to have been did I not know that general truths are seldom applied to particular occasions and that the fallacy of our self love extends itself as wide as our interest or affections Every man believes that mistresses are unfaithful and patrons capricious but he excepts his own mistress and his own patron We have all learned that greatness is negligent and contemptuous and that in Courts life is often languished away in ungratified expectation but he that approaches greatness or glitters in a Court imagines that destiny has at last exempted him from the common lot Do not let such evils overwhelm you as thousands have suffered and thousands have surmounted but turn your thoughts with vigour to some other plan of life and keep always in your mind that with due submission to Providence a man of genius has been seldom ruined but by himself eleven twenty four Your Patron s weakness or insensibility will finally do you little hurt if he is not assisted by your own passions Of your love I know not the propriety nor can estimate the power but in love as in every other passion of which hope is the essence we ought always to remember the uncertainty of events There is indeed nothing that so much seduces reason from vigilance as the thought of passing life with an amiable woman and if all would happen that a lover fancies I know not what other terrestrial happiness would deserve pursuit But love and marriage are different states Those who are to suffer the evils together and to suffer often for the sake of one another soon lose that tenderness of look and that benevolence of mind which arose from the participation of unmingled pleasure and successive amusement A woman we are sure will not be always fair we are not sure she will always be virtuous and man cannot retain through life that respect and assiduity by which he pleases for a day or for a month I do not however pretend to have discovered that life has any thing more to be desired than a prudent and virtuous marriage therefore know not what counsel to give you Page three hundred eighty two Johnson s Life of Collins A D seventeen sixty three If you can quit your imagination of love and greatness and leave your hopes of preferment and bridal raptures to try once more the fortune of literature and industry the way through France is now open eleven twenty five We flatter ourselves that we shall cultivate with great diligence the arts of peace and every man will be welcome among us who can teach us any thing we do not know eleven twenty six For your part you will find all your old friends willing to receive you Reynolds still continues to increase in reputation and in riches Miss Williams who very much loves you goes on in the old way Miss Cotterel is still with missus Porter Miss Charlotte is married to Dean Lewis and has three children mister Levet has married a street walker eleven twenty seven But the gazette of my narration must now arrive to tell you that Bathurst went physician to the army and died at the Havannah eleven twenty eight I know not whether I have not sent you word that Huggins eleven twenty nine and Richardson eleven thirty are both dead When we see our enemies and friends gliding away before us let us not forget that we are subject to the general law of mortality and shall soon be where our doom will be fixed for ever I pray GOD to bless you and am Sir Your most affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON Write soon Page three hundred eighty three A dedication to the Queen AEtat fifty four seventeen sixty three AETAT fifty four In seventeen sixty three he furnished to The Poetical Calendar published by Fawkes and Woty a character of Collins which he afterwards ingrafted into his entire life of that admirable poet eleven thirty one in the collection of lives which he wrote for the body of English poetry formed and published by the booksellers of London His account of the melancholy depression with which Collins was severely afflicted and which brought him to his grave is I think one of the most tender and interesting passages in the whole series of his writings eleven thirty two He also favoured mister Hoole with the Dedication of his translation of Tasso to the Queen which is so happily conceived and elegantly expressed that I cannot but point it out to the peculiar notice of my readers eleven thirty three Page three hundred eighty four Boswell s youthful compositions A D seventeen sixty three Page three hundred eighty five Johnson s quarrel with Sheridan AEtat fifty four This is to me a memorable year for in it I had the happiness to obtain the acquaintance of that extraordinary man whose memoirs I am now writing an acquaintance which I shall ever esteem as one of the most fortunate circumstances in my life Though then but two and twenty eleven thirty four I had for several years read his works with delight and instruction and had the highest reverence for their authour which had grown up in my fancy into a kind of mysterious veneration eleven thirty five by figuring to myself a state of solemn elevated abstraction in which I supposed him to live in the immense metropolis of London mister Gentleman a native of Ireland who passed some years in Scotland as a player and as an instructor in the English language a man whose talents and worth were depressed by misfortunes eleven thirty six had given me a representation of the figure and manner of DICTIONARY JOHNSON as he was then generally called eleven thirty seven and during my first visit to London which was for three months in seventeen sixty mister Derrick the poet eleven thirty eight who was Gentleman s friend and countryman flattered me with hopes that he would introduce me to Johnson an honour of which I was very ambitious But he never found an opportunity which made me doubt that he had promised to do what was not in his power till Johnson some years afterwards told me Derrick Sir might very well have introduced you I had a kindness for Derrick and am sorry he is dead In the summer of seventeen sixty one mister Thomas Sheridan was at Edinburgh and delivered lectures upon the English Language and Publick Speaking to large and respectable audiences I was often in his company and heard him frequently expatiate upon Johnson s extraordinary knowledge talents and virtues repeat his pointed sayings describe his particularities and boast of his being his guest sometimes till two or three in the morning At his house I hoped to have many opportunities of seeing the sage as mister Sheridan obligingly assured me I should not be disappointed Page three hundred eighty six Sheridan s pension A D seventeen sixty three When I returned to London in the end of seventeen sixty two to my surprise and regret I found an irreconcileable difference had taken place between Johnson and Sheridan A pension of two hundred pounds a year had been given to Sheridan Johnson who as has been already mentioned thought slightingly of Sheridan s art upon hearing that he was also pensioned exclaimed What have they given him a pension Then it is time for me to give up mine Whether this proceeded from a momentary indignation as if it were an affront to his exalted merit that a player should be rewarded in the same manner with him or was the sudden effect of a fit of peevishness it was unluckily said and indeed cannot be justified mister Sheridan s pension was granted to him not as a player but as a sufferer in the cause of government when he was manager of the Theatre Royal in Ireland when parties ran high in seventeen fifty three eleven thirty nine And it must also be allowed that he was a man of literature and had considerably improved the arts of reading and speaking with distinctness and propriety Besides Johnson should have recollected that mister Sheridan taught pronunciation to mister Alexander Wedderburne eleven forty whose sister was married to Sir Harry Erskine eleven forty one an intimate friend of Lord Bute who was the favourite of the King and surely the most outrageous Whig will not maintain that whatever ought to be the principle in the disposal of offices a pension ought never to be granted from any bias of court connection mister Macklin eleven forty two indeed shared with mister Sheridan the honour of instructing mister Wedderburne and though it was too late in life for a Caledonian to acquire the genuine English cadence yet so successful were mister Wedderburne s instructors and his own unabating endeavours that he got rid of the coarse part of his Scotch accent retaining only as much of the native wood note wild eleven forty three as to mark his country which if any Scotchman should affect to forget I should heartily despise him Notwithstanding the difficulties which are to be encountered by those who have not had the advantage of an English education he by degrees formed a mode of speaking to which Englishmen do not deny the praise of elegance Hence his distinguished oratory which he exerted in his own country as an advocate in the Court of Session and a ruling elder of the Kirk has had its fame and ample reward in much higher spheres When I look back on this noble person at Edinburgh in situations so unworthy of his brilliant powers and behold LORD LOUGHBOROUGH at London the change seems almost like one of the metamorphoses in Ovid and as his two preceptors by refining his utterance gave currency to his talents we may say in the words of that poet Nam vos mutastis eleven forty four Page three hundred eighty seven Lord Loughborough AEtat fifty four I have dwelt the longer upon this remarkable instance of successful parts and assiduity because it affords animating encouragement to other gentlemen of North Britain to try their fortunes in the southern part of the Island where they may hope to gratify their utmost ambition and now that we are one people by the Union it would surely be illiberal to maintain that they have not an equal title with the natives of any other part of his Majesty s dominions Page three hundred eighty eight Sheridan s attack on Johnson A D seventeen sixty three Page three hundred eighty nine missus Sheridan AEtat fifty four Johnson complained that a man who disliked him repeated his sarcasm to mister Sheridan without telling him what followed which was that after a pause he added However I am glad that mister Sheridan has a pension for he is a very good man Sheridan could never forgive this hasty contemptuous expression It rankled in his mind and though I informed him of all that Johnson said and that he would be very glad to meet him amicably he positively declined repeated offers which I made and once went off abruptly from a house where he and I were engaged to dine because he was told that doctor Johnson was to be there eleven forty five I have no sympathetick feeling with such persevering resentment It is painful when there is a breach between those who have lived together socially and cordially and I wonder that there is not in all such cases a mutual wish that it should be healed I could perceive that mister Sheridan was by no means satisfied with Johnson s acknowledging him to be a good man eleven forty six That could not sooth his injured vanity I could not but smile at the same time that I was offended to observe Sheridan in The Life of Swift eleven forty seven which he afterwards published attempting in the writhings of his resentment to depreciate Johnson by characterising him as A writer of gigantick fame in these days of little men that very Johnson whom he once so highly admired and venerated Page three hundred ninety mister Thomas Davies A D seventeen sixty three This rupture with Sheridan deprived Johnson of one of his most agreeable resources for amusement in his lonely evenings for Sheridan s well informed animated and bustling mind never suffered conversation to stagnate and missus Sheridan eleven forty eight was a most agreeable companion to an intellectual man She was sensible ingenious unassuming yet communicative I recollect with satisfaction many pleasing hours which I passed with her under the hospitable roof of her husband who was to me a very kind friend Her novel entitled Memoirs of Miss Sydney Biddulph contains an excellent moral while it inculcates a future state of retribution eleven forty nine and what it teaches is impressed upon the mind by a series of as deep distress as can affect humanity in the amiable and pious heroine who goes to her grave unrelieved but resigned and full of hope of heaven s mercy Johnson paid her this high compliment upon it I know not Madam that you have a right upon moral principles to make your readers suffer so much eleven fifty mister Thomas Davies the actor who then kept a bookseller s shop in Russel street Covent garden eleven fifty one told me that Johnson was very much his friend and came frequently to his house where he more than once invited me to meet him but by some unlucky accident or other he was prevented from coming to us Page three hundred ninety one mister Davies s back parlour AEtat fifty four mister Thomas Davies was a man of good understanding and talents with the advantage of a liberal education eleven fifty two Though somewhat pompous he was an entertaining companion and his literary performances eleven fifty three have no inconsiderable share of merit He was a friendly and very hospitable man Both he and his wife who has been celebrated for her beauty eleven fifty four though upon the stage for many years maintained an uniform decency of character and Johnson esteemed them and lived in as easy an intimacy with them as with any family which he used to visit eleven fifty five mister Davies recollected several of Johnson s remarkable sayings and was one of the best of the many imitators of his voice and manner while relating them He increased my impatience more and more to see the extraordinary man whose works I highly valued and whose conversation was reported to be so peculiarly excellent Page three hundred ninety two Boswell s introduction to Johnson A D seventeen sixty three Page three hundred ninety three His first record of Johnson s talk AEtat fifty four At last on Monday the sixteenth of May when I was sitting in mister Davies s back parlour after having drunk tea with him and missus Davies Johnson unexpectedly came into the shop eleven fifty six and mister Davies having perceived him through the glass door in the room in which we were sitting advancing towards us he announced his aweful approach to me somewhat in the manner of an actor in the part of Horatio when he addresses Hamlet on the appearance of his father s ghost Look my Lord it comes I found that I had a very perfect idea of Johnson s figure from the portrait of him painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds soon after he had published his Dictionary in the attitude of sitting in his easy chair in deep meditation which was the first picture his friend did for him which Sir Joshua very kindly presented to me and from which an engraving has been made for this work mister Davies mentioned my name and respectfully introduced me to him I was much agitated and recollecting his prejudice against the Scotch of which I had heard much I said to Davies Don t tell where I come from From Scotland cried Davies roguishly mister Johnson said I I do indeed come from Scotland but I cannot help it eleven fifty seven I am willing to flatter myself that I meant this as light pleasantry to sooth and conciliate him and not as an humiliating abasement at the expence of my country But however that might be this speech was somewhat unlucky for with that quickness of wit for which he was so remarkable he seized the expression come from Scotland which I used in the sense of being of that country and as if I had said that I had come away from it or left it retorted That Sir I find is what a very great many of your countrymen cannot help This stroke stunned me a good deal and when we had sat down I felt myself not a little embarrassed and apprehensive of what might come next He then addressed himself to Davies What do you think of Garrick He has refused me an order for the play for Miss Williams because he knows the house will be full and that an order would be worth three shillings Eager to take any opening to get into conversation with him I ventured to say O Sir I cannot think mister Garrick would grudge such a trifle to you Sir said he with a stern look I have known David Garrick longer than you have done and I know no right you have to talk to me on the subject Perhaps I deserved this check for it was rather presumptuous in me an entire stranger to express any doubt of the justice of his animadversion upon his old acquaintance and pupil eleven fifty eight I now felt myself much mortified and began to think that the hope which I had long indulged of obtaining his acquaintance was blasted And in truth had not my ardour been uncommonly strong and my resolution uncommonly persevering so rough a reception might have deterred me for ever from making any further attempts Fortunately however I remained upon the field not wholly discomfited and was soon rewarded by hearing some of his conversation of which I preserved the following short minute without marking the questions and observations by which it was produced People he remarked may be taken in once who imagine that an authour is greater in private life than other men Uncommon parts require uncommon opportunities for their exertion In barbarous society superiority of parts is of real consequence Great strength or great wisdom is of much value to an individual But in more polished times there are people to do every thing for money and then there are a number of other superiorities such as those of birth and fortune and rank that dissipate men s attention and leave no extraordinary share of respect for personal and intellectual superiority This is wisely ordered by Providence to preserve some equality among mankind Page three hundred ninety four Sheridan s lectures on Oratory A D seventeen sixty three Sir this book The Elements of Criticism eleven fifty nine which he had taken up is a pretty essay and deserves to be held in some estimation though much of it is chimerical Speaking of one who with more than ordinary boldness attacked publick measures and the royal family he said I think he is safe from the law but he is an abusive scoundrel and instead of applying to my Lord Chief Justice to punish him I would send half a dozen footmen and have him well ducked eleven sixty The notion of liberty amuses the people of England and helps to keep off the taedium vitae When a butcher tells you that his heart bleeds for his country he has in fact no uneasy feeling Sheridan will not succeed at Bath with his oratory Ridicule has gone down before him and I doubt Derrick is his enemy eleven sixty one Derrick may do very well as long as he can outrun his character but the moment his character gets up with him it is all over Page three hundred ninety five Boswell s first call on Johnson AEtat fifty four It is however but just to record that some years afterwards when I reminded him of this sarcasm he said Well but Derrick has now got a character that he need not run away from I was highly pleased with the extraordinary vigour of his conversation and regretted that I was drawn away from it by an engagement at another place I had for a part of the evening been left alone with him and had ventured to make an observation now and then which he received very civilly so that I was satisfied that though there was a roughness in his manner there was no ill nature in his disposition Davies followed me to the door and when I complained to him a little of the hard blows which the great man had given me he kindly took upon him to console me by saying Don t be uneasy I can see he likes you very well Page three hundred sixty nine The Giant in his den A D seventeen sixty three A few days afterwards I called on Davies and asked him if he thought I might take the liberty of waiting on mister Johnson at his Chambers in the Temple He said I certainly might and that mister Johnson would take it as a compliment So upon Tuesday the twenty fourth of May after having been enlivened by the witty sallies of Messieurs Thornton eleven sixty two Wilkes Churchill and Lloyd eleven sixty three with whom I had passed the morning I boldly repaired to Johnson His Chambers were on the first floor of No one Inner Temple lane and I entered them with an impression given me by the Reverend doctor Blair eleven sixty four of Edinburgh who had been introduced to him not long before and described his having found the Giant in his den an expression which when I came to be pretty well acquainted with Johnson I repeated to him and he was diverted at this picturesque account of himself doctor Blair had been presented to him by doctor James Fordyce eleven sixty five At this time the controversy concerning the pieces published by mister James Macpherson as translations of Ossian eleven sixty six was at its height Johnson had all along denied their authenticity and what was still more provoking to their admirers maintained that they had no merit The subject having been introduced by doctor Fordyce doctor Blair relying on the internal evidence of their antiquity asked doctor Johnson whether he thought any man of a modern age could have written such poems Johnson replied Yes Sir many men many women and many children eleven sixty seven Johnson at this time did not know that doctor Blair had just published a Dissertation not only defending their authenticity but seriously ranking them with the poems of Homer and Virgil and when he was afterwards informed of this circumstance he expressed some displeasure at doctor Fordyce s having suggested the topick and said I am not sorry that they got thus much for their pains Sir it was like leading one to talk of a book when the authour is concealed behind the door eleven sixty eight Page three hundred ninety seven Christopher Smart s madness AEtat fifty four He received me very courteously but it must be confessed that his apartment and furniture and morning dress were sufficiently uncouth His brown suit of cloaths looked very rusty he had on a little old shrivelled unpowdered wig which was too small for his head his shirt neck and knees of his breeches were loose his black worsted stockings ill drawn up and he had a pair of unbuckled shoes by way of slippers But all these slovenly particularities were forgotten the moment that he began to talk Some gentlemen whom I do not recollect were sitting with him and when they went away I also rose but he said to me Nay don t go Sir said I I am afraid that I intrude upon you It is benevolent to allow me to sit and hear you He seemed pleased with this compliment which I sincerely paid him and answered Sir I am obliged to any man who visits me I have preserved the following short minute of what passed this day Madness frequently discovers itself merely by unnecessary deviation from the usual modes of the world My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind by falling upon his knees and saying his prayers in the street or in any other unusual place Now although rationally speaking it is greater madness not to pray at all than to pray as Smart did I am afraid there are so many who do not pray that their understanding is not called in question Concerning this unfortunate poet Christopher Smart who was confined in a mad house he had at another time the following conversation with doctor Burney BURNEY How does poor Smart do Sir is he likely to recover JOHNSON It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease for he grows fat upon it BURNEY Perhaps Sir that may be from want of exercise JOHNSON No Sir he has partly as much exercise as he used to have for he digs in the garden Indeed before his confinement he used for exercise to walk to the ale house but he was carried back again I did not think he ought to be shut up His infirmities were not noxious to society He insisted on people praying with him eleven sixty nine and I d as lief pray with Kit Smart as any one else Another charge was that he did not love clean linen and I have no passion for it Johnson continued Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour eleven seventy but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it Page three hundred ninety eight Johnson s mode of life A D seventeen sixty three The morality of an action depends on the motive from which we act If I fling half a crown to a beggar with intention to break his head and he picks it up and buys victuals with it the physical effect is good but with respect to me the action is very wrong So religious exercises if not performed with an intention to please GOD avail us nothing As our Saviour says of those who perform them from other motives Verily they have their reward eleven seventy one The Christian religion has very strong evidences eleven seventy two It indeed appears in some degree strange to reason but in History we have undoubted facts against which reasoning a priori we have more arguments than we have for them but then testimony has great weight and casts the balance I would recommend to every man whose faith is yet unsettled Grotius doctor Pearson and doctor Clarke eleven seventy three Talking of Garrick he said He is the first man in the world for sprightly conversation When I rose a second time he again pressed me to stay which I did He told me that he generally went abroad at four in the afternoon and seldom came home till two in the morning eleven seventy four I took the liberty to ask if he did not think it wrong to live thus and not make more use of his great talents eleven seventy five He owned it was a bad habit On reviewing at the distance of many years my journal of this period I wonder how at my first visit I ventured to talk to him so freely and that he bore it with so much indulgence Page three hundred ninety nine Johnson the horse rider AEtat fifty four Before we parted he was so good as to promise to favour me with his company one evening at my lodgings and as I took my leave shook me cordially by the hand It is almost needless to add that I felt no little elation at having now so happily established an acquaintance of which I had been so long ambitious My readers will I trust excuse me for being thus minutely circumstantial when it is considered that the acquaintance of doctor Johnson was to me a most valuable acquisition and laid the foundation of whatever instruction and entertainment they may receive from my collections concerning the great subject of the work which they are now perusing I did not visit him again till Monday June thirteen at which time I recollect no part of his conversation except that when I told him I had been to see Johnson ride upon three horses eleven seventy six he said Such a man Sir should be encouraged for his performances shew the extent of the human powers in one instance and thus tend to raise our opinion of the faculties of man He shews what may be attained by persevering application so that every man may hope that by giving as much application although perhaps he may never ride three horses at a time or dance upon a wire yet he may be equally expert in whatever profession he has chosen to pursue He again shook me by the hand at parting and asked me why I did not come oftener to him Trusting that I was now in his good graces I answered that he had not given me much encouragement and reminded him of the check I had received from him at our first interview Poh poh said he with a complacent smile never mind these things Come to me as often as you can I shall be glad to see you I had learnt that his place of frequent resort was the Mitre tavern in Fleet street where he loved to sit up late and I begged I might be allowed to pass an evening with him there soon which he promised I should A few days afterwards I met him near Temple bar about one o clock in the morning and asked if he would then go to the Mitre Sir said he it is too late they won t let us in But I ll go with you another night with all my heart Page four hundred A revolution in Boswell s life A D seventeen sixty three Page four hundred one The Mitre AEtat fifty four A revolution of some importance in my plan of life had just taken place for instead of procuring a commission in the footguards which was my own inclination eleven seventy seven I had in compliance with my father s wishes agreed to study the law and was soon to set out for Utrecht to hear the lectures of an excellent Civilian in that University and then to proceed on my travels Though very desirous of obtaining doctor Johnson s advice and instructions on the mode of pursuing my studies I was at this time so occupied shall I call it or so dissipated by the amusements of London that our next meeting was not till Saturday June twenty five when happening to dine at Clifton s eating house in Butcher row eleven seventy eight I was surprized to perceive Johnson come in and take his seat at another table The mode of dining or rather being fed at such houses in London is well known to many to be particularly unsocial as there is no Ordinary or united company but each person has his own mess and is under no obligation to hold any intercourse with any one A liberal and full minded man however who loves to talk will break through this churlish and unsocial restraint Johnson and an Irish gentleman got into a dispute concerning the cause of some part of mankind being black Why Sir said Johnson it has been accounted for in three ways either by supposing that they are the posterity of Ham who was cursed or that GOD at first created two kinds of men one black and another white or that by the heat of the sun the skin is scorched and so acquires a sooty hue This matter has been much canvassed among naturalists but has never been brought to any certain issue What the Irishman said is totally obliterated from my mind but I remember that he became very warm and intemperate in his expressions upon which Johnson rose and quietly walked away When he had retired his antagonist took his revenge as he thought by saying He has a most ungainly figure and an affectation of pomposity unworthy of a man of genius Johnson had not observed that I was in the room I followed him however and he agreed to meet me in the evening at the Mitre I called on him and we went thither at nine We had a good supper and port wine of which he then sometimes drank a bottle The orthodox high church sound of the MITRE the figure and manner of the celebrated SAMUEL JOHNSON the extraordinary power and precision of his conversation and the pride arising from finding myself admitted as his companion produced a variety of sensations and a pleasing elevation of mind beyond what I had ever before experienced I find in my journal the following minute of our conversation which though it will give but a very faint notion of what passed is in some degree a valuable record and it will be curious in this view as shewing how habitual to his mind were some opinions which appear in his works Page four hundred two Cibber and Whitehead A D seventeen sixty three Colley Cibber eleven seventy nine Sir was by no means a blockhead but by arrogating to himself too much he was in danger of losing that degree of estimation to which he was entitled His friends gave out that he intended his birth day Odes should be bad but that was not the case Sir for he kept them many months by him and a few years before he died he shewed me one of them with great solicitude to render it as perfect as might be and I made some corrections to which he was not very willing to submit I remember the following couplet in allusion to the King and himself Perch d on the eagle s soaring wing The lowly linnet loves to sing Sir he had heard something of the fabulous tale of the wren sitting upon the eagle s wing and he had applied it to a linnet Gibber s familiar style however was better than that which Whitehead has assumed Grand nonsense is insupportable eleven eighty Whitehead is but a little man to inscribe verses to players I did not presume to controvert this censure which was tinctured with his prejudice against players eleven eighty one but I could not help thinking that a dramatick poet might with propriety pay a compliment to an eminent performer as Whitehead has very happily done in his verses to mister Garrick eleven eighty two Page four hundred three The abruptness of Gray s Ode AEtat fifty four Sir I do not think Gray a first rate poet He has not a bold imagination nor much command of words The obscurity in which he has involved himself will not persuade us that he is sublime eleven eighty three His Elegy in a Church yard has a happy selection of images but I don t like what are called his great things His Ode which begins Ruin seize thee ruthless King Confusion on thy banners wait has been celebrated for its abruptness and plunging into the subject all at once eleven eighty four But such arts as these have no merit unless when they are original We admire them only once and this abruptness has nothing new in it We have had it often before Nay we have it in the old song of Johnny Armstrong eleven eighty five Is there ever a man in all Scotland From the highest estate to the lowest degree c And then Sir Yes there is a man in Westmoreland And Johnny Armstrong they do him call There now you plunge at once into the subject You have no previous narration to lead you to it The two next lines in that Ode are I think very good Though fann d by conquest s crimson wing They mock the air with idle state eleven eighty six Page four hundred four Boswell opens his mind A D seventeen sixty three Here let it be observed that although his opinion of Gray s poetry was widely different from mine and I believe from that of most men of taste eleven eighty seven by whom it is with justice highly admired there is certainly much absurdity in the clamour which has been raised as if he had been culpably injurious to the merit of that bard and had been actuated by envy Alas ye little short sighted criticks could JOHNSON be envious of the talents of any of his contemporaries That his opinion on this subject was what in private and in publick he uniformly expressed regardless of what others might think we may wonder and perhaps regret but it is shallow and unjust to charge him with expressing what he did not think Finding him in a placid humour and wishing to avail myself of the opportunity which I fortunately had of consulting a sage to hear whose wisdom I conceived in the ardour of youthful imagination that men filled with a noble enthusiasm for intellectual improvement would gladly have resorted from distant lands I opened my mind to him ingenuously and gave him a little sketch of my life to which he was pleased to listen with great attention eleven eighty eight Page four hundred five The differences of Christians AEtat fifty four I acknowledged that though educated very strictly in the principles of religion I had for some time been misled into a certain degree of infidelity but that I was come now to a better way of thinking and was fully satisfied of the truth of the Christian revelation though I was not clear as to every point considered to be orthodox Being at all times a curious examiner of the human mind and pleased with an undisguised display of what had passed in it he called to me with warmth Give me your hand I have taken a liking to you He then began to descant upon the force of testimony and the little we could know of final causes so that the objections of why was it so or why was it not so ought not to disturb us adding that he himself had at one period been guilty of a temporary neglect of religion but that it was not the result of argument but mere absence of thought eleven eighty nine After having given credit to reports of his bigotry I was agreeably surprized when he expressed the following very liberal sentiment which has the additional value of obviating an objection to our holy religion founded upon the discordant tenets of Christians themselves For my part Sir I think all Christians whether Papists or Protestants agree in the essential articles and that their differences are trivial and rather political than religious eleven ninety We talked of belief in ghosts He said Sir I make a distinction between what a man may experience by the mere strength of his imagination and what imagination cannot possibly produce Thus suppose I should think that I saw a form and heard a voice cry Johnson you are a very wicked fellow and unless you repent you will certainly be punished my own unworthiness is so deeply impressed upon my mind that I might imagine I thus saw and heard and therefore I should not believe that an external communication had been made to me But if a form should appear and a voice should tell me that a particular man had died at a particular place and a particular hour a fact which I had no apprehension of nor any means of knowing and this fact with all its circumstances should afterwards be unquestionably proved I should in that case be persuaded that I had supernatural intelligence imparted to me Page four hundred six The Cock lane Ghost A D seventeen sixty three Here it is proper once for all to give a true and fair statement of Johnson s way of thinking upon the question whether departed spirits are ever permitted to appear in this world or in any way to operate upon human life He has been ignorantly misrepresented as weakly credulous upon that subject and therefore though I feel an inclination to disdain and treat with silent contempt so foolish a notion concerning my illustrious friend yet as I find it has gained ground it is necessary to refute it The real fact then is that Johnson had a very philosophical mind and such a rational respect for testimony as to make him submit his understanding to what was authentically proved though he could not comprehend why it was so Being thus disposed he was willing to inquire into the truth of any relation of supernatural agency a general belief of which has prevailed in all nations and ages eleven ninety one But so far was he from being the dupe of implicit faith that he examined the matter with a jealous attention and no man was more ready to refute its falsehood when he had discovered it Churchill in his poem entitled The Ghost availed himself of the absurd credulity imputed to Johnson and drew a caricature of him under the name of POMPOSO eleven ninety two representing him as one of the believers of the story of a Ghost in Cock lane which in the year seventeen sixty two had gained very general credit in London eleven ninety three Many of my readers I am convinced are to this hour under an impression that Johnson was thus foolishly deceived It will therefore surprise them a good deal when they are informed upon undoubted authority that Johnson was one of those by whom the imposture was detected The story had become so popular that he thought it should be investigated eleven ninety four and in this research he was assisted by the Reverend doctor Douglas eleven ninety five now Bishop of Salisbury the great detector of impostures who informs me that after the gentlemen who went and examined into the evidence were satisfied of its falsity Johnson wrote in their presence an account of it which was published in the newspapers and Gentleman s Magazine and undeceived the world eleven ninety six Page four hundred eight Subordination A D seventeen sixty three Our conversation proceeded Sir said he I am a friend to subordination as most conducive to the happiness of society eleven ninety seven There is a reciprocal pleasure in governing and being governed doctor Goldsmith is one of the first men we now have as an authour and he is a very worthy man too He has been loose in his principles but he is coming right Page four hundred nine Scotch Landlords AEtat fifty four I mentioned Mallet s tragedy of Elvira eleven ninety eight which had been acted the preceding winter at Drury lane and that the Honourable Andrew Erskine eleven ninety nine mister Dempster twelve hundred and myself had joined in writing a pamphlet entitled Critical Strictures against it twelve oh one That the mildness of Dempster s disposition had however relented and he had candidly said We have hardly a right to abuse this tragedy for bad as it is how vain should either of us be to write one not near so good JOHNSON Why no Sir this is not just reasoning You may abuse a tragedy though you cannot write one You may scold a carpenter who has made you a bad table though you cannot make a table It is not your trade to make tables When I talked to him of the paternal estate to which I was heir he said Sir let me tell you that to be a Scotch landlord where you have a number of families dependent upon you and attached to you is perhaps as high a situation as humanity can arrive at A merchant upon the Change of London with a hundred thousand pounds is nothing an English Duke with an immense fortune is nothing he has no tenants who consider themselves as under his patriarchal care and who will follow him to the field upon an emergency His notion of the dignity of a Scotch landlord had been formed upon what he had heard of the Highland Chiefs for it is long since a lowland landlord has been so curtailed in his feudal authority that he has little more influence over his tenants than an English landlord and of late years most of the Highland Chiefs have destroyed by means too well known the princely power which they once enjoyed twelve oh two Page four hundred ten Johnson s kindness of heart A D seventeen sixty three He proceeded Your going abroad Sir and breaking off idle habits may be of great importance to you I would go where there are courts and learned men There is a good deal of Spain that has not been perambulated I would have you go thither twelve oh three A man of inferiour talents to yours may furnish us with useful observations upon that country His supposing me at that period of life capable of writing an account of my travels that would deserve to be read elated me not a little I appeal to every impartial reader whether this faithful detail of his frankness complacency and kindness to a young man a stranger and a Scotchman does not refute the unjust opinion of the harshness of his general demeanour His occasional reproofs of folly impudence or impiety and even the sudden sallies of his constitutional irritability of temper which have been preserved for the poignancy of their wit have produced that opinion among those who have not considered that such instances though collected by missus Piozzi into a small volume and read over in a few hours were in fact scattered through a long series of years years in which his time was chiefly spent in instructing and delighting mankind by his writings and conversation in acts of piety to GOD and good will to men twelve oh four I complained to him that I had not yet acquired much knowledge and asked his advice as to my studies twelve oh five He said Don t talk of study now I will give you a plan but it will require some time to consider of it It is very good in you I replied to allow me to be with you thus Had it been foretold to me some years ago that I should pass an evening with the authour of The Rambler how should I have exulted What I then expressed was sincerely from the heart He was satisfied that it was and cordially answered Sir I am glad we have met I hope we shall pass many evenings and mornings too together We finished a couple of bottles of port and sat till between one and two in the morning Page four hundred eleven Oliver Goldsmith AEtat fifty four He wrote this year in the Critical Review the account of Telemachus a Mask by the Reverend George Graham of Eton College twelve oh six The subject of this beautiful poem was particularly interesting to Johnson who had much experience of the conflict of opposite principles which he describes as The contention between pleasure and virtue a struggle which will always be continued while the present system of nature shall subsist nor can history or poetry exhibit more than pleasure triumphing over virtue and virtue subjugating pleasure Page four hundred twelve Oliver Goldsmith A D seventeen sixty three As doctor Oliver Goldsmith will frequently appear in this narrative I shall endeavour to make my readers in some degree acquainted with his singular character He was a native of Ireland and a contemporary with mister Burke at Trinity College Dublin but did not then give much promise of future celebrity twelve oh seven He however observed to mister Malone that though he made no great figure in mathematicks twelve oh eight which was a study in much repute there he could turn an Ode of Horace into English better than any of them He afterwards studied physick at Edinburgh and upon the Continent and I have been informed was enabled to pursue his travels on foot twelve oh nine partly by demanding at Universities to enter the lists as a disputant by which according to the custom of many of them he was entitled to the premium of a crown when luckily for him his challenge was not accepted so that as I once observed to doctor Johnson he disputed his passage through Europe twelve ten He then came to England and was employed successively in the capacities of an usher to an academy a corrector of the press a reviewer and a writer for a news paper He had sagacity enough to cultivate assiduously the acquaintance of Johnson and his faculties were gradually enlarged by the contemplation of such a model To me and many others it appeared that he studiously copied the manner of Johnson twelve eleven though indeed upon a smaller scale At this time I think he had published nothing with his name twelve twelve though it was pretty generally known that one doctor Goldsmith was the authour of An Enquiry into the present State of polite Learning in Europe twelve thirteen and of The Citizen of the World twelve fourteen a series of letters supposed to be written from London by a Chinese No man had the art of displaying with more advantage as a writer whatever literary acquisitions he made Nihil quod tetigit non ornavit twelve fifteen His mind resembled a fertile but thin soil There was a quick but not a strong vegetation of whatever chanced to be thrown upon it No deep root could be struck The oak of the forest did not grow there but the elegant shrubbery and the fragrant parterre appeared in gay succession It has been generally circulated and believed that he was a mere fool in conversation twelve sixteen but in truth this has been greatly exaggerated He had no doubt a more than common share of that hurry of ideas which we often find in his countrymen and which sometimes produces a laughable confusion in expressing them He was very much what the French call un etourdi twelve seventeen and from vanity and an eager desire of being conspicuous wherever he was he frequently talked carelessly without knowledge of the subject or even without thought His person was short his countenance coarse and vulgar his deportment that of a scholar awkwardly affecting the easy gentleman twelve eighteen Those who were in any way distinguished excited envy in him to so ridiculous an excess that the instances of it are hardly credible twelve nineteen When accompanying two beautiful young ladies twelve twenty with their mother on a tour in France he was seriously angry that more attention was paid to them than to him twelve twenty one and once at the exhibition of the Fantoccini twelve twenty two in London when those who sat next him observed with what dexterity a puppet was made to toss a pike he could not bear that it should have such praise and exclaimed with some warmth Pshaw I can do it better myself twelve twenty three Page four hundred fifteen The Vicar of Wakefield AEtat fifty four He I am afraid had no settled system of any sort twelve twenty four so that his conduct must not be strictly scrutinised but his affections were social and generous and when he had money he gave it away very liberally His desire of imaginary consequence predominated over his attention to truth When he began to rise into notice he said he had a brother who was Dean of Durham twelve twenty five a fiction so easily detected that it is wonderful how he should have been so inconsiderate as to hazard it He boasted to me at this time of the power of his pen in commanding money which I believe was true in a certain degree though in the instance he gave he was by no means correct He told me that he had sold a novel for four hundred pounds This was his Vicar of Wakefield But Johnson informed me that he had made the bargain for Goldsmith and the price was sixty pounds twelve twenty six And Sir said he a sufficient price too when it was sold for then the fame of Goldsmith had not been elevated as it afterwards was by his Traveller and the bookseller had such faint hopes of profit by his bargain that he kept the manuscript by him a long time and did not publish it till after The Traveller had appeared twelve twenty seven Then to be sure it was accidentally worth more money twelve twenty eight missus Piozzi twelve twenty nine and Sir John Hawkins twelve thirty have strangely mis stated the history of Goldsmith s situation and Johnson s friendly interference when this novel was sold I shall give it authentically from Johnson s own exact narration I received one morning a message from poor Goldsmith that he was in great distress and as it was not in his power to come to me begging that I would come to him as soon as possible I sent him a guinea and promised to come to him directly I accordingly went as soon as I was drest and found that his landlady had arrested him for his rent at which he was in a violent passion I perceived that he had already changed my guinea and had got a bottle of Madeira and a glass before him twelve thirty one I put the cork into the bottle desired he would be calm and began to talk to him of the means by which he might be extricated He then told me that he had a novel ready for the press which he produced to me I looked into it and saw its merit told the landlady I should soon return and having gone to a bookseller sold it for sixty pounds I brought Goldsmith the money and he discharged his rent not without rating his landlady in a high tone for having used him so ill twelve thirty two Page four hundred seventeen doctor John Campbell AEtat fifty four My next meeting with Johnson was on Friday the first of July when he and I and doctor Goldsmith supped together at the Mitre I was before this time pretty well acquainted with Goldsmith who was one of the brightest ornaments of the Johnsonian school twelve thirty three Goldsmith s respectful attachment to Johnson was then at its height for his own literary reputation had not yet distinguished him so much as to excite a vain desire of competition with his great Master He had increased my admiration of the goodness of Johnson s heart by incidental remarks in the course of conversation such as when I mentioned mister Levet whom he entertained under his roof He is poor and honest which is recommendation enough to Johnson and when I wondered that he was very kind to a man of whom I had heard a very bad character He is now become miserable and that insures the protection of Johnson Goldsmith attempted this evening to maintain I suppose from an affectation of paradox that knowledge was not desirable on its own account for it often was a source of unhappiness JOHNSON Why Sir that knowledge may in some cases produce unhappiness I allow But upon the whole knowledge per se is certainly an object which every man would wish to attain although perhaps he may not take the trouble necessary for attaining it twelve thirty four Page four hundred eighteen Churchill s attack on Johnson A D seventeen sixty three doctor John Campbell twelve thirty five the celebrated political and biographical writer being mentioned Johnson said Campbell is a man of much knowledge and has a good share of imagination His Herinipptis Redivivus twelve thirty six is very entertaining as an account of the Hermetick philosophy and as furnishing a curious history of the extravagancies of the human mind If it were merely imaginary it would be nothing at all Campbell is not always rigidly careful of truth in his conversation but I do not believe there is any thing of this carelessness in his books twelve thirty seven Campbell is a good man a pious man I am afraid he has not been in the inside of a church for many years twelve thirty eight but he never passes a church without pulling off his hat twelve thirty nine This shews that he has good principles twelve forty I used to go pretty often to Campbell s on a Sunday evening twelve forty one till I began to consider that the shoals of Scotchmen who flocked about him might probably say when any thing of mine was well done Ay ay he has learnt this of CAWMELL Page four hundred nineteen Churchill s poetry AEtat fifty four He talked very contemptuously of Churchill s poetry observing that it had a temporary currency only from its audacity of abuse and being filled with living names and that it would sink into oblivion I ventured to hint that he was not quite a fair judge as Churchill had attacked him violently JOHNSON Nay Sir I am a very fair judge He did not attack me violently till he found I did not like his poetry twelve forty two and his attack on me shall not prevent me from continuing to say what I think of him from an apprehension that it may be ascribed to resentment No Sir I called the fellow a blockhead twelve forty three at first and I will call him a blockhead still However I will acknowledge that I have a better opinion of him now than I once had for he has shewn more fertility than I expected twelve forty four To be sure he is a tree that cannot produce good fruit he only bears crabs But Sir a tree that produces a great many crabs is better than a tree which produces only a few Page four hundred twenty Bonnell Thornton s ODE A D seventeen sixty three In this depreciation of Churchill s poetry I could not agree with him twelve forty five It is very true that the greatest part of it is upon the topicks of the day on which account as it brought him great fame and profit at the time twelve forty six it must proportionally slide out of the publick attention as other occasional objects succeed But Churchill had extraordinary vigour both of thought and expression His portraits of the players will ever be valuable to the true lovers of the drama and his strong caricatures of several eminent men of his age will not be forgotten by the curious Let me add that there are in his works many passages which are of a general nature twelve forty seven and his Prophecy of Famine is a poem of no ordinary merit It is indeed falsely injurious to Scotland but therefore may be allowed a greater share of invention Bonnell Thornton had just published a burlesque Ode on saint Cecilia s day adapted to the ancient British musick viz the salt box the Jew s harp the marrow bones and cleaver the humstrum or hurdy gurdy c Johnson praised its humour and seemed much diverted with it He repeated the following passage In strains more exalted the salt box shall join And clattering and battering and clapping combine With a rap and a tap while the hollow side sounds Up and down leaps the flap and with rattling rebounds twelve forty eight I mentioned the periodical paper called The Connoisseur twelve forty nine He said it wanted matter No doubt it has not the deep thinking of Johnson s writings But surely it has just views of the surface of life and a very sprightly manner His opinion of The World was not much higher than of the Connoisseur Page four hundred twenty one Tea with Miss Williams AEtat fifty four Let me here apologize for the imperfect manner in which I am obliged to exhibit Johnson s conversation at this period In the early part of my acquaintance with him I was so wrapt in admiration of his extraordinary colloquial talents and so little accustomed to his peculiar mode of expression that I found it extremely difficult to recollect and record his conversation with its genuine vigour and vivacity In progress of time when my mind was as it were strongly impregnated with the Johnsonian aether I could with much more facility and exactness carry in my memory and commit to paper the exuberant variety of his wisdom and wit At this time Miss Williams as she was then called though she did not reside with him in the Temple under his roof but had lodgings in Bolt court Fleet street twelve fifty had so much of his attention that he every night drank tea with her before he went home however late it might be and she always sat up for him This it may be fairly conjectured was not alone a proof of his regard for her but of his own unwillingness to go into solitude before that unseasonable hour at which he had habituated himself to expect the oblivion of repose doctor Goldsmith being a privileged man went with him this night strutting away and calling to me with an air of superiority like that of an esoterick over an exoterick disciple of a sage of antiquity I go to Miss Williams I confess I then envied him this mighty privilege of which he seemed so proud but it was not long before I obtained the same mark of distinction twelve fifty one On Tuesday the fifth of July I again visited Johnson He told me he had looked into the poems of a pretty voluminous writer mister now doctor John Ogilvie one of the Presbyterian ministers of Scotland which had lately come out but could find no thinking in them BOSWELL Is there not imagination in them Sir JOHNSON Why Sir there is in them what was imagination but it is no more imagination in him than sound is sound in the echo And his diction too is not his own We have long ago seen white robed innocence and flower bespangled meads Page four hundred twenty two The immensity of London A D seventeen sixty three Talking of London he observed Sir if you wish to have a just notion of the magnitude of this city you must not be satisfied with seeing its great streets and squares but must survey the innumerable little lanes and courts It is not in the showy evolutions of buildings but in the multiplicity of human habitations which are crouded together that the wonderful immensity of London consists I have often amused myself with thinking how different a place London is to different people They whose narrow minds are contracted to the consideration of some one particular pursuit view it only through that medium A politician thinks of it merely as the seat of government in its different departments a grazier as a vast market for cattle a mercantile man as a place where a prodigious deal of business is done upon Change a dramatick enthusiast as the grand scene of theatrical entertainments a man of pleasure as an assemblage of taverns and the great emporium for ladies of easy virtue But the intellectual man is struck with it as comprehending the whole of human life in all its variety the contemplation of which is inexhaustible twelve fifty two Page four hundred twenty three Goldsmith s eagerness to shine AEtat fifty four On Wednesday July six he was engaged to sup with me at my lodgings in Downing street Westminster But on the preceding night my landlord having behaved very rudely to me and some company who were with me I had resolved not to remain another night in his house I was exceedingly uneasy at the aukward appearance I supposed I should make to Johnson and the other gentlemen whom I had invited not being able to receive them at home and being obliged to order supper at the Mitre I went to Johnson in the morning and talked of it as a serious distress He laughed and said Consider Sir how insignificant this will appear a twelvemonth hence Were this consideration to be applied to most of the little vexatious incidents of life by which our quiet is too often disturbed it would prevent many painful sensations I have tried it frequently with good effect There is nothing continued he in this mighty misfortune nay we shall be better at the Mitre I told him that I had been at Sir John Fielding s office complaining of my landlord and had been informed that though I had taken my lodgings for a year I might upon proof of his bad behaviour quit them when I pleased without being under an obligation to pay rent for any longer time than while I possessed them The fertility of Johnson s mind could shew itself even upon so small a matter as this Why Sir said he I suppose this must be the law since you have been told so in Bow street But if your landlord could hold you to your bargain and the lodgings should be yours for a year you may certainly use them as you think fit So Sir you may quarter two life guardsmen upon him or you may send the greatest scoundrel you can find into your apartments or you may say that you want to make some experiments in natural philosophy and may burn a large quantity of assafoetida in his house I had as my guests this evening at the Mitre tavern doctor Johnson doctor Goldsmith mister Thomas Davies mister Eccles an Irish gentleman for whose agreeable company I was obliged to mister Davies and the Reverend mister John Ogilvie twelve fifty three who was desirous of being in company with my illustrious friend while I in my turn was proud to have the honour of shewing one of my countrymen upon what easy terms Johnson permitted me to live with him Page four hundred twenty four The lawfulness of rebellion A D seventeen sixty three Goldsmith as usual endeavoured with too much eagerness to shine twelve fifty four and disputed very warmly with Johnson against the well known maxim of the British constitution the King can do no wrong affirming that what was morally false could not be politically true and as the King might in the exercise of his regal power command and cause the doing of what was wrong it certainly might be said in sense and in reason that he could do wrong JOHNSON Sir you are to consider that in our constitution according to its true principles the King is the head he is supreme he is above every thing and there is no power by which he can be tried Therefore it is Sir that we hold the King can do no wrong that whatever may happen to be wrong in government may not be above our reach by being ascribed to Majesty twelve fifty five Redress is always to be had against oppression by punishing the immediate agents The King though he should command cannot force a Judge to condemn a man unjustly therefore it is the Judge whom we prosecute and punish Political institutions are formed upon the consideration of what will most frequently tend to the good of the whole although now and then exceptions may occur Thus it is better in general that a nation should have a supreme legislative power although it may at times be abused And then Sir there is this consideration that if the abuse be enormous Nature will rise up and claiming her original rights overturn a corrupt political system I mark this animated sentence with peculiar pleasure as a noble instance of that truly dignified spirit of freedom which ever glowed in his heart though he was charged with slavish tenets by superficial observers because he was at all times indignant against that false patriotism that pretended love of freedom that unruly restlessness which is inconsistent with the stable authority of any good government twelve fifty six This generous sentiment which he uttered with great fervour struck me exceedingly and stirred my blood to that pitch of fancied resistance the possibility of which I am glad to keep in mind but to which I trust I never shall be forced Page four hundred twenty five A Scotchman s noblest prospect AEtat fifty four Great abilities said he are not requisite for an Historian for in historical composition all the greatest powers of the human mind are quiescent He has facts ready to his hand so there is no exercise of invention Imagination is not required in any high degree only about as much as is used in the lower kinds of poetry Some penetration accuracy and colouring will fit a man for the task if he can give the application which is necessary twelve fifty seven Bayle s Dictionary is a very useful work for those to consult who love the biographical part of literature which is what I love most twelve fifty eight Talking of the eminent writers in Queen Anne s reign he observed I think doctor Arbuthnot the first man among them twelve fifty nine He was the most universal genius being an excellent physician a man of deep learning and a man of much humour mister Addison was to be sure a great man his learning was not profound but his morality his humour and his elegance of writing set him very high mister Ogilvie was unlucky enough to choose for the topick of his conversation the praises of his native country He began with saying that there was very rich land round Edinburgh Goldsmith who had studied physick there contradicted this very untruly with a sneering laugh twelve sixty Disconcerted a little by this mister Ogilvie then took new ground where I suppose he thought himself perfectly safe for he observed that Scotland had a great many noble wild prospects JOHNSON I believe Sir you have a great many Norway too has noble wild prospects and Lapland is remarkable for prodigious noble wild prospects But Sir let me tell you the noblest prospect which a Scotchman ever sees is the high road that leads him to England twelve sixty one Page four hundred twenty six The influence of weather A D seventeen sixty three This unexpected and pointed sally produced a roar of applause After all however those who admire the rude grandeur of Nature cannot deny it to Caledonia On Saturday July nine I found Johnson surrounded with a numerous levee but have not preserved any part of his conversation On the fourteenth we had another evening by ourselves at the Mitre It happening to be a very rainy night I made some common place observations on the relaxation of nerves and depression of spirits which such weather occasioned twelve sixty two adding however that it was good for the vegetable creation Johnson who as we have already seen twelve sixty three denied that the temperature of the air had any influence on the human frame answered with a smile of ridicule Why yes Sir it is good for vegetables and for the animals who eat those vegetables and for the animals who eat those animals This observation of his aptly enough introduced a good supper and I soon forgot in Johnson s company the influence of a moist atmosphere Page four hundred twenty seven Boswell s father AEtat fifty four Feeling myself now quite at ease as his companion though I had all possible reverence for him I expressed a regret that I could not be so easy with my father twelve sixty four though he was not much older than Johnson and certainly however respectable had not more learning and greater abilities to depress me I asked him the reason of this JOHNSON Why Sir I am a man of the world I live in the world and I take in some degree the colour of the world as it moves along Your father is a Judge in a remote part of the island and all his notions are taken from the old world Besides Sir there must always be a struggle between a father and son while one aims at power and the other at independence twelve sixty five I said I was afraid my father would force me to be a lawyer JOHNSON Sir you need not be afraid of his forcing you to be a laborious practising lawyer that is not in his power For as the proverb says One man may lead a horse to the water but twenty cannot make him drink He may be displeased that you are not what he wishes you to be but that displeasure will not go far If he insists only on your having as much law as is necessary for a man of property and then endeavours to get you into Parliament he is quite in the right He enlarged very convincingly upon the excellence of rhyme over blank verse in English poetry twelve sixty six I mentioned to him that doctor Adam Smith in his lectures upon composition when I studied under him in the College of Glasgow had maintained the same opinion strenuously and I repeated some of his arguments JOHNSON Sir I was once in company with Smith and we did not take to each other twelve sixty seven but had I known that he loved rhyme as much as you tell me he does I should have HUGGED him Page four hundred twenty eight The evidences of Christianity A D seventeen sixty three Talking of those who denied the truth of Christianity he said It is always easy to be on the negative side If a man were now to deny that there is salt upon the table you could not reduce him to an absurdity Come let us try this a little further I deny that Canada is taken and I can support my denial by pretty good arguments The French are a much more numerous people than we and it is not likely that they would allow us to take it But the ministry have assured us in all the formality of The Gazette that it is taken Very true But the ministry have put us to an enormous expence by the war in America and it is their interest to persuade us that we have got something for our money But the fact is confirmed by thousands of men who were at the taking of it Ay but these men have still more interest in deceiving us They don t want that you should think the French have beat them but that they have beat the French Now suppose you should go over and find that it is really taken that would only satisfy yourself for when you come home we will not believe you We will say you have been bribed Yet Sir notwithstanding all these plausible objections we have no doubt that Canada is really ours Such is the weight of common testimony How much stronger are the evidences of the Christian religion Idleness is a disease which must be combated but I would not advise a rigid adherence to a particular plan of study I myself have never persisted in any plan for two days together A man ought to read just as inclination leads him for what he reads as a task will do him little good A young man should read five hours in a day and so may acquire a great deal of knowledge twelve sixty eight Page four hundred twenty nine Johnson s pension AEtat fifty four To a man of vigorous intellect and arduous curiosity like his own reading without a regular plan may be beneficial though even such a man must submit to it if he would attain a full understanding of any of the sciences To such a degree of unrestrained frankness had he now accustomed me that in the course of this evening I talked of the numerous reflections which had been thrown out against him twelve sixty nine on account of his having accepted a pension from his present Majesty Why Sir said he with a hearty laugh it is a mighty foolish noise that they make twelve seventy I have accepted of a pension as a reward which has been thought due to my literary merit and now that I have this pension I am the same man in every respect that I have ever been twelve seventy one I retain the same principles It is true that I cannot now curse smiling the House of Hanover nor would it be decent for me to drink King James s health in the wine that King George gives me money to pay for But Sir I think that the pleasure of cursing the House of Hanover and drinking King James s health are amply overbalanced by three hundred pounds a year Page four hundred thirty Johnson s Jacobitism A D seventeen sixty three There was here most certainly an affectation of more Jacobitism than he really had and indeed an intention of admitting for the moment in a much greater extent than it really existed the charge of disaffection imputed to him by the world twelve seventy two merely for the purpose of shewing how dexterously he could repel an attack even though he were placed in the most disadvantageous position for I have heard him declare that if holding up his right hand would have secured victory at Culloden to Prince Charles s army he was not sure he would have held it up so little confidence had he in the right claimed by the house of Stuart and so fearful was he of the consequences of another revolution on the throne of Great Britain and mister Topham Beauclerk assured me he had heard him say this before he had his pension At another time he said to mister Langton Nothing has ever offered that has made it worth my while to consider the question fully He however also said to the same gentleman talking of King James the Second It was become impossible for him to reign any longer in this country twelve seventy three He no doubt had an early attachment to the House of Stuart but his zeal had cooled as his reason strengthened Indeed I heard him once say that after the death of a violent Whig with whom he used to contend with great eagerness he felt his Toryism much abated twelve seventy four I suppose he meant mister Walmsley twelve seventy five Page four hundred thirty one Whiggism AEtat fifty four Yet there is no doubt that at earlier periods he was wont often to exercise both his pleasantry and ingenuity in talking Jacobitism My much respected friend doctor Douglas now Bishop of Salisbury has favoured me with the following admirable instance from his Lordship s own recollection One day when dining at old mister Langton s where Miss Roberts twelve seventy six his niece was one of the company Johnson with his usual complacent attention to the fair sex took her by the hand and said My dear I hope you are a Jacobite Old mister Langton who though a high and steady Tory was attached to the present Royal Family seemed offended and asked Johnson with great warmth what he could mean by putting such a question to his niece Why Sir said Johnson I meant no offence to your niece I meant her a great compliment A Jacobite Sir believes in the divine right of Kings He that believes in the divine right of Kings believes in a Divinity A Jacobite believes in the divine right of Bishops He that believes in the divine right of Bishops believes in the divine authority of the Christian religion Therefore Sir a Jacobite is neither an Atheist nor a Deist That cannot be said of a Whig for Whiggism is a negation of all principle twelve seventy seven He advised me when abroad to be as much as I could with the Professors in the Universities and with the Clergy for from their conversation I might expect the best accounts of every thing in whatever country I should be with the additional advantage of keeping my learning alive It will be observed that when giving me advice as to my travels doctor Johnson did not dwell upon cities and palaces and pictures and shows and Arcadian scenes He was of Lord Essex s opinion who advises his kinsman Roger Earl of Rutland rather to go an hundred miles to speak with one wise man than five miles to see a fair town twelve seventy eight Page four hundred thirty two Lord Hailes A D seventeen sixty three I described to him an impudent fellow twelve seventy nine from Scotland who affected to be a savage and railed at all established systems JOHNSON There is nothing surprizing in this Sir He wants to make himself conspicuous He would tumble in a hogstye as long as you looked at him and called to him to come out But let him alone never mind him and he ll soon give it over I added that the same person maintained that there was no distinction between virtue and vice JOHNSON Why Sir if the fellow does not think as he speaks he is lying and I see not what honour he can propose to himself from having the character of a lyar But if he does really think that there is no distinction between virtue and vice why Sir when he leaves our houses let us count our spoons twelve eighty Sir David Dalrymple now one of the Judges of Scotland by the title of Lord Hailes had contributed much to increase my high opinion of Johnson on account of his writings long before I attained to a personal acquaintance with him I in return had informed Johnson of Sir David s eminent character for learning and religion twelve eighty one and Johnson was so much pleased that at one of our evening meetings he gave him for his toast I at this time kept up a very frequent correspondence with Sir David and I read to doctor Johnson to night the following passage from the letter which I had last received from him It gives me pleasure to think that you have obtained the friendship of mister Samuel Johnson He is one of the best moral writers which England has produced At the same time I envy you the free and undisguised converse with such a man May I beg you to present my best respects to him and to assure him of the veneration which I entertain for the authour of the Rambler and of Rasselas Let me recommend this last work to you with the Rambler you certainly are acquainted In Rasselas you will see a tender hearted operator who probes the wound only to heal it Swift on the contrary mangles human nature He cuts and slashes as if he took pleasure in the operation like the tyrant who said Ita feri ut se sentiat emori twelve eighty two Page four hundred thirty three Journal keeping AEtat fifty four Johnson seemed to be much gratified by this just and well turned compliment He recommended to me to keep a journal of my life full and unreserved twelve eighty three He said it would be a very good exercise and would yield me great satisfaction when the particulars were faded from my remembrance I was uncommonly fortunate in having had a previous coincidence of opinion with him upon this subject for I had kept such a journal for some time twelve eighty four and it was no small pleasure to me to have this to tell him and to receive his approbation He counselled me to keep it private and said I might surely have a friend who would burn it in case of my death From this habit I have been enabled to give the world so many anecdotes which would otherwise have been lost to posterity I mentioned that I was afraid I put into my journal too many little incidents JOHNSON There is nothing Sir too little for so little a creature as man It is by studying little things that we attain the great art of having as little misery and as much happiness as possible twelve eighty five Page four hundred thirty four Sir Thomas Robinson A D seventeen sixty three Next morning mister Dempster happened to call on me and was so much struck even with the imperfect account which I gave him of doctor Johnson s conversation that to his honour be it recorded when I complained that drinking port and sitting up late with him affected my nerves for some time after he said One had better be palsied at eighteen than not keep company with such a man twelve eighty six Page four hundred thirty five The King of Prussia AEtat fifty four On Tuesday July eighteen twelve eighty seven I found tall Sir Thomas Robinson twelve eighty eight sitting with Johnson Sir Thomas said that the king of Prussia valued himself upon three things upon being a hero a musician and an authour JOHNSON Pretty well Sir for one man As to his being an authour I have not looked at his poetry but his prose is poor stuff He writes just as you might suppose Voltaire s footboy to do who has been his amanuensis He has such parts as the valet might have and about as much of the colouring of the style as might be got by transcribing his works When I was at Ferney I repeated this to Voltaire in order to reconcile him somewhat to Johnson whom he in affecting the English mode of expression had previously characterised as a superstitious dog but after hearing such a criticism on Frederick the Great with whom he was then on bad terms he exclaimed An honest fellow twelve eighty nine But I think the criticism much too severe for the Memoirs of the House of Brandenburgh are written as well as many works of that kind His poetry for the style of which he himself makes a frank apology Jargonnant un Francois barbare though fraught with pernicious ravings of infidelity has in many places great animation and in some a pathetick tenderness twelve ninety Upon this contemptuous animadversion on the King of Prussia I observed to Johnson It would seem then Sir that much less parts are necessary to make a King than to make an Authour for the King of Prussia is confessedly the greatest King now in Europe yet you think he makes a very poor figure as an Authour Page four hundred thirty six Johnson s library A D seventeen sixty three mister Levet this day shewed me doctor Johnson s library which was contained in two garrets over his Chambers where Lintot son of the celebrated bookseller of that name had formerly his warehouse twelve ninety one I found a number of good books but very dusty and in great confusion twelve ninety two The floor was strewed with manuscript leaves in Johnson s own hand writing which I beheld with a degree of veneration supposing they perhaps might contain portions of The Rambler or of Rasselas I observed an apparatus for chymical experiments of which Johnson was all his life very fond twelve ninety three The place seemed to be very favourable for retirement and meditation Johnson told me that he went up thither without mentioning it to his servant when he wanted to study secure from interruption for he would not allow his servant to say he was not at home when he really was A servant s strict regard for truth said he must be weakened by such a practice A philosopher may know that it is merely a form of denial but few servants are such nice distinguishers If I accustom a servant to tell a lie for me have I not reason to apprehend that he will tell many lies for himself I am however satisfied that every servant of any degree of intelligence understands saying his master is not at home not at all as the affirmation of a fact but as customary words intimating that his master wishes not to be seen so that there can be no bad effect from it Page four hundred thirty seven Copyright in books AEtat fifty four mister Temple now vicar of saint Gluvias Cornwall twelve ninety four who had been my intimate friend for many years had at this time chambers in Farrar s buildings at the bottom of Inner Temple lane which he kindly lent me upon my quitting my lodgings he being to return to Trinity Hall Cambridge I found them particularly convenient for me as they were so near doctor Johnson s On Wednesday July twenty doctor Johnson mister Dempster and my uncle doctor Boswell who happened to be now in London 
2096-136868-0000	train-other-500	supped with me at these Chambers JOHNSON Pity is not natural to man Children are always cruel Savages are always cruel
2096-136868-0001	train-other-500	Pity is acquired and improved by the cultivation of reason We may have uneasy sensations from seeing a creature in distress without pity for we have not pity unless we wish to relieve them
2096-136868-0002	train-other-500	When I am on my way to dine with a friend and finding it late have bid the coachman make haste if I happen to attend when he whips his horses I may feel unpleasantly that the animals are put to pain but I do not wish him to desist
2096-136868-0003	train-other-500	No Sir I wish him to drive on mister Alexander Donaldson bookseller of Edinburgh had for some time opened a shop in London and sold his cheap editions of the most popular English books
none	none	 in defiance of the supposed common law right of Literary Property twelve ninety five Johnson though he concurred in the opinion which was afterwards sanctioned by a judgement of the House of Lords twelve ninety six that there was no such right 
2096-136868-0004	train-other-500	was at this time very angry that the Booksellers of London for whom he uniformly professed much regard
none	none	 should suffer from an invasion of what they had ever considered to be secure and he was loud and violent against mister Donaldson 
2096-136868-0005	train-other-500	He is a fellow who takes advantage of the law to injure his brethren for notwithstanding that the statute secures only fourteen years of exclusive right
none	none	 it has always been understood by the trade twelve ninety seven that he who buys the copyright of a book from the authour obtains a perpetual property 
2096-136868-0006	train-other-500	and upon that belief numberless bargains are made to transfer that property after the expiration of the statutory term Now Donaldson I say takes advantage here
2096-136868-0007	train-other-500	of people who have really an equitable title from usage and if we consider how few of the books of which they buy the property succeed so well as to bring profit we should be of opinion
2096-136868-0008	train-other-500	that the term of fourteen years is too short it should be sixty years DEMPSTER
none	none	 Donaldson Sir is anxious for the encouragement of literature He reduces the price of books so that poor students may buy them twelve ninety eight JOHNSON laughing Well Sir allowing that to be his motive he is no better than Robin Hood who robbed the rich in order to give to the poor Page four hundred thirty nine Humes style AEtat fifty four It is remarkable that when the great question concerning Literary Property came to be ultimately tried before the supreme tribunal of this country in consequence of the very spirited exertions of mister Donaldson twelve ninety nine doctor Johnson was zealous against a perpetuity but he thought that the term of the 
2096-136868-0009	train-other-500	exclusive right of authours should be considerably enlarged He was then for granting a hundred years The conversation now turned upon mister David Hume s style
none	none	 JOHNSON Why Sir his style is not English the structure of his sentences is French thirteen hundred Now the French structure and the English structure may in the nature of things be equally good But if you allow that the English language is established he is wrong My name might originally have been Nicholson as well as Johnson but were you to call me Nicholson now you would call me very absurdly Page four hundred forty Merit set against fortune A D seventeen sixty three Rousseau s treatise on the inequality of mankind thirteen oh one was at this time a fashionable topick It gave rise to an observation by mister Dempster that the advantages of fortune and rank were nothing to a wise man 
2096-136868-0010	train-other-500	who ought to value only merit JOHNSON If man were a savage living in the woods by himself this might be true but in civilized society we all depend upon each other
2096-136868-0011	train-other-500	and our happiness is very much owing to the good opinion of mankind
none	none	 Now Sir in civilized society external advantages make us more respected A man with a good coat upon his back meets with a better reception than he who has a bad one thirteen oh two Page four hundred forty one The advantages of poverty AEtat fifty four Sir you may analyse this and say what is there in it But that will avail you nothing for it is a part of a general system 
2096-136868-0012	train-other-500	Pound saint Paul s Church into atoms and consider any single atom it is to be sure good for nothing but put all these atoms together and you have saint Paul s Church So it is with human felicity
2096-136868-0013	train-other-500	which is made up of many ingredients each of which may be shewn to be very insignificant In civilized society personal merit will not serve you so much as money will Sir you may make the experiment
2096-136868-0014	train-other-500	Go into the street and give one man a lecture on morality and another a shilling and see which will respect you most If you wish only to support nature
none	none	 Sir William Petty fixes your allowance at three pounds a year thirteen oh three but as times are much altered let us call it six pounds 
2096-136868-0015	train-other-500	This sum will fill your belly shelter you from the weather and even get you a strong lasting coat
none	none	 supposing it to be made of good bull s hide Now Sir 
2096-136868-0016	train-other-500	all beyond this is artificial and is desired in order to obtain a greater degree of respect from our fellow creatures And Sir if six hundred pounds a year procure a man more consequence
2096-136868-0017	train-other-500	and of course more happiness than six pounds a year
none	none	 the same proportion will hold as to six thousand 
2096-136868-0018	train-other-500	and so on as far as opulence can be carried Perhaps he who has a large fortune may not be so happy as he who has a small one but that must proceed from other causes
none	none	 than from his having the large fortune 
2096-136868-0019	train-other-500	for caeteris paribus he who is rich in a civilized society must be happier than he who is poor as riches if properly used and it is a man s own fault if they are not
2096-136868-0020	train-other-500	must be productive of the highest advantages Money to be sure of itself is of no use for its only use is to part with it Rousseau and all those who deal in paradoxes
none	none	 are led away by a childish desire of novelty thirteen oh four When I was a boy I used always to choose the wrong side of a debate 
2096-136868-0021	train-other-500	because most ingenious things that is to say most new things could be said upon it Sir there is nothing for which you may not muster up more plausible arguments
2096-136868-0022	train-other-500	than those which are urged against wealth and other external advantages Why now there is stealing why should it be thought a crime
none	none	 When we consider by what unjust methods property has been often acquired 
2096-136868-0023	train-other-500	and that what was unjustly got it must be unjust to keep where is the harm in one man s taking the property of another from him Besides Sir when we consider the bad use that many people make of their property
2096-136868-0024	train-other-500	and how much better use the thief may make of it it may be defended as a very allowable practice Yet Sir the experience of mankind has discovered stealing to be so very bad a thing
2096-136868-0025	train-other-500	that they make no scruple to hang a man for it When I was running about this town a very poor fellow
none	none	 I was a great arguer for the advantages of poverty 
2096-136868-0026	train-other-500	but I was at the same time very sorry to be poor Sir all the arguments which are brought to represent poverty as no evil shew it to be evidently a great evil
2096-136868-0027	train-other-500	You never find people labouring to convince you
none	none	 that you may live very happily upon a plentiful fortune So you hear people talking how miserable a King must be and yet they all wish to be in his place thirteen oh five Page four hundred forty two Great Kings always social A D seventeen sixty three It was suggested that Kings must be unhappy because they are deprived of the greatest of all satisfactions easy and unreserved society 
2096-136868-0028	train-other-500	JOHNSON That is an ill founded notion Being a King does not exclude a man from such society Great Kings have always been social
none	none	 The King of Prussia 
2096-136868-0029	train-other-500	the only great King at present
none	none	 is very social thirteen oh six Charles the Second 
2096-136868-0030	train-other-500	the last King of England who was a man of parts was social and our Henrys and Edwards were all social mister Dempster having endeavoured to maintain that intrinsick merit
2096-136868-0031	train-other-500	ought to make the only distinction amongst mankind JOHNSON Why Sir mankind have found that this cannot be How shall we determine the proportion of intrinsick merit
2096-136868-0032	train-other-500	Were that to be the only distinction amongst mankind we should soon quarrel about the degrees of it Were all distinctions abolished the strongest would not long acquiesce
2096-136868-0033	train-other-500	but would endeavour to obtain a superiority by their bodily strength But Sir as subordination is very necessary for society and contensions for superiority very dangerous mankind that is to say
2096-136868-0034	train-other-500	all civilized nations have settled it upon a plain invariable principle
none	none	 A man is born to hereditary rank or his being appointed to certain offices gives him a certain rank Subordination tends greatly to human happiness Were we all upon an equality we should have no other enjoyment than mere animal pleasure thirteen oh seven Page four hundred forty three Johnson s respect for rank AEtat fifty four I said I considered distinction of rank to be of so much importance in civilised society that if I were asked on the same day to dine with the first Duke in England and with the first man in Britain for genius I should hesitate which to prefer JOHNSON 
2096-136868-0035	train-other-500	To be sure Sir if you were to dine only once and it were never to be known where you dined you would choose rather to dine with the first man for genius but to gain most respect
2096-136868-0036	train-other-500	you should dine with the first Duke in England For nine people in ten that you meet with would have a higher opinion of you for having dined with a Duke
none	none	 and the great genius himself would receive you better because you had been with the great Duke He took care to guard himself against any possible suspicion that his settled principles of reverence for rank and respect for wealth were at all owing to mean or interested motives 
2096-136868-0037	train-other-500	for he asserted his own independence as a literary man No man said he who ever lived by literature has lived more independently than I have done He said he had taken longer time
none	none	 than he needed to have done in composing his Dictionary He received our compliments upon that great work with complacency and told us that the Academy della Crusca thirteen oh eight could scarcely believe that it was done by one man Page four hundred forty four Sceptical innovators A D seventeen sixty three Next morning I found him alone and have preserved the following fragments of his conversation Of a gentleman thirteen oh nine who was mentioned 
2096-136868-0038	train-other-500	he said I have not met with any man for a long time who has given me such general displeasure He is totally unfixed in his principles and wants to puzzle other people
2096-136868-0039	train-other-500	I said his principles had been poisoned by a noted infidel writer but that he was nevertheless a benevolent good man JOHNSON We can have no dependance upon that instinctive
2096-136868-0040	train-other-500	that constitutional goodness which is not founded upon principle I grant you that such a man may be a very amiable member of society I can conceive him placed in such a situation
2096-136868-0041	train-other-500	that he is not much tempted to deviate from what is right and as every man prefers virtue when there is not some strong incitement to transgress its precepts I can conceive him doing nothing wrong
2096-136868-0042	train-other-500	But if such a man stood in need of money I should not like to trust him and I should certainly not trust him with young ladies for there there is always temptation
2096-136868-0043	train-other-500	Hume and other sceptical innovators are vain men and will gratify themselves at any expence
none	none	 Truth will not afford sufficient food to their vanity 
2096-136868-0044	train-other-500	so they have betaken themselves to errour Truth Sir is a cow which will yield such people no more milk
none	none	 and so they are gone to milk the bull thirteen ten If I could have allowed myself to gratify my vanity 
2096-136868-0045	train-other-500	at the expence of truth what fame might I have acquired Every thing which Hume has advanced against Christianity had passed through my mind long before he wrote Always remember this
2096-136868-0046	train-other-500	that after a system is well settled upon positive evidence a few partial objections ought not to shake it The human mind is so limited that it cannot take in all the parts of a subject
2096-136868-0047	train-other-500	so that there may be objections raised against any thing There are objections against a plenum
none	none	 and objections against a vacuum yet one of them must certainly be true thirteen eleven Page four hundred forty five The proofs of Christianity AEtat fifty four I mentioned Hume s argument against the belief of miracles that it is more probable that the witnesses to the truth of them are mistaken or speak falsely than that the miracles should be true thirteen twelve JOHNSON 
2096-136868-0048	train-other-500	Why Sir the great difficulty of proving miracles should make us very cautious in believing them But let us consider although GOD has made Nature to operate by certain fixed laws
2096-136868-0049	train-other-500	yet it is not unreasonable to think that he may suspend those laws in order to establish a system highly advantageous to mankind Now the Christian religion is a most beneficial system
none	none	 as it gives us light and certainty where we were before in darkness and doubt 
2096-136868-0050	train-other-500	The miracles which prove it are attested by men who had no interest in deceiving us but who on the contrary were told that they should suffer persecution and did actually lay down their lives in confirmation
2096-136868-0051	train-other-500	of the truth of the facts which they asserted Indeed for some centuries the heathens did not pretend to deny the miracles but said they were performed by the aid of evil spirits
2096-136868-0052	train-other-500	This is a circumstance of great weight Then Sir when we take the proofs derived from prophecies which have been so exactly fulfilled we have most satisfactory evidence
2096-136868-0053	train-other-500	Supposing a miracle possible as to which in my opinion there can be no doubt we have as strong evidence for the miracles in support of Christianity as the nature of the thing admits

2096-136868-0054	train-other-500	said he for the mistress of it is a good civil woman and has not much business Sir I love the acquaintance of young people because in the first place I don t like to think myself growing old
2096-136868-0055	train-other-500	In the next place young acquaintances must last longest if they do last and then Sir young men have more virtue than old men they have more generous sentiments
none	none	 in every respect thirteen fourteen I love the young dogs of this age 
2096-136868-0056	train-other-500	they have more wit and humour and knowledge of life than we had but then the dogs are not so good scholars Sir in my early years I read very hard It is a sad reflection but a true one
none	none	 that I knew almost as much at eighteen as I do now thirteen fifteen My judgement to be sure was not so good but I had all the facts I remember very well when I was at Oxford an old gentleman said to me Young man ply your book diligently now and acquire a stock of knowledge for when years come upon you you will find that poring upon books will be but an irksome task Page four hundred forty six Remedies for melancholy A D seventeen sixty three This account of his reading given by himself in plain words sufficiently confirms what I have already advanced upon the disputed question as to his application It reconciles any seeming inconsistency in his way of talking upon it at different times and shews that idleness and reading hard were with him relative terms the import of which as used by him must be gathered from a comparison with what scholars of different degrees of ardour and assiduity 
2096-136868-0057	train-other-500	have been known to do And let it be remembered that he was now talking spontaneously
none	none	 and expressing his genuine sentiments whereas at other times he might be induced 
2096-136868-0058	train-other-500	from his spirit of contradiction or more properly from his love of argumentative contest to speak lightly of his own application to study It is pleasing to consider that the old gentleman s gloomy prophecy
2096-136868-0059	train-other-500	as to the irksomeness of books to men of an advanced age which is too often fulfilled was so far from being verified in Johnson
none	none	 that his ardour for literature never failed and his last writings had more ease and vivacity than any of his earlier productions 
2096-136868-0060	train-other-500	He mentioned to me now for the first time that he had been distrest by melancholy and for that reason
none	none	 had been obliged to fly from study and meditation to the dissipating variety of life 
2096-136868-0061	train-other-500	Against melancholy he recommended constant occupation of mind a great deal of exercise moderation in eating and drinking and especially to shun drinking at night He said melancholy people
2096-136868-0062	train-other-500	were apt to fly to intemperance for relief
none	none	 but that it sunk them much deeper in misery thirteen sixteen He observed that labouring men who work hard and live sparingly are seldom or never troubled with low spirits Page four hundred forty seven missus Macaulay s footman AEtat fifty four Page four hundred forty eight Levelling up A D seventeen sixty three He again insisted on the duty of maintaining subordination of rank Sir I would no more deprive a nobleman of his respect than of his money I consider myself as acting a part in the great system of society and I do to others as I would have them to do to me I would behave to a nobleman as I should expect he would behave to me were I a nobleman and he Sam Johnson Sir there is one missus Macaulay thirteen seventeen in this town a great republican One day when I was at her house 
2096-136868-0063	train-other-500	I put on a very grave countenance and said to her Madam I am now become a convert to your way of thinking I am convinced that all mankind are upon an equal footing and to give you an unquestionable proof Madam
none	none	 that I am in earnest 
2096-136868-0064	train-other-500	here is a very sensible civil well behaved fellow citizen your footman
none	none	 I desire that he may be allowed to sit down and dine with us thirteen eighteen I thus Sir shewed her the absurdity of the levelling doctrine 
2096-136868-0065	train-other-500	She has never liked me since Sir your levellers wish to level down as far as themselves but they cannot bear levelling up to themselves They would all have some people under them
2096-136868-0066	train-other-500	why not then have some people above them I mentioned a certain authour who disgusted me by his forwardness and by shewing no deference to noblemen
none	none	 into whose company he was admitted

2096-136868-0072	train-other-500	but being originally poor he has got a love of mean company and low jocularity a very bad thing Sir To laugh is good as to talk is good

2096-136868-0074	train-other-500	to a better motive than to vanity for they afford unquestionable evidence of his tenderness and complacency which some while they were forced to acknowledge his great powers have been so strenuous to deny He maintained that a boy at school was

2096-136868-0075	train-other-500	from which I have never yet varied that a man is happier and I enlarged upon the anxiety and sufferings which are endured at school JOHNSON

none	none	 He this evening drank a bumper to Sir David Dalrymple thirteen twenty nine as a man of worth a scholar and a wit

July twenty six I found mister Johnson alone It was a very wet day and I again complained of the disagreeable effects of such weather JOHNSON Sir this is all imagination which physicians encourage for man lives in air as a fish lives in water so that if the atmosphere press heavy from above there is an equal resistance from below To be sure bad weather is hard upon people who are obliged to be abroad and men cannot labour so well in the open air in bad weather as in good but Sir a smith or a taylor whose work is within doors will surely do as much in rainy weather as in fair Some very delicate frames indeed may be affected by wet weather but not common constitutions thirteen thirty We talked of the education of children and I asked him what he thought was best to teach them first JOHNSON Sir it is no matter what you teach them first any more than what leg you shall put into your breeches first Sir you may stand disputing which is best to put in first but in the mean time your breech is bare Sir while you are considering which of two things you should teach your child first another boy has learnt them both On Thursday July twenty eight we again supped in private at the Turk s Head coffee house JOHNSON Swift has a higher reputation than he deserves His excellence is strong sense for his humour though very well is not remarkably good I doubt whether The Tale of a Tub be his for he never owned it and it is much above his usual manner thirteen thirty one Page four hundred fifty three mister Thomas Sheridan s dulness AEtat fifty four Thompson I think had as much of the poet about him as most writers Every thing appeared to him through the medium of his favourite pursuit He could not have viewed those two candles burning but with a poetical eye thirteen thirty two Has not thirteen thirty three a great deal of wit Sir JOHNSON I do not think so Sir He is indeed continually attempting wit but he fails And I have no more pleasure in hearing a man attempting wit and failing than in seeing a man trying to leap over a ditch and tumbling into it He laughed heartily when I mentioned to him a saying of his concerning mister Thomas Sheridan which Foote took a wicked pleasure to circulate Why Sir Sherry is dull naturally dull but it must have taken him a great deal of pains to become what we now see him Such an excess of stupidity Sir is not in Nature So said he I allowed him all his own merit Page four hundred fifty four Experience the test of truth A D seventeen sixty three He now added Sheridan cannot bear me I bring his declamation to a point I ask him a plain question What do you mean to teach Besides Sir what influence can mister Sheridan have upon the language of this great country by his narrow exertions Sir it is burning a farthing candle at Dover to shew light at Calais thirteen thirty four Talking of a young man thirteen thirty five who was uneasy from thinking that he was very deficient in learning and knowledge he said A man has no reason to complain who holds a middle place and has many below him and perhaps he has not six of his years above him perhaps not one Though he may not know any thing perfectly the general mass of knowledge that he has acquired is considerable Time will do for him all that is wanting The conversation then took a philosophical turn JOHNSON Human experience which is constantly contradicting theory is the great test of truth A system built upon the discoveries of a great many minds is always of more strength than what is produced by the mere workings of any one mind which of itself can do little There is not so poor a book in the world that would not be a prodigious effort were it wrought out entirely by a single mind without the aid of prior investigators The French writers are superficial thirteen thirty six because they are not scholars and so proceed upon the mere power of their own minds and we see how very little power they have Page four hundred fifty five The University of Salamancha AEtat fifty four As to the Christian religion Sir besides the strong evidence which we have for it there is a balance in its favour from the number of great men who have been convinced of its truth after a serious consideration of the question Grotius was an acute man a lawyer a man accustomed to examine evidence and he was convinced Grotius was not a recluse but a man of the world who certainly had no bias to the side of religion Sir Isaac Newton set out an infidel thirteen thirty seven and came to be a very firm believer He this evening again recommended to me to perambulate Spain thirteen thirty eight I said it would amuse him to get a letter from me dated at Salamancha JOHNSON I love the University of Salamancha for when the Spaniards were in doubt as to the lawfulness of their conquering America the University of Salamancha gave it as their opinion that it was not lawful He spoke this with great emotion and with that generous warmth which dictated the lines in his London against Spanish encroachment thirteen thirty nine I expressed my opinion of my friend Derrick as but a poor writer JOHNSON To be sure Sir he is but you are to consider that his being a literary man has got for him all that he has It has made him King of Bath thirteen forty Sir he has nothing to say for himself but that he is a writer Had he not been a writer he must have been sweeping the crossings in the streets and asking halfpence from every body that past Page four hundred fifty six mister Derrick A D seventeen sixty three In justice however to the memory of mister Derrick who was my first tutor in the ways of London and shewed me the town in all its variety of departments both literary and sportive the particulars of which doctor Johnson advised me to put in writing it is proper to mention what Johnson at a subsequent period said of him both as a writer and an editor Sir I have often said that if Derrick s letters thirteen forty one had been written by one of a more established name they would have been thought very pretty letters thirteen forty two And I sent Derrick to Dryden s relations to gather materials for his life and I believe he got all that I myself should have got thirteen forty three Poor Derrick I remember him with kindness Yet I cannot withhold from my readers a pleasant humourous sally which could not have hurt him had he been alive and now is perfectly harmless In his collection of poems there is one upon entering the harbour of Dublin his native city after a long absence It begins thus Eblana much lov d city hail Where first I saw the light of day And after a solemn reflection on his being numbered with forgotten dead there is the following stanza Unless my lines protract my fame And those who chance to read them cry I knew him Derrick was his name In yonder tomb his ashes lie Which was thus happily parodied by mister John Home to whom we owe the beautiful and pathetick tragedy of Douglas Unless my deeds protract my fame And he who passes sadly sings I knew him Derrick was his name On yonder tree his carcase swings Page four hundred fifty seven A day at Greenwich AEtat fifty four I doubt much whether the amiable and ingenious author of these burlesque lines will recollect them for they were produced extempore one evening while he and I were walking together in the dining room at Eglintoune Castle in seventeen sixty and I have never mentioned them to him since Johnson said once to me Sir I honour Derrick for his presence of mind One night when Floyd thirteen forty four another poor authour was wandering about the streets in the night he found Derrick fast asleep upon a bulk thirteen forty five upon being suddenly waked Derrick started up My dear Floyd I am sorry to see you in this destitute state will you go home with me to my lodgings I again begged his advice as to my method of study at Utrecht Come said he let us make a day of it Let us go down to Greenwich and dine and talk of it there The following Saturday was fixed for this excursion As we walked along the Strand to night arm in arm a woman of the town accosted us in the usual enticing manner No no my girl said Johnson it won t do He however did not treat her with harshness and we talked of the wretched life of such women and agreed that much more misery than happiness upon the whole is produced by illicit commerce between the sexes Page four hundred fifty eight The Desire of Knowledge A D seventeen oh three On Saturday July thirty doctor Johnson and I took a sculler at the Temple stairs and set out for Greenwich I asked him if he really thought a knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages an essential requisite to a good education JOHNSON Most certainly Sir for those who know them have a very great advantage over those who do not Nay Sir it is wonderful what a difference learning makes upon people even in the common intercourse of life which does not appear to be much connected with it And yet said I people go through the world very well and carry on the business of life to good advantage without learning JOHNSON Why Sir that may be true in cases where learning cannot possibly be of any use for instance this boy rows us as well without learning as if he could sing the song of Orpheus to the Argonauts who were the first sailors He then called to the boy What would you give my lad to know about the Argonauts Sir said the boy I would give what I have Johnson was much pleased with his answer and we gave him a double fare doctor Johnson then turning to me Sir said he a desire of knowledge is the natural feeling of mankind and every human being whose mind is not debauched will be willing to give all that he has to get knowledge thirteen forty six We landed at the Old Swan thirteen forty seven and walked to Billingsgate where we took oars and moved smoothly along the silver Thames It was a very fine day We were entertained with the immense number and variety of ships that were lying at anchor and with the beautiful country on each side of the river Page four hundred fifty nine The Methodists AEtat fifty four Page four hundred sixty A course of study A D seventeen sixty three I talked of preaching and of the great success which those called Methodists thirteen forty eight have JOHNSON Sir it is owing to their expressing themselves in a plain and familiar manner which is the only way to do good to the common people and which clergymen of genius and learning ought to do from a principle of duty when it is suited to their congregations a practice for which they will be praised by men of sense thirteen forty nine To insist against drunkenness as a crime because it debases reason the noblest faculty of man would be of no service to the common people but to tell them that they may die in a fit of drunkenness and shew them how dreadful that would be cannot fail to make a deep impression Sir when your Scotch clergy give up their homely manner religion will soon decay in that country Let this observation as Johnson meant it be ever remembered I was much pleased to find myself with Johnson at Greenwich which he celebrates in his London as a favourite scene I had the poem in my pocket and read the lines aloud with enthusiasm On Thames s banks in silent thought we stood Where Greenwich smiles upon the silver flood Pleas d thirteen fifty with the seat which gave ELIZA birth We kneel and kiss the consecrated earth He remarked that the structure of Greenwich hospital was too magnificent for a place of charity and that its parts were too much detached to make one great whole Buchanan he said was a very fine poet and observed that he was the first who complimented a lady by ascribing to her the different perfections of the heathen goddesses thirteen fifty one but that Johnston thirteen fifty two improved upon this by making his lady at the same time free from their defects He dwelt upon Buchanan s elegant verses to Mary Queen of Scots Nympha Caledoniae c and spoke with enthusiasm of the beauty of Latin verse All the modern languages said he cannot furnish so melodious a line as Formosam resonare doces Amarillida silvas thirteen fifty three Page four hundred sixty one Nature and Fleet street AEtat fifty four Afterwards he entered upon the business of the day which was to give me his advice as to a course of study And here I am to mention with much regret that my record of what he said is miserably scanty I recollect with admiration an animating blaze of eloquence which rouzed every intellectual power in me to the highest pitch but must have dazzled me so much that my memory could not preserve the substance of his discourse thirteen fifty four for the note which I find of it is no more than this He ran over the grand scale of human knowledge advised me to select some particular branch to excel in but to acquire a little of every kind The defect of my minutes will be fully supplied by a long letter upon the subject which he favoured me with after I had been some time at Utrecht and which my readers will have the pleasure to peruse in its proper place We walked in the evening in Greenwich Park He asked me I suppose by way of trying my disposition Is not this very fine Having no exquisite relish of the beauties of Nature thirteen fifty five and being more delighted with the busy hum of men thirteen fifty six I answered Yes Sir but not equal to Fleet street thirteen fifty seven JOHNSON You are right Sir I am aware that many of my readers may censure my want of taste Let me however shelter myself under the authority of a very fashionable Baronet thirteen fifty eight in the brilliant world who on his attention being called to the fragrance of a May evening in the country observed This may be very well but for my part I prefer the smell of a flambeau at the play house thirteen fifty nine Page four hundred sixty two Auchinleck A D seventeen sixty three We staid so long at Greenwich that our sail up the river in our return to London was by no means so pleasant as in the morning for the night air was so cold that it made me shiver I was the more sensible of it from having sat up all the night before recollecting and writing in my journal what I thought worthy of preservation an exertion which during the first part of my acquaintance with Johnson I frequently made I remember having sat up four nights in one week without being much incommoded in the day time Johnson whose robust frame was not in the least affected by the cold scolded me as if my shivering had been a paltry effeminacy saying Why do you shiver Sir William Scott thirteen sixty of the Commons told me that when he complained of a headach in the post chaise as they were travelling together to Scotland Johnson treated him in the same manner At your age Sir I had no head ach It is not easy to make allowance for sensations in others which we ourselves have not at the time We must all have experienced how very differently we are affected by the complaints of our neighbours when we are well and when we are ill In full health we can scarcely believe that they suffer much so faint is the image of pain upon our imagination when softened by sickness we readily sympathize with the sufferings of others We concluded the day at the Turk s Head coffee house very socially He was pleased to listen to a particular account which I gave him of my family and of its hereditary estate as to the extent and population of which he asked questions and made calculations recommending at the same time a liberal kindness to the tenantry as people over whom the proprietor was placed by Providence thirteen sixty one He took delight in hearing my description of the romantick seat of my ancestors I must be there Sir said he and we will live in the old castle and if there is not a room in it remaining we will build one I was highly flattered but could scarcely indulge a hope that Auchinleck would indeed be honoured by his presence and celebrated by a description as it afterwards was in his Journey to the Western Islands thirteen sixty two Page four hundred sixty three Tea with Miss Williams AEtat fifty four After we had again talked of my setting out for Holland he said I must see thee out of England I will accompany you to Harwich I could not find words to express what I felt upon this unexpected and very great mark of his affectionate regard Next day Sunday July thirty one I told him I had been that morning at a meeting of the people called Quakers where I had heard a woman preach JOHNSON Sir a woman s preaching is like a dog s walking on his hinder legs It is not done well but you are surprized to find it done at all On Tuesday August two the day of my departure from London having been fixed for the fifth doctor Johnson did me the honour to pass a part of the morning with me at my Chambers He said that he always felt an inclination to do nothing I observed that it was strange to think that the most indolent man in Britain had written the most laborious work The English Dictionary I mentioned an imprudent publication thirteen sixty three by a certain friend of his at an early period of life and asked him if he thought it would hurt him JOHNSON No Sir not much It may perhaps be mentioned at an election I had now made good my title to be a privileged man thirteen sixty four and was carried by him in the evening to drink tea with Miss Williams whom though under the misfortune of having lost her sight I found to be agreeable in conversation for she had a variety of literature and expressed herself well but her peculiar value was the intimacy in which she had long lived with Johnson by which she was well acquainted with his habits and knew how to lead him on to talk Page four hundred sixty four Convocation A D seventeen sixty three After tea he carried me to what he called his walk which was a long narrow paved court in the neighbourhood overshadowed by some trees There we sauntered a considerable time and I complained to him that my love of London and of his company was such that I shrunk almost from the thought of going away even to travel which is generally so much desired by young men thirteen sixty five He roused me by manly and spirited conversation He advised me when settled in any place abroad to study with an eagerness after knowledge and to apply to Greek an hour every day and when I was moving about to read diligently the great book of mankind On Wednesday August three we had our last social evening at the Turk s Head coffee house before my setting out for foreign parts I had the misfortune before we parted to irritate him unintentionally I mentioned to him how common it was in the world to tell absurd stories of him and to ascribe to him very strange sayings JOHNSON What do they make me say Sir BOSWELL Why Sir as an instance very strange indeed laughing heartily as I spoke David Hume told me you said that you would stand before a battery of cannon to restore the Convocation to its full powers Little did I apprehend that he had actually said this but I was soon convinced of my errour for with a determined look he thundered out And would I not Sir Shall the Presbyterian Kirk of Scotland have its General Assembly and the Church of England be denied its Convocation He was walking up and down the room while I told him the anecdote but when he uttered this explosion of high church zeal he had come close to my chair and his eyes flashed with indignation thirteen sixty six I bowed to the storm and diverted the force of it by leading him to expatiate on the influence which religion derived from maintaining the church with great external respectability I must not omit to mention that he this year wrote The Life of Ascham dagger and the Dedication to the Earl of Shaftesbury dagger prefixed to the edition of that writer s English works published by mister Bennet thirteen sixty seven Page four hundred sixty five In the Harwich stage coach AEtat fifty four Page four hundred sixty six Blacklock s poetry A D seventeen sixty three On Friday August five we set out early in the morning in the Harwich stage coach A fat elderly gentlewoman and a young Dutchman seemed the most inclined among us to conversation At the inn where we dined the gentlewoman said that she had done her best to educate her children and particularly that she had never suffered them to be a moment idle JOHNSON I wish madam you would educate me too for I have been an idle fellow all my life I am sure Sir said she you have not been idle JOHNSON Nay Madam it is very true and that gentleman there pointing to me has been idle He was idle at Edinburgh His father sent him to Glasgow where he continued to be idle He then came to London where he has been very idle and now he is going to Utrecht where he will be as idle as ever I asked him privately how he could expose me so JOHNSON Poh poh said he they knew nothing about you and will think of it no more In the afternoon the gentlewoman talked violently against the Roman Catholicks and of the horrours of the Inquisition To the utter astonishment of all the passengers but myself who knew that he could talk upon any side of a question he defended the Inquisition and maintained that false doctrine should be checked on its first appearance that the civil power should unite with the church in punishing those who dared to attack the established religion and that such only were punished by the Inquisition thirteen sixty eight He had in his pocket Pomponius Mela de situ Orbis in which he read occasionally and seemed very intent upon ancient geography Though by no means niggardly his attention to what was generally right was so minute that having observed at one of the stages that I ostentatiously gave a shilling to the coachman when the custom was for each passenger to give only six pence he took me aside and scolded me saying that what I had done would make the coachman dissatisfied with all the rest of the passengers who gave him no more than his due This was a just reprimand for in whatever way a man may indulge his generosity or his vanity in spending his money for the sake of others he ought not to raise the price of any article for which there is a constant demand He talked of mister Blacklock s poetry so far as it was descriptive of visible objects and observed that as its authour had the misfortune to be blind we may be absolutely sure that such passages are combinations of what he has remembered of the works of other writers who could see That foolish fellow Spence has laboured to explain philosophically how Blacklock may have done by means of his own faculties what it is impossible he should do thirteen sixty nine The solution as I have given it is plain Suppose I know a man to be so lame that he is absolutely incapable to move himself and I find him in a different room from that in which I left him shall I puzzle myself with idle conjectures that perhaps his nerves have by some unknown change all at once become effective No Sir it it clear how he got into a different room he was carried Page four hundred sixty seven Torture in Holland AEtat fifty four Having stopped a night at Colchester thirteen seventy Johnson talked of that town with veneration for having stood a siege for Charles the First The Dutchman alone now remained with us He spoke English tolerably well and thinking to recommend himself to us by expatiating on the superiority of the criminal jurisprudence of this country over that of Holland he inveighed against the barbarity of putting an accused person to the torture in order to force a confession thirteen seventy one But Johnson was as ready for this as for the Inquisition Why Sir you do not I find understand the law of your own country The torture in Holland is considered as a favour to an accused person for no man is put to the torture there unless there is as much evidence against him as would amount to conviction in England An accused person among you therefore has one chance more to escape punishment than those who are tried among us Page four hundred sixty eight Johnson s relish for good eating A D seventeen sixty three Page four hundred sixty nine A critick of cookery AEtat fifty four Page four hundred seventy Studied behaviour A D seventeen sixty three At supper this night he talked of good eating with uncommon satisfaction Some people said he have a foolish way of not minding or pretending not to mind what they eat For my part I mind my belly very studiously and very carefully for I look upon it that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind anything else thirteen seventy two He now appeared to me Jean Bull philosophe and he was for the moment not only serious but vehement Yet I have heard him upon other occasions talk with great contempt of people who were anxious to gratify their palates and the two hundred and sixth number of his Rambler is a masterly essay against gulosity thirteen seventy three His practice indeed I must acknowledge may be considered as casting the balance of his different opinions upon this subject for I never knew any man who relished good eating more than he did When at table he was totally absorbed in the business of the moment his looks seemed rivetted to his plate nor would he unless when in very high company say one word or even pay the least attention to what was said by others till he had satisfied his appetite thirteen seventy four which was so fierce and indulged with such intenseness that while in the act of eating the veins of his forehead swelled and generally a strong perspiration was visible thirteen seventy five To those whose sensations were delicate this could not but be disgusting and it was doubtless not very suitable to the character of a philosopher who should be distinguished by self command But it must be owned that Johnson though he could be rigidly abstemious was not a temperate man either in eating or drinking He could refrain but he could not use moderately thirteen seventy six He told me that he had fasted two days without inconvenience and that he had never been hungry but once thirteen seventy seven They who beheld with wonder how much he eat upon all occasions when his dinner was to his taste could not easily conceive what he must have meant by hunger and not only was he remarkable for the extraordinary quantity which he eat but he was or affected to be a man of very nice discernment in the science of cookery He used to descant critically on the dishes which had been at table where he had dined or supped and to recollect very minutely what he had liked thirteen seventy eight I remember when he was in Scotland his praising Gordon s palates a dish of palates at the Honourable Alexander Gordon s with a warmth of expression which might have done honour to more important subjects As for Maclaurin s imitation of a made dish it was a wretched attempt thirteen seventy nine He about the same time was so much displeased with the performances of a nobleman s French cook that he exclaimed with vehemence I d throw such a rascal into the river and he then proceeded to alarm a lady at whose house he was to sup thirteen eighty by the following manifesto of his skill I Madam who live at a variety of good tables am a much better judge of cookery than any person who has a very tolerable cook but lives much at home for his palate is gradually adapted to the taste of his cook whereas Madam in trying by a wider range I can more exquisitely judge thirteen eighty one When invited to dine even with an intimate friend he was not pleased if something better than a plain dinner was not prepared for him I have heard him say on such an occasion This was a good dinner enough to be sure but it was not a dinner to ask a man to On the other hand he was wont to express with great glee his satisfaction when he had been entertained quite to his mind One day when we had dined with his neighbour and landlord in Bolt court mister Allen the printer whose old housekeeper had studied his taste in every thing he pronounced this eulogy Sir we could not have had a better dinner had there been a Synod of Cooks thirteen eighty two While we were left by ourselves after the Dutchman had gone to bed doctor Johnson talked of that studied behaviour which many have recommended and practised He disapproved of it and said I never considered whether I should be a grave man or a merry man but just let inclination for the time have its course thirteen eighty three He flattered me with some hopes that he would in the course of the following summer come over to Holland and accompany me in a tour through the Netherlands I teized him with fanciful apprehensions of unhappiness A moth having fluttered round the candle and burnt itself he laid hold of this little incident to admonish me saying with a sly look and in a solemn but quiet tone That creature was its own tormentor and I believe its name was BOSWELL Page four hundred seventy one Bishop Berkley s sophistry AEtat fifty four Next day we got to Harwich to dinner and my passage in the packet boat to Helvoetsluys being secured and my baggage put on board we dined at our inn by ourselves I happened to say it would be terrible if he should not find a speedy opportunity of returning to London and be confined to so dull a place JOHNSON Don t Sir accustom yourself to use big words for little matters thirteen eighty four It would not be terrible though I were to be detained some time here The practice of using words of disproportionate magnitude is no doubt too frequent every where but I think most remarkable among the French of which all who have travelled in France must have been struck with innumerable instances We went and looked at the church and having gone into it and walked up to the altar Johnson whose piety was constant and fervent sent me to my knees saying Now that you are going to leave your native country recommend yourself to the protection of your CREATOR and REDEEMER Page four hundred seventy two Boswell embarks for Holland A D seventeen sixty three After we came out of the church we stood talking for some time together of Bishop Berkeley s ingenious sophistry to prove the non existence of matter and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal I observed that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true it is impossible to refute it I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone till he rebounded from it I refute it thus thirteen eighty five This was a stout exemplification of the first truths of Pere Bouffier thirteen eighty six or the original principles of Reid and of Beattie without admitting which we can no more argue in metaphysicks than we can argue in mathematicks without axioms To me it is not conceivable how Berkeley can be answered by pure reasoning but I know that the nice and difficult task was to have been undertaken by one of the most luminous minds of the present age had not politicks turned him from calm philosophy aside thirteen eighty seven What an admirable display of subtilty united with brilliance might his contending with Berkeley have afforded us thirteen eighty eight How must we when we reflect on the loss of such an intellectual feast regret that he should be characterised as the man Who born for the universe narrow d his mind And to party gave up what was meant for mankind thirteen eighty nine My revered friend walked down with me to the beach where we embraced and parted with tenderness and engaged to correspond by letters I said I hope Sir you will not forget me in my absence JOHNSON Nay Sir it is more likely you should forget me than that I should forget you As the vessel put out to sea I kept my eyes upon him for a considerable time while he remained rolling his majestick frame in his usual manner and at last I perceived him walk back into the town and he disappeared thirteen ninety Page four hundred seventy three Johnson s first letter to Boswell AEtat fifty four Utrecht seeming at first very dull to me after the animated scenes of London my spirits were grievously affected and I wrote to Johnson a plaintive and desponding letter to which he paid no regard Afterwards when I had acquired a firmer tone of mind I wrote him a second letter expressing much anxiety to hear from him At length I received the following epistle which was of important service to me and I trust will be so to many others A mister BOSWELL A LA COUR DE L EMPEREUR UTRECHT DEAR SIR You are not to think yourself forgotten or criminally neglected that you have had yet no letter from me I love to see my friends to hear from them to talk to them and to talk of them but it is not without a considerable effort of resolution that I prevail upon myself to write I would not however gratify my own indolence by the omission of any important duty or any office of real kindness Page four hundred seventy four Boswell s character sketched by Johnson A D seventeen sixty three To tell you that I am or am not well that I have or have not been in the country that I drank your health in the room in which we sat last together and that your acquaintance continue to speak of you with their former kindness topicks with which those letters are commonly filled which are written only for the sake of writing I seldom shall think worth communicating but if I can have it in my power to calm any harassing disquiet to excite any virtuous desire to rectify any important opinion or fortify any generous resolution you need not doubt but I shall at least wish to prefer the pleasure of gratifying a friend much less esteemed than yourself before the gloomy calm of idle vacancy Whether I shall easily arrive at an exact punctuality of correspondence I cannot tell I shall at present expect that you will receive this in return for two which I have had from you The first indeed gave me an account so hopeless of the state of your mind that it hardly admitted or deserved an answer by the second I was much better pleased and the pleasure will still be increased by such a narrative of the progress of your studies as may evince the continuance of an equal and rational application of your mind to some useful enquiry You will perhaps wish to ask what study I would recommend I shall not speak of theology because it ought not to be considered as a question whether you shall endeavour to know the will of GOD I shall therefore consider only such studies as we are at liberty to pursue or to neglect and of these I know not how you will make a better choice than by studying the civil law as your father advises and the ancient languages as you had determined for yourself at least resolve while you remain in any settled residence to spend a certain number of hours every day amongst your books The dissipation of thought of which you complain is nothing more than the vacillation of a mind suspended between different motives and changing its direction as any motive gains or loses strength If you can but kindle in your mind any strong desire if you can but keep predominant any wish for some particular excellence or attainment the gusts of imagination will break away without any effect upon your conduct and commonly without any traces left upon the memory Page four hundred seventy five The Frisick language AEtat fifty four There lurks perhaps in every human heart a desire of distinction which inclines every man first to hope and then to believe that Nature has given him something peculiar to himself This vanity makes one mind nurse aversion and another actuate desires till they rise by art much above their original state of power and as affectation in time improves to habit they at last tyrannise over him who at first encouraged them only for show Every desire is a viper in the bosom who while he was chill was harmless but when warmth gave him strength exerted it in poison You know a gentleman who when first he set his foot in the gay world as he prepared himself to whirl in the vortex of pleasure imagined a total indifference and universal negligence to be the most agreeable concomitants of youth and the strongest indication of an airy temper and a quick apprehension Vacant to every object and sensible of every impulse he thought that all appearance of diligence would deduct something from the reputation of genius and hoped that he should appear to attain amidst all the ease of carelessness and all the tumult of diversion that knowledge and those accomplishments which mortals of the common fabrick obtain only by mute abstraction and solitary drudgery He tried this scheme of life awhile was made weary of it by his sense and his virtue he then wished to return to his studies and finding long habits of idleness and pleasure harder to be cured than he expected still willing to retain his claim to some extraordinary prerogatives resolved the common consequences of irregularity into an unalterable decree of destiny and concluded that Nature had originally formed him incapable of rational employment Let all such fancies illusive and destructive be banished henceforward from your thoughts for ever Resolve and keep your resolution choose and pursue your choice If you spend this day in study you will find yourself still more able to study to morrow not that you are to expect that you shall at once obtain a complete victory Depravity is not very easily overcome Resolution will sometimes relax and diligence will sometimes be interrupted but let no accidental surprise or deviation whether short or long dispose you to despondency Consider these failings as incident to all mankind Begin again where you left off and endeavour to avoid the seducements that prevailed over you before This my dear Boswell is advice which perhaps has been often given you and given you without effect But this advice if you will not take from others you must take from your own reflections if you purpose to do the duties of the station to which the bounty of Providence has called you Let me have a long letter from you as soon as you can I hope you continue your journal and enrich it with many observations upon the country in which you reside It will be a favour if you can get me any books in the Frisick language and can enquire how the poor are maintained in the Seven Provinces I am dear Sir Your most affectionate servant SAM JOHNSON London Dec eight seventeen sixty three I am sorry to observe that neither in my own minutes nor in my letters to Johnson which have been preserved by him can I find any information how the poor are maintained in the Seven Provinces But I shall extract from one of my letters what I learnt concerning the other subject of his curiosity Page four hundred seventy six Johnson s visit to Langton A D seventeen sixty four I have made all possible enquiry with respect to the Frisick language and find that it has been less cultivated than any other of the northern dialects a certain proof of which is their deficiency of books Of the old Frisick there are no remains except some ancient laws preserved by Schotanus in his Beschryvinge van die Heerlykheid van Friesland and his Historia Frisica I have not yet been able to find these books Professor Trotz who formerly was of the University of Vranyken in Friesland and is at present preparing an edition of all the Frisick laws gave me this information Of the modern Frisick or what is spoken by the boors at this day I have procured a specimen It is Gisbert Japix s Rymelerie which is the only book that they have It is amazing that they have no translation of the bible no treatises of devotion nor even any of the ballads and storybooks which are so agreeable to country people You shall have Japix by the first convenient opportunity I doubt not to pick up Schotanus Mynheer Trotz has promised me his assistance seventeen sixty four AETAT fifty five Early in seventeen sixty four Johnson paid a visit to the Langton family at their seat of Langton in Lincolnshire where he passed some time much to his satisfaction thirteen ninety one His friend Bennet Langton it will not be doubted did every thing in his power to make the place agreeable to so illustrious a guest and the elder mister Langton and his lady being fully capable of understanding his value were not wanting in attention He however told me that old mister Langton though a man of considerable learning had so little allowance to make for his occasional laxity of talk thirteen ninety two that because in the course of discussion he sometimes mentioned what might be said in favour of the peculiar tenets of the Romish church he went to his grave believing him to be of that communion thirteen ninety three Johnson during his stay at Langton had the advantage of a good library and saw several gentlemen of the neighbourhood I have obtained from mister Langton the following particulars of this period He was now fully convinced that he could not have been satisfied with a country living thirteen ninety four for talking of a respectable clergyman in Lincolnshire he observed This man Sir fills up the duties of his life well I approve of him but could not imitate him Page four hundred seventy seven The Literary Club AEtat fifty five To a lady who endeavoured to vindicate herself from blame for neglecting social attention to worthy neighbours by saying I would go to them if it would do them any good he said What good Madam do you expect to have in your power to do them It is shewing them respect and that is doing them good So socially accommodating was he that once when mister Langton and he were driving together in a coach and mister Langton complained of being sick he insisted that they should go out and sit on the back of it in the open air which they did And being sensible how strange the appearance must be observed that a countryman whom they saw in a field would probably be thinking If these two madmen should come down what would become of me thirteen ninety five Page four hundred seventy eight The Literary Club A D seventeen sixty four Page four hundred seventy nine List of the members AEtat fifty five Soon after his return to London which was in February was founded that CLUB which existed long without a name but at mister Garrick s funeral became distinguished by the title of THE LITERARY CLUB thirteen ninety six Sir Joshua Reynolds had the merit of being the first proposer of it thirteen ninety seven to which Johnson acceded and the original members were Sir Joshua Reynolds doctor Johnson mister Edmund Burke doctor Nugent thirteen ninety eight mister Beauclerk mister Langton doctor Goldsmith mister Chamier thirteen ninety nine and Sir John Hawkins fourteen hundred They met at the Turk s Head in Gerrard street Soho one evening in every week at seven and generally continued their conversation till a pretty late hour fourteen oh one This club has been gradually increased to its present number thirty five fourteen oh two After about ten years instead of supping weekly it was resolved to dine together once a fortnight during the meeting of Parliament Their original tavern having been converted into a private house they moved first to Prince s in Sackville street then to Le Telier s in Dover street and now meet at Parsloe s saint James s street fourteen oh three Between the time of its formation and the time at which this work is passing through the press June seventeen ninety two fourteen oh four the following persons now dead were members of it mister Dunning afterwards Lord Ashburton mister Samuel Dyer mister Garrick doctor Shipley Bishop of saint Asaph mister Vesey mister Thomas Warton and doctor Adam Smith The present members are mister Burke mister Langton Lord Charlemont Sir Robert Chambers doctor Percy Bishop of Dromore doctor Barnard Bishop of Killaloe doctor Marlay Bishop of Clonfert mister Fox doctor George Fordyce Sir William Scott Sir Joseph Banks Sir Charles Bunbury mister Windham of Norfolk mister Sheridan mister Gibbon Sir William Jones mister Colman mister Steevens doctor Burney doctor Joseph Warton mister Malone Lord Ossory Lord Spencer Lord Lucan Lord Palmerston Lord Eliot Lord Macartney mister Richard Burke junior Sir William Hamilton doctor Warren mister Courtenay doctor Hinchcliffe Bishop of Peterborough the Duke of Leeds doctor Douglas Bishop of Salisbury and the writer of this account Page four hundred eighty Garrick and the Literary Club A D seventeen sixty four Sir John Hawkins fourteen oh five represents himself as a seceder from this society and assigns as the reason of his withdrawing himself from it that its late hours were inconsistent with his domestick arrangements In this he is not accurate for the fact was that he one evening attacked mister Burke in so rude a manner that all the company testified their displeasure and at their next meeting his reception was such that he never came again fourteen oh six He is equally inaccurate with respect to mister Garrick of whom he says he trusted that the least intimation of a desire to come among us would procure him a ready admission but in this he was mistaken Johnson consulted me upon it and when I could find no objection to receiving him exclaimed He will disturb us by his buffoonery and afterwards so managed matters that he was never formally proposed and by consequence never admitted fourteen oh seven Page four hundred eighty one Grainger s Sugar Cane AEtat fifty five In justice both to mister Garrick and doctor Johnson I think it necessary to rectify this mis statement The truth is that not very long after the institution of our club Sir Joshua Reynolds was speaking of it to Garrick I like it much said he I think I shall be of you When Sir Joshua mentioned this to doctor Johnson he was much displeased with the actor s conceit He ll be of us said Johnson how does he know we will permit him The first Duke in England has no right to hold such language However when Garrick was regularly proposed some time afterwards Johnson though he had taken a momentary offence at his arrogance warmly and kindly supported him and he was accordingly elected was a most agreeable member and continued to attend our meetings to the time of his death missus Piozzi has also given a similar misrepresentation of Johnson s treatment of Garrick in this particular as if he had used these contemptuous expressions If Garrick does apply I ll black ball him fourteen oh eight Surely one ought to sit in a society like ours Unelbow d by a gamester pimp or player fourteen oh nine I am happy to be enabled by such unquestionable authority as that of Sir Joshua Reynolds as well as from my own knowledge to vindicate at once the heart of Johnson and the social merit of Garrick fourteen ten Page four hundred eighty two Johnson s self accusations A D seventeen sixty four In this year except what he may have done in revising Shakspeare we do not find that he laboured much in literature He wrote a review of Grainger s Sugar Cane a Poem in the London Chronicle He told me that doctor Percy wrote the greatest part of this review but I imagine he did not recollect it distinctly for it appears to be mostly if not altogether his own fourteen eleven He also wrote in The Critical Review an account of Goldsmith s excellent poem The Traveller fourteen twelve The ease and independence to which he had at last attained by royal munificence increased his natural indolence In his Meditations he thus accuses himself Good Friday April twenty seventeen sixty four I have made no reformation I have lived totally useless more sensual in thought and more addicted to wine and meat fourteen thirteen And next morning he thus feelingly complains My indolence since my last reception of the sacrament has sunk into grosser sluggishness and my dissipation spread into wilder negligence My thoughts have been clouded with sensuality and except that from the beginning of this year I have in some measure forborne excess of strong drink my appetites have predominated over my reason A kind of strange oblivion has overspread me so that I know not what has become of the last year and perceive that incidents and intelligence pass over me without leaving any impression He then solemnly says This is not the life to which heaven is promised fourteen fourteen and he earnestly resolves an amendment Page four hundred eighty three A severe attack of hypochondria AEtat fifty five It was his custom to observe certain days with a pious abstraction viz New year s day the day of his wife s death Good Friday Easter day and his own birth day He this year says fourteen fifteen I have now spent fifty five years in resolving having from the earliest time almost that I can remember been forming schemes of a better life I have done nothing The need of doing therefore is pressing since the time of doing is short zero GOD grant me to resolve aright and to keep my resolutions for JESUS CHRIST S sake Amen fourteen sixteen Such a tenderness of conscience such a fervent desire of improvement will rarely be found It is surely not decent in those who are hardened in indifference to spiritual improvement to treat this pious anxiety of Johnson with contempt About this time he was afflicted with a very severe return of the hypochondriack disorder which was ever lurking about him He was so ill as notwithstanding his remarkable love of company to be entirely averse to society the most fatal symptom of that malady doctor Adams told me that as an old friend he was admitted to visit him and that he found him in a deplorable state sighing groaning talking to himself and restlessly walking from room to room He then used this emphatical expression of the misery which he felt I would consent to have a limb amputated to recover my spirits fourteen seventeen Page four hundred eighty four Johnson s particularities A D seventeen sixty four Talking to himself was indeed one of his singularities ever since I knew him I was certain that he was frequently uttering pious ejaculations for fragments of the Lord s Prayer have been distinctly overheard fourteen eighteen His friend mister Thomas Davies of whom Churchill says That Davies hath a very pretty wife fourteen nineteen when doctor Johnson muttered lead us not into temptation used with waggish and gallant humour to whisper missus Davies You my dear are the cause of this He had another particularity of which none of his friends ever ventured to ask an explanation fourteen twenty It appeared to me some superstitious habit which he had contracted early and from which he had never called upon his reason to disentangle him This was his anxious care to go out or in at a door or passage by a certain number of steps from a certain point or at least so as that either his right or his left foot I am not certain which should constantly make the first actual movement when he came close to the door or passage Thus I conjecture for I have upon innumerable occasions observed him suddenly stop and then seem to count his steps with a deep earnestness and when he had neglected or gone wrong in this sort of magical movement I have seen him go back again put himself in a proper posture to begin the ceremony and having gone through it break from his abstraction walk briskly on and join his companion fourteen twenty one A strange instance of something of this nature even when on horseback happened when he was in the isle of Sky fourteen twenty two Sir Joshua Reynolds has observed him to go a good way about rather than cross a particular alley in Leicester fields but this Sir Joshua imputed to his having had some disagreeable recollection associated with it Page four hundred eighty six Illness of Joshua Reynolds A D seventeen sixty five That the most minute singularities which belonged to him and made very observable parts of his appearance and manner may not be omitted it is requisite to mention that while talking or even musing as he sat in his chair he commonly held his head to one side towards his right shoulder and shook it in a tremulous manner moving his body backwards and forwards and rubbing his left knee in the same direction with the palm of his hand In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth sometimes as if ruminating or what is called chewing the cud sometimes giving a half whistle some times making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth as if clucking like a hen and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front as if pronouncing quickly under his breath too too too all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look but more frequently with a smile Generally when he had concluded a period in the course of a dispute by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation he used to blow out his breath like a Whale This I supposed was a relief to his lungs and seemed in him to be a contemptuous mode of expression as if he had made the arguments of his opponent fly like chaff before the wind I am fully aware how very obvious an occasion I here give for the sneering jocularity of such as have no relish of an exact likeness which to render complete he who draws it must not disdain the slightest strokes But if witlings should be inclined to attack this account let them have the candour to quote what I have offered in my defence He was for some time in the summer at Easton Maudit Northamptonshire on a visit to the Reverend doctor Percy now Bishop of Dromore Whatever dissatisfaction he felt at what he considered as a slow progress in intellectual improvement we find that his heart was tender and his affections warm as appears from the following very kind letter TO JOSHUA REYNOLDS esquire IN LEICESTER FIELDS LONDON DEAR SIR I did not hear of your sickness till I heard likewise of your recovery and therefore escaped that part of your pain which every man must feel to whom you are known as you are known to me Having had no particular account of your disorder I know not in what state it has left you If the amusement of my company can exhilarate the languor of a slow recovery I will not delay a day to come to you for I know not how I can so effectually promote my own pleasure as by pleasing you or my own interest as by preserving you in whom if I should lose you I should lose almost the only man whom I call a friend Pray let me hear of you from yourself or from dear Miss Reynolds fourteen twenty three Make my compliments to mister Mudge I am dear Sir Your most affectionate And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON At the reverend mister Percy s at Easton Maudit Northamptonshire by Castle Ashby Aug nineteen seventeen sixty four Page four hundred eighty seven Johnson at Cambridge AEtat fifty six seventeen sixty five AETAT fifty six Early in the year seventeen sixty five he paid a short visit to the University of Cambridge with his friend mister Beauclerk There is a lively picturesque account of his behaviour on this visit in The Gentleman s Magazine for March seventeen eighty five being an extract of a letter from the late doctor John Sharp The two following sentences are very characteristical He drank his large potations of tea with me interrupted by many an indignant contradiction and many a noble sentiment Several persons got into his company the last evening at Trinity where about twelve he began to be very great stripped poor missus Macaulay to the very skin then gave her for his toast and drank her in two bumpers fourteen twenty four The strictness of his self examination and scrupulous Christian humility appear in his pious meditation on Easter day this year I purpose again to partake of the blessed sacrament yet when I consider how vainly I have hitherto resolved at this annual commemoration of my Saviour s death to regulate my life by his laws I am almost afraid to renew my resolutions The concluding words are very remarkable and shew that he laboured under a severe depression of spirits Since the last Easter I have reformed no evil habit my time has been unprofitably spent and seems as a dream that has left nothing behind My memory grows confused and I know not how the days pass over me Good Lord deliver me fourteen twenty five Page four hundred eighty eight Trinity College Dublin A D seventeen sixty five No man was more gratefully sensible of any kindness done to him than Johnson There is a little circumstance in his diary this year which shews him in a very amiable light July two I paid mister Simpson ten guineas which he had formerly lent me in my necessity and for which Tetty expressed her gratitude July eight I lent mister Simpson ten guineas more fourteen twenty six Here he had a pleasing opportunity of doing the same kindness to an old friend which he had formerly received from him Indeed his liberality as to money was very remarkable The next article in his diary is July sixteen I received seventy five pounds fourteen twenty seven Lent mister Davis twenty five Trinity College Dublin at this time surprised Johnson with a spontaneous compliment of the highest academical honours by creating him Doctor of Laws fourteen twenty eight The diploma which is in my possession is as follows Page four hundred eighty nine Johnson created Doctor of Laws AEtat fifty six

FRAN ANDREWS R MURRAY THO WILSON Praeps ROBtus LAW THO LELAND MICH KEARNEY This unsolicited mark of distinction conferred on so great a literary character did much honour to the judgement and liberal spirit of that learned body Johnson acknowledged the favour in a letter to doctor Leland one of their number but I have not been able to obtain a copy of it fourteen thirty He appears this year to have been seized with a temporary fit of ambition for he had thoughts both of studying law and of engaging in politics His Prayer before the Study of Law is truly admirable Sept twenty six seventeen sixty five Almighty GOD the giver of wisdom without whose help resolutions are vain without whose blessing study is ineffectual enable me if it be thy will to attain such knowledge as may qualify me to direct the doubtful and instruct the ignorant to prevent wrongs and terminate contentions and grant that I may use that knowledge which I shall attain to thy glory and my own salvation for JESUS CHRIST S sake Amen fourteen thirty one Page four hundred ninety Johnson s introduction to the Thrales A D seventeen sixty five His prayer in the view of becoming a politician is entitled Engaging in POLITICKS with H n no doubt his friend the Right Honourable William Gerard Hamilton fourteen thirty two for whom during a long acquaintance he had a great esteem and to whose conversation he once paid this high compliment I am very unwilling to be left alone Sir and therefore I go with my company down the first pair of stairs in some hopes that they may perhaps return again I go with you Sir as far as the street door In what particular department he intended to engage does not appear nor can mister Hamilton explain fourteen thirty three His prayer is in general terms Enlighten my understanding with knowledge of right and govern my will by thy laws that no deceit may mislead me nor temptation corrupt me that I may always endeavour to do good and hinder evil fourteen thirty four There is nothing upon the subject in his diary Page four hundred ninety one Old Thrale AEtat fifty six This year fourteen thirty five was distinguished by his being introduced into the family of mister Thrale one of the most eminent brewers in England and Member of Parliament for the borough of Southwark Foreigners are not a little amazed when they hear of brewers distillers and men in similar departments of trade held forth as persons of considerable consequence In this great commercial country it is natural that a situation which produces much wealth should be considered as very respectable and no doubt honest industry is entitled to esteem But perhaps the too rapid advance of men of low extraction tends to lessen the value of that distinction by birth and gentility which has ever been found beneficial to the grand scheme of subordination Johnson used to give this account of the rise of mister Thrale s father He worked at six shillings a week for twenty years in the great brewery which afterwards was his own The proprietor of it had an only daughter who was married to a nobleman It was not fit that a peer should continue the business On the old man s death therefore the brewery was to be sold To find a purchaser for so large a property was a difficult matter and after some time it was suggested that it would be adviseable to treat with Thrale a sensible active honest man who had been employed in the house and to transfer the whole to him for thirty thousand pounds security being taken upon the property This was accordingly settled In eleven years Thrale paid the purchase money fourteen thirty six He acquired a large fortune and lived to be Member of Parliament for Southwark But what was most remarkable was the liberality with which he used his riches He gave his son and daughters the best education The esteem which his good conduct procured him from the nobleman who had married his master s daughter made him be treated with much attention and his son both at school and at the University of Oxford associated with young men of the first rank His allowance from his father after he left college was splendid no less than a thousand a year This in a man who had risen as old Thrale did was a very extraordinary instance of generosity He used to say If this young dog does not find so much after I am gone as he expects let him remember that he has had a great deal in my own time The son though in affluent circumstances had good sense enough to carry on his father s trade which was of such extent that I remember he once told me he would not quit it for an annuity of ten thousand a year Not said he that I get ten thousand a year by it but it is an estate to a family Having left daughters only the property was sold for the immense sum of one hundred and thirty five thousand pounds fourteen thirty seven a magnificent proof of what may be done by fair trade in no long period of time Page four hundred ninety two A new system of gentility A D seventeen sixty five There may be some who think that a new system of gentility fourteen thirty eight might be established upon principles totally different from what have hitherto prevailed Our present heraldry it may be said is suited to the barbarous times in which it had its origin It is chiefly founded upon ferocious merit upon military excellence Why in civilised times we may be asked should there not be rank and honours upon principles which independent of long custom are certainly not less worthy and which when once allowed to be connected with elevation and precedency would obtain the same dignity in our imagination Why should not the knowledge the skill the expertness the assiduity and the spirited hazards of trade and commerce when crowned with success be entitled to give those flattering distinctions by which mankind are so universally captivated Such are the specious but false arguments for a proposition which always will find numerous advocates in a nation where men are every day starting up from obscurity to wealth To refute them is needless The general sense of mankind cries out with irresistible force Un gentilhomme est toujours gentilhomme fourteen thirty nine Page four hundred ninety three A new home for Johnson AEtat fifty six mister Thrale had married Miss Hesther Lynch Salusbury of good Welsh extraction fourteen forty a lady of lively talents improved by education That Johnson s introduction into mister Thrale s family which contributed so much to the happiness of his life was owing to her desire for his conversation is very probable and a general supposition but it is not the truth mister Murphy who was intimate with mister Thrale fourteen forty one having spoken very highly of doctor Johnson he was requested to make them acquainted fourteen forty two This being mentioned to Johnson he accepted of an invitation to dinner at Thrale s and was so much pleased with his reception both by mister and missus Thrale and they so much pleased with him that his invitations to their house were more and more frequent till at last he became one of the family and an apartment was appropriated to him both in their house in Southwark and in their villa at Streatham fourteen forty three Page four hundred ninety four mister Thrale A D seventeen sixty five Johnson had a very sincere esteem for mister Thrale as a man of excellent principles a good scholar well skilled in trade of a sound understanding and of manners such as presented the character of a plain independent English Squire fourteen forty four As this family will frequently be mentioned in the course of the following pages and as a false notion has prevailed that mister Thrale was inferiour and in some degree insignificant compared with missus Thrale it may be proper to give a true state of the case from the authority of Johnson himself in his own words Page four hundred ninety five missus Thrale AEtat fifty six I know no man said he who is more master of his wife and family than Thrale If he but holds up a finger he is obeyed It is a great mistake to suppose that she is above him in literary attainments fourteen forty five She is more flippant but he has ten times her learning he is a regular scholar but her learning is that of a school boy in one of the lower forms My readers may naturally wish for some representation of the figures of this couple mister Thrale was tall well proportioned and stately As for Madam or my Mistress fourteen forty six by which epithets Johnson used to mention missus Thrale she was short plump and brisk fourteen forty seven She has herself given us a lively view of the idea which Johnson had of her person on her appearing before him in a dark coloured gown You little creatures should never wear those sort of clothes however they are unsuitable in every way What have not all insects gay colours fourteen forty eight mister Thrale gave his wife a liberal indulgence both in the choice of their company and in the mode of entertaining them He understood and valued Johnson without remission from their first acquaintance to the day of his death missus Thrale was enchanted with Johnson s conversation for its own sake and had also a very allowable vanity in appearing to be honoured with the attention of so celebrated a man Page four hundred ninety six Johnson s SHAKSPEARE published A D seventeen sixty five Nothing could be more fortunate for Johnson than this connection fourteen forty nine He had at mister Thrale s all the comforts and even luxuries of life his melancholy was diverted and his irregular habits lessened fourteen fifty by association with an agreeable and well ordered family He was treated with the utmost respect and even affection The vivacity of missus Thrale s literary talk roused him to cheerfulness and exertion even when they were alone But this was not often the case for he found here a constant succession of what gave him the highest enjoyment the society of the learned the witty and the eminent in every way who were assembled in numerous companies fourteen fifty one called forth his wonderful powers and gratified him with admiration to which no man could be insensible Page four hundred ninety seven doctor Kenrick AEtat fifty six In the October of this year fourteen fifty two he at length gave to the world his edition of Shakspeare fourteen fifty three which if it had no other merit but that of producing his Preface fourteen fifty four in which the excellencies and defects of that immortal bard are displayed with a masterly hand the nation would have had no reason to complain A blind indiscriminate admiration of Shakspeare had exposed the British nation to the ridicule of foreigners fourteen fifty five Johnson by candidly admitting the faults of his poet had the more credit in bestowing on him deserved and indisputable praise and doubtless none of all his panegyrists have done him half so much honour Their praise was like that of a counsel upon his own side of the cause Johnson s was like the grave well considered and impartial opinion of the judge which falls from his lips with weight and is received with reverence What he did as a commentator has no small share of merit though his researches were not so ample and his investigations so acute as they might have been which we now certainly know from the labours of other able and ingenious criticks who have followed him fourteen fifty six He has enriched his edition with a concise account of each play and of its characteristick excellence Many of his notes have illustrated obscurities in the text and placed passages eminent for beauty in a more conspicuous light and he has in general exhibited such a mode of annotation as may be beneficial to all subsequent editors fourteen fifty seven Page four hundred ninety eight Johnson s attack on Voltaire A D seventeen eighty five His Shakespeare was virulently attacked by mister William Kenrick who obtained the degree of LL D from a Scotch University and wrote for the booksellers in a great variety of branches Though he certainly was not without considerable merit he wrote with so little regard to decency and principles and decorum fourteen fifty eight and in so hasty a manner that his reputation was neither extensive nor lasting I remember one evening when some of his works were mentioned doctor Goldsmith said he had never heard of them upon which doctor Johnson observed Sir he is one of the many who have made themselves publick without making themselves known fourteen fifty nine A young student of Oxford of the name of Barclay wrote an answer to Kenrick s review of Johnson s Shakspeare Johnson was at first angry that Kenrick s attack should have the credit of an answer But afterwards considering the young man s good intention he kindly noticed him and probably would have done more had not the young man died fourteen sixty Page four hundred ninety nine Voltaire s reply AEtat fifty six In his Preface to Shakspeare Johnson treated Voltaire very contemptuously observing upon some of his remarks These are the petty criticisms of petty wits fourteen sixty one Voltaire in revenge made an attack upon Johnson in one of his numerous literary sallies which I remember to have read but there being no general index to his voluminous works have searched in vain and therefore cannot quote it fourteen sixty two Voltaire was an antagonist with whom I thought Johnson should not disdain to contend I pressed him to answer He said he perhaps might but he never did mister Burney having occasion to write to Johnson for some receipts for subscriptions to his Shakspeare which Johnson had omitted to deliver when the money was paid fourteen sixty three he availed himself of that opportunity of thanking Johnson for the great pleasure which he had received from the perusal of his Preface to Shakspeare which although it excited much clamour against him at first is now justly ranked among the most excellent of his writings To this letter Johnson returned the following answer Page five hundred Resolutions at church To CHARLES BURNEY esquire IN POLAND STREET SIR I am sorry that your kindness to me has brought upon you so much trouble though you have taken care to abate that sorrow by the pleasure which I receive from your approbation I defend my criticism in the same manner with you We must confess the faults of our favourite to gain credit to our praise of his excellencies He that claims either in himself or for another the honours of perfection will surely injure the reputation which he designs to assist Be pleased to make my compliments to your family I am Sir Your most obliged And most humble servant Sam Johnson Oct sixteen seventeen sixty five fourteen sixty four From one of his journals I transcribed what follows At church Oct sixty five To avoid all singularity Bonaventura fourteen sixty five To come in before service and compose my mind by meditation or by reading some portions of scriptures Tetty If I can hear the sermon to attend it unless attention be more troublesome than useful To consider the act of prayer as a reposal of myself upon God and a resignation of all into his holy hand APPENDIX A JOHNSON S DEBATES IN PARLIAMENT Pages one hundred eighteen and one hundred fifty The publication of the Debates in the Gentleman s Magazine began in July seventeen thirty two The names of the speakers were not printed in full Sir Robert Walpole was disguised if a disguise it can be called as Sir R t W le and mister Pelham as mister P lh m Otherwise the report was open and avowed During the first few years however it often happened that no attempt was made to preserve the individuality of the members Thus in a debate on the number of seamen Gent Mag v five hundred seven the speeches of the eight chief speakers were so combined as to form but three First come the arguments made use of for thirty thousand men next an answer to the following effect and lastly a reply that was in substance as follows Each of these three speeches is in the first person though each is formed of the arguments of two members at least perhaps of many In the report of a two days debate in seventeen thirty seven in which there were fourteen chief speakers the substance of thirteen of the speeches was given in three ib vii seven hundred forty six seven hundred seventy five In July seventeen thirty six ib vi three hundred sixty three we find the beginning of a great change To satisfy the impatience of his readers the publisher promises to give them occasionally some entire speeches He prints one which likely enough had been sent to him by the member who had spoken it and adds that he shall be grateful for any authentic intelligence in matters of such importance and tenderness as the speeches in Parliament ib p three hundred sixty five Cave in his examination before the House of Lords on April thirty seventeen forty seven on a charge of having printed in the Gentleman s Magazine an account of the trial of Lord Lovat owned that he had had speeches sent him by the members themselves and had had assistance from some members who have taken notes of other members speeches Parl Hist xiv sixty It was chiefly in the numbers of the Magazine for the latter half of each year that the publication took place The parliamentary recess was the busy time for reporters and printers It was commonly believed that the resolution on the Journals of the House of Commons against publishing any of its proceedings was only in force while parliament was sitting But on April thirteen seventeen thirty eight it was unanimously resolved that it is an high indignity to and a notorious breach of the privilege of this House to give any account of the debates as well during the recess as the sitting of parliament Parl Hist x eight hundred twelve It was admitted that this privilege expired at the end of every parliament When the dissolution had come every one might publish what he pleased With the House of Lords it was far otherwise for it is a Court of Record and as such its rights and privileges never die It may punish a printer for printing any part of its proceedings for thirty or forty years back ib p eight hundred seven mister Winnington when speaking to this resolution of April thirteen said that if they did not put a speedy stop to this practice of reporting they will have every word that is spoken here by gentlemen misrepresented by fellows who thrust themselves into our gallery ib p eight hundred six Walpole complained that he had been made to speak the very reverse of what he meant He had read debates wherein all the wit the learning and the argument had been thrown into one side and on the other nothing but what was low mean and ridiculous ib p eight hundred nine Later on Johnson in his reports saved appearances tolerably well but took care that the WHIG DOGS should not have the best of it Murphy s Johnson p forty five It was but a few days after he became a contributor to the Magazine that this resolution was passed Parliament rose on May twenty and in the June number the reports of the debates of the Senate of Lilliput began To his fertile mind was very likely due this humorous expedient by which the resolution of the House was mocked That he wrote the introduction in which is narrated the voyage of Captain Gulliver s grandson to Lilliputia can scarcely be doubted It bears all the marks of his early style The Lords become Hurgoes and the Commons Clinabs Walpole becomes Walelop Pulteney Pulnub and Pitt Ptit otherwise the report is much as it had been At the end of the volume for seventeen thirty nine was given a key to all the names The London Magazine had boldly taken the lead In the May number which was published at the close of the month and therefore after parliament had risen began the report of the proceedings and debates of a political and learned club of young noblemen and gentlemen who hoped one day to enter parliament and who therefore the better to qualify themselves for their high position only debated questions that were there discussed To the speakers were given the names of the ancient Greeks and Romans Thus we find the honorable Marcus Cato and the Right honorable M Tullius Cicero By the key that was published in seventeen forty two Cicero was seen to be Walpole and Cato Pulteney What risks the publishers and writers ran was very soon shown In December seventeen forty the ministers proposed to lay an embargo on various articles of food As the members entered the House a printed paper was handed to each entitled Considerations upon the Embargo Adam Smith had just gone up as a young student to the University of Oxford There are considerations suggested in this paper which the great authority of the author of the Wealth of Nations has not yet made pass current as truths The paper contained moreover charges of jobbery against great men though no one was named It was at once voted a malicious and scandalous libel and the author William Cooley a scrivener was committed to Newgate With him was sent the printer of the Daily Post in which part of the Considerations had been published After seven weeks imprisonment in the depth of winter in that miserable den without sufficient sustenance to support life Cooley was discharged on paying his fees He was in knowledge more than a hundred years before his time and had been made to suffer accordingly The printer would have been discharged also but the fees were more than he could pay Two months later he petitioned for mercy The fees by that time were Lone hundred twenty one His petition was not received and he was kept in prison till the close of the session Parl Hist xi eight hundred sixty seven eight hundred ninety four Such were the risks run by Cave and Johnson and their fellow workers That no prosecution followed was due perhaps to that dread of ridicule which has often tempered the severity of the law The Hurgolen Branard who in the former session was Pretor of Mildendo might well have been unwilling to prove that he was Sir John Barnard late Lord Mayor of London Johnson it should seem revised some of the earliest Debates In a letter to Cave which cannot have been written later than September seventeen thirty eight he mentions the alterations that he had made ante p one hundred thirty six The more they were written by him the less authentic did they become for he was not one of those fellows who thrust themselves into the gallery of the House His employer Cave if we can trust his own evidence had been in the habit of going there and taking notes with a pencil Parl Hist xiv sixty But Johnson Hawkins says Life p one hundred twenty two never was within the walls of either House According to Murphy Life p forty four he had been inside the House of Commons once Be this as it may in the end the Debates were composed by him alone ante p one hundred eighteen From that time they must no longer be looked upon as authentic records in spite of the assertions of the Editor of the Parl Hist xi Preface Johnson told Boswell ante p one hundred eighteen that sometimes he had nothing more communicated to him than the names of the several speakers and the part which they had taken in the debate sometimes he had scanty notes furnished by persons employed to attend in both Houses of Parliament Often his Debates were written from no materials at all the mere coinage of his own imagination post under Dec nine seventeen eighty four He never wrote any part of his works with equal velocity Three columns of the Magazine in an hour was no uncommon effort which was faster than most persons could have transcribed that quantity ib According to Hawkins Life p ninety nine His practice was to shut himself up in a room assigned to him at saint John s Gate to which he would not suffer any one to approach except the compositor or Cave s boy for matter which as fast as he composed it he tumbled out at the door From Murphy we get the following curious story That Johnson was the author of the debates during that period Nov seventeen forty to Feb seventeen forty three was not generally known but the secret transpired several years afterwards and was avowed by himself on the following occasion mister Wedderburne now Lord Loughborough doctor Johnson doctor Francis the translator of Horace the present writer and others dined with the late mister Foote An important debate towards the end of Sir Robert Walpole s administration being mentioned doctor Francis observed that mister Pitt s speech on that occasion was the best he had ever read He added that he had employed eight years of his life in the study of Demosthenes and finished a translation of that celebrated orator with all the decorations of style and language within the reach of his capacity but he had met with nothing equal to the speech above mentioned Many of the company remembered the debate and some passages were cited with the approbation and applause of all present During the ardour of conversation Johnson remained silent As soon as the warmth of praise subsided he opened with these words That speech I wrote in a garret in Exeter Street The company was struck with astonishment After staring at each other in silent amaze doctor Francis asked how that speech could be written by him Sir said Johnson I wrote it in Exeter Street I never had been in the gallery of the House of Commons but once Cave had interest with the door keepers He and the persons employed under him gained admittance they brought away the subject of discussion the names of the speakers the side they took and the order in which they rose together with notes of the arguments advanced in the course of the debate The whole was afterwards communicated to me and I composed the speeches in the form which they now have in the Parliamentary Debates To this discovery doctor Francis made answer Then sir you have exceeded Demosthenes himself for to say that you have exceeded Francis s Demosthenes would be saying nothing The rest of the company bestowed lavish encomiums on Johnson one in particular praised his impartiality observing that he dealt out reason and eloquence with an equal hand to both parties That is not quite true said Johnson I saved appearances tolerably well but I took care that the WHIG DOGS should not have the best of it Murphy s Life of Johnson p three hundred forty three Murphy we must not forget wrote from memory for there is no reason to think that he kept notes That his memory cannot altogether be trusted has been shown by Boswell ante p three hundred ninety one note four This dinner with Foote must have taken place at least nineteen years before this account was published for so many years had doctor Francis been dead At the time when Johnson was living in Exeter street he was not engaged on the magazine Nevertheless the main facts may be true enough Johnson himself told Boswell post May thirteen seventeen seventy eight that in Lord Chesterfield s Miscellaneous Works ii three hundred nineteen there were two speeches ascribed to Chesterfield which he had himself entirely written Horace Walpole Letters i one hundred forty seven complained that the published report of his own first speech did not contain one sentence of the true one Johnson in his preface to the Literary Magazine of seventeen fifty six seems to confess what he had done unless indeed he was altogether making himself the mere mouth piece of the publisher He says We shall not attempt to give any regular series of debates or to amuse our readers with senatorial rhetorick The speeches inserted in other papers have been long known to be fictitious and produced sometimes by men who never heard the debate nor had any authentick information We have no design to impose thus grossly on our readers Works v three hundred sixty three The secret that Johnson wrote these Debates was indeed well kept He seems to be aimed at in a question that was put to Cave in his examination before the House of Lords in seventeen forty seven Being asked if he ever had any person whom he kept in pay to make speeches for him he said he never had Parl Hist xiv sixty Herein he lied in order no doubt to screen Johnson Forty four years later Horace Walpole wrote Letters ix three hundred nineteen I never knew Johnson wrote the speeches in the Gentleman s Magazine till he died Johnson told Boswell that as soon as he found that they were thought genuine he determined that he would write no more of them for he would not be accessory to the propagation of falsehood Ante p one hundred fifty two One of his Debates was translated into French German and Spanish Gent Mag xiii fifty nine and no doubt was accepted abroad as authentic When he learnt this his conscience might well have received a shock That it did receive a shock seems almost capable of proof It was in the number of the Magazine for February seventeen forty three at the beginning of March that is to say that the fact of these foreign translations was made known The last Debate that Johnson wrote was for the twenty second day of February in that year In seventeen forty seventeen forty one and seventeen forty two he had worked steadily at his Debates The beginning of seventeen forty three found him no less busy His task suddenly came to an end Among foreign nations his speeches were read as the very words of English statesmen To the propagation of such a falsehood as this he would no longer be accessory Fifteen years later Smollett quoted them as if they were genuine History of England iii seventy three Here however Johnson s conscience was void of offence for he had cautioned him not to rely on them for that they were not authentic Hawkins Life p one hundred twenty nine That they should generally have passed current shews how unacquainted people at that time were with real debating Even if we had not Johnson s own statement both from external and internal evidence we could have known that they were for the most part the mere coinage of his imagination They do not read like speeches that had ever been spoken None of them mister Flood said were at all like real debates post under March thirty seventeen seventy one They are commonly formed of general statements which suit any one speaker just as well as any other The scantier were the notes that were given him by those who had heard the debate the more he had to draw on his imagination But his was an imagination which supplied him with what was general much more readily than with what was particular Had De Foe been the composer he would have scattered over each speech the most ingenious and probable matters of detail but De Foe and Johnson were wide as the poles asunder Neither had Johnson any dramatic power His parliamentary speakers have scarcely more variety than the characters in Irene Unless he had been a constant frequenter of the galleries of the two Houses he could not have acquired any knowledge of the style and the peculiarities of the different members Nay even of their modes of thinking and their sentiments he could have gained but the most general notions Of debating he knew nothing It was the set speeches in Livy and the old historians that he took as his models In his orations there is very little of the tart reply there is indeed scarcely any examination of an adversary s arguments So general are the speeches that the order in which they are given might very often without inconvenience be changed They are like a series of leading articles on both sides of the question but all written by one man Johnson is constantly shifting his character and like Falstaff and the Prince playing first his own part and then his opponent s It is wonderful how well he preserves his impartiality though he does take care that the Whig dogs should not have the best of it He not only took the greatest liberties in his reports but he often took them openly Thus an army bill was debated in committee on Dec ten seventeen forty and again the following day on the report in the full House As in these two debates he writes the arguments were the same mister Gulliver has thrown them into one to prevent unnecessary repetitions Gent Mag Dec seventeen forty two p six hundred seventy six In each House during the winter of seventeen forty two three there was a debate on taking the Hanoverian troops into pay The debate in the Lords was spread over five numbers of the Magazine in the following summer and autumn It was not till the spring of seventeen forty four that the turn of the Commons came and then they were treated somewhat scurvily This debate says the reporter who was Johnson we thought it necessary to contract by the omission of those arguments which were fully discussed in the House of Hurgoes and of those speakers who produced them lest we should disgust our readers by tedious repetitions Ib xiv one hundred twenty five Many of these debates have been reported somewhat briefly by Bishop afterwards Archbishop Seeker To follow his account requires an accurate knowledge of the times whereas Johnson s rhetorick for the most part is easily understood even by one very ignorant of the history of the first two Georges Much of it might have been spoken on almost any occasion for or against almost any minister It is true that we here and there find such a correspondence between the two reports as shews that Johnson as he has himself told us was at times furnished with some information But on the other hand we can no less clearly see that he was often drawing solely on his imagination Frequently there is but the slightest agreement between the reports given by the two men of the same speeches Of this a good instance is afforded by Lord Carteret s speech of Feb thirteen seventeen forty one According to Johnson the Hurgo Quadrert began in this manner As the motion which I am about to make is of the highest importance and of the most extensive consequences as it cannot but meet with all the opposition which the prejudices of some and the interest of others can raise against it as it must have the whole force of ministerial influence to encounter without any assistance but from justice and reason I hope to be excused by your Lordships for spending some time in endeavouring to shew that it wants no other support that it is not founded upon doubtful suspicions but upon uncontestable facts and so on for eight more lines Gent Mag xi three hundred thirty nine The Bishop s note begins as follows CARTERET I am glad to see the House so full The honour of the nation is at stake And the oldest man hath not known such circumstances as we are in When storms rise you must see what pilots you have and take methods to make the nation easy I shall one go through the foreign transactions of several years two The domestic three Prove that what I am about to propose is a parliamentary method Parl Hist xi ten forty seven Still more striking is the difference in the two reports of a speech by Lord Talbot on May twenty five seventeen forty two According to the Gent Mag xii five hundred nineteen the Hurgo Toblat spoke to this effect So high is my veneration for this great assembly that it is never without the utmost efforts of resolution that I can prevail upon myself to give my sentiments upon any question that is the subject of debate however strong may be my conviction or however ardent my zeal The Bishop makes him say I rise up only to give time to others to consider how they will carry on the debate Parl Hist xii six hundred forty six On Feb thirteen seventeen forty one the same Lord being called to order for saying that there were Lords who were influenced by a place exclaimed according to the Bishop By the eternal G d I will defend my cause everywhere But Lords calling to order he recollected himself and made an excuse Parl Hist xi ten sixty three In the Gent Mag xi fourlnine the Hurgo Toblat resumed My Lords whether anything has escaped from me that deserves such severe animadversions your Lordships must decide Once at least in Johnson s reports a speech is given to the wrong member In the debate on the Gin Bill on Feb twenty two seventeen forty three Gent Mag xiii six hundred ninety six though the Bishop s notes show that he did not speak yet a long speech is put into his mouth It was the Earl of Sandwich who had spoken at this turn of the debate The editor of the Parl Hist xii thirteen ninety eight without even notifying the change coolly transfers the speech from the decent Seeker fourteen sixty six who was afterwards Primate to the grossly licentious Earl A transference such as this is however but of little moment For the most part the speeches would be scarcely less lifelike if all on one side were assigned to some nameless Whig and all on the other side to some nameless Tory It is nevertheless true that here and there are to be found passages which no doubt really fell from the speaker in whose mouth they are put They mention some fact or contain some allusion which could not otherwise have been known by Johnson Even if we had not Cave s word for it we might have inferred that now and then a member was himself his own reporter Thus in the Gent Mag for February seventeen forty four p sixty eight we find a speech by Sir John saint Aubyn that had appeared eight months earlier in the very same words in the London Magazine That Johnson copied a rival publication is most unlikely impossible I might say saint Aubyn I conjecture sent a copy of his speech to both editors In the Gent Mag for April seventeen forty three p one hundred eighty four a speech by Lord Percival on Dec ten seventeen forty two is reported apparently at full length The debate itself was not published till the spring of seventeen forty four when the reader is referred for this speech to the back number in which it had already been inserted Ib xiv one hundred twenty three The London Magazine generally gave the earlier report it was however twitted by its rival with its inaccuracy In one debate it was said it had introduced instead of twenty speakers but six and those in a very confused manner It had attributed to Caecilius words remembered by the whole audience to be spoken by M Agrippa Gent Mag xii five hundred twelve The report of the debate of Feb thirteen seventeen forty one in the London Magazine fills more than twenty two columns of the Parl Hist xi eleven thirty with a speech by Lord Bathurst That he did speak is shewn by Secker ib p ten sixty two No mention of him is made however in the report in the Gent Mag xi three hundred thirty nine But on the other hand it reports eleven speakers while the London Magazine gives but five Secker shows that there were nineteen Though the London Magazine was generally earlier in publishing the debates it does not therefore follow that Johnson had seen their reports when he wrote his His may have been kept back by Cave s timidity for some months even after they had been set up in type In the staleness of the debate there was some safeguard against a parliamentary prosecution mister Croker maintains Croker s Boswell p forty four that Johnson wrote the Debates from the time June seventeen thirty eight that they assumed the Lilliputian title till seventeen forty four In this he is certainly wrong Even if we had not Johnson s own statement from the style of the earlier Debates we could have seen that they were not written by him No doubt we come across numerous traces of his work but this we should have expected Boswell tells us that Guthrie s reports were sent to Johnson for revision ante p one hundred eighteen Nay even a whole speech now and then may be from his hand It is very likely that he wrote for instance the Debate on buttons and button holes Gent Mag viii six hundred twenty seven and the Debate on the registration of seamen ib xi But it is absurd to attribute to him passages such as the following which in certain numbers are plentiful enough long after June seventeen thirty eight There never was any measure pursued more consistent with and more consequential of the sense of this House ib ix three hundred forty It gave us a handle of making such reprisals upon the Iberians as this Crown found the sweets of ib x two hundred eighty one That was the only expression that the least shadow of fault was found with ib xi two hundred ninety two Johnson told me himself says Boswell ante p one hundred fifty that he was the sole composer of the Debates for those three years only seventeen forty one two three He was not however precisely exact in his statement which he mentioned from hasty recollection for it is sufficiently evident that his composition of them began November nineteen seventeen forty and ended February twenty three twenty two seventeen forty two three Some difficulty is caused in following Boswell s statement by the length of time that often elapsed between the debate itself and its publication The speeches that were spoken between Nov nineteen or more strictly speaking Nov twenty five seventeen forty and Feb twenty two seventeen forty three were in their publication spread through the Magazine from July seventeen forty one to March seventeen forty four On Feb thirteen seventeen forty one Lord Carteret in the House of Lords and mister Sandys the Motion maker fourteen sixty seven in the House of Commons moved an address to the King for the removal of Sir Robert Walpole Johnson s report of the debate in the Lords was published in the Magazine for the next July and August The year went round Walpole s ministry was overthrown and Walpole himself was banished to the House of Lords A second year went by At length in three of the spring numbers of seventeen forty three the debate on Sandys s motion was reported It had been published in the London Magazine eleven months earlier Cave if he was tardy nevertheless was careful that his columns should not want variety Thus in the number for July seventeen forty three we have the middle part of the debate in the Lords on Feb one seventeen forty three the end of the debate in the Commons on March nine seventeen forty two and the beginning of another in the Commons on the following March twenty three From the number for July seventeen forty one to the number for March seventeen forty four Johnson as I have already said was the sole composer of the Debates The irregularity with which they were given at first sight seems strange but in it a certain method can be discovered The proceedings of a House of Commons that had come to an end might as I have shown be freely published There had been a dissolution after the session which closed in April seventeen forty one The publication of the Debates of the old parliament could at once begin and could go on freely from month to month all the year round But they would not last for ever In seventeen forty two in the autumn recess the time when experience had shewn that the resolution of the House could be broken with the least danger the Debates of the new parliament were published They were continued even in the short session before Christmas But the spring of seventeen forty three saw a cautious return to the reports of the old parliament The session closed on April twenty one and in the May number the comparatively fresh Debates began again In one case the report was not six months after date In the beginning of seventeen forty four this publication went on even in the session but it was confined to the proceedings of the previous winter The following table shews the order in which Johnson s Debates were published Gentleman s

forty two Feb twenty two seventeen forty three Mar Dec ten seventeen forty two During the rest of seventeen forty four the debates were given in the old form and in a style that is a close imitation of Johnson s Most likely they were composed by Hawkesworth ante p two hundred fifty two In seventeen forty five they were fewer in number and in seventeen forty six the reports of the Senate of Lilliputia with its Hurgoes and Clinabs passed away for ever They had begun to quote the words of the Preface to the Magazine for seventeen forty seven at a time when a determined spirit of opposition in the national assemblies communicated itself to almost every individual multiplied and invigorated periodical papers and rendered politics the chief if not the only object of curiosity They are a monument to the greatness of Walpole and to the genius of Johnson Had that statesman not been overthrown the people would have called for these reports even though Johnson had refused to write them Had Johnson still remained the reporter even though Walpole no longer swayed the Senate of the Lilliputians the speeches of that tumultuous body would still have been read For though they are not debates yet they have a vast vigour and a great fund of wisdom of their own APPENDIX B JOHNSON S LETTERS TO HIS MOTHER AND MISS PORTER IN seventeen fifty nine Page three hundred forty Malone published

but you in whom I put all my little affairs with too much confidence to desire you to keep receipts as you prudently proposed If you and Kitty will keep the house I think I shall like it best Kitty may carry on the trade for herself keeping her own stock apart and laying aside any money that she receives for any of the goods which her good mistress has left behind her I do not see if this scheme be followed any need of appraising the books My mother s debts dear mother I suppose I may pay with little difficulty and the little trade may go silently forward I fancy Kitty can do nothing better

have the highest value for her and would do any thing for her advantage Let her think of this proposal I do not see any likelier method by which she may pass the remaining part of her life in quietness and competence You must have what part of the house you please while you are inclined to stay in it but I flatter myself with the hope that you and I shall some time pass our days together I am very solitary and comfortless but will not invite you to come hither till I can have hope of making you live here so as not to dislike your situation Pray my dearest write to me as often as you can I am dear Madam Your affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON Feb six seventeen fifty nine To Miss PORTER DEAR MADAM I thought your last letter long in coming and did not require or expect such an inventory of little things as you have sent me I could have taken your word for a matter of much greater value I am glad that Kitty is better let her be paid first as my dear dear mother ordered and then let me know at once the sum necessary to discharge her other debts and I will find it you very soon I beg my dear that you would act for me without the least scruple for I can repose myself very

dear to write often to me and tell me how you like my little book I am dear love your affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON May ten seventeen fifty nine JOHNSON AT CAMBRIDGE Page four hundred eighty seven The following is the full extract of doctor Sharp s letter giving an account of Johnson s visit to Cambridge in seventeen sixty five Camb Mar one seventeen sixty five As to Johnson you will be surprised to hear that I have had him in the chair in which I am now writing He has ascended my aerial citadel He came down on a Saturday evening with a mister Beauclerk who has a friend at Trinity Caliban you may be sure was not roused from his lair before next day noon and his breakfast probably kept him till night I saw nothing of him nor was he heard of by any one till Monday afternoon when I was sent for home to two gentlemen unknown In conversation I made a strange faux pas about Burnaby Greene s poem in which Johnson is drawn at full length fourteen seventy four He drank his large potations of tea with me interrupted by many an indignant contradiction and many a noble sentiment He had on a better wig than usual but one whose curls were not like Sir Cloudesly s fourteen seventy five formed for eternal buckle fourteen seventy six Our conversation was chiefly on books you may be sure He was much pleased with a small Milton of mine published in the author s lifetime and with the Greek epigram on his own effigy of its being the picture not of him but of a bad painter fourteen seventy seven There are many manuscript stanzas for aught I know in Milton s own handwriting and several interlined hints and fragments We were puzzled about one of the sonnets which we thought was not to be found in Newton s edition fourteen seventy eight and differed from all the printed ones But Johnson cried No no repeated the whole sonnet instantly memoriter and shewed it us in Newton s book After which he learnedly harangued on sonnet writing and its different numbers He tells me he will come hither again quickly and is promised an habitation in Emanuel College fourteen seventy nine He went back to town next morning but as it began to be known that he was in the university several persons got into his company the last evening at Trinity where about twelve he began to be very great stripped poor missus Macaulay to the very skin then gave her for his toast and drank her

can be estimated by those who know them not only as they are represented by those who know them and therefore I flatter myself that I owe much of the pleasure which this distinction gives me to your concurrence with doctor Andrews in recommending me to the learned society Having desired the Provost to return my general thanks to the University I beg that you sir will accept my particular and immediate acknowledgements I am Sir Your most obedient and most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Johnson s court Fleet street London Oct seventeen seventeen sixty five APPENDIX E JOHNSON S ENGAGING IN POLITICKS WITH H N Page four hundred ninety In a little volume entitled Parliamentary Logick by the Right honorable W G Hamilton published in eighteen oh eight twelve years after the author s death is included Considerations on Corn by doctor Johnson Works v three hundred twenty one It was written says Hamilton s editor in November seventeen sixty six A dearth had caused riots Those who want the supports of life Johnson wrote will seize them wherever they can be found Ib p three hundred twenty two He supported in this tract the bounty for exporting corn If more than a year after he had engaged in politics with mister Hamilton nothing had been produced but this short tract the engagement was not of much importance But there was I suspect much more in it Indeed the editor says Preface p ix that Johnson had entered into some engagement with mister Hamilton occasionally to furnish him with his sentiments on the great political topicks that should be considered in Parliament mister Croker draws attention to a passage in Johnson s letter to Miss Porter of Jan fourteen seventeen sixty six Croker s Boswell p one hundred seventy three in which he says I cannot well come to Lichfield during the session of parliament In the spring of this same year Burke had broken with Hamilton in whose service he had been The occasion of our difference he wrote was not any act whatsoever on my part it was entirely upon his by a voluntary but most insolent and intolerable demand amounting to no less than a claim of servitude during the whole course of my life without leaving to me at any time a power either of getting forward with honour or of retiring with tranquillity Burke s Corres i seventy seven It seems to me highly probable that Hamilton in consequence of his having just lost as I have shewn Burke s services sought Johnson s aid He had taken Burke as a companion in his studies Ib p forty eight Six of the best years of my life wrote Burke he took me from every pursuit of literary reputation or of improvement of my fortune In that time he made his own fortune a very great one Ib p sixty seven Burke had been recommended to Hamilton by doctor Warton On losing him Hamilton on Feb twelve seventeen sixty five wrote to Warton giving a false account of his separation with Burke and asking him to recommend some one to fill his place some one who in addition to a taste and an understanding of ancient authors and what generally passes under the name of scholarship has likewise a share of modern knowledge and has applied himself in some degree to the study of the law By way of payment he offers at once an income which would neither be insufficient for him as a man of letters or disreputable to him as a gentleman and hereafter a situation a post that is to say under government Wooll s Warton i two hundred ninety nine Warton recommended Chambers Chambers does not seem to have accepted the post for we find him staying on at Oxford post ii twenty five forty six Johnson had all the knowledge that Hamilton required except that of law It is this very study that we find him at this very time entering upon All this shows that for some time and to some extent an engagement was formed between him and Hamilton Boswell writing to Malone on Feb twenty five seventeen ninety one while The Life of Johnson was going through the press says I shall have more cancels That nervous mortal W G H is not satisfied with my report of some particulars which I wrote down from his own mouth and is so much agitated that Courtenay has persuaded me to allow a new edition of them by H himself to be made at H s expense Croker s Boswell p eight hundred twenty nine This would seem to show that there was something that Hamilton wished to conceal Horace Walpole Memoirs of the Reign of George III iii four hundred two does not give him a character for truthfulness He writes on one occasion Hamilton denied it but his truth was not renowned Miss Burney who met Hamilton fourteen years after this thus describes him This mister Hamilton is extremely tall and handsome has an air of haughty and fashionable superiority is intelligent dry sarcastic and clever I should have received much pleasure from his conversational powers had I not previously been prejudiced against him by hearing that he is infinitely artful double and crafty Mme D Arblay s Diary i two hundred ninety three APPENDIX F JOHNSON S FIRST ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE THRALES AND HIS SERIOUS ILLNESS Page four hundred ninety Johnson Pr and Med p one hundred ninety one writes My first knowledge of Thrale was in seventeen sixty five In a letter to missus Thrale he says You were but five and twenty when I knew you first Piozzi Letters i two hundred eighty four As she was born on Jan sixteen twenty seven seventeen forty one this would place their introduction in seventeen sixty six In another letter written on July eight seventeen eighty four he talks of her kindness which soothed twenty years of a life radically wretched Ib ii three hundred seventy six Perhaps however he here spoke in round numbers missus Piozzi Anec p one hundred twenty five says they first met in seventeen sixty four mister Thrale she writes sought an excuse for inviting him The celebrity of mister Woodhouse post ii one hundred twenty seven a shoemaker whose verses were at that time the subject of common discourse soon afforded a pretence There is a notice of Woodhouse in the Gent Mag for June seventeen sixty four p two hundred eighty nine Johnson she says dined with them every Thursday through the winter of seventeen sixty four five and in the autumn of seventeen sixty five followed them to Brighton In the Piozzi Letters i one there is a letter of his dated Aug thirteen seventeen sixty five in which he speaks of his intention to join them there From that time she writes his visits grew more frequent till in the year seventeen sixty six his health which he had always complained of grew so exceedingly bad that he could not stir out of his room in the court he inhabited for many weeks together I think months mister Thrale s attentions and my own now became so acceptable to him that he often lamented to us the horrible condition of his mind which he said was nearly distracted and though he charged us to make him odd solemn promises of secrecy on so strange a subject yet when we waited on him one morning and heard him in the most pathetic terms beg the prayers of doctor Delap the Rector of Lewes who had left him as we came in I felt excessively affected with grief and well remember my husband involuntarily lifted up one hand to shut his mouth from provocation at hearing a man so widely proclaim what he could at last persuade no one to believe and what if true would have been so unfit to reveal mister Thrale went away soon after leaving me with him and bidding me prevail on him to quit his close habitation in the court and come with us to Streatham where I undertook the care of his health and had the honour and happiness of contributing to its restoration It is not possible to reconcile the contradiction in dates between Johnson and missus Piozzi nor is it easy to fix the time of this illness That before February seventeen sixty six he had had an illness so serious as to lead him altogether to abstain from wine is beyond a doubt Boswell on his return to England in that month heard it from his own lips post ii eight That this illness must have attacked him after March one seventeen sixty five when he visited Cambridge is also clear for at that time he was still drinking wine ante Appendix C That he was unusually depressed in the spring of this year is shewn by his entry at Easter ante p four hundred eighty seven From his visit to doctor Percy in the summer of seventeen sixty four ante p four hundred eighty six to the autumn of seventeen sixty five we have very little information about him For more than two years he did not write to Boswell post ii one doctor Adams ante p four hundred eighty three describes the same kind of attack as missus Piozzi Its date is not given Boswell after quoting an entry made on Johnson s birthday Sept eighteen seventeen sixty four says about this time he was afflicted with the illness doctor Adams describes From missus Piozzi from Johnson s account to Boswell and from doctor Adams we learn of a serious illness Was there more than one If there was only one then Boswell is wrong in placing it before March one seventeen sixty five when Johnson was still a wine drinker and missus Piozzi is wrong in placing it after February seventeen sixty six when he had become an abstainer Johnson certainly stayed at Streatham from before Midsummer to October in seventeen sixty six post ii twenty five and Pr and Med p seventy one and this fact lends support to missus Piozzi s statement But on the other hand his meetings with Boswell in February of that year and his letters to Langton of March nine and May ten post ii sixteen seventeen shew a not unhappy frame of mind Boswell in his Hebrides Oct sixteen seventeen seventy three speaks of Johnson s illness in seventeen sixty six If it was in seventeen sixty six that he was ill it must have been after May ten and before Midsummer day and this period is almost too brief for missus Piozzi s account It is a curious coincidence that Cowper was introduced to the Unwins in the same year in which Johnson according to his own account had his first knowledge of the Thrales Southey s Cowper i one hundred seventy one FOOTNOTES one Post iv one

February Will you now do my picture and the price shall be paid out of the first fees which I receive as a barrister in Westminster Hall Or if that fund should fail it shall be paid at any rate five

Nash The doctor was one day conversing with Locke and two or three more of his learned and intimate companions with that freedom gaiety and cheerfulness which is ever the result of innocence In the midst of their mirth and laughter the doctor looking from the window saw Nash s chariot stop at the door Boys boys cried the philosopher let us now be wise for here is a fool coming Cunningham s Goldsmith s Works iv ninety six doctor Warton in his criticism on Pope s line Unthought of frailties cheat us in the wise Moral Essays i sixty nine says For who could imagine that doctor Clarke valued

heard I don t know for the truth of it and I can t tell what he will do He is so extraordinary a man that perhaps he will devise something extraordinary Mme D Artlay s Diary ii four hundred doctor Johnson s history wrote Horace Walpole on June twenty seventeen eighty five though he is going to have as many lives as a cat might be reduced to four lines but I shall wait to extract the quintessence till Sir John Hawkins Madame Piozzi and mister Boswell have produced their quartos Horace Walpole s Letters viii five hundred fifty seven fifty nine The delay was in part due to Boswell s dissipation and place hunting as is shewn by the following passages in his Letters to Temple Feb twenty four seventeen eighty eight I have been wretchedly dissipated so that I have not written a line for a fortnight p two hundred sixty six Nov twenty eight seventeen eighty nine Malone s hospitality and my other invitations and particularly my attendance at Lord Lonsdale s have lost us many

Boswell p three hundred eleven sixty one Boswell writing to Temple in seventeen seventy five says I try to keep a journal and shall shew you that I have done tolerably but it is hardly credible what ground I go over and what a variety of men and manners I contemplate in a day and all the time I myself am pars magna for my exuberant spirits will not let me listen enough Ib p one hundred eighty eight mister Barclay said that he had seen Boswell lay down his knife and fork and take out his tablets in order to register a good anecdote Croker s Boswell p eight hundred thirty seven The account given by Paoli to Miss Burney shows that very early in life Boswell took out his tablets He came to my country and he fetched me some letter of recommending him but I was of the belief he might be an impostor and I supposed in my minde he was an espy for I look away from him and in a moment I look to him again and I behold his tablets Oh he was to the work of writing down all I say Indeed I was angry But soon I discover he was no impostor and no espy and I only find I was myself the monster he had come to discern Oh he is a very good man I love him indeed so cheerful so gay so pleasant but at the first oh I was indeed angry Mme D Arblay s Diary ii one hundred fifty five Boswell not only recorded the conversations he often stimulated them On one occasion he assumed he said an air of ignorance to incite doctor Johnson to talk for which it was often necessary to employ some address See post April twelve seventeen seventy six Tom Tyers said Johnson described me the best He once said to me Sir you are like a ghost you never speak till you are spoken to Boswell s Hebrides Aug twenty seventeen seventy three Boswell writing of this Tour said I also may be allowed to claim some merit in leading the conversation I do not mean leading as in an orchestra by playing the first fiddle but leading as one does in examining a witness starting topics and making him pursue them Ib Sept twenty eight One day he recorded I did not exert myself to get doctor Johnson to talk that I might not have the labour of writing down his conversation Ib Sept seven His industry grew much less towards the close of Johnson s life Under May eight seventeen eighty one he records Of his conversation on that and other occasions during this period I neglected to keep any regular record On May fifteen seventeen eighty three I have no minute of any interview with Johnson from May one till May fifteen May fifteen seventeen eighty four Of these days and others on which I saw him I have no memorials sixty two It is an interesting question how far Boswell derived his love of truth from himself and how far from Johnson s training He was one of Johnson s school He himself quotes Reynolds s observation that all who were of his school are distinguished for a love of truth and accuracy which they would not have possessed in the same degree if they had not been acquainted with Johnson post under March thirty seventeen seventy eight Writing to Temple in seventeen eighty nine he said Johnson taught me to cross question in common life Letters of Boswell p two hundred eighty His quotations nevertheless are not unfrequently inaccurate Yet to him might fairly be applied the words that Gibbon used of Tillemont His inimitable accuracy almost assumes the character of genius Gibbon s Misc

neighbourhood Excluding the time they were together on their tour to the Hebrides they were dwelling within reach of each other a few weeks less than two years Moreover when they were apart there were great gaps in their correspondence Between Dec eight seventeen sixty three and Jan fourteen seventeen sixty six and again between Nov ten seventeen sixty nine and June twenty seventeen seventy one

confined me to bed in pain and fever and helplessness as a child many days This shall be a crisis in my life I trust I shall henceforth be a sober regular man Indeed my indulgence in wine has of late

brother expired this morning at two o clock we have both lost a kind affectionate friend and I shall never have such another Letters of Boswell p three hundred fifty seven What was probably Boswell s last letter is as follows My Dear Temple I would fain write to you in my own hand but really cannot These words which are hardly legible and probably the last poor Boswell ever wrote afford the clearest evidence of his utter physical prostration Alas my friend what a state is this My son James is to write for me what remains of this letter and I am to dictate The pain which continued for so many weeks was very severe indeed and when it went off I thought myself quite well but I soon felt a conviction that I was by no means as I should be so exceedingly weak as my miserable attempt to write to you afforded a full proof All then that can be said is that I must wait with patience But O my friend how strange is it that at this very time of my illness you and Miss Temple should have been in such a dangerous state Much occasion for thankfulness is there that it has not been worse with you Pray write or make somebody write frequently I feel myself a good deal stronger to day not

his own story He that recounts the life of another lessens the familiarity of his tale to increase its dignity and endeavours to hide the man that he may produce a hero eighty six It very seldom happens to man that his business is his pleasure What is done from necessity is so often to be done when against the present inclination and so often fills the mind with anxiety that an habitual dislike steals upon us and we shrink involuntarily from the remembrance of our task From this unwillingness to perform more than is required of that which is commonly performed with reluctance it proceeds that few authors write their own lives Idler No one hundred two See also post May one seventeen eighty three eighty seven missus Piozzi records the following conversation with Johnson which she says took place on July eighteen seventeen seventy three And who will be my biographer said he do you think Goldsmith no doubt replied I and he will do it the best among us The dog would write it best to be sure replied he but his particular malice towards me and general disregard for truth would make the book useless to all and injurious to my character Oh as to that said I we should all fasten upon him and force him to do you justice but the worst is the Doctor does not know your life nor can I tell indeed who does except doctor Taylor of Ashbourne Why Taylor said he is better acquainted with my heart than any man or woman now alive and the history of my Oxford exploits lies all between him and Adams but doctor James knows my very early days better than he After my coming to London to drive the world about a little you must all go to Jack Hawkesworth for anecdotes I lived in great familiarity with him though I think there was not much affection from the year seventeen fifty three till the time mister Thrale and you took me up I intend however to disappoint the rogues and either make you write the life with Taylor s intelligence or which is better do it myself after outliving you all I am now added he keeping a diary in hopes of using it for that purpose sometime Piozzi s Anec p thirty one How much of this is true cannot be known Boswell some time before this conversation had told Johnson that he intended to write his Life and Johnson had given him many particulars see post March thirty one seventeen seventy two and April eleven seventeen seventy three He read moreover in manuscript most of Boswell s Tour to the Hebrides and from it learnt of his intention It is no small satisfaction to me to reflect Boswell wrote that doctor Johnson after being apprised of my intentions communicated to me at subsequent periods many particulars of his life Boswell s Hebrides Oct fourteen seventeen seventy three eighty eight It may be said the death of doctor Johnson kept the public mind in agitation beyond all former example No literary character ever excited so much attention Murphy s Johnson p three eighty nine The greatest part of this book was written while Sir John Hawkins was alive and I avow that one object of my strictures was to make him feel some compunction for his illiberal treatment of doctor Johnson Since his decease I have suppressed several of my remarks upon his work But though I would not war with the dead offensively I think it necessary to be strenuous in defence of my illustrious friend which I cannot be without strong animadversions upon a writer who has greatly injured him Let me add that though I doubt I should not have been very prompt to gratify Sir John Hawkins with any compliment in his life time I do now frankly acknowledge that in my opinion his volume however inadequate and improper as a life of doctor Johnson and however discredited by unpardonable inaccuracies in other respects contains a collection of curious anecdotes and observations which few men but its author could have brought together BOSWELL ninety The next name that was started was that of Sir John Hawkins and missus Thrale said Why now doctor Johnson he is another of those whom you suffer nobody to abuse but yourself Garrick is one too for if any other person speaks against him you brow beat him in a minute Why madam answered he they don t know when to abuse him and when to praise him I will allow no man to speak ill of David that he does not deserve and as to Sir John why really I believe him to be an honest man at the bottom but to be sure he is penurious and he is mean and it must be owned he has a degree of brutality and a tendency to savageness that cannot easily be defended He said that Sir John and he once belonged to the same club but that as he eat no supper after the first night of his admission he desired to be excused paying his share And was he excused O yes for no man is angry at another for being inferior to himself We all scorned him and admitted his plea For my part I was such a fool as to pay my share for wine though I never tasted any But Sir John was a most unclubable man Madame D Arblay s Diary i sixty five ninety one In censuring mister sic J Hawkins s book I say There is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable cast which puts the most unfavourable construction on my illustrious friend s conduct Malone maintains cast will not do he will have malignancy Is that not too strong How would disposition do Hawkins is no doubt very malevolent Observe how he talks of me as quite unknown Letters of Boswell p two hundred eighty one Malone wrote of Hawkins as follows The bishop Bishop Percy of Dromore concurred with every other person I have heard speak of Hawkins in saying that he was a most detestable fellow He was the son of a carpenter and set out in life in the very lowest line of the law Dyer knew him well at one time and the Bishop heard him give a character of Hawkins once that painted him in the blackest colours though Dyer was by no means apt to deal in such portraits Dyer said he was a man of the most mischievous uncharitable and malignant disposition Sir Joshua Reynolds observed to me that Hawkins though he assumed great outward sanctity was not only mean and grovelling in dispostion but absolutely dishonest He never lived in any real

been more literate they had been better companions She might have sometimes introduced her unwelcome topic with more success if she could have diversified her conversation Of business she had no distinct conception and therefore her discourse was composed only of complaint fear and suspicion Neither of them ever tried to calculate the profits of trade or the expenses of living My mother

them and maintain his family he got something but not enough Annals p fourteen mister Croker noticing the violence of Johnson s language against the Excise with great acuteness suspected some cause of

Lichfield while Johnson was under three years of age Sacheverel indeed made a triumphal progress through the midland counties in seventeen ten and it appears by the books of the corporation of Lichfield that he was received in that town and complimented by the attendance of the corporation and a present of three dozen of wine on June sixteen seventeen ten but then the infant Hercules of Toryism was just nine months old It is quite possible that the story is in the main correct Sacheverel was received in Lichfield in seventeen ten on his way down to Shropshire to take possession of a

of its truth been made the foundation of the following ingenious and fanciful reflections of Miss Seward amongst the communications concerning doctor Johnson with which she has been pleased to favour me These infant numbers contain the seeds of those propensities which through his life so strongly marked his character of that poetick talent which afterwards bore such rich and plentiful fruits for excepting his orthographick works every thing which doctor Johnson wrote was Poetry whose essence consists not in numbers or in jingle but in the strength and glow of a fancy to which all the stores of nature and of art stand in prompt administration and in an eloquence which conveys their blended illustrations in a language more tuneable than needs or rhyme or verse to add more harmony The above little verses also shew that superstitious bias which grew with his growth and strengthened with his strength and of late years particularly injured his happiness by presenting to him the gloomy side of religion rather than that bright and cheering one which gilds the period of closing life with the light of pious hope This is so beautifully imagined that I would not suppress it But like many

of kings who had not at that time been crowned or anointed ib xviii thirteen Thereupon the Court of Common Council by a unanimous vote withdrew its subscription ib one hundred eighty five The old

seventeen seventy two Steele in the Spectator No one hundred fifty seven two years after Johnson s birth describes these savage tyrants of the grammar schools The boasted liberty we talk of he writes is but a mean reward for the long servitude the many heartaches and terrors to which our childhood is exposed in going through a grammar school No one who has gone through what they call a great school but must remember to have seen children of excellent and ingenuous natures as has afterwards appeared in their manhood I say no man has passed through this way of education but must have seen an ingenuous creature expiring with shame with pale looks beseeching sorrow and silent tears throw up its honest eyes and kneel or its tender kneeds to an inexorable blockhead to be forgiven the false quantity of a word in making a Latin verse Likely enough Johnson s roughness was in part due to this brutal treatment for Steele goes on to say It is wholly to this dreadful practise that we may attribute a certain hardiness and ferocity which some men though liberally educated carry about them in all their behaviour To be bred like a gentleman and punished like a malefactor must as we see it does produce that illiberal sauciness which we see sometimes in men of letters one hundred forty four Johnson described him as a peevish and ill tempered man and not so good a scholar or teacher as Taylor made out Once the boys perceived that he did not understand a part of the Latin lesson another time when sent up to the upper master to be punished they had to complain that when they could not

school about two years after Johnson left According to Garrick s biographer Tom Davies p three Hunter was an odd mixture of the pedant and the sportsman Happy was the boy who could slily inform his offended master where a covey of partridges was to be found this notice was a certain pledge of his pardon Lord Campbell in his Lives of the Chief Justices ii two hundred seventy nine says Hunter is celebrated for having flogged seven boys who afterwards sat as judges in the superior courts at Westminster at the same time Among these were Chief Justice Wilmot Lord Chancellor Northington Sir T Clarke Master of the Rolls Chief Justice Willes and Chief Baron Parker It is remarkable that although Johnson and Wilmot were several years class fellows at Lichfield there never seems to have been the slightest intercourse between them in after life but the Chief Justice used frequently to mention the Lexicographer as a long lank lounging boy whom he distinctly remembered to have been punished by Hunter for idleness Lord Campbell blunders here Northington and Clarke were from Westminster School Campbell s Chancellors v one hundred seventy six The schoolhouse famous though it was was allowed to fall into decay A writer in the Gent Mag in seventeen ninety four p four hundred thirteen says that it is now in a state of dilapidation and unfit for the use of either the master or boys one

practised than formerly But then said Johnson they get nothing else and what they gain at one end they lose at the other BURNEY See post under Dec seventeen seventeen seventy five one hundred forty

he replied Sir she is wrong and continued in the words of the text Gibbon in his Autobiography says The domestic discipline of our ancestors has been relaxed by the philosophy and softness of the age and if my father remembered that he had trembled before a stern parent it was only to adopt with his son an opposite mode of behaviour Gibbon s Works i one hundred twelve Lord Chesterfield writing to a friend on Oct eighteen seventeen fifty two says Pray let my godson never know what a blow or a whipping is unless for those things for which were he a man he would deserve them such as lying cheating making mischief and meditated malice Chesterfield s Misc Works iv one hundred thirty one hundred fifty Johnson however hated anything that came near to tyranny in the management of children Writing to missus Thrale who had told him that she had on one occasion gone against the wish of her nurses he said That the nurses fretted will supply me during life with an additional motive to keep every child as far as is possible out of a nurse s power A nurse made of common mould will have a pride in overcoming a child s reluctance There are few minds to which tyranny is not delightful power is nothing but as it is felt and the delight of superiority is proportionate to the resistance overcome Piozzi Letters ii sixty seven one hundred fifty one Sword I will hallow thee for this thy deed

which fault he made atonement in his old age post November seventeen eighty four one hundred sixty nine Perhaps Johnson had his own early reading in mind when he thus describes Pope s reading at about the same age During this period of his life he was indefatigably diligent and insatiably curious wanting health for violent and money for expensive pleasures and having excited in himself very strong desires of intellectual eminence he spent much of his time over his books but he read only to store his mind with facts and images seizing all that his authors presented with undistinguishing voracity

beating heart to the afternoon He had been impertinent before dinner and when he was sent for after dinner he expected a sharp rebuke one hundred seventy nine It ought to be remembered that doctor

with his household omitting public prayers he omitted all That he lived without prayer can hardly be affirmed his studies and meditations were an habitual prayer The neglect of it in his family was probably a fault for which he condemned himself and which he intended to correct but that death as too often happens intercepted his reformation Johnson s Works vii one hundred fifteen See post Oct

took the opportunity of a more remiss discipline to gratify their passions yet virtue preserved her natural superiority and those who ventured to neglect were not suffered to insult her Oxford at this date was somewhat wayward in her love for religion Whitefield records I had no sooner received the sacrament publicly on a week day at saint Mary s but I was set up as a mark for all the polite students that knew me to shoot at By this they knew that I was commenced Methodist for though there is a sacrament at the beginning of every term at which all especially the seniors are by statute obliged to be present yet so dreadfully has that once faithful city played the harlot that very few masters and no undergraduates but the Methodists attended upon it I daily underwent some contempt at

edition of it in a friend s hand I soon procured it God worked powerfully upon my soul by that and his other excellent treatise upon Christian perfection Tyerman s Whitefield i sixteen Johnson called the Serious Call the finest piece of hortatory theology in any language post seventeen seventy A few months before his death he said William Law wrote the best piece of parenetic divinity but William Law was no reasoner post June nine seventeen eighty four Law was the tutor of Gibbon s father and he died in the house of the historian s aunt In describing the Serious Call Gibbon says His precepts are rigid but they are founded on the gospel his satire is sharp but it is drawn from the knowledge of human life and many of his portraits are not unworthy of the pen of La Bruyere If he finds a spark of piety in his reader s mind he will soon kindle it to a flame Gibbon s Misc Works i twenty one two hundred seven missus Piozzi has given a strange fantastical account of the original of doctor Johnson s belief in our most holy religion At the age of ten years his mind was disturbed by scruples of infidelity which preyed upon his spirits and made him very uneasy the more so as he revealed his uneasiness to none being naturally as he said of a sullen temper and reserved disposition He searched however diligently but fruitlessly for evidences of the truth of revelation and at length recollecting a book he had once seen I suppose at five years old in his father s shop intitled De veritate Religionis et cetera he began to think himself highly culpable for neglecting such a means of information and took himself severely to task for this sin adding many acts of voluntary and to others unknown penance The first opportunity which offered of course he seized the book with avidity but on examination not finding himself scholar enough to peruse its contents set his heart at rest and not thinking to enquire whether there were any English books written on the subject followed his usual amusements and considered his conscience as lightened of a crime He redoubled his diligence to learn the language that contained the information he most wished for but from the pain which guilt namely having omitted to read what he did not understand had given him he now began to deduce the soul s immortality a sensation of pain in this world being an unquestionable proof of existence in another which was the point that belief first stopped at and from that moment resolving to be a Christian became one of the most zealous and pious ones our nation ever produced Anecdotes p seventeen This is one of the numerous misrepresentations of this lively lady which it is worth while to correct for if credit should be given to such a childish irrational and ridiculous statement of the foundation of doctor Johnson s faith in Christianity how little credit would be due to it missus Piozzi seems to wish that the world should think doctor Johnson also under the influence of that easy logick Stet pro ratione voluntas BOSWELL On April twenty eight seventeen eighty three Johnson said Religion had dropped out of my mind It was at an early part of my life Sickness brought it back and I hope I have never lost it since Most likely it was the sickness in the long vacation of seventeen twenty nine mentioned ante p sixty three two hundred eight In his Life of Milton writing of Paradise Lost he says But these truths are too important to be new they have been taught to our infancy they have mingled with our solitary thoughts and familiar conversations and are habitually interwoven

entirely through Late in life if any man praised a book in his presence he was sure to ask Did you read it through If the answer was in the affirmative he did not seem willing to believe it Murphy s Johnson p twelve It would be easy to show that Johnson read many books right through though according to missus Piozzi he asked was there ever yet anything written by mere man that was wished longer by its readers excepting Don Quixote Robinson Crusoe and the Pilgrim s Progress Piozzi s Anec p two hundred eighty one Nevertheless in Murphy s statement there is some truth See what has been just stated by Boswell that he hardly ever read any poem to an end and post April nineteen seventeen seventy three and June fifteen seventeen eighty four To him might be applied his own description of Barretier He had a quickness of apprehension and firmness of memory which enabled him to read with incredible rapidity and at the same time to retain what he read so as to be able to recollect and apply it He turned over volumes in an instant and selected what was useful for his purpose Johnson s Works vi three hundred ninety two hundred fourteen See post June fifteen seventeen eighty four

one copy he got part of it by heart while he was walking into the hall and the rest he supplied as well as he could extempore missus Piozzi recording the same ancedote says that having given the copy into the hand of the tutor who stood to receive it as he passed he was obliged to begin by chance and continue on how he could A prodigious risk however said some one Not at all exclaims Johnson no man I suppose leaps at once into deep water who does not know how to swim Piozzi s Anec p thirty two hundred fifteen He told doctor Burney that he never wrote any of his works that were printed twice

an ignorant coxcomb maintains that all scholars are blockheads on account of their scholarship J BOSWELL JUN There is I believe a Spanish proverb to the effect that to be an utter fool a man must know Latin A writer in Notes and Queries fifth S xii two hundred eighty five suggests that Johnson had in mind Acts xvii twenty one two hundred twenty two It was the practice in his time for a servitor by order of the Master to go round to the rooms of the young men and knocking at the door to enquire if they were within and if no answer was returned to report them absent Johnson could not endure this intrusion and would frequently be silent when the utterance of a word would have ensured him from censure and would join with others of the young men in the college in hunting as they called it the servitor who was thus diligent in his duty and this they did with the noise of pots and candlesticks singing to the tune of Chevy Chase the words in the old ballad To drive the deer with hound and horn Hawkins p twelve Whitefield writing of a few years later says At this time Satan used to terrify me much and threatened to punish me if I discovered his wiles It being my duty as servitor in my

clothes were worn out and he received notice that at a coffee house some clothes and linen were left for him But though the offer was so far generous it was made with some neglect of ceremonies which mister Savage so much resented that he refused the present and declined to enter the house till the clothes that had been designed for him were taken away Johnson s Works viii one hundred sixty one

so far as food went he lived in spite of mister Carlyle s assertion as well as his fellow students two hundred thirty seven mister Croker states that an examination of the college books proves that Johnson who entered on the thirty first October seventeen twenty eight remained there even during the vacations to the twelfth December seventeen twenty nine when he personally left the college and never returned though his name remained on the books till eighth October seventeen thirty one I have gone into this question at great length in my Dr Johnson His Friends and His Critics p three hundred twenty nine I am of opinion that mister Croker s general conclusion is right The proof of residence is established and alone established by the entries in the buttery books Now these entries show that Johnson with the exception of the week in October seventeen twenty nine ending on the twenty fourth was in residence till December twelve seventeen twenty nine He seems to have returned for a week in March seventeen thirty and again for a week in the following September On three other weeks there is a charge against him of fivepence in the books mister Croker has made that darker which was already dark enough by confounding as I have shewn two John Taylors who both matriculated at Christ Church Boswell s statement no doubt is precise but in this he followed perhaps the account given by Hawkins He would have been less likely to discover Hawkins s error from the fact that as Johnson s name was for about three years on the College books he was so long in name at least a member of the College Had Boswell seen Johnson s letter to mister Hickman quoted by mister Croker Croker s Boswell p twenty he would at once have seen that Johnson could not have remained at college for a little more than three years For within three years all but a day of his entrance at Pembroke he writes to mister Hickman from Lichfield As I am yet unemployed I hope you will if anything should offer remember and recommend Sir your humble servant Sam Johnson In Boswell s Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides Aug fifteen seventeen seventy three there is a very perplexing passage bearing on Johnson s residence at College We talked of Whitefield He said he was at the same college with him and knew him before he began to be better than other people Now Johnson as Boswell tells us read this journal in manuscript The statement therefore seems to be well established indeed Yet Whitefield did not matriculate till Nov seven seventeen thirty two a full year after Johnson according to Boswell had left Oxford We are told that when Johnson was living at Birmingham he borrowed Lobo s Abyssinia from the library of Pembroke College It is probable enough that a man who frequently walked from Lichfield to Birmingham and back would have trudged all the way to Oxford to fetch the book In that case he might have seen Whitefield But Thomas Warton says that the first time of his being at Oxford after quitting the University was in seventeen fifty four post under July sixteen seventeen fifty four two hundred thirty eight March sixteen seventeen twenty eight nine Yesterday in a Convocation mister Wm Jorden of Pembroke Coll was elected the Univ of Oxford rector of Astocke in com Wilts which belongs to a Roman Catholic family Hearne s Remains iii seventeen His fellowship was filled up on Dec twenty three seventeen thirty Boswell s statement therefore is inaccurate If Johnson remained at college till Nov seventeen thirty one he would have really been for at least ten months Adams s pupil We may assume that as his name remained on the books after Jorden left so he was nominally transferred to Adams It is worthy of notice that Thomas Warton in the account that he gives of Johnson s visit to Oxford in seventeen fifty four says He much regretted that his first tutor was dead two hundred thirty nine According to Hawkins Life pp seventeen five hundred eighty two and post Dec nine seventeen eighty four Johnson s father was at one time a bankrupt Johnson in the epitaph that he wrote for him post Dec two seventeen eighty four describes him as bibliopola admodum peritus but rebus adversis

rejected the province of assigning the prize Johnson s Works vi four hundred thirty two two hundred eighty one I suspect that Johnson wrote the Castle Inn Birmingham two hundred eighty two missus Piozzi gives the following account of this little composition from doctor Johnson s own relation to her on her inquiring whether it was rightly attributed to him I think it is now just forty years ago that a young fellow had a sprig of myrtle given him by a girl he courted and asked me to write him some verses that he might present her in return I promised but forgot and when he called for his

aside for five minutes and wrote the nonsense you now keep such a stir about Anec p thirty four In my first edition I was induced to doubt the authenticity of this account by the following circumstantial statement in a letter to me from Miss Seward of Lichfield I know those verses were addressed to Lucy Porter when he was enamoured of her in his boyish days two or three years before he had seen her mother his future wife He wrote them at my grandfather s and gave them to Lucy in the presence of my mother to whom he showed them on the instant She used to repeat them to me when I asked her for the Verses doctor Johnson gave her on a Sprig of Myrtle which he had stolen or begged from her bosom We all know honest Lucy Porter to have been incapable of the mean vanity of applying to herself a compliment not intended for her Such was this lady s statement which I make no doubt she supposed to be correct but it shews how dangerous it is to trust too implicitly to traditional testimony and ingenious inference for mister Hector has lately assured me that missus Piozzi s account is in this instance accurate and that he was the person for whom Johnson wrote those verses which have been erroneously ascribed to mister Hammond I am obliged in so many instances to notice missus Piozzi s incorrectness of relation that I gladly seize this opportunity of acknowledging that however often she is not always inaccurate The author having been drawn into a controversy with Miss Anna Seward in consequence of the preceding statement which may be found in the Gent Mag vol liii and liv received the following letter from mister Edmund Hector on the subject DEAR SIR I am sorry to see you are engaged in altercation with a Lady who seems unwilling to be convinced of her errors Surely it would be more ingenuous to acknowledge than to persevere Lately in looking over some papers I meant to burn I found the original manuscript of the Myrtle with the date on it seventeen thirty one which I have inclosed The true history which I could swear to is as follows mister Morgan Graves the elder brother of a worthy Clergyman near Bath with whom I was acquainted waited upon a lady in this neighbourhood who at parting presented him the branch He shewed it me and wished much to return the compliment in verse I applied to Johnson who was with me and in about half an hour dictated the verses which I sent to my friend I most solemnly declare at that time Johnson was an entire stranger to the Porter family and it was almost two years after that I introduced him to the acquaintance of Porter whom I bought my cloaths of If you intend to convince this obstinate woman and to exhibit to the publick the truth of your narrative you are at liberty to make what use you please of this

of Milton he says This is the period of his life from which all his biographers seem inclined to shrink They are unwilling that Milton should be degraded to a schoolmaster but since it cannot be denied that he taught boys one finds out that he taught for nothing and another that his motive was only zeal for the propagation of learning and virtue and all tell what they do not know to be true only to excuse an act which no wise man will consider as in itself disgraceful His father was alive his allowance was not ample and he supplied its deficiencies by an honest and useful employment Johnson s Works vii seventy five In the Life of Blackmore he says In some part of his life it is not known when his indigence compelled him to teach a school an humiliation with which though it certainly lasted but a little while his enemies did not forget to reproach him when he became conspicuous enough to excite malevolence and let it be remembered for his honour that to have been once a school master is the only reproach which all the perspicacity of malice animated by wit has ever fixed upon his private life Johnson s Works viii thirty six two hundred ninety four In the original To

they really were two young men friends and travellers from the same place and just arrived with a view to settle here he was so moved with their artless tale that on their joint note he advanced them all that their modesty would permit them to ask five pounds which was soon after punctually repaid Perhaps Johnson was thinking of himself when he recorded the advice given by Cibber to Fenton When the tragedy of Mariamne was shewn to Cibber it was rejected by him with the additional insolence of advising Fenton to engage himself in some employment of honest labour by which he might obtain that support which he could never hope from his poetry The play was acted at the other theatre and the brutal petulance of Cibber was confuted though perhaps not shamed by general applause Johnson s Works

constitute the character of urbanity Upon the first approach of a stranger his practice was to continue sitting and for a few minutes to continue silent If at any time he was inclined to begin the discourse it was generally by putting a leaf of the Magazine then in the press into the hand of his visitor and asking his opinion of it He was so incompetent a judge of Johnson s abilities that meaning at one time to dazzle him with the splendour of some of those luminaries in literature who favoured him with their correspondence he told him that if he would in the evening be at a certain alehouse in the neighbourhood of Clerkenwell he might have a chance of seeing mister Browne and another or two of the persons mentioned in the preceding note The note contained the names of some of Cave s regular writers Johnson accepted the invitation and being introduced by Cave dressed in a loose horseman s coat and such a great bushy uncombed wig as he constantly wore to the sight of mister Browne whom he found sitting at the upper end of a long table in a cloud of tobacco smoke had his curiosity gratified mister Carlyle writes of bushy wigged Cave but it was Johnson whose wig is described and not Cave s On p three hundred twenty seven Hawkins again mentions his great bushy wig and says that it was ever nearly as impenetrable by a comb as a quickset hedge Hawkins s Johnson pp

was published in seventeen thirty nine Dodsley was kept in custody for a week Gent Mag ix one hundred four The whole process was supposed to be intended rather to intimidate Pope who in his Seventeen Hundred and Thirty Eight had given offence than to punish Whitehead and it answered that purpose CHALMERS quoted in Parl Hist x thirteen twenty five three hundred sixty two Sir John Hawkins p eighty six tells us The event is antedated in the poem of London but in every particular except the difference of a year what is there said of the departure of Thales must be understood of Savage and looked upon as true history This conjecture is I believe entirely groundless I have been assured that Johnson said he was not so much as acquainted with Savage when he wrote his London If the departure mentioned in it was the departure of Savage the event was not antedated but foreseen for London was published in May seventeen thirty eight and Savage did not set out for Wales till July seventeen thirty nine However well Johnson could defend the credibility of second sight see post Feb seventeen sixty six he did not pretend that he himself was possessed of that faculty BOSWELL I am not sure that Hawkins is altogether wrong in his account Boswell does not state of his own knowledge that Johnson was not acquainted with Savage when he wrote London The death of Queen Caroline in Nov seventeen thirty seven deprived Savage of her yearly bounty and abandoned him again to fortune Johnson s Works viii one hundred sixty six The elegy on her that he composed on her birth day March one brought him no reward He was for some time in suspense but nothing was done He was in a short time reduced to the lowest degree of distress and often wanted both lodging and food Ib p one hundred

hundred seventy After many delays a subscription was at length raised to provide him with a small pension and he left London in July seventeen thirty nine Ib p one hundred seventy three London as I have shewn was written before April six seventeen thirty eight That it was written with great rapidity we might infer from the fact that a hundred lines of The Vanity of Human Wishes were written in a day At this rate London might have been the work of three days That it was written in a very short time seems to be shown by a passage in the first of these letters to Cave Johnson says When I took the liberty of writing to you a few days ago I did not expect a repetition of the same pleasure so soon but having the enclosed poem c It is probable that in these few days the poem was written If we can assume that Savage s elegy was sent to the Court not later than March one it may have been sent earlier and that Johnson s poem was written in the last ten days of March we have three weeks for the intervening events They are certainly not more than sufficient if indeed they are sufficient The coincidence is certainly very striking between Thales s retirement to Cambria s solitary shore and Savage s retirement to Wales There are besides lines in the poem additions to Juvenal and not translations which curiously correspond with what Johnson wrote of Savage in his Life Thus he says that Savage imagined that he should be transported to scenes of flowery felicity he could not bear to lose the opportunity of listening without intermission to the melody of the nightingale which he believed was to be heard from every bramble and which he did not fail to mention as a very important part of the happiness of a country life Ib p one hundred seventy In like manner Thales prays to find Some pleasing bank where verdant osiers play Some peaceful vale with nature s paintings gay There every bush with nature s musick rings There every breeze bears health upon its wings mister Croker objects that if Thales had been Savage Johnson could never have admitted into his poem two lines that point so forcibly at the drunken fray in which Savage stabbed a mister Sinclair for which he was convicted of murder Some frolic drunkard reeling from a feast Provokes a broil and stabs you in a jest But here Johnson is following Juvenal mister Croker forgets that if Savage was convicted of murder he was soon after admitted to bail and pleaded the King s pardon Persons of distinction testified that he was a modest inoffensive man not inclined to broils or to insolence the witnesses against him were of the lowest character and his judge had shewn himself as ignorant as he was brutal Sinclair had been drinking in a brothel and Savage asserted that he had stabbed him by the necessity of self defence Ib p one hundred seventeen It is however not unlikely that Wales was suggested to Johnson as Thales s retreat by Swift s lines on Steele in Miscellanies in Prose and Verse v

however a remarkable man He first directed attention to the abuses of the London jails His relinquishment of all the attractions of English life and fortune for the settlement of the colony of Georgia is as romantic a story at that of Bishop Berkeley Pattison s Pope p one hundred fifty two It is very likely that Johnson s regard for Oglethorpe was greatly increased by the stand that he and his brother trustees in the settlement of Georgia made against slavery see post Sept twenty three seventeen seventy seven The first principle which they laid down in their laws was that no slave should be employed This was regarded at the time as their great and fundamental error it was afterwards repealed Southey s Wesley i seventy five In spite however of Oglethorpe s strong benevolence of soul he at one time treated Charles Wesley who was serving as a missionary in Georgia with great brutality Ib p eighty eight According to Benjamin Franklin Memoirs i one hundred sixty two Georgia was settled with little forethought Instead of being made with hardy industrious husbandmen it was with families of broken shop keepers and other insolvent debtors many of idle habits taken out of the jails who being set down in the woods unqualified for clearing land and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement perished in numbers leaving many helpless children unprovided for Johnson wished to write Oglethorpe s life post April ten seventeen seventy five three hundred sixty seven Horace Walpole Letters viii five hundred forty eight writing of him forty seven years after London was published

Sir Joshua s in company with many painters in the course of conversation Richardson s Treatise on Painting happened to be mentioned Ah said Johnson I remember when I was at college I by chance found that book on my stairs I took it up with me to my chamber and read it through and truly I did not think it possible to say so much upon the art Sir Joshua desired of one of the company to be informed what Johnson had said and it being repeated to him so loud that Johnson heard it the Doctor seemed hurt and added But I did not wish Sir that Sir Joshua should have been told what I then said

politician when he considers men driven into other countries for shelter and obliged to retire to forests and deserts and pass their lives and fix their posterity in the remotest corners of the world to avoid those hardships which they suffer or fear in their native place may very properly enquire why the legislature does not provide a remedy for these miseries rather than encourage an escape from them He may conclude that the flight of every honest man is a loss to the community The poet guides the unhappy fugitive from want and persecution to plenty quiet and security and seats him in scenes

billet written by mister Pope in the following year this school is said to have been in Shropshire but as it appears from a letter from Earl Gower that the trustees of it were some worthy gentlemen in Johnson s neighbourhood I in my first edition suggested that Pope must have by mistake written Shropshire instead of Staffordshire But I have since been obliged to mister Spearing attorney at law for the following information William Adams formerly citizen and haberdasher of London founded a school at Newport in the county of Salop by deed dated twenty seventh November sixteen fifty six by which he granted the yearly sum of sixty pounds to such able and learned schoolmaster from time to time being of godly life and conversation who should have been educated at one of the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge and had taken the degree of Master of Arts and was well read in the Greek and Latin tongues as should be nominated from time to time by the said William Adams during his life and after the decease of the said William Adams by the Governours namely the Master and Wardens of the Haberdashers Company of the City of London and their successors The manour and lands out of which the revenues for the maintenance of the school were to issue are situate at Knighton and Adbaston in the county of Stafford From the foregoing account of this foundation particularly the circumstances of the salary being sixty pounds and the degree of Master of Arts being a requisite qualification in the teacher it seemed probable that this was the school in contemplation and that Lord Gower erroneously supposed that the gentlemen who possessed the lands out of which the revenues issued were trustees of the charity Such was probable conjecture But in the Gent Mag for May seventeen ninety three there is a letter from mister Henn one of the masters of the school of Appleby in Leicestershire in which he writes as follows I compared time and circumstance together in order to discover whether the school in question might not be this of Appleby Some of the trustees at that period were worthy gentlemen of the neighbourhood of Litchfield Appleby itself is not far from the neighbourhood of Litchfield The salary the degree requisite together with the time of election all agreeing with the statutes of Appleby The election as said in the letter could not be delayed longer than the eleventh of next month which was the eleventh of September just three months after the annual audit day of Appleby school which is always on the eleventh of June and the statutes enjoin ne ullius praeceptorum electio diutius tribus mensibus moraretur etc These I thought to be convincing proofs that my conjecture was not ill founded and that in a future edition of that book the circumstance might be recorded as fact But what banishes every shadow of doubt is the Minute book of the school which declares the headmastership to be at that time VACANT I cannot omit returning thanks to this learned gentleman for the very handsome manner in which he has in that letter been so good as to speak of this work BOSWELL three hundred seventy nine What a pity it is Sir said to him

occasion Johnson argues that abridgments are not only legal but also justifiable The design of an abridgment is to benefit mankind by facilitating the attainment of knowledge for as an incorrect book is lawfully criticised and false assertions justly confuted so a tedious volume may no less lawfully be abridged because it is better that the proprietors should suffer some damage than that the acquisition of knowledge should be obstructed with unnecessary difficulties and the valuable hours of thousands thrown away Johnson s Works v four hundred sixty five Whether we have here Johnson s own

one shilling is advertised in the Gent Mag for seventeen thirty nine p two hundred twenty among the books for April four hundred eight Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides third edit p eight BOSWELL four hundred nine According to Sir Joshua Reynolds Every person who knew doctor Johnson must have observed that the moment he was left out of the conversation whether from his deafness or from whatever cause but a few minutes without speaking or listening his mind appeared to be preparing itself He fell into a reverie accompanied with strange antic gestures but this he never did when his mind was engaged by the conversation These were therefore improperly called convulsions which imply involuntary contortions whereas a word addressed to him his attention was recovered Sometimes indeed it would be near a minute before he would give an answer looking as if he laboured to bring his mind to bear on the question Taylor s Reynolds ii four hundred fifty six I still however think wrote Boswell that these gestures were involuntary for surely had not that been the case he would have restrained them in the public streets Boswell s Hebrides under date of Aug eleven seventeen seventy three note doctor T Campbell in his Diary of a Visit to England p thirty three writing of Johnson on March sixteen seventeen seventy five says He has the aspect of an idiot without the faintest ray of sense gleaming from any one feature with the most awkward garb and unpowdered grey wig on one side only of his head he is for ever dancing the devil s jig and sometimes he makes the most driveling effort to whistle some thought in his absent paroxysms Miss Burney thus describes him when she first saw him in seventeen seventy eight Soon after we were seated this great man entered I have so true a veneration for him that the very sight of him inspires me with delight and reverence notwithstanding the cruel infirmities to which he is subject for he has almost perpetual convulsive movements either of his hands lips feet or knees and sometimes of all together Mme D Arblay s Diary i sixty three See post under March thirty seventeen eighty three Boswell s note on Johnson s peculiarities four hundred ten Solitude wrote Reynolds to him was horror nor would he ever trust himself alone but when employed in writing or reading He has often begged me to go home with him to prevent his being alone in the coach Any company was better than none by which he connected himself with many mean persons whose presence he could command Taylor s Reynolds ii four hundred fifty five Johnson writing to missus Thrale said If the world be worth winning let us enjoy it if it is to be despised let us despise it by conviction But the world is not to be despised but as it is compared with something better Company is in itself better than solitude and pleasure better than indolence Piozzi Letters i two hundred forty two In The Idler No thirty two he wrote Others are afraid to be alone and amuse themselves by a perpetual succession of companions but the difference is not great in solitude we have our dreams to ourselves and in company we agree to dream in concert The end sought in both is forgetfulness of ourselves In The Rambler No five he wrote It may be laid down as a position which will seldom deceive that when a man cannot bear his own company there is something wrong He must fly from himself either because he feels a tediousness in life from the equipoise of an empty mind or he must be afraid of the intrusion of some unpleasing ideas and perhaps is struggling to escape from the remembrance of a loss the fear of a calamity or some other thought of greater horror Cowper whose temperament was in some respects not unlike Johnson s wrote A vacant hour is my abhorrence because when I am not occupied I suffer under the whole influence of my unhappy temperament Southey s Cowper vi one hundred forty six four hundred eleven Richardson was of the same way of thinking as Hogarth

the government he abuses than his pestilent harangues so publicly made with impunity furnishes sic all his readers with Rich Corresp ii one hundred ninety seven four hundred twelve Impartial posterity may perhaps be as little inclined as doctor Johnson was to justify the uncommon rigour exercised in the case of doctor Archibald Cameron He was an amiable and truly honest man and his offence was owing to a generous though mistaken principle of duty Being obliged after seventeen forty six to give up his profession as a physician and to go into foreign parts he was honoured with the rank of Colonel both in the French and Spanish service He was a son of the ancient and respectable family of Cameron of Lochiel and his brother who was the Chief of that brave clan distinguished himself by moderation and humanity while the Highland army marched victorious through Scotland It is remarkable of this Chief that though he had earnestly remonstrated against the attempt as hopeless he was of too heroick a spirit not to venture his life and fortune in the cause when personally asked by him whom he thought his prince BOSWELL Sir Walter Scott states in his Introduction to Redgauntlet that the government of George II were in possession of sufficient evidence that doctor Cameron had returned to the Highlands not as he alleged on his trial for family affairs merely but as the secret agent of the Pretender in a new scheme of rebellion the ministers however preferred trying this indefatigable partisan on the ground of his undeniable share in the insurrection of seventeen forty five rather than rescuing themselves and their master from the charge of harshness at the expense of making it universally known that a fresh rebellion had been in agitation so late as seventeen fifty two LOCKHART He was executed on June seven seventeen fifty three Gent Mag xxiii two hundred ninety two Lord Campbell Lives of the Chancellors v one hundred nine says I regard his execution as a wanton atrocity Horace Walpole however inclined to the belief that Cameron was engaged in a new scheme of rebellion Walpole s Memoirs of George II i three hundred thirty three four hundred thirteen Horace Walpole says that towards convicts under sentence of death George II s disposition in general was merciful if the offence was not murder He mentions however a dreadful exception when the King sent to the gallows at Oxford a young man who had been guilty of a most trifling forgery though he had been recommended to mercy by the Judge who had assured him his pardon Mercy was refused merely because the Judge Willes was attached to the Prince of Wales It is very likely that this was one of Johnson s instances as it had happened about four years earlier and as an account of the young man had been published by an Oxonian Walpole s Memoirs of the Reign of George II i one hundred seventy five four hundred fourteen It is strange that when Johnson had been sixteen years in London he should not be known to Hogarth by sight mister Hogarth writes missus Piozzi was used to be very earnest that I should obtain the acquaintance and if possible the friendship of doctor Johnson whose conversation was to the talk of other men like Titian s painting compared to Hudson s he said Of doctor Johnson when my father and he were talking together about him one day That man says Hogarth is not contented with believing the Bible but he fairly resolves I think to believe nothing but the Bible Piozzi s Anec p one hundred thirty six four hundred fifteen On October twenty nine of this year James Boswell was

hint this occasions great speculation They seem to have been ignorant of such engaging introductions as we hear it is strongly reported and of that ingenious but thread bare excuse for a downright lie it wants confirmation four hundred seventeen The Lives of Blake and Drake were certainly written with a political aim The war with Spain was going on and the Tory party was doing its utmost to rouse the country against the Spaniards It was a time according to Johnson when the nation was engaged in a war with an enemy whose insults ravages and barbarities have long called for vengeance Johnson s Works vi two hundred ninety three four hundred eighteen Barretier s childhood surpassed even that of J S Mill At the age of nine he was master of five languages Greek and Hebrew being two of them In

year the University of Halle offered him the degree of doctor in philosophy His theses or philosophical positions which he printed ran through several editions in a few weeks He was a deep student of mathematics and astronomy was his favourite subject His health broke down under his studies and he died in seventeen forty in the twentieth year of his age Johnson s Works vi three hundred seventy six

Amphion move To beauteous order and harmonious love Rest here in peace till Angels bid thee rise And meet thy Saviour s consort in the skies BLAKEWAY Consort is defined in Johnson s Dictionary as a number of instruments playing together four hundred twenty three I have no doubt that it was written in seventeen forty one for the second line is clearly a parody of a line in the chorus of Cibber s

a friend to taste his wine he found the vessel almost empty c four hundred twenty seven mister Carlyle by the use of the term Imaginary Editors Cromwell s Letters and Speeches iii two hundred twenty nine seems to imply that he does not hold with Boswell in assigning this piece to Johnson I am inclined to think nevertheless that Boswell is right If it is Johnson s it is doubly interesting as showing the method which he often followed in writing the Parliamentary Debates When notes were given him while for the most part he kept to the speaker s train of thoughts he dealt with the language much as it pleased him In the Gent Mag Cromwell speaks as if he were wearing a flowing wig and were addressing a Parliament of the days of George II He is thus made to conclude Speech xi For my part

Goldsmith in his Life of Nash Cunningham s Goldsmith s Works iv fifty four says Nash was not born a writer for whatever humour he might have in conversation he used to call a pen his torpedo whenever

the most quick sighted men I ever knew in discovering the good and amiable qualities of others Hawkins s Johnson p fifty He was says Boswell post April thirteen seventeen seventy eight willing to take men as they are imperfect and with a mixture of good and bad qualities How intimate the two men were is shown by the following passage in Johnson s Life of Savage Savage left London in July seventeen thirty nine having taken leave with great tenderness of his friends and parted from the author of this narrative with tears in his eyes Johnson s Works viii one hundred seventy three four hundred

The original was in the hands of the late Francis Cockayne Cust esquire one of His Majesty s Counsel learned in the law Right Honourable BRUTE and BOOBY I find you want as mister is pleased to hint to

one hundred seventy four hundred seventy Savage took all opportunities of conversing familiarly with those who were most conspicuous at that time for their power or their influence he watched their looser moments and examined their domestic behaviour with that acuteness which nature had given him and which the uncommon variety of his life had contributed to increase and that inquisitiveness which must always be produced in a vigorous mind by an absolute freedom from all pressing or domestic engagements Johnson s Works viii one hundred thirty five four hundred seventy one Thus he spent his time in mean expedients and tormenting suspense living for the greatest part in the fear of prosecutions from his creditors and consequently skulking in obscure parts of the town of which he was no stranger to the remotest corners Ib p one hundred sixty five four hundred seventy two Sir John Hawkins gives the world to understand that Johnson being an admirer of genteel manners was captivated by the address and demeanour of Savage who as to his exterior was to a remarkable degree accomplished Hawkins s Life p fifty two But Sir John s notions of gentility must appear somewhat ludicrous from his stating the following circumstance as presumptive evidence that Savage was a good swordsman That he understood the exercise of a gentleman s weapon may be inferred from the use made of it in that rash encounter which is related in his life The dexterity here alluded to was that Savage in a nocturnal fit of drunkenness stabbed a man at a coffee house and killed him for which he was tried at the Old Bailey and found guilty of murder Johnson indeed describes him as having a grave and manly deportment a solemn dignity of mien but which upon a nearer acquaintance softened into an engaging easiness of manners Johnson s Works viii one hundred eighty seven How highly Johnson admired him for that knowledge which he himself so much cultivated and what kindness he entertained for him appears from the following lines in the Gentleman s Magazine for April seventeen thirty eight which I am assured were written by Johnson Ad RICARDUM SAVAGE Humani studium generis cui pectore fervet O colat humanum te foveatque genus BOSWELL The epigram is inscribed Ad Ricardum Savage Arm Humani Generis Amatorem Gent Mag viii two hundred ten four hundred seventy three The following striking proof of Johnson s extreme indigence when he published the Life of Savage was communicated to the author by mister Richard Stow of Apsley in Bedfordshire from the information of mister Walter Harte author of the Life of Gustavus Adolphus Soon after Savage s Life was published mister Harte dined with Edward Cave and occasionally praised it Soon after meeting him Cave said You made a man very happy t other day How could that be says Harte nobody was there but ourselves Cave answered by reminding him that a plate of victuals was sent behind a screen which was to Johnson dressed so shabbily that he did not choose to appear but on hearing the conversation was highly delighted with the encomiums on his book MALONE He desired much to be alone yet he always loved good talk and often would get behind the

plate which dear Tetty sold in our distress Account of Johnson s Early Life p eighteen Yet it is not easy to understand how if there was a lodging for her there was not one for him She might have been living with friends We have a statement by Hawkins p eighty nine that there was a temporary separation of Johnson from his wife He adds that while he was in a lodging in Fleet Street she was harboured by a friend near the Tower This separation he insinuates rose by an estrangement caused by Johnson s indifference in the discharge of the domestic virtues It is far more likely that it rose from destitution Shenstone in a letter written in seventeen forty three gives a curious account of the streets of London through which Johnson wandered He says London is really dangerous at this time the pickpockets formerly content with mere filching make no scruple to knock people down with bludgeons in Fleet Street and the Strand and that at no later hour than eight o clock at night but in the Piazzas Covent Garden they come in large bodies armed with couteaus and attack whole parties so that the danger of coming out of the play houses is of some weight in the opposite scale when I am disposed to go to them oftener than I ought Shenstone s Works edit iii seventy three four hundred seventy five Savage lodged as much by accident as he dined and passed the night sometimes in mean houses and sometimes when he had not money to support even the expenses of these receptacles walked about the streets till he was weary and lay down in the summer upon a bulk or in the winter with his associates in poverty among the ashes of a glass house In this manner were passed those days and those nights which nature had enabled him to have employed in elevated speculations useful studies or

first edition P CUNNINGHAM Between Savage s character as drawn by Johnson and Johnson himself there are many points of likeness Each always preserved a steady confidence in his own capacity and of each it might be said Whatever faults may be imputed to him the virtue of suffering well cannot be denied him Each excelled in the arts of conversation and therefore willingly practised them In Savage s refusal to enter a house till some clothes had been taken away that had been left for him with some neglect of ceremonies we have the counterpart of Johnson s throwing away the new pair of shoes that had been set at his door Of Johnson the following lines are as true as of Savage His distresses however afflictive never dejected him in his lowest state he wanted not spirit to assert the natural dignity of wit and was always ready to repress that insolence which the superiority of fortune incited he never admitted any gross familiarities or submitted to be treated otherwise than as an equal Of both men it might be said that it was in no time of his life any part of his character to be the first of the company that desired to separate Each would prolong his conversation till midnight without considering that business might require his friend s application in the morning and each could plead the same excuse that when he left his company he was abandoned to gloomy reflections Each had the same accurate judgment the same quick apprehension the same tenacious memory In reading such lines as the following who does not think not of the man whose biography was written but of the biographer himself He had the peculiar felicity that his attention never deserted him he was present to every object and regardful of the most trifling occurrences To this quality is to be imputed the extent of his knowledge compared with the small time which he spent in visible endeavours to acquire it He mingled in cursory conversation with the same steadiness of attention as others apply to a lecture His judgment was eminently exact both with regard to writings and to men The knowledge of life was indeed his chief attainment Of Johnson s London as of Savage s The Wanderer it might equally well be said Nor can it without some degree of indignation and concern be told that he sold the copy for ten guineas four hundred eighty five Savage was now again abandoned to fortune without any other friend than mister Wilks a man who whatever were his abilities or skill as an actor deserves at least to be remembered for his virtues which are not often to be found in the world and perhaps less often in his profession than in others To be humane generous and candid is a very high degree of merit in any case but those qualities deserve still greater praise when they are found in that condition which makes almost every other man for whatever reason contemptuous insolent petulant selfish and brutal Johnson s Works viii one hundred seven four hundred eighty six In his old age he wrote as he had written in the vigour of his manhood To the censure of Collier he Dryden makes little reply being at the age of sixty eight attentive to better things than the claps of a play house Johnson s Works vii two hundred ninety five See post April twenty nine seventeen seventy three and Sept twenty one seventeen seventy seven four hundred eighty seven Johnson writing of the latter half of the seventeenth century says The playhouse was abhorred by the Puritans and avoided by those who desired the character of seriousness or decency A grave lawyer would have debased his dignity and a young trader would have impaired his credit by appearing in those mansions of dissolute licentiousness Johnson s Works vii two hundred seventy The following lines in Churchill s Apology Poems i sixty five published in seventeen sixty one shew how strong even at that time was the feeling against strolling players The strolling tribe a despicable race Like wand ring Arabs shift from place to place Vagrants by law to Justice open laid They tremble of the beadle s lash afraid And fawning cringe for wretched means of life To Madam May ress or his Worship s Wife four hundred eighty eight Johnson himself recognises the change in the public estimation In Dryden s time he writes the drama was very far from that universal approbation which it has now obtained Works vii two hundred seventy four

and not as both concur to form the negative injunction and false witness like the other acts prohibited in the Decalogue should not be marked by any peculiar emphasis but only be distinctly enunciated BOSWELL four hundred ninety two This character of the Life of Savage was not written by Fielding as has been supposed but most probably by Ralph who as appears from the minutes of the partners of The Champion in the possession of mister Reed of Staple Inn succeeded Fielding in his share of the paper before the date of that eulogium BOSWELL Ralph is mentioned in The Dunciad iii one hundred sixty five A curious account of him is given in Benjamin Franklin s Memoirs i fifty four eighty seven and two hundred forty five four hundred ninety three The late Francis Cockayne Cust esquire one of his Majesty s Counsel BOSWELL four hundred ninety four Savage s veracity was questioned but with little reason his accounts though not indeed always the same were generally consistent When he loved any man he suppressed all his faults and when he had been offended by him concealed all his virtues but his characters were generally true so far as he proceeded though it cannot be denied that his partiality might have sometimes the effect of falsehood Johnson s Works viii one hundred ninety four hundred ninety five sixteen ninety seven BOSWELL four hundred ninety six Johnson s Works viii ninety eight four hundred ninety seven The story on which mister Cust so much relies that Savage was a supposititious child not the son of Lord Rivers and Lady Macclesfield but the offspring of a shoemaker introduced in consequence of her real son s death was without doubt grounded on the circumstance of Lady Macclesfield having in sixteen ninety six previously to the birth of Savage had a daughter by the Earl Rivers who died in her infancy a fact which was proved in the course of the proceedings on Lord Macclesfield s Bill of Divorce Most fictions of this kind have some admixture of truth in them MALONE From The Earl of Macclesfield s Case it appears that Anne Countess of Macclesfield under the name of Madam Smith in Fox Court near Brook Street Holborn was delivered of a male child on the sixteenth of January sixteen ninety six seven who was baptized on the Monday following the eighteenth and registered by the name of Richard the son of John Smith by mister Burbridge and from the privacy was supposed by mister Burbridge to be a by blow or bastard It also appears that during her delivery the lady wore a mask and that Mary Pegler on the next day after the baptism took a male child whose mother was called Madam Smith from the house of missus Pheasant in Fox Court running from Brook Street in Gray s Inn Lane who went by the name of missus Lee Conformable to this statement is the entry in the register of saint Andrew s Holborn which is as follows and which unquestionably records the baptism of Richard Savage to whom Lord Rivers gave his own Christian name prefixed to the assumed surname of his mother Jan sixteen ninety six seven Richard son of John Smith and Mary in Fox Court in Gray s Inn Lane baptized the eighteenth BINDLEY According to Johnson s account Savage did not learn who his parents were till the death of his nurse who had always treated him as her son Among her papers he found some letters written by Lady Macclesfield s mother proving his origin Johnson s Works viii one hundred two Why these letters were not laid before the public is not stated Johnson was one of the least credulous of men and he was convinced by Savage s story Horace Walpole too does not seem to have doubted it Walpole s Letters i cv four hundred ninety eight Johnson s Works viii ninety seven four hundred ninety nine Ib p one hundred forty two five hundred Johnson s Works p one hundred one five hundred one According to Johnson s account Johnson s Works viii one hundred two the shoemaker under whom Savage was placed on trial as an apprentice was not the husband of his nurse five hundred two He was in his tenth year when she died He had none to prosecute his claim to shelter him from oppression or call in law to the assistance of justice Ib p ninety nine five hundred three Johnson s companion appears to have persuaded that lofty minded man that he resembled him in having a noble pride for Johnson after painting in strong colours the quarrel between Lord Tyrconnel and Savage asserts that the spirit of mister Savage indeed never suffered him to solicit a reconciliation he returned reproach for reproach and insult for insult Ib p one hundred forty one But the respectable gentleman to whom I have alluded has in his possession a letter from Savage after Lord Tyrconnel had discarded him addressed to the Reverend mister Gilbert his Lordship s Chaplain in which he requests him in the humblest manner to represent his case to the Viscount BOSWELL five hundred four How loved how honoured once avails thee not To whom related or by whom begot POPE S Elegy to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady five hundred five Trusting to Savage s information Johnson represents this unhappy man s being received as a companion by Lord Tyrconnel and pensioned by his Lordship as if posteriour to Savage s conviction and pardon But I am assured that Savage had received the voluntary bounty of Lord Tyrconnel and had been dismissed by him long before the murder was committed and that his Lordship was very instrumental in procuring Savage s pardon by his intercession with the Queen through Lady Hertford If therefore he had been desirous of preventing the publication by Savage he would have left him to his fate Indeed I must observe that although Johnson mentions that Lord Tyrconnel s patronage of Savage was upon his promise to lay aside his design of exposing the cruelty of his mother Johnson s Works viii one hundred twenty four the great biographer has forgotten that he himself has mentioned that Savage s story had been told several years before in The Plain Dealer from which he quotes this strong saying of the generous Sir Richard Steele that the inhumanity of his mother had given him a right to find every good man his father Ib p one hundred four At the same time it must be acknowledged that Lady Macclesfield and her relations might still wish that her story should not be brought into more conspicuous notice by the satirical pen of Savage BOSWELL five hundred six According to Johnson she was at Bath when Savage s poem of The Bastard was published She could not he wrote enter the assembly rooms or cross the walks without being saluted with some lines from The Bastard This was perhaps the first time that she ever discovered a sense of shame and on this occasion the power of wit was very conspicuous the wretch who had without scruple proclaimed herself an adulteress and who had first endeavoured to starve her son then to transport him and afterwards to hang him was not able to bear the representation of her own conduct but fled from reproach though she felt no pain from guilt and left Bath with the utmost haste to shelter herself among the crowds of London Johnson s Works viii one hundred forty one five hundred seven Miss Mason after having forfeited the title of Lady Macclesfield by divorce was married to Colonel Brett and it is said was well known in all the polite circles Colley Cibber I am informed had so high an opinion of her taste and judgement as to genteel life and manners that he submitted every scene of his Careless Husband to missus Brett s revisal and correction Colonel Brett was reported to be too free in his gallantry with his Lady s maid missus Brett came into a room one day in her own house and found the Colonel and her maid both fast asleep in two chairs She tied a white handkerchief round her husband s neck which was a sufficient proof that she had discovered his intrigue but she never at any time took notice of it to him This incident as I am told gave occasion to the well wrought scene of Sir Charles and Lady Easy and Edging BOSWELL Lady Macclesfield died seventeen fifty three aged above eighty Her eldest daughter by colonel Brett was for the few

Walmesley s letter does not shew that Johnson was idle The old man had expected great things from him I have great hopes he had written in seventeen thirty seven see ante p one hundred two that he will turn out a fine tragedy writer In the nine years in which Johnson had been in town he had done no doubt much admirable work but by his poem of London only was he known to the public His Life of Savage did not bear his name His Observations on Macbeth were published in April seventeen forty five his Plan of the Dictionary in seventeen forty seven Transcriber s note Originally seventeen seventy four corrected in Errata What was Johnson doing meanwhile Boswell conjectures that he was engaged on his Shakespeare and his Dictionary That he went on working at his Shakespeare when the prospect of publishing was so remote that he could not issue his proposals is very unlikely That he had been for some time engaged on his Dictionary before he addressed Lord Chesterfield is shewn by the opening sentences of the Plan mister Croker s conjecture that he was absent or concealed on account of some difficulties which had arisen through the rebellion of seventeen forty five is absurd At no time of his life had he been an ardent Jacobite I have heard him declare writes Boswell that if holding up his right hand would have secured victory at Culloden to Prince Charles s army he was not sure he would have held it up post July fourteen seventeen sixty three He had never in his life been in a nonjuring meeting house post June nine seventeen eighty four For the fact that he wrote very little if indeed anything in the Gent Mag during these years more than one reason may be given In the first place public affairs take up an unusual amount of room in its columns Thus in the number for Dec seventeen forty five we read Our readers being too much alarmed by the present rebellion to relish with their usual delight the Debates in the Senate of Lilliput we shall postpone them for a season that we may be able to furnish out a fuller entertainment of what we find to be more suitable to their present taste In the Preface it is stated We have sold more of our books than we desire for several months past and are heartily sorry for the occasion of it the present troubles During these years then much less space was given to literature But besides this Johnson likely enough refused to write for the Magazine when it shewed itself strongly Hanoverian He would highly disapprove of A New Protestant Litany which was written after the following fashion May Spaniards or French all who join with a Highland In disturbing the peace of this our bless d island Meet tempests on sea and halters on dry land We beseech Thee to hear us good Lord Gent Mag xv five hundred fifty one He

p thirty six It is remarkable that there is no mention of Johnson s Plan of a Dictionary in the Magazine Perhaps some coolness had risen between him and Cave five hundred thirteen Boswell proceeds to mention six five hundred fourteen In missus Williams s Miscellanies in which this paraphrase is inserted it is stated that the Latin epitaph was written by doctor Freind I do not think that the English version is by Johnson I should be sorry to ascribe to him such lines as Illustrious age how bright thy glories shone When Hanmer filled the chair and Anne the throne five hundred fifteen In the Observations Johnson writing of Hanmer says Surely the weapons of criticism ought not to be blunted against an editor who can imagine that he is restoring poetry while he is amusing himself with alterations like these For This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought This is the sergeant who Like a right good and hardy soldier fought Such harmless industry may surely be forgiven if it cannot be praised may he therefore never want a monosyllable who can use it with such wonderful dexterity Johnson s Works v ninety three In his Preface to Shakespeare published eighteen years later he describes Hanmer as A man in my opinion eminently qualified by nature for such studies Ib p one hundred thirty nine The editors of the Cambridge Shakespeare i xxxii thus write of Hanmer A country gentleman of great ingenuity and lively fancy but with no knowledge of older literature no taste for research and no ear for the rhythm of earlier English verse amused his leisure hours by scribbling down his own and his friend s guesses in Pope s Shakespeare five hundred sixteen In the Universal Visiter to which Johnson contributed the mark which is affixed to some pieces unquestionably his is also found subjoined to others of which he certainly was not the author The mark therefore will not ascertain the poems in question to have been written by him They were probably the productions of Hawkesworth who it is believed was afflicted with the gout MALONE It is most unlikely that Johnson wrote such poor poems as these I shall not easily be persuaded that the following

task as he himself expressly described to me by devoting his first care to a diligent perusal of all such English writers as were most correct in their language and under every sentence which he meant to quote he drew a line and noted in the margin the first letter of the word under which it was to occur He then delivered these books to his clerks who transcribed each sentence on a separate slip of paper and arranged the same under the word referred to By these means he collected the several words and their different significations and when the whole arrangement was alphabetically formed he gave the definitions of their meanings and collected their etymologies from Skinner Junius and other writers on the subject PERCY five hundred fifty four The books he used for this purpose were what he had in his own collection a copious but a miserably ragged one and all such as he could borrow which latter if ever they came back to those that lent them were so defaced as to be scarce worth owning and

of spreading the contagion in society I wish not to conceal or excuse the depravity Such degradation of the dignity of genius such abuse of superlative abilities cannot be contemplated but with grief and indignation What consolation can be had Dryden has afforded by living to repent and to testify his repentance Johnson s Works vii two hundred ninety three He quotes Congreve and of Congreve he says It is acknowledged with universal conviction that the perusal of his works will make no man better and that their ultimate effect is to represent pleasure in alliance with vice and to relax those

Head a famous beef steak house in Ivy Lane near saint Paul s every Tuesday evening Thither he constantly resorted with a disposition to please and be pleased Our conversations seldom began till after a supper so very solid and substantial as led us to think that with him it was a dinner By the help of this refection and no other incentive to hilarity than lemonade Johnson was in a short time after

in dialogue than a drama rather a succession of just sentiments in elegant language than a representation of natural affections or any state probable or possible in human life The events are expected without solicitude and are remembered without joy or sorrow Its success has introduced or confirmed among us the use of dialogue too declamatory of unaffecting elegance and chill philosophy Works vii

wise and learned and good people too Many are the disputes it has cost me and not once did I come off triumphant missus Carter replied Many a battle have I too fought for him in the country out with

Hardcastle s drive in She Stoops to Conquer was suggested by the Rambler No thirty four In it a young gentleman describes a lady s terror on a coach journey Our whole conversation passed in dangers and cares and fears and consolations and stories of ladies dragged in the mire forced to spend all the night on a heath drowned in rivers or burnt with lightning We had now a new scene of terror every man we saw was a robber and we were ordered sometimes to drive hard lest a traveller whom we saw behind should overtake us and sometimes to stop lest we should come up to him who was passing before us She alarmed many an honest man by begging him to spare her life as he passed by the coach six hundred thirty nine doctor Johnson was gratified by seeing this selection and wrote to mister Kearsley bookseller in Fleet Street the following note mister Johnson sends compliments to mister Kearsley and begs the favour of seeing him as soon as he can mister Kearsley is desired to bring with him the last edition of what he has honoured with the name of BEAUTIES May twenty seventeen eighty two BOSWELL The correspondence post May fifteen seventeen eighty two shews that Johnson sent for this book not because he was gratified but because he was accused on the strength of one of the Beauties of recommending suicide On that day being in the country he wrote I never saw the book but by casual inspection and considered myself as utterly disengaged from its consequences He adds I hope some time in the next week to have all rectified The letter of May twenty shews that on his return to town he lost little time if any in sending for Kearsley six hundred forty See post April twelve seventeen eighty one six hundred forty one Ecclesiastes vii four six hundred forty two In the original

that somebody had written a book against the squire and the whole parish The book was The Whole Duty of Man six hundred forty four The character of Prospero was beyond all question occasioned by Garrick s ostentatious display of furniture and Dresden china Murphy s Johnson p one hundred forty four If Garrick was aimed at it is surprising that the severity of the satire did not bring to an end not only all friendship but even any acquaintance between the two men The writer describes how he and Prospero had set out in the world together and how for a long time they had assisted each other till his friend had been lately raised to wealth by a lucky project I felt at his sudden shoot of success an honest and disinterested joy Prospero reproached him with his neglect to visit him at his new house When however he went to see him he found that his friend s impatience arose not from any desire to communicate his happiness but to enjoy his superiority He was kept waiting at the door and when at length he was shewn up stairs he found the staircase carefully secured by mats from the pollution of his feet Prospero led him into a backroom where he told him he always breakfasted when he had not great company After the visitor had endured one act of insolence after another he says I left him without any intention of seeing him again unless some misfortune should restore his understanding Rambler No two hundred See post May fifteen seventeen seventy six where Johnson speaking of the charge of meanness brought against Garrick said he might have been much better attacked for living with more splendour than is suitable to a player six hundred forty five In C C Greville s Journal ii three hundred sixteen we have an instance how stories about Johnson grew He writes Lord Holland told some stories of Johnson and Garrick which he had heard from Kemble When Garrick was in the zenith of his popularity and grown rich and lived with the great and while Johnson was yet obscure the Doctor used to drink tea with him and he would say Davy I do not envy you your money nor your fine acquaintance but I envy you your power of drinking such tea as this Yes said Garrick it is very good tea but it is not my best nor that which I give to my Lord this and Sir somebody t other There can be little doubt that the whole story is founded on the following passage in the character of Prospero Breakfast was at last set and as I was not willing to indulge the peevishness that began to seize me I commended the tea Prospero then told me that another time I should taste his finest sort but that he had only a very small quantity remaining and reserved it for those whom he thought himself obliged to treat with particular respect See post April ten seventeen seventy

pleasant humour for the ingenious Bonnell Thornton published a mock Rambler in the Drury lane Journal BOSWELL Murphy Life p one hundred fifty seven criticising the above quotation from Johnson says He forgot the observation of Dryden If too many foreign words are poured in upon us it looks as if they were designed not to assist the natives but to conquer them six hundred forty eight Idler No seventy BOSWELL In the same number Johnson writes Few faults of style whether real or imaginary excite the malignity of a more numerous class of readers than the use of hard words But words are hard only to those who do not understand them and the critic ought always to inquire whether he is incommoded by the fault of the writer or by his own Every author does not write for every reader See post Sept nineteen seventeen seventy seven where Johnson says If Robertson s style be faulty he owes it to me that is having too many words and those too big ones six hundred forty nine The following passages in Temple s writings shew that a likeness may be discovered between his style and Johnson s There may be firmness and constancy of courage from tradition as well as of belief nor methinks should any man know how to be a coward that is brought up with the opinion that all of his nation or city have ever been valiant Temple s Works i one hundred sixty seven This is a disease too refined for this country and people who are well when they are not ill and pleased when they are not troubled are content because they think little of it and seek their happiness in the common eases and

paucis notus qui vitam inter lucem et umbram nec eruditus nec idioticis literis deditus transegit In the Gent Mag for seventeen forty p two hundred sixty two the last line is given no doubt correctly as Nec eruditus nec idiota literis deditus The second edition of Chambers s Cyclopaedia was published in seventeen thirty eight There is no copy of his Proposal in the British Museum or Bodleian The resemblance between his style and Johnson s is not great The following passage is the most Johnsonian that I could find None of my predecessors can blame me for the use I have made of them since it is their own avowed practice It is a kind of privilege attached to the office of lexicographer if not by any formal grant yet by connivance at least I have already assumed the bee for my device and who ever brought an action of trover or trespass against that avowed free booter Tis vain to pretend anything of property in things of this nature To offer our thoughts to the public and yet pretend a right reserved therein to oneself if it be not absurd yet it is sordid The words we speak nay the breath we emit is not more vague and common than our thoughts when divulged in print Chambers s

peregrinity and depeditation six hundred fifty seven The words which our authors have introduced by their knowledge of foreign languages or ignorance of their own by vanity or wantonness by compliance with fashion or lust of innovation I have registered as they occurred though commonly only to censure them and warn others against the folly of naturalizing useless foreigners to the injury of the natives Our language for almost a century has by the concurrence of many causes been gradually departing from its original Teutonick character and deviating towards a Gallick structure and phraseology from which it ought to be our endeavour to recall it by making our ancient volumes the groundwork of style From the authors which rose in the time of Elizabeth a speech might be formed adequate to all the purposes of use and elegance Johnson s Works v pp thirty one thirty nine See post May twelve seventeen seventy eight six hundred fifty eight If Johnson sometimes indulged his Brownism see post beginning of seventeen fifty six yet he saw much to censure in Browne s style His style is indeed a tissue of many languages a mixture of heterogeneous words brought together from distant regions with terms originally appropriated to one art and drawn by violence into the service of another He must however be confessed to have augmented our philosophical diction His innovations are sometimes pleasing and his temerities happy Johnson s Works vi five hundred It is remarkable that the pomp of diction which has been objected to Johnson was first assumed in the Rambler His Dictionary was going on at the same time and in the course of that work as he grew familiar with technical and scholastic words he thought that the bulk of his readers were equally learned or at least would admire the splendour and dignity of the style Murphy s Johnson p one hundred fifty six The observation of his having imitated Sir Thomas Brown has been made by many people and lately it has been insisted on and illustrated by a variety of quotations from Brown in one of the popular Essays written by the Reverend mister Knox the Essay is No xxii of Winter Evenings Knox s Works ii three hundred ninety seven master of Tumbridge school whom I have set down in my list post under Dec six seventeen eighty four of those who have sometimes not unsuccessfully imitated doctor Johnson s style BOSWELL six hundred fifty nine The following observation in mister Boswell s Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides p nine may sufficiently account for that Gentleman s being now scarcely esteem d a Scot by many of his countrymen If he doctor Johnson was particularly prejudiced against the Scots it was because they were more in his way because he thought their success in England rather exceeded the due proportion of their real merit and because he could not but see in them that nationality which I believe no liberal minded Scotchman will deny mister Boswell indeed is so free from national prejudices that he might with equal propriety have been described as Scarce by South Britons now esteem d a Scot COURTENAY BOSWELL six hundred sixty Malone says that Baretti used sometimes to walk with Johnson through the streets at night and occasionally entered into conversation with the unfortunate women who frequent them for the sake of hearing their stories It was from a history of one of these which a girl told under a tree in the King s Bench Walk in the Temple to Baretti and Johnson that he formed the story of Misella in the Rambler Nos one hundred seventy and one hundred seventy one Prior s Malone p one

sixty three When Johnson shewed me a proof sheet of the character of Addison in which he so highly extols his style I could not help observing that it had not been his own model as no two styles could differ more from each other Sir Addison had his style and I have mine When I ventured to ask him whether the difference did not consist in this that Addison s style was full of idioms colloquial phrases and proverbs and his own more strictly grammatical and free from such phraseology and modes of speech as can never be literally translated or understood by foreigners he allowed the discrimination to be just Let any one who doubts it try to translate one of Addison s Spectators into Latin French or Italian and though so easy familiar and elegant to an Englishman as to give the intellect no trouble yet he would find the transfusion into another language extremely difficult if not impossible But a Rambler Adventurer or Idler of Johnson would fall into any classical or European language as easily as if it had been originally conceived in it BURNEY missus Piozzi Anec p one hundred twenty five recounts how Johnson recommended Addison s works as a model for imitation to mister Woodhouse a poetical shoemaker Give nights and days Sir said he to the study of Addison if you mean either to be a good writer or what is more worth an honest man When I saw something like the same expression in his criticism on that author I put him in mind of his past injunctions to the young poet to which he replied That he wished the shoemaker might have remembered them as well Yet he says in his Life of Pope Works viii two hundred eighty four He that has once studiously formed a style rarely writes afterwards with complete ease six hundred sixty four I shall probably in another work maintain the merit of Addison s poetry which has been very unjustly depreciated BOSWELL He proposed also to publish an edition of Johnson s poems ante p sixteen an account of his own travels post

absurd enough to suspect that Johnson was a partaker in Lauder s fraud or had any knowledge of it when he assisted him with his masterly pen it is proper here to quote the words of doctor Douglas now Bishop of Salisbury at the time when he detected the imposition It is to be hoped nay it is expected that the elegant and nervous writer whose judicious sentiments and inimitable style point out the authour of Lauder s Preface and Postscript will no longer allow one to plume himself with his feathers who appeareth so little to deserve his assistance an assistance which I am persuaded would never have been communicated had there been the least suspicion of those facts which I have been the instrument of conveying to the world in these sheets Milton no Plagiary second edit p seventy eight And his Lordship has been pleased now to authorise me to say in the strongest manner that there is no ground whatever for any unfavourable reflection against doctor Johnson who expressed the strongest indignation against Lauder BOSWELL To this letter Lauder had the impudence to add a shameless postscript and some testimonies concerning himself Though on the face of it it is evident that this postscript is not by Johnson yet it is included in his works v two hundred eighty three The letter was dated Dec twenty seventeen fifty In the Gent Mag for the next month xxi forty seven there is the following paragraph mister Lauder confesses here and exhibits all his forgeries for which he assigns one motive in the book and after asking pardon assigns another in the postscript he also takes an opportunity to publish several letters and testimonials to his former character Goldsmith in Retaliation has a hit at Lauder Here Douglas retires from his toils to relax The scourge of impostors the

After quoting doctor Newton s account of the distress to which Milton s grand daughter had been reduced he says That this relation is true cannot be questioned but surely the honour of letters the dignity of sacred poetry the spirit of the English nation and the glory of human nature require that it should be true no longer In an age which amidst all its vices and all its follies has not become

no other asylum nor could all their peevishness and ingratitude weary out his benevolence Essays i three hundred ninety In his Biography of Johnson p three hundred eighty eight he says that missus Williams s chief recommendations were her blindness and her poverty No doubt in Johnson s letters to missus Thrale are found amusing accounts of the discord of the inmates of his house But it is abundantly clear that in missus Williams s company he had for years found pleasure A few months after her death he wrote to missus Thrale You have more than once wondered at my complaint of solitude

of life is obliged to borrow its happiness from the time to come In youth we have nothing past to entertain us and in age we derive little from retrospect but hopeless sorrow Yet the future likewise has its limits which the imagination dreads to approach but which we see to be not far distant The loss of our friends and companions impresses hourly upon us the necessity of our own departure we know that the schemes of man are quickly at an end that we must soon lie down in the grave with the forgotten multitudes of former ages and yield our place to others who like us shall be driven a

Barber was born in Jamaica and was brought to England in seventeen fifty by Colonel Bathurst father of Johnson s very intimate friend doctor Bathurst He was sent for some time to the Reverend mister Jackson s school at Barton in Yorkshire The Colonel by his will left him his freedom and doctor Bathurst was willing that he should enter into Johnson s service in which he continued from seventeen fifty two till Johnson s death with the exception of two intervals in one of which upon some difference with his master he went and served an apothecary in Cheapside but still visited doctor Johnson occasionally in another he took a fancy to go to sea Part of the time indeed he was by the kindness of his master at a school in Northamptonshire that he might have the advantage of some learning So

absolute want can force me to continue where I am Jamaica he calls this execrable region Hawkins Life p two hundred thirty five says that Bathurst before leaving England confessed to Johnson that in the course of ten years exercise of his faculty he had never opened his hand to more than one guinea Johnson perhaps had Bathurst in mind when many years later he wrote A physician in a great city seems to be the mere plaything of fortune his degree of reputation is for the most part totally casual they that employ him know not his excellence they that reject him know not his deficience By any

eighty five seven hundred nineteen Lord Southwell said Johnson was the most qualitied man I ever saw Post March twenty three seventeen eighty three seven hundred twenty The account given of Levet in Gent Mag lv one hundred one shews that he was a man out of the common run He would not otherwise have attracted the notice of the French surgeons The writer says mister Levet though an Englishman by birth became early in life a waiter at a coffee house in Paris The surgeons who frequented it finding him of an inquisitive turn and attentive to their conversation made a purse for him and gave him some instructions in their art They afterwards furnished him with the means of further knowledge by procuring him free admission to such lectures in pharmacy and anatomy as were read by the ablest professors of that period When he lived with Johnson much of the day was employed in attendance on his patients who were chiefly of the lowest rank of tradesmen The remainder of his hours he dedicated to Hunter s lectures and to as many different opportunities of improvement as he could meet with on the same gratuitous conditions All his medical knowledge said Johnson and it is not inconsiderable was obtained through the ear Though he buys books he seldom looks into them or discovers any power by which he can be supposed to judge of an author s merit doctor Johnson has frequently observed that Levet was indebted to him for nothing more than house room his share in a penny loaf at breakfast and now and then a dinner on a Sunday His character was rendered valuable by repeated proof of honesty tenderness and gratitude to his benefactor as well as by an unwearied diligence in his profession His single failing was an occasional departure from sobriety Johnson would observe he was perhaps the only man who ever became intoxicated through motives of prudence He reflected that if he refused the gin or brandy offered him by some of his patients he could have been no gainer by their cure as they might have had nothing else to bestow on him This habit of taking a fee in whatever shape it was exhibited could not be put off by advice He would swallow what he did not like nay what he knew would injure him rather than go home with an idea that his skill had been exerted without recompense Though he took all that was offered him he demanded nothing from the poor The writer adds that Johnson never wished him to be regarded as an inferior or treated him like a dependent missus Piozzi says When Johnson raised contributions for some distressed author or wit in want he often made us all more than amends by diverting descriptions of the lives they were then passing in corners unseen by anybody but himself and that odd old surgeon whom he kept in his house to tend the outpensioners and of whom he said most truly and sublimely that In misery s darkest caverns known et cetera Piozzi s Anec p one hundred eighteen Levet madam is a brutal fellow but I have a good regard for him for

thirty eight that Johnson was living in Castle Street At the time of Reynolds s arrival in London in seventeen fifty two he had been living for some years in Gough Square Boswell I suppose only means to say that Johnson s acquaintance with the Cotterells was formed when he lived in their neighbourhood Northcote Life of Reynolds i sixty nine says that the Cotterells lived opposite to Reynolds s but his account seems based on a misunderstanding of Boswell seven hundred twenty three Ante p one hundred sixty five seven hundred twenty four We are both of doctor Johnson s school wrote Reynolds to some friend For my own part I acknowledge the highest obligations to him He may be said to have formed my mind and to have brushed from it a great deal of rubbish Those very persons whom he has brought to think rightly will occasionally criticise the opinions of their master when he nods But we should always recollect that it is he himself who taught us and enabled us to do it Taylor s Reynolds ii four hundred sixty one Burke writing to Malone said You state very properly how much Reynolds owed to the writings and conversation of Johnson and nothing shews more the greatness of Sir Joshua s parts than his taking advantage of both and making some application of them to his profession when Johnson neither understood nor desired to understand anything of painting Ib p six hundred thirty eight Reynolds there can be little question is thinking of Johnson in the following passage in his Seventh Discourse What partial and desultory reading cannot afford may be supplied by the conversation of learned and ingenious men which is the best of all substitutes for those who have not the means or opportunities of deep study There are many such men in this age and they will be pleased with communicating their ideas to artists when they see them curious and docile if they are treated with that respect and deference which is so justly their due Into such society young artists if they make it the point of their ambition will by degrees be admitted There without formal teaching they will insensibly come to feel and reason like those they live with and find a rational and systematic taste imperceptibly formed in their minds which they will know how to reduce to a standard by applying general truth to their own purposes better perhaps than those to whom they owned owed the original sentiment Reynolds s Works edit eighteen twenty four i one hundred forty nine Another thing remarkable to shew how little Sir Joshua crouched to the great is that he never gave them their proper titles I never heard the words your lordship or your ladyship come from his mouth nor did he ever say Sir in speaking to any one but doctor Johnson and when he did not hear distinctly what the latter said which often happened he would then say Sir that he might repeat it Northcote s Conversations p two hundred eighty nine Gibbon called Johnson Reynolds s oracle Gibbon s Misc Works i one hundred forty nine See also post under Dec twenty nine seventeen seventy eight seven hundred twenty five The thought may have been suggested to Reynolds by Johnson s writings In The Rambler No eighty seven he had said There are minds so impatient of inferiority that their gratitude is a species of revenge and they return benefits not because recompense is a pleasure but because obligation is a pain In No one hundred sixty six he says To be obliged is to be in some respect inferior to another seven hundred twenty six Northcote tells the following story on the authority of Miss Reynolds It is to be noticed however that in her Recollections Croker s Boswell p eight hundred thirty two the story is told somewhat differently Johnson Reynolds and Miss Reynolds one day called on the Miss Cotterells Johnson was the last of the three that came in when the maid seeing this uncouth and dirty figure of a man and not conceiving he could be one of the company laid hold of his coat just as he was going up stairs and pulled him back again saying You fellow what is your business here I suppose you intended to rob the house This most unlucky accident threw him into such a fit of shame and anger that he roared out like a bull What have I done What have I done Northcote s Reynolds i seventy three seven hundred twenty seven Johnson writing to Langton on January nine seventeen fifty nine describes him as towering in the confidence of twenty one The conclusion of The Rambler was in March seventeen fifty two when Langton must have been only fourteen or just fifteen at most Johnson s

nobleman solemnly to protest that he has not been bribed by a poor author whom seven years before he had repulsed from his door But Chesterfield did worse than this By way of recommending a work of so much learning and so much labour he tells a foolish story of an assignation that had failed between a fine gentleman and a fine lady The letter that had passed between them had been badly spelt and they had gone to different houses Such examples he wrote really make one tremble and will I am convinced determine my fair fellow subjects and their adherents to adopt and scrupulously conform to

four doctor Johnson appeared to have had a remarkable delicacy with respect to the circulation of this letter for doctor Douglas Bishop of Salisbury informs me that having many years ago pressed him to be allowed to read it to the second Lord Hardwicke who was very desirous to hear it promising at the same time that no copy of it should be taken Johnson seemed much pleased that it had attracted the attention of a nobleman of such a respectable character but after pausing some time declined to comply with the request saying with a smile No Sir I have hurt the dog too much already or words to that purpose BOSWELL seven hundred sixty five See post June four seventeen eighty one seven hundred sixty six In seventeen ninety the year before the Life of Johnson came out Boswell published this letter in a separate sheet of four quarto pages under the following title The celebrated Letter from Samuel Johnson LL D to Philip Dormer Stanhope Earl of Chesterfield Now first published with Notes by James Boswell esquire London Printed by Henry Baldwin for Charles Dilly in the Poultry MDCCXC Price Half a Guinea Entered in the Hall Book of the Company of Stationers It belongs to the same impression as The Life of Johnson seven hundred sixty seven Je chante le vainqueur des vainqueurs de la terre Boileau L Art poetique iii two hundred seventy two seven hundred sixty eight The following note is subjoined by mister Langton doctor Johnson when he gave me this copy of his letter desired that I would annex to it his information to me that whereas it is said in the letter that no assistance has been received he did once receive from Lord Chesterfield the sum of ten pounds but as that was so inconsiderable a sum he thought the mention of it could not properly find place in a letter of the kind that this was BOSWELL This surely is an unsatisfactory excuse writes mister Croker He read Johnson s letter carelessly as the rest of his note shews Johnson says that during the seven years that had passed since he was repulsed from Chesterfield s door he had pushed on his work without one act of assistance These ten pounds we may feel sure had been received before the seven years began to run No doubt they had been given in seventeen forty seven as an acknowledgement of the compliment paid to Chesterfield in the Plan He had at first been misled by Chesterfield s one act of kindness but he had long had his eyes opened Like the shepherd in Virgil Eclogues viii forty three he could say Nunc scio quid sit Amor seven hundred sixty nine In this passage doctor Johnson evidently alludes to the loss of his wife We find the same tender recollection recurring to his mind upon innumerable occasions and perhaps no man ever more forcibly felt the truth of the sentiment so elegantly expressed by my friend mister Malone in his Prologue to mister Jephson s tragedy of JULIA Julia or the Italian Lover was acted for the first time on April seventeen seventeen eighty seven Gent Mag seventeen eighty seven p three hundred fifty four Vain wealth and fame and fortune s fostering care If no fond breast the splendid blessings share And each day s bustling pageantry once past

every good that it be timely obtained for whatever comes at the close of life will come too late to give much delight What we acquire by bravery or science by mental or corporal diligence comes at last when we cannot communicate and therefore cannot enjoy it Chesterfield himself was in no happy state Less than a month before he received Johnson s letter he wrote Works iii three hundred eight For these six months past it seems as if all the complaints that ever attacked heads had joined to overpower mine Continual noises headache giddiness and impenetrable deafness I could not stoop to write and even reading the only resource of the deaf was painful to me He wrote to his son a year earlier Letters iv forty three Reading which was always a pleasure to me in the time even of my greatest dissipation is now become my only refuge and I fear I indulge it too much at the expense of my eyes But what can I do I must do something I cannot bear absolute idleness my ears grow every day more useless to me my eyes consequently more necessary I will not hoard them like a miser but will rather risk the loss than not enjoy the use of them seven hundred seventy The English Dictionary was written with little assistance of the learned and without any patronage of the great not in the soft obscurities of retirement or under the shelter of academick bowers but amidst inconvenience and distraction in sickness and in sorrow Johnson s Works v fifty one seven hundred seventy one Upon comparing this copy with that which doctor Johnson dictated to me from recollection the variations are found to be so slight that this must be added to the many other proofs which he gave of the wonderful extent and accuracy of his memory To gratify the curious in composition I have deposited both the copies in the British Museum BOSWELL seven hundred seventy two Soon after Edwards s Canons of Criticism came out Johnson was dining at Tonson the Bookseller s with Hayman the Painter and some more company Hayman related to Sir Joshua Reynolds that the conversation having turned upon Edwards s book the gentlemen praised it much and Johnson allowed its merit But when they went farther and appeared to put that author upon a level with Warburton Nay said Johnson he has given him some smart hits to be sure but there is no proportion between the two men they must not be named together A fly Sir may sting a stately horse and make him wince but one is but an insect and the other is a horse still BOSWELL Johnson in his Preface to Shakespeare Works v one hundred forty one wrote doctor Warburton s chief assailants are the authors of The Canons of Criticism and of The Revisal of Shakespeare s Text The one stings like a fly sucks a little blood takes a gay flutter and returns for more the other bites like a viper When I think on one with his confederates I remember the danger of Coriolanus who was afraid that girls with spits and boys with stones should slay him in puny battle when the other crosses my imagination I remember the prodigy in Macbeth A falcon tow ring in his pride of place Was by a mousing owl hawk d at and kill d Let me however do them justice One is a wit and one a scholar seven hundred seventy three To Johnson might be applied what he himself said of Dryden He appears to have known in its whole extent the dignity of his character and to have set a very high value on his own powers and performances Works vii two hundred ninety one seven hundred seventy four In the original Yet mark seven hundred seventy five In the original Toil seven hundred seventy six In his Dictionary he defined patron as commonly a wretch who supports with insolence and is paid with flattery This definition disappears in the Abridgement but remains in the fourth edition seven hundred seventy seven Chesterfield when he read Johnson s letter to Dodsley was acting up to the advice that he had given his own son six years earlier Letters ii one hundred seventy two When things of this kind bons mots happen to be said of you the most prudent way is to seem not to suppose that they are meant at you but to dissemble and conceal whatever degree of anger you may feel inwardly and should they be so plain that you cannot be supposed ignorant of their meaning so join in the laugh of the company against yourself acknowledge the hit to be a fair one and the jest a good one and play off the whole thing in seeming good humour but by no means reply in the same way which only shows that you are hurt and publishes the victory which you might have concealed seven hundred seventy

According to Rebecca Warner Original Letters p two hundred four Johnson telling Joseph Fowke about his refusal to dedicate his Dictionary to Chesterfield said Sir I found I must have gilded a rotten post seven hundred eighty That collection of letters cannot be vindicated from the serious charge of encouraging in some passages one of the vices most destructive to the good order and comfort of society which his Lordship represents as mere fashionable gallantry and in others of inculcating the base practice of dissimulation and recommending with disproportionate anxiety a perpetual attention to external elegance of manners But it must at the same time be allowed that they contain many good precepts of conduct and much genuine information upon life and manners very happily expressed and that there was considerable merit in paying so much attention to the improvement of one who was dependent upon his Lordship s protection it has probably been exceeded in no instance by the most exemplary parent and though I can by no means approve of confounding the distinction between lawful and illicit offspring which is in effect insulting the civil establishment of our country to look no higher I cannot help thinking it laudable to be kindly attentive to those of whose existence we have in any way been the cause mister Stanhope s character has been unjustly represented as diametrically opposite to what Lord Chesterfield wished him to be He has been called dull gross and awkward but I knew him at Dresden when he was Envoy to that court and though he could not boast of the graces he was in truth a sensible civil well behaved man BOSWELL See post March twenty eight seventeen seventy five under April twenty nine seventeen seventy six and June twenty seven seventeen

Lord Chesterfield s Respectable Hottentot was not Johnson From the beginning of seventeen forty eight to the end of seventeen fifty four Chesterfield had no dealings of any kind with Johnson At no time had there been the slightest intimacy between the great nobleman and the poor author Chesterfield had never seen Johnson eat The letter in which the character is drawn opens with the epigram Non amo te Sabidi nee possum dicere quare Hoc tantum possum dicere non amo te Chesterfield goes on to show how it is possible not to love anybody and yet not to know the reason why How often he says have I in the course of my life found myself in this situation with regard to many of my acquaintance whom I have honoured and respected without being able to love He then instances the case of the man whom he describes as a respectable Hottentot It is clear that he is writing of a man whom he knows well and who has some claim upon his affection Twice he says that it is impossible to love him The date of this letter is Feb twenty eight seventeen fifty one more than three years after Johnson had for the last time waited in Chesterfield s outward rooms Moreover the same man is described in three other letters Sept twenty two seventeen forty nine Nov seventeen forty nine and May twenty seven seventeen fifty three and described as one with whom Chesterfield lived on terms of intimacy In the two former of these letters he is called mister L Lyttelton did not become Sir George Lyttelton till Sept fourteen seventeen fifty one He was raised to the peerage in seventeen fifty seven Horace Walpole Reign of George III i two hundred fifty six says of him His ignorance of mankind want of judgment with strange absence and awkwardness involved him in mistakes and ridicule Had Chesterfield s letter been published when it was written no one in all likelihood would have so much as dreamt that Johnson was aimed at But it did not come before the world till twenty three years later when Johnson s quarrel with Chesterfield was known to every one when Johnson himself was at the very head of the literary world and when his peculiarities had become a matter of general interest seven hundred eighty five About four years after this time Gibbon on his return to England became intimate with mister and missus Mallet He thus wrote of them The most useful friends of my father were the Mallets they received me with civility and kindness at first on his account and afterwards on my own and if I may use Lord Chesterfield s words I was soon domesticated in their house mister Mallet a name among the English poets is praised by an unforgiving enemy for the ease and elegance of his conversation and his wife was not destitute of wit or learning Gibbon s Misc Works i one hundred fifteen The

recorded in his Life of Boerhaave Works vi two hundred seventy seven As Boerhaave was sitting in a common boat there arose a conversation among the passengers upon the impious and pernicious doctrine of Spinosa which as they all agreed tends to the utter overthrow of all religion Boerhaave sat and attended silently to this discourse for some time till one of the company instead of confuting the positions of Spinosa by argument began to give a loose to contumelious language and virulent invectives which Boerhaave was so little pleased with that at last he could not forbear asking him whether he had ever read the author he declaimed against seven hundred eighty seven Lord Shelburne said that Bolingbroke was both a political and personal coward Fitzmaurice s Shelburne i twenty nine seven

the publication of Lord Bolingbroke s posthumous works mister Garrick asked him if he had seen them Yes I have seen them What do you think of them Think of them He made a long pause and then replied Think of them a scoundrel and a coward A scoundrel who spent his life in charging a gun against Christianity and a coward who was afraid of hearing the report of his own gun but left half a crown to a hungry Scotchman to draw the trigger after his death His mind at this time strained and over laboured by constant exertion called for an interval of repose and indolence But indolence was the time of danger it was then that his spirits not employed abroad turned with inward hostility against himself Murphy s Johnson p seventy nine and Piozzi s Anec p two hundred thirty five Adam Smith perhaps had

an information twenty ninth Nov seventeen fifty five W Murray In one of the Parl Debates of seventeen forty two Johnson makes Pitt say that it is probable that we shall detect bribery descending

knew I could afford to joke with the rascal who had me in custody and did so over a pint of adulterated wine for which at that instant I had no money to pay It is very likely that this anecdote has no

engagement that he had made to edit Shakespeare so was Cowper by his engagement to edit Milton The consciousness that there is so much to do and nothing done is a burthen I am not able to bear Milton

by Johnson It is fit the speaker says that those whom for the future we shall employ and pay may know they are the servants of a people that expect duty for their money It is said an address expresses

up his own To this Dodsley returned a cold reply Garrick wrote back as follows Master Robert Dodsley When I first read your peevish answer to my well meant proposal to you I was much disturbed at it but when I considered that some minds cannot bear the smallest portion of success I most sincerely pitied you and when I found in the same letter that you were graciously pleased to dismiss me from

superiority what is equally difficult to the reader and to myself but where I could not instruct him have owned my ignorance nine hundred seventy nine Northcote gives the following account of this same garret in describing how Reynolds introduced Roubiliac to Johnson Johnson received him with much civility and took them up into a garret which he considered as his library where besides his books all covered with dust there was an old crazy deal table and a still worse and older elbow chair having only three legs In this chair Johnson seated himself after having with considerable dexterity and evident practice first drawn it up against the wall which served to support it on that side on which the leg was deficient Northcote s Reynolds i seventy five Miss Reynolds improves on the account She says that before Johnson had the pension he literally dressed like a beggar and from what I have been told he as literally lived as such at least as to common conveniences in his apartments wanting even a chair to sit on particularly in his study where a gentleman who frequently visited him whilst writing his Idlers constantly found him at his desk sitting on one with three legs and on rising from it he remarked that doctor Johnson never forgot its defect but would either hold it in his hand or place it with great composure against some support taking no notice of its imperfection to his visitor It was remarkable in Johnson that no external circumstances ever prompted him to make any apology or to seem even sensible of their existence Croker s Boswell p eight hundred thirty two There can be little question that she is describing the same room a room in a house in which Miss Williams was lodged and most likely mister Levet and in which mister Burney dined and in which certainly

predecessors and to his immediate successor Warburton although the latter had the advantage of working on his materials Many most brilliant emendations are due to him On Johnson s statement that Warburton would make two and fifty Theobalds cut into slices they write From this judgment whether they be compared as critics or editors we emphatically dissent Cambridge Shakespeare i xxxi xxxiv

Pope had clandestinely printed an unauthorised number of the pamphlet called The Patriot King Bolingbroke in a fit of useless fury resolved to blast his memory and employed Mallet seventeen forty nine

seventeen fifty four five nine hundred eighty four A paper under this name had been started seven years earlier See Carter and Talbot Corres ii thirty three nine hundred eighty five In the two years in which Johnson wrote for this paper it saw many changes The first Idler appeared in No two of the Universal Chronicle or Weekly Gazette which was published not by Newbery but by J Payne On April

title was changed to The Universal Chronicle and Westminster Journal and it was published by W Faden and R Stevens On March fifteen seventeen sixty it was published by R Stevens alone The paper consisted of eight pages The Idler which varied in length came first and was printed in larger characters much like a leading article The changes in title and ownership seem to show that in spite of Johnson s contributions it was not a successful publication nine hundred eighty six Those papers may be considered as a kind of syllabus of all Reynolds s future discourses and certainly occasioned him some thinking in their composition I have heard him say that Johnson required them from him on a sudden emergency and on that account he sat up the whole night to complete them in time and by it he was so much disordered that it produced a vertigo in his head Northcote s Reynolds i eighty nine Reynolds must have spoken of only one paper as the three appearing as they did on Sept twenty nine

for this day any other entertainment nine hundred ninety one In the table of contents the title of No fifty eight is Expectations of pleasure frustrated In the original edition of The Idler no titles are given In this paper he shews that nothing is more hopeless than a scheme of merriment nine hundred ninety two In this paper he begins by considering why the only thinking being of this globe is doomed to think merely to be wretched and to pass his time from youth to age in fearing or in suffering calamities He ends by asserting that of what virtue there is misery produces far the greater part nine hundred ninety three There are few things he writes not purely evil of which we can say without some emotion of uneasiness this is the last The secret horrour of the last is inseparable from a thinking being whose life is limited and to whom death is dreadful nine hundred ninety four I asked him one day why the Idlers were published without mottoes He replied that it was forborne the better to conceal himself and escape discovery But let us think of some now said he for the next edition We can fit the two volumnes in two hours can t we Accordingly he recollected and I wrote down

plain prose we gravely talk of courting the Muse in shady bowers waiting the call and inspiration of Genius of attending to times and seasons when the imagination shoots with the greatest vigour

who shall treat it with contempt Surely not the attendant on a court whose business is to watch the looks of a being weak and foolish as himself and whose vanity is to recount the names of men who

publishers of news papers and magazines to enrich their publications Johnson to put a stop to this unfair proceeding wrote for the Universal Chronicle the following advertisement in which there is perhaps more pomp of words than the occasion demanded London January five seventeen fifty nine ADVERTISEMENT The proprietors of the paper intitled The Idler having found that those essays are inserted in the news papers and magazines with so little regard to justice or decency that the Universal Chronicle in which they first appear is not always mentioned think it necessary to declare to the publishers of those collections that however patiently they have hitherto endured these injuries made yet more injurious by contempt they have now determined to endure them no longer They have already seen essays for which a very large price is paid transferred with the most shameless rapacity into the weekly or monthly compilations and their right at least for the present alienated from them before they could themselves be said to enjoy it But they would not willingly be thought to want tenderness even for men by whom no tenderness hath been shewn The past is without remedy and shall be without resentment But those who have been thus busy with their sickles in the fields of their neighbours are henceforward to take notice that the time of impunity is at an end Whoever shall without our leave lay the hand of rapine upon our papers is to expect that we shall vindicate our due by the means which justice prescribes and which are warranted by the immemorial prescriptions of honourable trade We shall lay hold in our turn on their copies degrade them from the pomp of wide margin and diffuse typography contract them into a narrow space and sell them at an humble price yet not with a view of growing rich by confiscations for we think not much better of money got by punishment than by crimes We shall therefore when our losses are repaid give what profit shall remain to

dissipated course of life On July two seventeen sixty five Johnson records that he repaid him ten guineas which he had borrowed in the lifetime of missus Johnson his wife He also lent him ten guineas more If it was in seventeen fifty nine that Simpson was troubled by small debts it is most unlikely that Johnson let six years more pass without repaying him a loan which even then was at least of seven years standing Moreover in this letter Johnson writes I have been invited or have invited myself to several parts of the kingdom The only visits it seems that he paid between seventeen fifty

sanction of parental authority He continues Even though no consideration should be paid to the great law of social beings by which every individual is commanded to consult the happiness of others yet the harsh parent is less to be vindicated than any other criminal because he less provides for the happiness of himself See also post March twenty nine seventeen seventy nine A passage in one of

Philadelphia with the copy of a letter written by doctor John Armstrong the poet to doctor Smollet at Leghorne containing the following paragraph As to the K Bench patriot it is hard to say from what

that he gives of Savage s destitution Works viii three Nor had he any other conveniences for study than the fields or the streets allowed him there he used to walk and form his speeches and afterwards step into a shop beg for a few moments the use of the pen and ink and write down what he had composed upon paper which he had picked up by accident Hawkins Life p three hundred eighty three says that Johnson s chambers were two doors down the Inner Temple Lane I have been told he continues by his neighbour at the corner that during the time he dwelt there more inquiries were made at his shop for mister Johnson than for all the inhabitants put together of both the Inner and Middle Temple In a court opening out of Fleet Street Goldsmith at this very time was still more miserably lodged In the beginning of March seventeen fifty nine Percy found him employed in writing his Enquiry into Polite Learning in a wretched dirty room in which there was but one chair and when he from civility offered it to his visitant himself was obliged to sit in the window Goldsmith s Misc Works i sixty one ten fifty Sir John Hawkins Life p three hundred seventy three has given a long detail of it in that manner vulgarly but significantly called rigmarole in which amidst an ostentatious exhibition of arts and artists he talks of proportions of a column being taken from that of the human figure and adjusted by Nature masculine and feminine in a man sesquioctave of the head and in a woman sesquinonal nor has he failed to introduce a jargon of musical terms which do not seem much to correspond with the subject but serve to make up the heterogeneous mass To follow the Knight through all this would be an useless fatigue to myself and not a little disgusting to my readers I shall therefore only make a few remarks upon his statement He seems to exult in having detected Johnson in procuring from a person eminently skilled in Mathematicks and the principles of architecture answers to a string of questions drawn up by himself touching the comparative strength of semicircular and elliptical arches Now I cannot conceive how Johnson could have acted more wisely Sir John complains that the opinion of that excellent mathematician mister Thomas Simpson did not preponderate in favour of the semicircular arch But he should have known that however eminent mister Simpson was in the higher parts of abstract mathematical science he was little versed in mixed and practical mechanicks mister Muller of Woolwich Academy the scholastick father of all the great engineers which this country has employed for forty years decided the question by declaring clearly in favour of the elliptical arch It is ungraciously suggested that Johnson s motive for opposing mister Mylne s scheme may have been his prejudice against him as a native of North Britain when in truth as has been stated he gave the aid of his able pen to a friend who was one of the candidates and so far was he from having any illiberal antipathy to mister Mylne that he afterwards lived with that gentleman upon very agreeable terms of acquaintance and dined with him at his house Sir John Hawkins indeed gives full vent to his own prejudice in abusing Blackfriars bridge calling it an edifice in which beauty and symmetry are in vain sought for by which the citizens of London have perpetuated study their own disgrace and subjected a whole nation to the reproach of foreigners Whoever has contemplated placido lumine Horace Odes iv three two this stately elegant and airy structure which has so fine an effect especially on approaching the capital on that quarter must wonder at such unjust and ill tempered censure and I appeal to all foreigners of good taste whether this bridge be not one of the most distinguished ornaments of London As to the stability of the fabrick it is certain that the City of London took every precaution to have the best Portland stone for it but as this is to be found in the quarries belonging to the publick under the direction of the Lords of the Treasury it so happened that parliamentary interest which is often the bane of fair pursuits thwarted their endeavours Notwithstanding this disadvantage it is well known that not only has Blackfriars bridge never sunk either in its foundation or in its arches which were so much the subject of contest but any injuries which it has suffered from the effects of severe frosts have been already in some measure repaired with sounder stone and every necessary renewal can be completed at a moderate expence BOSWELL Horace Walpole mentions an ineffectual application made by the City to Parliament in seventeen sixty four for more money for their new bridge at Blackfriars when doctor Hay one of the Lords of the Admiralty abused the Common Council whose late behaviour he said entitled them to no favour Walpole s Memoirs of the Reign of George III i three hundred ninety The late behaviour was the part taken by the City in Wilkes s case It was the same love of liberty no doubt that lost the City the Portland stone Smollett goes out of the way to praise his brother Scot mister Mylne in Humphry Clinker a party novel written says Horace Walpole to vindicate the Scots Reign of George III iv three hundred twenty eight In the letter dated May twenty nine he makes mister Bramble say The Bridge at Blackfriars is a

cause we know that they are poor and naked and poor and naked without a crime The opponents of this charity must allow it to be good and will not easily prove it not to be the best That charity is best of which the consequences are most extensive the relief of enemies has a tendency to unite mankind in fraternal affection The Committee for which Johnson s paper was written began its work in Dec seventeen fifty nine In the previous month of October Wesley records in his Journal ii four hundred sixty one I walked up to Knowle a mile from Bristol to see the French prisoners Above eleven hundred of them we were informed were confined in that little place without anything to lie on but a little dirty straw or anything to cover them but a few foul thin rags either by day or by night so that they died like rotten sheep I was much affected and preached in the evening on Exodus xxiii nine Money was at once contributed and clothing bought It was not long before contributions were set on foot in various parts of the Kingdom On Oct twenty four of the following year he records I visited the French prisoners at Knowle and found many of them almost naked again Ib iii twenty three The prisoners wrote Hume Private Corres p fifty five received food from the public but it was thought that their own friends would supply them with clothes which however was found after some time to be neglected The cry arose that the brave and gallant men though enemies were perishing with cold in prison a subscription was set on foot great sums were given by all ranks of people and notwithstanding the national foolish prejudices against the French a remarkable zeal everywhere appeared for this charity I am afraid that M Rousseau could not have produced many parallel instances among his heroes the Greeks and still fewer among the Romans Baretti in his Journey from London to Genoa i sixty two sixty six after telling how on all foreigners even on a Turk wearing a turban the pretty appellation of French dog was liberally bestowed by the London rabble continues I have seen the populace of England contribute as many shillings as they could spare towards the maintenance of the French prisoners

eighteen says that Johnson told him that in his whole life he was never capable of discerning the least resemblance of any kind between a picture and the subject it was intended to represent This however must have been an exaggeration on the part either of Hawkins or Johnson His general ignorance of art is shown by missus Piozzi Anec p ninety eight Sir Joshua Reynolds mentioned some picture as excellent It has often grieved me sir said mister Johnson to see so much mind as the science of painting requires laid out upon such perishable materials why do not you oftener make use of copper I could wish your superiority in the art you profess to be preserved in stuff more durable than canvas Sir Joshua urged the difficulty of procuring a plate large enough for historical subjects What foppish obstacles are these exclaims on a sudden doctor Johnson Here is Thrale has a thousand tun of copper you may paint it all round if you will I suppose it will serve him to brew in afterwards Will it not Sir to my husband who sat by Indeed his utter scorn of painting was such that I have heard him say that he should sit very quietly in a room hung round with the works of the greatest masters and never feel the slightest disposition to turn them if their backs were outermost unless it might be for the sake of telling Sir Joshua that he had turned them Such a remark of Johnson s must not however be taken too strictly He often spoke at random often with exaggeration There is in many minds a kind of vanity exerted to the disadvantage of themselves This reflection of his is the opening sentence to the number of the Idler No forty five in which he thus writes about portrait painting Genius is chiefly exerted in historical pictures and the art of the painter of portraits is often lost in the obscurity of his subject But it is in painting as in life what is greatest is not always best I should grieve to see Reynolds transfer to heroes and to goddesses to empty splendour and to airy fiction that art which is now employed in diffusing friendship in reviving tenderness in quickening the affections of the absent and continuing the presence of the dead It is recorded in Johnson s Works seventeen eighty seven xi two hundred eight that Johnson talking with some persons about allegorical painting said I had rather see the portrait of a dog that I know than all the allegorical paintings they can show me in the world He bought prints of Burke Dyer and Goldsmith Good impressions he said to hang in a little room that he was fitting up with prints Croker s Boswell p

one duty succeeds another so that they are not left open to the distraction of unguided choice nor lost in the shades of listless inactivity He that lives well in the world is better than he that

being intimate with Johnson was desired to call upon him and take him with him As they went together the former was much struck with the studied neatness of Johnson s dress He had on a new suit of clothes a new wig nicely powdered and everything about him so perfectly dissimilar from his usual appearance that his companion could not help inquiring the cause of this singular transformation Why

these circumstances I must esteem myself one of the happy and fortunate J H Burton s Hume i three hundred forty two Goldsmith in his Present State of Polite Learning chap vii makes the following observation on pensions granted in France to authors The French nobility have certainly a most pleasing way of satisfying the vanity of an author without indulging his avarice A man of literary merit is sure of being caressed by the great though seldom enriched His pension from the crown just supplies half a competence and the sale of his labours makes some small addition to his circumstances thus the author leads a life of splendid poverty and seldom becomes wealthy or indolent enough to discontinue an exertion of those abilities by which he rose Whether Johnson s pension led to his writing less than he would otherwise have done may be questioned It is true that in the next seventeen years he did little more than finish his edition of Shakespeare and write his Journey to the Western Islands and two or three political pamphlets But since he wrote the last number of The Idler in the spring of seventeen sixty he had done very little His mind which to use Murphy s words Life p eighty

government any reward whatsoever for his political labours I think not I think that had Johnson unpensioned been asked by the Ministry to write these pamphlets he would have written them He would have been pleased by the compliment and for pay would have trusted to the sale Speaking of the first two of these pamphlets the third had not yet appeared he said Except what I had from the booksellers I

message was disclosed Johnson made a long pause he asked if it was seriously intended He fell into a profound meditation and his own definition of a pensioner occurred to him He desired to meet next day and dine at the Mitre Tavern At that meeting he gave up all his scruples On the following day Lord Loughborough conducted him to the Earl of Bute The conversation that passed was in the evening related to me by doctor Johnson He expressed his sense of his Majesty s bounty and thought himself the more highly honoured as the favour was not bestowed on him for having dipped his pen in faction

devoured so large a quantity of new honey and of clouted cream besides drinking large potations of new cyder that the entertainer found himself much embarrassed between his anxious regard for the Doctor s health and his fear of breaking through the rules of politeness by giving him a hint on the subject The strength of Johnson s constitution however saved him from any unpleasant consequences Sir Joshua informed a friend that he had never seen doctor Johnson intoxicated by hard drinking but once and that happened at the time that they were together in Devonshire when one night after supper Johnson drank three bottles of wine which affected his speech so much that he was unable to articulate a hard word which occurred in the course of his conversation He attempted it three times but failed yet at last accomplished it and then said Well Sir Joshua I think it is now time to go to bed Ib ii one hundred sixty one One part of this story however is wanting in accuracy and therefore all

Collins with whom I once delighted to converse and whom I yet remember with tenderness eleven thirty three MADAM To approach the high and the illustrious has been in all ages the privilege of Poets and though translators cannot justly claim the same honour yet they naturally follow their authours as attendants and I hope that in return for having enabled TASSO to diffuse his fame through the British dominions I may be introduced by him to the presence of YOUR MAJESTY TASSO has a peculiar claim to YOUR MAJESTY S favour as follower and panegyrist of the House of Este which has one common ancestor with the House of HANOVER and in reviewing his life it is not easy to forbear a wish that he had lived in a happier time when he might among the descendants of that illustrious family have found a more liberal and potent patronage I cannot but observe MADAM how unequally reward is proportioned to merit when I reflect that the happiness which was withheld from TASSO is reserved for me and that the poem which once hardly procured to its authour the countenance of the Princess of Ferrara has attracted to its translator the favourable notice of a BRITISH QUEEN Had this been the fate of TASSO he would have been able to have celebrated the condescension of YOUR MAJESTY in nobler language but could not have felt it with more ardent gratitude than MADAM Your MAJESTY S Most faithful

decry some of the prettiest pieces of writing we have in English yet Johnson is an honourable man that is to say he is a good critic and in other respects a man of enormous talents eleven forty nine My position has been very well illustrated by mister Belsham of Bedford in his Essay on Dramatic Poetry The fashionable doctrine says he both of moralists and criticks in these times is that virtue and happiness are constant concomitants and it is regarded as a kind of dramatick impiety to maintain that virtue should not be rewarded nor vice punished in the last scene of the last act of every tragedy This conduct in our modern poets is however in my opinion extremely injudicious for it labours in vain to inculcate a doctrine in theory which every one knows to be false in fact viz that virtue in real life is always productive of happiness and vice of misery Thus Congreve concludes the Tragedy of The Mourning Bride with the following foolish couplet For blessings ever wait on virtuous deeds And though a late a sure reward succeeds When a man eminently virtuous a Brutus a Cato or a Socrates finally sink under the pressure of accumulated misfortune we are not only led to entertain a more indignant hatred of vice than if he rose from his distress but we are inevitably induced to cherish the sublime idea that a day of future retribution will arrive when he shall receive not merely poetical but real and substantial justice Essays Philosophical Historical and Literary London seventeen ninety one vol II eightvo p three hundred seventeen This is well reasoned and well expressed I wish indeed that the ingenious authour had not thought it necessary to introduce any instance of a man eminently virtuous as he would then have avoided mentioning such a ruffian as Brutus under that description mister Belsham discovers in his Essays so much reading and thinking and good composition that I regret his not having been fortunate enough to be educated a member of our excellent national establishment Had he not been nursed in nonconformity he probably would not have been tainted with those heresies as I sincerely and on no slight investigation think them both in religion and politicks which while I read I am sure with candour I cannot read without offence BOSWELL Boswell s position has been illustrated with far greater force by Johnson It has been the boast of some swelling moralists that every man s fortune was in his own power that prudence supplied the place of all other divinities and that happiness is the unfailing consequence of virtue But surely the quiver of Omnipotence is stored with arrows against which the shield of human virtue however adamantine it has been boasted is held up in vain we do not always suffer by our crimes we are not always protected by our innocence The Adventurer No one hundred twenty See also Rasselas chap twenty seven eleven fifty Charles Fox said that missus Sheridan s Sydney Biddulph was the best of all

to give credit to a clergyman Post seventeen eighty in mister Langton s Collection The spiteful Steevens thus wrote about Davies His concern ought to be with the outside of books but doctor Johnson

Lamb s Works ed eighteen forty p five hundred seventeen eleven fifty five See Johnson s letter to Davies post June eighteen seventeen eighty three eleven fifty six mister Murphy in his Essay on the Life and Genius of doctor Johnson p one hundred six has given an account of this meeting considerably different from mine I am persuaded without any consciousness of errour His memory at the end of near thirty years has undoubtedly deceived him and he supposes himself to have been present at a scene which he has probably heard inaccurately described by others In my note taken on the very day in which I am confident I marked every thing material that passed no mention is made of this gentleman and I am sure that I should not have omitted one so well known in the literary world It may easily be imagined that this my first interview with doctor Johnson with all its circumstances made a strong impression on my mind and would be registered with peculiar attention BOSWELL eleven fifty seven

six The account was as follows On the night of the first of February seventeen sixty two many gentlemen eminent for their rank and character were by the invitation of the Reverend mister Aldrich of Clerkenwell assembled at his house for the examination of the noises supposed to be made by a departed spirit for the detection of some enormous crime About ten at night the gentlemen met in the chamber in which the girl supposed to be disturbed by a spirit had with proper caution been put to bed by several ladies They sat rather more than an hour and hearing nothing went down stairs when they interrogated the father of the girl who denied in the strongest terms any knowledge or belief of fraud The supposed spirit had before publickly promised by an affirmative knock that it would attend one of the gentlemen into the vault under the Church of saint John Clerkenwell where the body is deposited and give a token of her presence there by a knock upon her coffin it was therefore determined to make this trial of the existence or veracity of the supposed spirit While they were enquiring and deliberating they were summoned into the girl s chamber by some ladies who were near her bed and who had heard knocks and scratches When the gentlemen entered the girl declared that she felt the spirit like a mouse upon her back and was required to hold her hands out of bed From that time though the spirit was very solemnly required to manifest its existence by appearance by impression on the hand or body of any present by scratches knocks or any other agency no evidence of any preter natural power was exhibited The spirit was then very seriously advertised that the person to whom the promise was made of striking the coffin was then about to visit the vault and that the performance of the promise was then claimed The company at one o clock went into the church and the gentleman to whom the promise was made went with another into the vault The spirit was solemnly required to perform its promise but nothing more than silence ensued the person supposed to be accused by the spirit then went down with several others but no effect was perceived Upon their return they examined the girl but could draw no confession from her Between two and three she desired and was permitted to go home with her father It is therefore the opinion of the whole assembly that the child has some art of making or counterfeiting a particular noise and that there is no agency of any higher cause BOSWELL Gent Mag xxxii eighty one The following MS letter is in the British Museum REVD SIR The

mentioned to me that he frequently heard Goldsmith talk warmly of the pleasure of being liked and observe how hard it would be if literary excellence should preclude a man from that satisfaction which he perceived it often did from the envy which attended it and therefore Sir Joshua was convinced that he was intentionally more absurd in order to lessen himself in social intercourse trusting that his character would be sufficiently supported by his works If it indeed was his intention to appear absurd in company he was often very successful But with due deference to Sir Joshua s ingenuity I think the conjecture too refined BOSWELL Horace Walpole s saying of the inspired ideot is recorded in Davies s Garrick ii one hundred fifty one Walpole in his Letters describes Goldsmith as a

under the direction of the most literary property in seventeen ten whether by wise most learned and most generous encouragers of knowledge in the world the property of a mechanick should be better secured than that of a scholar that the poorest manual operations should be more valued than the noblest products of the brain that it should be felony to rob a cobbler of a pair of shoes and no crime

force of curiosity He next points out what Cromwell owed to the private condition in which he first entered the world and continues The King of Prussia brought to the throne the knowledge of a private man without the guilt of usurpation Of this general acquaintance with the world there may be found some traces in his whole life His conversation is like that of other men upon common topicks his

family thirteen nineteen The first volume was published in seventeen fifty six the second in seventeen eighty two thirteen twenty Warton to use his own words did not think Pope at the head of his profession In other words in that species of poetry wherein Pope excelled he is superior to all mankind and I only say that this species of poetry is not the most excellent one of the art He disposes the English poets in four classes placing in the first only Spenser Shakespeare and Milton In the second class should be ranked such as possessed the true poetical genius in a more moderate degree but who had noble talents for moral ethical and panegyrical poetry In this class in his concluding volume he says we may venture to assign Pope a place just above Dryden Yet to bring our minds steadily to make this decision we must forget for a moment the divine Music Ode of Dryden and may perhaps then be compelled to confess that though Dryden be the greater genius yet Pope is the better artist Warton s Essay i i vii and ii four hundred four See post March thirty one seventeen seventy two thirteen twenty one mister Croker believes Joseph Warton was meant His father however had been Fellow of Magdalen College Oxford and was afterwards Vicar of Basingstoke and Cobham and Professor of Poetry in his own University so that the son could scarcely be described as being originally poor It is no doubt after Boswell s fashion to introduce in consecutive paragraphs the same person once by name and once anonymously but then the certain author who disgusted Boswell by his forwardness mentioned just before Warton may be Warton himself thirteen twenty two When he arrived at Eton he could not make a verse that is he wanted a point indispensable with us to a certain rank in our system But this wonderful boy having satisfied the Master doctor Barnard that he was an admirable scholar and possessed of genius was at once placed at the head of a form He acquired the rules of Latin verse tried his powers and perceiving that he could not rise above his rivals in Virgil Ovid or the lyric of Horace he took up the sermoni propiora and there overshadowed all competitors In the following lines he

Johnson and Goldsmith than with two tigers According to mister Seward Biographiana p six hundred missus Cotterell having one day asked doctor Johnson to introduce her to a celebrated writer Dearest

of the author The Dean bowed smiled good humouredly and answered No I thank you in a very significant manner There is this to be said of Johnson s incredulity about the Tale of a Tub that the History of John Bull and the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus though both by Arbuthnot were commonly assigned to Swift and are printed in his Works thirteen thirty two Thomson thinks in a peculiar train and he thinks always as a man of genius he looks round on Nature and on Life with the eye which Nature bestows only on a poet the eye that distinguishes in everything presented to its view whatever there is

London Bridge as mister Croker points out even when the tide would have allowed passengers to shoot it those who were prudent landed above the bridge and walked to some wharf below it thirteen forty eight All who are acquainted with the history of religion the most important surely that concerns the human mind know that the appellation of Methodists was first given to a society of students in the University of Oxford who about the year seventeen thirty were distinguished by an earnest and methodical attention to devout exercises This disposition of mind is not a novelty or peculiar to any sect but has been and still may be found in many christians of every denomination Johnson himself was in a dignified manner a Methodist In his Rambler No one hundred ten he mentions with respect the whole discipline of regulated piety and in his Prayers and Meditations many instances occur of his anxious examination into his spiritual state That this religious earnestness and in particular an observation of the influence of the Holy Spirit has sometimes degenerated into folly and sometimes been counterfeited for base purposes cannot be denied But it is not therefore fair to decry it when genuine The principal argument in reason and good sense against methodism is that it tends to debase human nature and prevent the generous exertions of goodness by an unworthy supposition that GOD will pay no regard to them although it is positively said in the scriptures that He will reward every man according to his works saint Matthew xvi twenty seven But I am happy to have it in my power to do justice to those whom it is the fashion to ridicule without any knowledge of their tenets and this I can do by quoting a passage from one of their best apologists mister Milner who thus expresses their doctrine upon this subject Justified by faith renewed in his faculties and constrained by the love of Christ their believer moves in the sphere of love and gratitude and all his duties flow more or less from this principle And though they are accumulating for him in heaven a treasure of bliss proportioned to his faithfulness and activity and it is by no means inconsistent with his principles to feel the force of this consideration yet love itself sweetens every duty to his mind and he thinks there is no absurdity in his feeling the love of GOD as the grand commanding principle of his life

is poverty or there is avarice or there is stupidity in short the family is somehow grossly wrong for continued he a man seldom thinks with more earnestness of anything than he does of his dinner and if he cannot get that well dressed he should be suspected of inaccuracy in other things Yet he used to say that a man who rode out for an appetite consulted but little the dignity of human nature Johnson s Works seventeen eighty seven xi two hundred four thirteen seventy three This essay is more against the practices of the parasite than gulosity It is entitled The art of living at the cost of others Johnson wrote to one of missus Thrale s children Gluttony is I think less common among women than among men Women commonly eat more sparingly and are less curious in the choice of meat but if once you find a woman gluttonous expect from her very little virtue Her mind is enslaved to the lowest and grossest temptation Piozzi Letters ii two hundred ninety eight thirteen seventy four Hawkins Life p three hundred fifty five mentions the greediness with which he ate his total inattention to those among whom he was seated and his profound silence at the moment of refection thirteen seventy

Johnson wrote to missus Thrale on July ten seventeen eighty Last week I saw flesh but twice and I think fish once the rest was pease You are afraid you say lest I extenuate myself too fast and are an enemy to violence but did you never hear nor read dear Madam that every man has his genius and that the great rule by which all excellence is attained and all success procured is to follow genius and have you not observed in all our conversations that my genius is always in extremes that I am very noisy or very silent very gloomy or very merry very sour or very kind And would you have me cross my genius when it leads me sometimes to voracity and sometimes to abstinence Piozzi Letters ii one hundred sixty six thirteen seventy seven This he told Boswell was no intentional fasting but happened just in the course of a literary life Boswell s Hebrides Oct four seventeen seventy three See post April seventeen seventeen seventy eight thirteen seventy eight In the last year of his life when he knew that his appetite was diseased he wrote to missus Thrale I have now an inclination to luxury which even your table did not excite for till now my talk was more about the dishes than my thoughts I remember you commended me for seeming pleased with my dinners when you had reduced your table I am able to tell you with great veracity that I never knew when the reduction began nor should have known what it was made had not you told me I now think and consult to day what I shall eat to morrow This disease will I hope be cured Piozzi Letters ii three hundred sixty two thirteen seventy nine Johnson

beef were his favourite dainties Cradock saw Burke at a tavern dinner send Johnson a very small piece of a pie the crust of which was made with bad butter Johnson soon returned his plate for more Burke exclaimed I am glad that you are able so well to relish this pie Johnson not at all pleased that what he ate should ever be noticed retorted There is a time of life Sir when a man requires the repairs of a table Cradock s Memoirs i two hundred twenty nine A passage in Baretti s Italy ii three hundred sixteen seems to show that English eating in general was not delicate I once heard a

Life i seventy one said that Burke s treatise on the Sublime and Beautiful is rather a proof that his mind was not formed for pure philosophy and if we may believe Boswell that it was once the intention of mister Burke to have written against Berkeley we may be assured that he would not have been successful in answering that great speculator or to speak more correctly that he could not have discovered the true nature of the questions in dispute and thus have afforded the only answer consistent with the limits of the human faculties thirteen eighty nine Goldsmith s Retaliation thirteen ninety I have the following autograph letter written by Johnson to doctor Taylor three weeks after Boswell s departure DEAR SIR Having with some impatience reckoned upon hearing from you these two last posts and been disappointed I can form to myself no reason for the omission but your perturbation of mind or disorder of body arising from it and therefore I once more advise removal from Ashbourne as the proper remedy both for the cause and the effect You perhaps ask whither should I go any whither where your case is not known and where your presence will cause neither looks nor

back to look down the hill and said he was determined to take a roll down When we understood what he meant to do we endeavoured to dissuade him but he was resolute saying he had not had a roll for a long time and taking out of his lesser pockets whatever might be in them and laying himself parallel with the edge of the hill he actually descended turning himself over and over till he came to the bottom This story was told with such gravity and with an air of such affectionate remembrance of a departed friend that it was impossible to suppose this extraordinary freak an invention of mister

club room is before us and the table on which stands the omelet for Nugent and the lemons for Johnson It was from missus Piozzi that Macaulay learnt of the omelet Nugent was a Roman Catholic and it was on Friday that the Club before long came to meet We may assume that he would not on that day eat meat I fancy missus Piozzi writes Anec p one hundred twenty two doctor Nugent ordered an omelet sometimes on a Friday or Saturday night for I remember mister Johnson felt very painful sensations at the sight of that dish soon after his death and cried Ah my poor dear friend I shall never eat

commenting on this passage says that under these words mister Burke is darkly alluded to together with his cousin He adds that the character given of Dyer by Hawkins is discoloured by the malignant

surely one ought c fourteen oh nine Pope s Moral Essays iii two hundred forty two fourteen ten Malone says that it was from him that Boswell had his account of Garrick s election and that he had it from Reynolds He adds that Johnson warmly supported Garrick being in reality a very tender affectionate man He was merely offended at the actors conceit He continues On the former part of this story it probably was that Hawkins grounded his account that Garrick never was of the Club and that Johnson said he never ought to be of it And thus it is that this stupid biographer and the more flippant and malicious missus Piozzi have miscoloured and misrepresented almost every anecdote that they have pretented to tell of doctor Johnson Prior s Malone p three hundred ninety two Whatever was the slight cast upon Garrick he was nevertheless the sixth new member elected Four as I have shown were added by seventeen sixty eight The next elections were in seventeen seventy three Croker s Boswell

with a striking invocation to the genius of Africa and goes on to give proper instructions for the buying and choice of negroes The poet talks of this ungenerous commerce without the least appearance of detestation but proceeds to direct these purchasers of their fellow creatures with the same indifference that a groom would give instructions for choosing a horse Clear roll their ample eye their

were others whose crime it was rather to neglect Reason than to disobey her and who retreated from the heat and tumult of the way not to the bowers of Intemperance but to the maze of Indolence They had this peculiarity in their condition that they were always in sight of the road of Reason always wishing for her presence and always resolving to return to morrow fourteen seventeen See Appendix F fourteen eighteen It used to be imagined at mister Thrale s when Johnson retired to a window or corner of the room by perceiving his lips in motion and hearing a murmur without audible articulation that he was praying but this was not always the case for I was once perhaps unperceived by him writing at a table so near the place of his retreat that I heard him repeating some lines in an ode of Horace over and over again as if by iteration to exercise the organs of speech and fix the ode in his memory Audiet cives acuisse ferrum Quo graves Persas melius perirent Audiet pugnas Odes i two twenty one Our sons shall hear shall hear to latest times Of Roman arms with civil gore imbrued Which better had the Persian foe subdued Francis It was during the American War BURNEY Boswell in his Hebrides Oct twelve seventeen seventy three records doctor Johnson is often uttering pious ejaculations when he appears to be talking to himself for sometimes his voice grows stronger and parts of the Lord s Prayer are heard In the same passage he describes other particularities and adds in a note It is remarkable that doctor Johnson should have read this account of some of his own peculiar habits without saying anything on the subject which I hoped he would have done See post Dec seventeen eighty four note fourteen nineteen Churchill s Poems i sixteen See ante p three hundred ninety one

Bedford street opposite Henrietta street with an opera glass he watched Johnson approaching I perceived him at a good distance working along with a peculiar solemnity of deportment and an awkward sort of measured step Upon every post as he passed along he deliberately laid his hand but missing one of them when he had got at some distance he seemed suddenly to recollect himself and immediately

Hawkins says that he disliked to be called Doctor as reminding him that he had been a schoolmaster What Hawkins really says Life p four hundred forty six is this His attachment to Oxford prevented Johnson from receiving this honour as it was intended and he never assumed the title which it conferred He was as little pleased to be called Doctor in consequence of it as he was with the title of Domine which a friend of his once incautiously addressed him by He thought it alluded to his having been a schoolmaster It is clear that it in the last line refers only to the title of Domine Murphy Life p ninety eight says that Johnson never assumed the title of Doctor till Oxford conferred on him the degree Boswell states post March thirty one seventeen seventy five note It is remarkable that he never so far as I know assumed his title of Doctor but called himself Mr Johnson In this as I show there Boswell seems to be not perfectly accurate I do not believe Hawkins s assertion that Johnson was little pleased to be called Doctor in consequence of his Dublin degree In Boswell s Hebrides most of which was read by him before he received his Oxford degree he is commonly styled Doctor Boswell says in a note on Aug fifteen seventeen seventy three It was some time before I could bring myself to call him Doctor Had Johnson disliked the title it would have been known to Boswell missus Thrale it is true in her letters to him after he had received both his degrees commonly speaks of him as mister Johnson We may assume that he valued his Oxford degree of M A more highly than the Dublin degree of LL D for in the third edition of the Abridgment of his Dictionary published in seventeen sixty six he is styled Samuel Johnson A M In his Lives of the Poets he calls himself simply Samuel Johnson He had by that time risen above degrees In his Journey to the Hebrides Works ix fourteen after stating that An English or Irish doctorate cannot be obtained by a very young man he continues It

have grown into the world this last century and are as honourable and almost as useful as you landed folks that have always thought yourselves so much above us for your trading forsooth is extended no

p ninety eight says that Johnson s introduction to the Thrales contributed more than anything else to exempt him from the solicitudes of life He continues that he looks back to the share he had in that business with self congratulation since he knows the tenderness which from that time soothed Johnson s cares at Streatham and prolonged a valuable life Johnson wrote to missus Thrale from Lichfield on July twenty seventeen sixty seven I have found nothing that withdraws my affections from the friends whom I left behind or which makes me less desirous of reposing at that place which

constancy of friendship and uniformity of conduct not often to be found was treated for thirty six years with all the kindness that friendship could prompt and all the attention that respect could dictate He continues A coalition like this a state in which the notions of patronage and dependence were overpowered by the perception of reciprocal benefits deserves a particular memorial It was such a coalition which he formed with the Thrales a coalition in which though the benefits which he received were great yet those which he conferred were still greater fourteen forty four On this missus

I am printing my new edition of Shakspeare p three hundred twenty two On Dec twenty four of the same year he says I shall publish about March p three hundred twenty three On March eight seventeen

shall soon receive Shakspeare p three hundred sixty nine In October seventeen sixty five it was published fourteen fifty four According to mister Seward Anec ii four hundred sixty four Adam Smith styled it the most manly piece of criticism that was ever published in any country fourteen fifty five George III at all events did not share in this blind admiration Was there ever cried he such stuff as great part of Shakespeare only one must not say so But what think you What Is there not sad stuff What What Yes indeed I think so Sir though mixed with such excellencies that O cried he laughing good humouredly I know it is not to be said but it s true Only it s Shakespeare and nobody dare abuse him Mme D Arblay s Diary ii three hundred ninety eight fourteen fifty six That Johnson did not slur his work as has been often said we have the best of all evidence his own word I have indeed he writes Works v one hundred fifty two disappointed no opinion more than my own yet I have endeavoured to perform my task with no slight solicitude Not a single passage in the whole work has appeared to me corrupt which I have not attempted to restore or obscure which I have not attempted to illustrate fourteen fifty seven Steevens wrote to Garrick To say the truth the errors of Warburton and Johnson are often more meritorious than such corrections of them as the obscure industry of mister Farmer and myself can furnish Disdaining crutches they have sometimes had a fall but it is my duty to remember that I for my part could not have kept on my legs at all without them Garrick Corres ii one hundred thirty Johnson s preface and notes are distinguished by clearness of thought and diction and by masterly common sense Cambridge Shakespeare i xxxvi fourteen fifty eight Kenrick later on was the gross libeller of Goldsmith and the far grosser libeller of Garrick When proceedings were commenced against him in the Court of King s Bench for the libel on Garrick he made at once the most abject submission and retractation Prior s Goldsmith i two hundred ninety four In the Garrick Carres ii three hundred forty one is a letter addressed to Kenrick in which Garrick says I could have honoured you by giving the satisfaction of a gentleman if you could as Shakespeare says have screwed your courage to the sticking place to have taken it It is endorsed This was not sent to the scoundrel doctor Kenrick It was judged best not to answer any more of doctor Kenrick s notes he had behaved so unworthily fourteen fifty nine Ephraim Chambers in the epitaph that he made for himself ante p two hundred nineteen had described himself as multis pervulgatus paucis notus Gent Mag x two hundred sixty two fourteen sixty See Boswell s Hebrides Oct one seventeen seventy three fourteen sixty one Johnson had joined Voltaire with Dennis and Rymer Dennis and Rymer think Shakespeare s Romans not sufficiently Roman and Voltaire censures his kings as not completely royal Dennis is offended that Menenius a senator of Rome should play the buffoon and Voltaire perhaps thinks decency violated when the Danish usurper is represented as a drunkard But Shakespeare always makes nature predominate over accident His story requires Romans or kings but he thinks only on men He knew that Rome like every other city had men of all dispositions and wanting a buffoon he went into the senate house for that which the senate house would certainly have afforded him He was inclined to show an usurper and a murderer not only odious but despicable he therefore added drunkenness to his other qualities knowing that kings love wine like other men and that wine exerts its natural power upon kings These are the petty cavils of petty minds a poet overlooks the casual distinction of country and condition as a painter satisfied with the figure neglects the drapery Johnson s Works v one hundred nine Johnson had previously attacked Voltaire in his Memoirs of Frederick the Great Ante i four hundred thirty five note two In these Memoirs he writes Voltaire has asserted that a large sum was raised for her the Queen of Hungary s succour by voluntary subscriptions of the English ladies It is the great failing of a strong imagination to catch greedily at wonders He was misinformed and was perhaps unwilling to learn by a second enquiry a truth less splendid and amusing Ib vi four hundred fifty five See post Oct twenty seven seventeen seventy nine fourteen sixty two Voltaire replied in the Dictionnaire Philosophique Works xxxiii five hundred sixty six J ai jete les yeux sur une edition de Shakespeare donnee par le sieur Samuel Johnson J y ai vu qu on y traite de petits esprits les etrangers qui sont etonnes que dans les pieces de ce grand Shakespeare un senateur romain fasse le bouffon et gu un roi paraisse sur le theatre en ivrogne Je ne veux point soupconner le sieur Johnson d etre un mauvais plaisant et d aimer trop le vin mais je trouve un peu extraordinaire qu il compte la bouffonnerie et l ivrognerie parmi les beautes du theatre tragique la raison qu il en donne n est pas moins singuliere Le poete dit il dedaigne ces distinctions accidentelles de conditions et de pays comme un peintre qui content d avoir peint la figure neglige la draperie La comparaison serait plus juste s il parlait d un peintre qui dans un sujet noble introduirait des grotesques ridicules peindrait dans la bataille d Arbelles Alexandre le Grand monte sur un ane et la femme de Darius buvant avec des goujats dans un cabaret Johnson perhaps had this attack in mind when in his Life of Pope Works viii two hundred seventy five he thus wrote of Voltaire He had been entertained by Pope at his table when he talked with so much grossness that missus Pope was driven from the room Pope discovered by a trick that he was a spy for the court and never considered him as a man worthy of confidence fourteen sixty three See post under May eight seventeen eighty one fourteen sixty four See

was buried Johnson composed a prayer as being now about to return to the common comforts and business of the world Pr and Med p thirty eight After his wife s death he had allowed forty days to pass before his return to life See ante p two hundred thirty four note two fourteen seventy three See ante p eighty fourteen seventy four Barnaby Greene had just published The Laureat a Poem in which Johnson is abused It is in the February list of books in the Gent Mag for seventeen sixty five fourteen seventy five Sir Cloudesly Shovel s monument is thus mentioned by Addison in The Spectator No twenty six It has very often given me great offence instead of the brave rough English Admiral which was the distinguishing character of that plain gallant man he is represented on his tomb by the figure of a beau dressed in a long periwig and reposing himself upon velvet cushions under a canopy of state fourteen seventy six That live long wig which Gorgon s self might own Eternal buckle takes in Parian stone Pope s Moral Essays iii two hundred ninety five fourteen seventy seven Milton s Epigram is in his Sylvarum Liber and is entitled In Effigiei ejus Sculptorem fourteen seventy eight
