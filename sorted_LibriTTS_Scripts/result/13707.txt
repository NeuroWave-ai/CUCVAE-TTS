heavier wrongs than those threatened ones which brought on the Revolution James II the bigoted successor of Charles the Voluptuous had annulled the charters of all the colonies and sent a harsh and unprincipled soldier to take away our liberties and endanger our religion The administration of Sir Edmund Andros lacked scarcely a single characteristic of tyranny a governor and council holding office from the king and wholly independent of the country laws made and taxes levied without concurrence of the people immediate or by their representatives the rights of private citizens violated and the titles of all landed property declared void the voice of complaint stifled by restrictions on the press and finally disaffection overawed by the first band of mercenary troops that ever marched on our free soil For two years our ancestors were kept in sullen submission by that filial love which had invariably secured their allegiance to the mother country whether its head chanced to be a Parliament Protector or popish monarch Till these evil times however such allegiance had been merely nominal and the colonists had ruled themselves enjoying far more freedom than is even yet the privilege of the native subjects of Great Britain At length a rumor reached our shores that the prince of Orange had ventured on an enterprise the success of which would be the triumph of civil and religious rights and the salvation of New England It was but a doubtful whisper it might be false or the attempt might fail and in either case the man that stirred against King James would lose his head Still the intelligence produced a marked effect The people smiled mysteriously in the streets and threw bold glances at their oppressors while far and wide there was a subdued and silent agitation as if the slightest signal would rouse the whole land from its sluggish despondency Aware of their danger the rulers resolved to avert it by an imposing display of strength and perhaps to confirm their despotism by yet harsher measures One afternoon in April sixteen eighty nine Sir Edmund Andros and his favorite councillors being warm with wine assembled the red coats of the governor s guard and made their appearance in the streets of Boston The sun was near setting when the march commenced The roll of the drum at that unquiet crisis seemed to go through the streets less as the martial music of the soldiers than as a muster call to the inhabitants themselves A multitude by various avenues assembled in King street which was destined to be the scene nearly a century afterward of another encounter between the troops of Britain and a people struggling against her tyranny Though more than sixty years had elapsed since the Pilgrims came this crowd of their descendants still showed the strong and sombre features of their character perhaps more strikingly in such a stern emergency than on happier occasions There was the sober garb the general severity of mien the gloomy but undismayed expression the scriptural forms of speech and the confidence in Heaven s blessing on a righteous cause which would have marked a band of the original Puritans when threatened by some peril of the wilderness Indeed it was not yet time for the old spirit to be extinct since there were men in the street that day who had worshipped there beneath the trees before a house was reared to the God for whom they had become exiles Old soldiers of the Parliament were here too smiling grimly at the thought that their aged arms might strike another blow against the house of Stuart Here also were the veterans of King Philip s war who had burned villages and slaughtered young and old with pious fierceness while the godly souls throughout the land were helping them with prayer Several ministers were scattered among the crowd which unlike all other mobs regarded them with such reverence as if there were sanctity in their very garments These holy men exerted their influence to quiet the people but not to disperse them Meantime the purpose of the governor in disturbing the peace of the town at a period when the slightest commotion might throw the country into a ferment was almost the Universal subject of inquiry and variously explained Satan will strike his master stroke presently cried some because he knoweth that his time is short All our godly pastors are to be dragged to prison We shall see them at a Smithfield fire in King street Hereupon the people of each parish gathered closer round their minister who looked calmly upward and assumed a more apostolic dignity as well befitted a candidate for the highest honor of his profession a crown of martyrdom It was actually fancied at that period that New England might have a John Rogers of her own to take the place of that worthy in the Primer The pope of Rome has given orders for a new saint Bartholomew cried others We are to be massacred man and male child Neither was this rumor wholly discredited although the wiser class believed the governor s object somewhat less atrocious His predecessor under the old charter Bradstreet a venerable companion of the first settlers was known to be in town There were grounds for conjecturing that Sir Edmund Andros intended at once to strike terror by a parade of military force and to confound the opposite faction by possessing himself of their chief Stand firm for the old charter governor shouted the crowd seizing upon the idea the good old Governor Bradstreet While this cry was at the loudest the people were surprised by the well known figure of Governor Bradstreet himself a patriarch of nearly ninety who appeared on the elevated steps of a door and with characteristic mildness besought them to submit to the constituted authorities My children concluded this venerable person do nothing rashly Cry not aloud but pray for the welfare of New England and expect patiently what the Lord will do in this matter The event was soon to be decided All this time the roll of the drum had been approaching through Cornhill louder and deeper till with reverberations from house to house and the regular tramp of martial footsteps it burst into the street A double rank of soldiers made their appearance occupying the whole breadth of the passage with shouldered matchlocks and matches burning so as to present a row of fires in the dusk Their steady march was like the progress of a machine that would roll irresistibly over everything in its way Next moving slowly with a confused clatter of hoofs on the pavement rode a party of mounted gentlemen the central figure being Sir Edmund Andros elderly but erect and soldier like Those around him were his favorite councillors and the bitterest foes of New England At his right hand rode Edward Randolph our arch enemy that blasted wretch as Cotton Mather calls him who achieved the downfall of our ancient government and was followed with a sensible curse through life and to his grave On the other side was Bullivant scattering jests and mockery as he rode along Dudley came behind with a downcast look dreading as well he might to meet the indignant gaze of the people who beheld him their only countryman by birth among the oppressors of his native land The captain of a frigate in the harbor and two or three civil officers under the Crown were also there But the figure which most attracted the public eye and stirred up the deepest feeling was the Episcopal clergyman of King s Chapel riding haughtily among the magistrates in his priestly vestments the fitting representative of prelacy and persecution the union of Church and State and all those abominations which had driven the Puritans to the wilderness Another guard of soldiers in double rank brought up the rear The whole scene was a picture of the condition of New England and its moral the deformity of any government that does not grow out of the nature of things and the character of the people on one side the religious multitude with their sad visages and dark attire and on the other the group of despotic rulers with the high churchman in the midst and here and there a crucifix at their bosoms all magnificently clad flushed with wine proud of unjust authority and scoffing at the universal groan And the mercenary soldiers waiting but the word to deluge the street with blood showed the only means by which obedience could be secured O Lord of hosts cried a voice among the crowd provide a champion for thy people This ejaculation was loudly uttered and served as a herald s cry to introduce a remarkable personage The crowd had rolled back and were now huddled together nearly at the extremity of the street while the soldiers had advanced no more than a third of its length The intervening space was empty a paved solitude between lofty edifices which threw almost a twilight shadow over it Suddenly there was seen the figure of an ancient man who seemed to have emerged from among the people and was walking by himself along the centre of the street to confront the armed band He wore the old Puritan dress a dark cloak and a steeple crowned hat in the fashion of at least fifty years before with a heavy sword upon his thigh but a staff in his hand to assist the tremulous gait of age When at some distance from the multitude the old man turned slowly round displaying a face of antique majesty rendered doubly venerable by the hoary beard that descended on his breast He made a gesture at once of encouragement and warning then turned again and resumed his way Who is this gray patriarch asked the young men of their sires Who is this venerable brother asked the old men among themselves But none could make reply The fathers of the people those of fourscore years and upward were disturbed deeming it strange that they should forget one of such evident authority whom they must have known in their early days the associate of Winthrop and all the old councillors giving laws and making prayers and leading them against the savage The elderly men ought to have remembered him too with locks as gray in their youth as their own were now And the young How could he have passed so utterly from their memories that hoary sire the relic of long departed times whose awful benediction had surely been bestowed on their uncovered heads in childhood Whence did he come What is his purpose Who can this old man be whispered the wondering crowd Meanwhile the venerable stranger staff in hand was pursuing his solitary walk along the centre of the street As he drew near the advancing soldiers and as the roll of their drum came full upon his ear the old man raised himself to a loftier mien while the decrepitude of age seemed to fall from his shoulders leaving him in gray but unbroken dignity Now he marched onward with a warrior s step keeping time to the military music Thus the aged form advanced on one side and the whole parade of soldiers and magistrates on the other till when scarcely twenty yards remained between the old man grasped his staff by the middle and held it before him like a leader s truncheon Stand cried he The eye the face and attitude of command the solemn yet warlike peal of that voice fit either to rule a host in the battle field or be raised to God in prayer were irresistible At the old man s word and outstretched arm the roll of the drum was hushed at once and the advancing line stood still A tremulous enthusiasm seized upon the multitude That stately form combining the leader and the saint so gray so dimly seen in such an ancient garb could only belong to some old champion of the righteous cause whom the oppressor s drum had summoned from his grave They raised a shout of awe and exultation and looked for the deliverance of New England The governor and the gentlemen of his party perceiving themselves brought to an unexpected stand rode hastily forward as if they would have pressed their snorting and affrighted horses right against the hoary apparition He however blenched not a step but glancing his severe eye round the group which half encompassed him at last bent it sternly on Sir Edmund Andros One would have thought that the dark old man was chief ruler there and that the governor and council with soldiers at their back representing the whole power and authority of the Crown had no alternative but obedience What does this old fellow here cried Edward Randolph fiercely On Sir Edmund Bid the soldiers forward and give the dotard the same choice that you give all his countrymen to stand aside or be trampled on Nay nay Let us show respect to the good grandsire said Bullivant laughing See you not he is some old round headed dignitary who hath lain asleep these thirty years and knows nothing of the change of times Doubtless he thinks to put us down with a proclamation in Old Noll s name Are you mad old man demanded Sir Edmund Andros in loud and harsh tones How dare you stay the march of King James s governor I have stayed the march of a king himself ere now replied the gray figure with stern composure I am here Sir Governor because the cry of an oppressed people hath disturbed me in my secret place and beseeching this favor earnestly of the Lord it was vouchsafed me to appear once again on earth in the good old cause of his saints And what speak ye of James There is no longer a popish tyrant on the throne of England and by to morrow noon his name shall be a by word in this very street where ye would make it a word of terror Back thou that wast a governor back With this night thy power is ended To morrow the prison Back lest I foretell the scaffold The people had been drawing nearer and nearer and drinking in the words of their champion who spoke in accents long disused like one unaccustomed to converse except with the dead of many years ago But his voice stirred their souls They confronted the soldiers not wholly without arms and ready to convert the very stones of the street into deadly weapons Sir Edmund Andros looked at the old man then he cast his hard and cruel eye over the multitude and beheld them burning with that lurid wrath so difficult to kindle or to quench and again he fixed his gaze on the aged form which stood obscurely in an open space where neither friend nor foe had thrust himself What were his thoughts he uttered no word which might discover but whether the oppressor were overawed by the Gray Champion s look or perceived his peril in the threatening attitude of the people it is certain that he gave back and ordered his soldiers to commence a slow and guarded retreat Before another sunset the governor and all that rode so proudly with him were prisoners and long ere it was known that James had abdicated King William was proclaimed throughout New England But where was the Gray Champion Some reported that when the troops had gone from King street and the people were thronging tumultuously in their rear Bradstreet the aged governor was seen to embrace a form more aged than his own Others soberly affirmed that while they marvelled at the venerable grandeur of his aspect the old man had faded from their eyes melting slowly into the hues of twilight till where he stood there was an empty space But all agreed that the hoary shape was gone The men of that generation watched for his reappearance in sunshine and in twilight but never saw him more nor knew when his funeral passed nor where his gravestone was And who was the Gray Champion Perhaps his name might be found in the records of that stern court of justice which passed a sentence too mighty for the age but glorious in all after times for its humbling lesson to the monarch and its high example to the subject I have heard that whenever the descendants of the Puritans are to show the spirit of their sires the old man appears again When eighty years had passed he walked once more in King street Five years later in the twilight of an April morning he stood on the green beside the meeting house at Lexington where now the obelisk of granite with a slab of slate inlaid commemorates the first fallen of the Revolution And when our fathers were toiling at the breastwork on Bunker s Hill all through that night the old warrior walked his rounds Long long may it be ere he comes again His hour is one of darkness and adversity and peril But should domestic tyranny oppress us or the invader s step pollute our soil still may the Gray Champion come for he is the type of New England s hereditary spirit and his shadowy march on the eve of danger must ever be the pledge that New England s sons will vindicate their ancestry SUNDAY AT HOME Every Sabbath morning in the summer time I thrust back the curtain to watch the sunrise stealing down a steeple which stands opposite my chamber window First the weathercock begins to flash then a fainter lustre gives the spire an airy aspect next it encroaches on the tower and causes the index of the dial to glisten like gold as it points to the gilded figure of the hour Now the loftiest window gleams and now the lower The carved framework of the portal is marked strongly out At length the morning glory in its descent from heaven comes down the stone steps one by one and there stands the steeple glowing with fresh radiance while the shades of twilight still hide themselves among the nooks of the adjacent buildings Methinks though the same sun brightens it every fair morning yet the steeple has a peculiar robe of brightness for the Sabbath By dwelling near a church a person soon contracts an attachment for the edifice We naturally personify it and conceive its massy walls and its dim emptiness to be instinct with a calm and meditative and somewhat melancholy spirit But the steeple stands foremost in our thoughts as well as locally It impresses us as a giant with a mind comprehensive and discriminating enough to care for the great and small concerns of all the town Hourly while it speaks a moral to the few that think it reminds thousands of busy individuals of their separate and most secret affairs It is the steeple too that flings abroad the hurried and irregular accents of general alarm neither have gladness and festivity found a better utterance than by its tongue and when the dead are slowly passing to their home the steeple has a melancholy voice to bid them welcome Yet in spite of this connection with human interests what a moral loneliness on week days broods round about its stately height It has no kindred with the houses above which it towers it looks down into the narrow thoroughfare the lonelier because the crowd are elbowing their passage at its base A glance at the body of the church deepens this impression Within by the light of distant windows amid refracted shadows we discern the vacant pews and empty galleries the silent organ the voiceless pulpit and the clock which tells to solitude how time is passing Time where man lives not what is it but eternity And in the church we might suppose are garnered up throughout the week all thoughts and feelings that have reference to eternity until the holy day comes round again to let them forth Might not then its more appropriate site be in the outskirts of the town with space for old trees to wave around it and throw their solemn shadows over a quiet green We will say more of this hereafter But on the Sabbath I watch the earliest sunshine and fancy that a holier brightness marks the day when there shall be no buzz of voices on the Exchange nor traffic in the shops nor crowd nor business anywhere but at church Many have fancied so For my own part whether I see it scattered down among tangled woods or beaming broad across the fields or hemmed in between brick buildings or tracing out the figure of the casement on my chamber floor still I recognize the Sabbath sunshine And ever let me recognize it Some illusions and this among them are the shadows of great truths Doubts may flit around me or seem to close their evil wings and settle down but so long as I imagine that the earth is hallowed and the light of heaven retains its sanctity on the Sabbath while that blessed sunshine lives within me never can my soul have lost the instinct of its faith If it have gone astray it will return again I love to spend such pleasant Sabbaths from morning till night behind the curtain of my open window Are they spent amiss Every spot so near the church as to be visited by the circling shadow of the steeple should be deemed consecrated ground to day With stronger truth be it said that a devout heart may consecrate a den of thieves as an evil one may convert a temple to the same My heart perhaps has no such holy nor I would fain trust such impious potency It must suffice that though my form be absent my inner man goes constantly to church while many whose bodily presence fills the accustomed seats have left their souls at home But I am there even before my friend the sexton At length he comes a man of kindly but sombre aspect in dark gray clothes and hair of the same mixture He comes and applies his key to the wide portal Now my thoughts may go in among the dusty pews or ascend the pulpit without sacrilege but soon come forth again to enjoy the music of the bell How glad yet solemn too All the steeples in town are talking together aloft in the sunny air and rejoicing among themselves while their spires point heavenward Meantime here are the children assembling to the Sabbath school which is kept somewhere within the church Often while looking at the arched portal I have been gladdened by the sight of a score of these little girls and boys in pink blue yellow and crimson frocks bursting suddenly forth into the sunshine like a swarm of gay butterflies that had been shut up in the solemn gloom Or I might compare them to cherubs haunting that holy place About a quarter of an hour before the second ringing of the bell individuals of the congregation begin to appear The earliest is invariably an old woman in black whose bent frame and rounded shoulders are evidently laden with some heavy affliction which she is eager to rest upon the altar Would that the Sabbath came twice as often for the sake of that sorrowful old soul There is an elderly man also who arrives in good season and leans against the corner of the tower just within the line of its shadow looking downward with a darksome brow I sometimes fancy that the old woman is the happier of the two After these others drop in singly and by twos and threes either disappearing through the doorway or taking their stand in its vicinity At last and always with an unexpected sensation the bell turns in the steeple overhead and throws out an irregular clangor jarring the tower to its foundation As if there were magic in the sound the sidewalks of the street both up and down along are immediately thronged with two long lines of people all converging hitherward and streaming into the church Perhaps the far off roar of a coach draws nearer a deeper thunder by its contrast with the surrounding stillness until it sets down the wealthy worshippers at the portal among their humblest brethren Beyond that entrance in theory at least there are no distinctions of earthly rank nor indeed by the goodly apparel which is flaunting in the sun would there seem to be such on the hither side Those pretty girls Why will they disturb my pious meditations Of all days in the week they should strive to look least fascinating on the Sabbath instead of heightening their mortal loveliness as if to rival the blessed angels and keep our thoughts from heaven Were I the minister himself I must needs look One girl is white muslin from the waist upward and black silk downward to her slippers a second blushes from top knot to shoe tie one universal scarlet another shines of a pervading yellow as if she had made a garment of the sunshine The greater part however have adopted a milder cheerfulness of hue Their veils especially when the wind raises them give a lightness to the general effect and make them appear like airy phantoms as they flit up the steps and vanish into the sombre doorway Nearly all though it is very strange that I should know it wear white stockings white as snow and neat slippers laced crosswise with black ribbon pretty high above the ankles A white stocking is infinitely more effective than a black one Here comes the clergyman slow and solemn in severe simplicity needing no black silk gown to denote his office His aspect claims my reverence but cannot win my love Were I to picture Saint Peter keeping fast the gate of Heaven and frowning more stern than pitiful on the wretched applicants that face should be my study By middle age or sooner the creed has generally wrought upon the heart or been attempered by it As the minister passes into the church the bell holds its iron tongue and all the low murmur of the congregation dies away The gray sexton looks up and down the street and then at my window curtain where through the small peephole I half fancy that he has caught my eye Now every loiterer has gone in and the street lies asleep in the quiet sun while a feeling of loneliness comes over me and brings also an uneasy sense of neglected privileges and duties Oh I ought to have gone to church The bustle of the rising congregation reaches my ears They are standing up to pray Could I bring my heart into unison with those who are praying in yonder church and lift it heavenward with a fervor of supplication but no distinct request would not that be the safest kind of prayer Lord look down upon me in mercy With that sentiment gushing from my soul might I not leave all the rest to him Hark the hymn This at least is a portion of the service which I can enjoy better than if I sat within the walls where the full choir and the massive melody of the organ would fall with a weight upon me At this distance it thrills through my frame and plays upon my heart strings with a pleasure both of the sense and spirit Heaven be praised I know nothing of music as a science and the most elaborate harmonies if they please me please as simply as a nurse s lullaby The strain has ceased but prolongs itself in my mind with fanciful echoes till I start from my reverie and find that the sermon has commenced It is my misfortune seldom to fructify in a regular way by any but printed sermons The first strong idea which the preacher utters gives birth to a train of thought and leads me onward step by step quite out of hearing of the good man s voice unless he be indeed a son of thunder At my open window catching now and then a sentence of the parson s saw I am as well situated as at the foot of the pulpit stairs The broken and scattered fragments of this one discourse will be the texts of many sermons preached by those colleague pastors colleagues but often disputants my Mind and Heart The former pretends to be a scholar and perplexes me with doctrinal points the latter takes me on the score of feeling and both like several other preachers spend their strength to very little purpose I their sole auditor cannot always understand them Suppose that a few hours have passed and behold me still behind my curtain just before the close of the afternoon service The hour hand on the dial has passed beyond four o clock The declining sun is hidden behind the steeple and throws its shadow straight across the street so that my chamber is darkened as with a cloud Around the church door all is solitude and an impenetrable obscurity beyond the threshold A commotion is heard The seats are slammed down and the pew doors thrown back a multitude of feet are trampling along the unseen aisles and the congregation bursts suddenly through the portal Foremost scampers a rabble of boys behind whom moves a dense and dark phalanx of grown men and lastly a crowd of females with young children and a few scattered husbands This instantaneous outbreak of life into loneliness is one of the pleasantest scenes of the day Some of the good people are rubbing their eyes thereby intimating that they have been wrapped as it were in a sort of holy trance by the fervor of their devotion There is a young man a third rate coxcomb whose first care is always to flourish a white handkerchief and brush the seat of a tight pair of black silk pantaloons which shine as if varnished They must have been made of the stuff called everlasting or perhaps of the same piece as Christian s garments in the Pilgrim s Progress for he put them on two summers ago and has not yet worn the gloss off I have taken a great liking to those black silk pantaloons But now with nods and greetings among friends each matron takes her husband s arm and paces gravely homeward while the girls also flutter away after arranging sunset walks with their favored bachelors The Sabbath eve is the eve of love At length the whole congregation is dispersed No here with faces as glossy as black satin come two sable ladies and a sable gentleman and close in their rear the minister who softens his severe visage and bestows a kind word on each Poor souls To them the most captivating picture of bliss in heaven is There we shall be white All is solitude again But hark A broken warbling of voices and now attuning its grandeur to their sweetness a stately peal of the organ Who are the choristers Let me dream that the angels who came down from heaven this blessed morn to blend themselves with the worship of the truly good are playing and singing their farewell to the earth On the wings of that rich melody they were borne upward This gentle reader is merely a flight of poetry A few of the singing men and singing women had lingered behind their fellows and raised their voices fitfully and blew a careless note upon the organ Yet it lifted my soul higher than all their former strains They are gone the sons and daughters of Music and the gray sexton is just closing the portal For six days more there will be no face of man in the pews and aisles and galleries nor a voice in the pulpit nor music in the choir Was it worth while to rear this massive edifice to be a desert in the heart of the town and populous only for a few hours of each seventh day Oh but the church is a symbol of religion May its site which was consecrated on the day when the first tree was felled be kept holy for ever a spot of solitude and peace amid the trouble and vanity of our week day world There is a moral and a religion too even in the silent walls And may the steeple still point heavenward and be decked with the hallowed sunshine of the Sabbath morn THE WEDDING KNELL There is a certain church in the city of New York which I have always regarded with peculiar interest on account of a marriage there solemnized under very singular circumstances in my grandmother s girlhood That venerable lady chanced to be a spectator of the scene and ever after made it her favorite narrative Whether the edifice now standing on the same site be the identical one to which she referred I am not antiquarian enough to know nor would it be worth while to correct myself perhaps of an agreeable error by reading the date of its erection on the tablet over the door It is a stately church surrounded by an enclosure of the loveliest green within which appear urns pillars obelisks and other forms of monumental marble the tributes of private affection or more splendid memorials of historic dust With such a place though the tumult of the city rolls beneath its tower one would be willing to connect some legendary interest The marriage might be considered as the result of an early engagement though there had been two intermediate weddings on the lady s part and forty years of celibacy on that of the gentleman At sixty five mister Ellenwood was a shy but not quite a secluded man selfish like all men who brood over their own hearts yet manifesting on rare occasions a vein of generous sentiment a scholar throughout life though always an indolent one because his studies had no definite object either of public advantage or personal ambition a gentleman high bred and fastidiously delicate yet sometimes requiring a considerable relaxation in his behalf of the common rules of society In truth there were so many anomalies in his character and though shrinking with diseased sensibility from public notice it had been his fatality so often to become the topic of the day by some wild eccentricity of conduct that people searched his lineage for a hereditary taint of insanity But there was no need of this His caprices had their origin in a mind that lacked the support of an engrossing purpose and in feelings that preyed upon themselves for want of other food If he were mad it was the consequence and not the cause of an aimless and abortive life The widow was as complete a contrast to her third bridegroom in everything but age as can well be conceived Compelled to relinquish her first engagement she had been united to a man of twice her own years to whom she became an exemplary wife and by whose death she was left in possession of a splendid fortune A Southern gentleman considerably younger than herself succeeded to her hand and carried her to Charleston where after many uncomfortable years she found herself again a widow It would have been singular if any uncommon delicacy of feeling had survived through such a life as missus Dabney s it could not but be crushed and killed by her early disappointment the cold duty of her first marriage the dislocation of the heart s principles consequent on a second union and the unkindness of her Southern husband which had inevitably driven her to connect the idea of his death with that of her comfort To be brief she was that wisest but unloveliest variety of woman a philosopher bearing troubles of the heart with equanimity dispensing with all that should have been her happiness and making the best of what remained Sage in most matters the widow was perhaps the more amiable for the one frailty that made her ridiculous Being childless she could not remain beautiful by proxy in the person of a daughter she therefore refused to grow old and ugly on any consideration she struggled with Time and held fast her roses in spite of him till the venerable thief appeared to have relinquished the spoil as not worth the trouble of acquiring it The approaching marriage of this woman of the world with such an unworldly man as mister Ellenwood was announced soon after missus Dabney s return to her native city Superficial observers and deeper ones seemed to concur in supposing that the lady must have borne no inactive part in arranging the affair there were considerations of expediency which she would be far more likely to appreciate than mister Ellenwood and there was just the specious phantom of sentiment and romance in this late union of two early lovers which sometimes makes a fool of a woman who has lost her true feelings among the accidents of life All the wonder was how the gentleman with his lack of worldly wisdom and agonizing consciousness of ridicule could have been induced to take a measure at once so prudent and so laughable But while people talked the wedding day arrived The ceremony was to be solemnized according to the Episcopalian forms and in open church with a degree of publicity that attracted many spectators who occupied the front seats of the galleries and the pews near the altar and along the broad aisle It had been arranged or possibly it was the custom of the day that the parties should proceed separately to church By some accident the bridegroom was a little less punctual than the widow and her bridal attendants with whose arrival after this tedious but necessary preface the action of our tale may be said to commence The clumsy wheels of several old fashioned coaches were heard and the gentlemen and ladies composing the bridal party came through the church door with the sudden and gladsome effect of a burst of sunshine The whole group except the principal figure was made up of youth and gayety As they streamed up the broad aisle while the pews and pillars seemed to brighten on either side their steps were as buoyant as if they mistook the church for a ball room and were ready to dance hand in hand to the altar So brilliant was the spectacle that few took notice of a singular phenomenon that had marked its entrance At the moment when the bride s foot touched the threshold the bell swung heavily in the tower above her and sent forth its deepest knell The vibrations died away and returned with prolonged solemnity as she entered the body of the church Good heavens What an omen whispered a young lady to her lover On my honor replied the gentleman I believe the bell has the good taste to toll of its own accord What has she to do with weddings If you dearest Julia were approaching the altar the bell would ring out its merriest peal It has only a funeral knell for her The bride and most of her company had been too much occupied with the bustle of entrance to hear the first boding stroke of the bell or at least to reflect on the singularity of such a welcome to the altar They therefore continued to advance with undiminished gayety The gorgeous dresses of the time the crimson velvet coats the gold laced hats the hoop petticoats the silk satin brocade and embroidery the buckles canes and swords all displayed to the best advantage on persons suited to such finery made the group appear more like a bright colored picture than anything real But by what perversity of taste had the artist represented his principal figure as so wrinkled and decayed while yet he had decked her out in the brightest splendor of attire as if the loveliest maiden had suddenly withered into age and become a moral to the beautiful around her On they went however and had glittered along about a third of the aisle when another stroke of the bell seemed to fill the church with a visible gloom dimming and obscuring the bright pageant till it shone forth again as from a mist This time the party wavered stopped and huddled closer together while a slight scream was heard from some of the ladies and a confused whispering among the gentlemen Thus tossing to and fro they might have been fancifully compared to a splendid bunch of flowers suddenly shaken by a puff of wind which threatened to scatter the leaves of an old brown withered rose on the same stalk with two dewy buds such being the emblem of the widow between her fair young bridemaids But her heroism was admirable She had started with an irrepressible shudder as if the stroke of the bell had fallen directly on her heart then recovering herself while her attendants were yet in dismay she took the lead and paced calmly up the aisle The bell continued to swing strike and vibrate with the same doleful regularity as when a corpse is on its way to the tomb My young friends here have their nerves a little shaken said the widow with a smile to the clergyman at the altar But so many weddings have been ushered in with the merriest peal of the bells and yet turned out unhappily that I shall hope for better fortune under such different auspices Madam answered the rector in great perplexity this strange occurrence brings to my mind a marriage sermon of the famous Bishop Taylor wherein he mingles so many thoughts of mortality and future woe that to speak somewhat after his own rich style he seems to hang the bridal chamber in black and cut the wedding garment out of a coffin pall And it has been the custom of divers nations to infuse something of sadness into their marriage ceremonies so to keep death in mind while contracting that engagement which is life s chiefest business Thus we may draw a sad but profitable moral from this funeral knell But though the clergyman might have given his moral even a keener point he did not fail to despatch an attendant to inquire into the mystery and stop those sounds so dismally appropriate to such a marriage A brief space elapsed during which the silence was broken only by whispers and a few suppressed titterings among the wedding party and the spectators who after the first shock were disposed to draw an ill natured merriment from the affair The young have less charity for aged follies than the old for those of youth The widow s glance was observed to wander for an instant toward a window of the church as if searching for the time worn marble that she had dedicated to her first husband then her eyelids dropped over their faded orbs and her thoughts were drawn irresistibly to another grave Two buried men with a voice at her ear and a cry afar off were calling her to lie down beside them Perhaps with momentary truth of feeling she thought how much happier had been her fate if after years of bliss the bell were now tolling for her funeral and she were followed to the grave by the old affection of her earliest lover long her husband But why had she returned to him when their cold hearts shrank from each other s embrace Still the death bell tolled so mournfully that the sunshine seemed to fade in the air A whisper communicated from those who stood nearest the windows now spread through the church a hearse with a train of several coaches was creeping along the street conveying some dead man to the churchyard while the bride awaited a living one at the altar Immediately after the footsteps of the bridegroom and his friends were heard at the door The widow looked down the aisle and clenched the arm of one of her bridemaids in her bony hand with such unconscious violence that the fair girl trembled You frighten me my dear madam cried she For heaven s sake what is the matter Nothing my dear nothing said the widow then whispering close to her ear There is a foolish fancy that I cannot get rid of I am expecting my bridegroom to come into the church with my two first husbands for groomsmen Look look screamed the bridemaid What is here The funeral As she spoke a dark procession paced into the church First came an old man and woman like chief mourners at a funeral attired from head to foot in the deepest black all but their pale features and hoary hair he leaning on a staff and supporting her decrepit form with his nerveless arm Behind appeared another and another pair as aged as black and mournful as the first As they drew near the widow recognized in every face some trait of former friends long forgotten but now returning as if from their old graves to warn her to prepare a shroud or with purpose almost as unwelcome to exhibit their wrinkles and infirmity and claim her as their companion by the tokens of her own decay Many a merry night had she danced with them in youth and now in joyless age she felt that some withered partner should request her hand and all unite in a dance of death to the music of the funeral bell While these aged mourners were passing up the aisle it was observed that from pew to pew the spectators shuddered with irrepressible awe as some object hitherto concealed by the intervening figures came full in sight Many turned away their faces others kept a fixed and rigid stare and a young girl giggled hysterically and fainted with the laughter on her lips When the spectral procession approached the altar each couple separated and slowly diverged till in the centre appeared a form that had been worthily ushered in with all this gloomy pomp the death knell and the funeral It was the bridegroom in his shroud No garb but that of the grave could have befitted such a death like aspect The eyes indeed had the wild gleam of a sepulchral lamp all else was fixed in the stern calmness which old men wear in the coffin The corpse stood motionless but addressed the widow in accents that seemed to melt into the clang of the bell which fell heavily on the air while he spoke Come my bride said those pale lips The hearse is ready the sexton stands waiting for us at the door of the tomb Let us be married and then to our coffins How shall the widow s horror be represented It gave her the ghastliness of a dead man s bride Her youthful friends stood apart shuddering at the mourners the shrouded bridegroom and herself the whole scene expressed by the strongest imagery the vain struggle of the gilded vanities of this world when opposed to age infirmity sorrow and death The awestruck silence was first broken by the clergyman mister Ellenwood said he soothingly yet with somewhat of authority you are not well Your mind has been agitated by the unusual circumstances in which you are placed The ceremony must be deferred As an old friend let me entreat you to return home Home yes but not without my bride answered he in the same hollow accents You deem this mockery perhaps madness Had I bedizened my aged and broken frame with scarlet and embroidery had I forced my withered lips to smile at my dead heart that might have been mockery or madness but now let young and old declare which of us has come hither without a wedding garment the bridegroom or the bride He stepped forward at a ghostly pace and stood beside the widow contrasting the awful simplicity of his shroud with the glare and glitter in which she had arrayed herself for this unhappy scene None that beheld them could deny the terrible strength of the moral which his disordered intellect had contrived to draw Cruel cruel groaned the heartstricken bride Cruel repeated he then losing his deathlike composure in a wild bitterness Heaven judge which of us has been cruel to the other In youth you deprived me of my happiness my hopes my aims you took away all the substance of my life and made it a dream without reality enough even to grieve at with only a pervading gloom through which I walked wearily and cared not whither But after forty years when I have built my tomb and would not give up the thought of resting there no not for such a life as we once pictured you call me to the altar At your summons I am here But other husbands have enjoyed your youth your beauty your warmth of heart and all that could be termed your life What is there for me but your decay and death And therefore I have bidden these funeral friends and bespoken the sexton s deepest knell and am come in my shroud to wed you as with a burial service that we may join our hands at the door of the sepulchre and enter it together It was not frenzy it was not merely the drunkenness of strong emotion in a heart unused to it that now wrought upon the bride The stern lesson of the day had done its work her worldliness was gone She seized the bridegroom s hand Yes cried she let us wed even at the door of the sepulchre My life is gone in vanity and emptiness but at its close there is one true feeling It has made me what I was in youth it makes me worthy of you Time is no more for both of us Let us wed for eternity With a long and deep regard the bridegroom looked into her eyes while a tear was gathering in his own How strange that gush of human feeling from the frozen bosom of a corpse He wiped away the tear even with his shroud Beloved of my youth said he I have been wild The despair of my whole lifetime had returned at once and maddened me Forgive and be forgiven Yes it is evening with us now and we have realized none of our morning dreams of happiness But let us join our hands before the altar as lovers whom adverse circumstances have separated through life yet who meet again as they are leaving it and find their earthly affection changed into something holy as religion And what is time to the married of eternity Amid the tears of many and a swell of exalted sentiment in those who felt aright was solemnized the union of two immortal souls The train of withered mourners the hoary bridegroom in his shroud the pale features of the aged bride and the death bell tolling through the whole till its deep voice overpowered the marriage words all marked the funeral of earthly hopes But as the ceremony proceeded the organ as if stirred by the sympathies of this impressive scene poured forth an anthem first mingling with the dismal knell then rising to a loftier strain till the soul looked down upon its woe And when the awful rite was finished and with cold hand in cold hand the married of eternity withdrew the organ s peal of solemn triumph drowned the wedding knell THE MINISTER S BLACK VEIL A PARABLE one The sexton stood in the porch of Milford meeting house pulling lustily at the bell rope The old people of the village came stooping along the street Children with bright faces tripped merrily beside their parents or mimicked a graver gait in the conscious dignity of their Sunday clothes Spruce bachelors looked sidelong at the pretty maidens and fancied that the Sabbath sunshine made them prettier than on week days When the throng had mostly streamed into the porch the sexton began to toll the bell keeping his eye on the Reverend mister Hooper s door The first glimpse of the clergyman s figure was the signal for the bell to cease its summons Footnote one Another clergyman in New England mister Joseph Moody of York Maine who died about eighty years since made himself remarkable by the same eccentricity that is here related of the Reverend mister Hooper In his case however the symbol had a different import In early life he had accidentally killed a beloved friend and from that day till the hour of his own death he hid his face from men But what has good Parson Hooper got upon his face cried the sexton in astonishment All within hearing immediately turned about and beheld the semblance of mister Hooper pacing slowly his meditative way toward the meeting house With one accord they started expressing more wonder than if some strange minister were coming to dust the cushions of mister Hooper s pulpit Are you sure it is our parson inquired Goodman Gray of the sexton Of a certainty it is good mister Hooper replied the sexton He was to have exchanged pulpits with Parson Shute of Westbury but Parson Shute sent to excuse himself yesterday being to preach a funeral sermon The cause of so much amazement may appear sufficiently slight mister Hooper a gentlemanly person of about thirty though still a bachelor was dressed with due clerical neatness as if a careful wife had starched his band and brushed the weekly dust from his Sunday s garb There was but one thing remarkable in his appearance Swathed about his forehead and hanging down over his face so low as to be shaken by his breath mister Hooper had on a black veil On a nearer view it seemed to consist of two folds of crape which entirely concealed his features except the mouth and chin but probably did not intercept his sight further than to give a darkened aspect to all living and inanimate things With this gloomy shade before him good mister Hooper walked onward at a slow and quiet pace stooping somewhat and looking on the ground as is customary with abstracted men yet nodding kindly to those of his parishioners who still waited on the meeting house steps But so wonder struck were they that his greeting hardly met with a return I can t really feel as if good mister Hooper s face was behind that piece of crape said the sexton I don t like it muttered an old woman as she hobbled into the meeting house He has changed himself into something awful only by hiding his face Our parson has gone mad cried Goodman Gray following him across the threshold A rumor of some unaccountable phenomenon had preceded mister Hooper into the meeting house and set all the congregation astir Few could refrain from twisting their heads toward the door many stood upright and turned directly about while several little boys clambered upon the seats and came down again with a terrible racket There was a general bustle a rustling of the women s gowns and shuffling of the men s feet greatly at variance with that hushed repose which should attend the entrance of the minister But mister Hooper appeared not to notice the perturbation of his people He entered with an almost noiseless step bent his head mildly to the pews on each side and bowed as he passed his oldest parishioner a white haired great grandsire who occupied an arm chair in the centre of the aisle It was strange to observe how slowly this venerable man became conscious of something singular in the appearance of his pastor He seemed not fully to partake of the prevailing wonder till mister Hooper had ascended the stairs and showed himself in the pulpit face to face with his congregation except for the black veil That mysterious emblem was never once withdrawn It shook with his measured breath as he gave out the psalm it threw its obscurity between him and the holy page as he read the Scriptures and while he prayed the veil lay heavily on his uplifted countenance Did he seek to hide it from the dread Being whom he was addressing Such was the effect of this simple piece of crape that more than one woman of delicate nerves was forced to leave the meeting house Yet perhaps the pale faced congregation was almost as fearful a sight to the minister as his black veil to them mister Hooper had the reputation of a good preacher but not an energetic one he strove to win his people heavenward by mild persuasive influences rather than to drive them thither by the thunders of the word The sermon which he now delivered was marked by the same characteristics of style and manner as the general series of his pulpit oratory but there was something either in the sentiment of the discourse itself or in the imagination of the auditors which made it greatly the most powerful effort that they had ever heard from their pastor s lips It was tinged rather more darkly than usual with the gentle gloom of mister Hooper s temperament The subject had reference to secret sin and those sad mysteries which we hide from our nearest and dearest and would fain conceal from our own consciousness even forgetting that the Omniscient can detect them A subtle power was breathed into his words Each member of the congregation the most innocent girl and the man of hardened breast felt as if the preacher had crept upon them behind his awful veil and discovered their hoarded iniquity of deed or thought Many spread their clasped hands on their bosoms There was nothing terrible in what mister Hooper said at least no violence and yet with every tremor of his melancholy voice the hearers quaked An unsought pathos came hand in hand with awe So sensible were the audience of some unwonted attribute in their minister that they longed for a breath of wind to blow aside the veil almost believing that a stranger s visage would be discovered though the form gesture and voice were those of mister Hooper At the close of the services the people hurried out with indecorous confusion eager to communicate their pent up amazement and conscious of lighter spirits the moment they lost sight of the black veil Some gathered in little circles huddled closely together with their mouths all whispering in the centre some went homeward alone wrapped in silent meditation some talked loudly and profaned the Sabbath day with ostentatious laughter A few shook their sagacious heads intimating that they could penetrate the mystery while one or two affirmed that there was no mystery at all but only that mister Hooper s eyes were so weakened by the midnight lamp as to require a shade After a brief interval forth came good mister Hooper also in the rear of his flock Turning his veiled face from one group to another he paid due reverence to the hoary heads saluted the middle aged with kind dignity as their friend and spiritual guide greeted the young with mingled authority and love and laid his hands on the little children s heads to bless them Such was always his custom on the Sabbath day Strange and bewildered looks repaid him for his courtesy None as on former occasions aspired to the honor of walking by their pastor s side Old Squire Saunders doubtless by an accidental lapse of memory neglected to invite mister Hooper to his table where the good clergyman had been wont to bless the food almost every Sunday since his settlement He returned therefore to the parsonage and at the moment of closing the door was observed to look back upon the people all of whom had their eyes fixed upon the minister A sad smile gleamed faintly from beneath the black veil and flickered about his mouth glimmering as he disappeared How strange said a lady that a simple black veil such as any woman might wear on her bonnet should become such a terrible thing on mister Hooper s face Something must surely be amiss with mister Hooper s intellects observed her husband the physician of the village But the strangest part of the affair is the effect of this vagary even on a sober minded man like myself The black veil though it covers only our pastor s face throws its influence over his whole person and makes him ghost like from head to foot Do you not feel it so Truly do I replied the lady and I would not be alone with him for the world I wonder he is not afraid to be alone with himself Men sometimes are so said her husband The afternoon service was attended with similar circumstances At its conclusion the bell tolled for the funeral of a young lady The relatives and friends were assembled in the house and the more distant acquaintances stood about the door speaking of the good qualities of the deceased when their talk was interrupted by the appearance of mister Hooper still covered with his black veil It was now an appropriate emblem The clergyman stepped into the room where the corpse was laid and bent over the coffin to take a last farewell of his deceased parishioner As he stooped the veil hung straight down from his forehead so that if her eye lids had not been closed for ever the dead maiden might have seen his face Could mister Hooper be fearful of her glance that he so hastily caught back the black veil A person who watched the interview between the dead and living scrupled not to affirm that at the instant when the clergyman s features were disclosed the corpse had slightly shuddered rustling the shroud and muslin cap though the countenance retained the composure of death A superstitious old woman was the only witness of this prodigy From the coffin mister Hooper passed into the chamber of the mourners and thence to the head of the staircase to make the funeral prayer It was a tender and heart dissolving prayer full of sorrow yet so imbued with celestial hopes that the music of a heavenly harp swept by the fingers of the dead seemed faintly to be heard among the saddest accents of the minister The people trembled though they but darkly understood him when he prayed that they and himself and all of mortal race might be ready as he trusted this young maiden had been for the dreadful hour that should snatch the veil from their faces The bearers went heavily forth and the mourners followed saddening all the street with the dead before them and mister Hooper in his black veil behind Why do you look back said one in the procession to his partner I had a fancy replied she that the minister and the maiden s spirit were walking hand in hand And so had I at the same moment said the other That night the handsomest couple in Milford village were to be joined in wedlock Though reckoned a melancholy man mister Hooper had a placid cheerfulness for such occasions which often excited a sympathetic smile where livelier merriment would have been thrown away There was no quality of his disposition which made him more beloved than this The company at the wedding awaited his arrival with impatience trusting that the strange awe which had gathered over him throughout the day would now be dispelled But such was not the result When mister Hooper came the first thing that their eyes rested on was the same horrible black veil which had added deeper gloom to the funeral and could portend nothing but evil to the wedding Such was its immediate effect on the guests that a cloud seemed to have rolled duskily from beneath the black crape and dimmed the light of the candles The bridal pair stood up before the minister but the bride s cold fingers quivered in the tremulous hand of the bridegroom and her death like paleness caused a whisper that the maiden who had been buried a few hours before was come from her grave to be married If ever another wedding were so dismal it was that famous one where they tolled the wedding knell After performing the ceremony mister Hooper raised a glass of wine to his lips wishing happiness to the new married couple in a strain of mild pleasantry that ought to have brightened the features of the guests like a cheerful gleam from the hearth At that instant catching a glimpse of his figure in the looking glass the black veil involved his own spirit in the horror with which it overwhelmed all others His frame shuddered his lips grew white he spilt the untasted wine upon the carpet and rushed forth into the darkness for the Earth too had on her black veil The next day the whole village of Milford talked of little else than Parson Hooper s black veil That and the mystery concealed behind it supplied a topic for discussion between acquaintances meeting in the street and good women gossipping at their open windows It was the first item of news that the tavernkeeper told to his guests The children babbled of it on their way to school One imitative little imp covered his face with an old black handkerchief thereby so affrighting his playmates that the panic seized himself and he wellnigh lost his wits by his own waggery It was remarkable that of all the busybodies and impertinent people in the parish not one ventured to put the plain question to mister Hooper wherefore he did this thing Hitherto whenever there appeared the slightest call for such interference he had never lacked advisers nor shown himself averse to be guided by their judgment If he erred at all it was by so painful a degree of self distrust that even the mildest censure would lead him to consider an indifferent action as a crime Yet though so well acquainted with this amiable weakness no individual among his parishioners chose to make the black veil a subject of friendly remonstrance There was a feeling of dread neither plainly confessed nor carefully concealed which caused each to shift the responsibility upon another till at length it was found expedient to send a deputation of the church in order to deal with mister Hooper about the mystery before it should grow into a scandal Never did an embassy so ill discharge its duties The minister received them with friendly courtesy but became silent after they were seated leaving to his visitors the whole burden of introducing their important business The topic it might be supposed was obvious enough There was the black veil swathed round mister Hooper s forehead and concealing every feature above his placid mouth on which at times they could perceive the glimmering of a melancholy smile But that piece of crape to their imagination seemed to hang down before his heart the symbol of a fearful secret between him and them Were the veil but cast aside they might speak freely of it but not till then Thus they sat a considerable time speechless confused and shrinking uneasily from mister Hooper s eye which they felt to be fixed upon them with an invisible glance Finally the deputies returned abashed to their constituents pronouncing the matter too weighty to be handled except by a council of the churches if indeed it might not require a General Synod But there was one person in the village unappalled by the awe with which the black veil had impressed all besides herself When the deputies returned without an explanation or even venturing to demand one she with the calm energy of her character determined to chase away the strange cloud that appeared to be settling round mister Hooper every moment more darkly than before As his plighted wife it should be her privilege to know what the black veil concealed At the minister s first visit therefore she entered upon the subject with a direct simplicity which made the task easier both for him and her After he had seated himself she fixed her eyes steadfastly upon the veil but could discern nothing of the dreadful gloom that had so overawed the multitude it was but a double fold of crape hanging down from his forehead to his mouth and slightly stirring with his breath No said she aloud and smiling there is nothing terrible in this piece of crape except that it hides a face which I am always glad to look upon Come good sir let the sun shine from behind the cloud First lay aside your black veil then tell me why you put it on mister Hooper s smile glimmered faintly There is an hour to come said he when all of us shall cast aside our veils Take it not amiss beloved friend if I wear this piece of crape till then Your words are a mystery too returned the young lady Take away the veil from them at least Elizabeth I will said he so far as my vow may suffer me Know then this veil is a type and a symbol and I am bound to wear it ever both in light and darkness in solitude and before the gaze of multitudes and as with strangers so with my familiar friends No mortal eye will see it withdrawn This dismal shade must separate me from the world even you Elizabeth can never come behind it What grievous affliction hath befallen you she earnestly inquired that you should thus darken your eyes for ever If it be a sign of mourning replied mister Hooper I perhaps like most other mortals have sorrows dark enough to be typified by a black veil But what if the world will not believe that it is the type of an innocent sorrow urged Elizabeth Beloved and respected as you are there may be whispers that you hide your face under the consciousness of secret sin For the sake of your holy office do away this scandal The color rose into her cheeks as she intimated the nature of the rumors that were already abroad in the village But mister Hooper s mildness did not forsake him He even smiled again that same sad smile which always appeared like a faint glimmering of light proceeding from the obscurity beneath the veil If I hide my face for sorrow there is cause enough he merely replied and if I cover it for secret sin what mortal might not do the same And with this gentle but unconquerable obstinacy did he resist all her entreaties At length Elizabeth sat silent For a few moments she appeared lost in thought considering probably what new methods might be tried to withdraw her lover from so dark a fantasy which if it had no other meaning was perhaps a symptom of mental disease Though of a firmer character than his own the tears rolled down her cheeks But in an instant as it were a new feeling took the place of sorrow her eyes were fixed insensibly on the black veil when like a sudden twilight in the air its terrors fell around her She arose and stood trembling before him And do you feel it then at last said he mournfully She made no reply but covered her eyes with her hand and turned to leave the room He rushed forward and caught her arm Have patience with me Elizabeth cried he passionately Do not desert me though this veil must be between us here on earth Be mine and hereafter there shall be no veil over my face no darkness between our souls It is but a mortal veil it is not for eternity Oh you know not how lonely I am and how frightened to be alone behind my black veil Do not leave me in this miserable obscurity for ever Lift the veil but once and look me in the face said she Never It cannot be replied mister Hooper Then farewell said Elizabeth She withdrew her arm from his grasp and slowly departed pausing at the door to give one long shuddering gaze that seemed almost to penetrate the mystery of the black veil But even amid his grief mister Hooper smiled to think that only a material emblem had separated him from happiness though the horrors which it shadowed forth must be drawn darkly between the fondest of lovers From that time no attempts were made to remove mister Hooper s black veil or by a direct appeal to discover the secret which it was supposed to hide By persons who claimed a superiority to popular prejudice it was reckoned merely an eccentric whim such as often mingles with the sober actions of men otherwise rational and tinges them all with its own semblance of insanity But with the multitude good mister Hooper was irreparably a bugbear He could not walk the street with any peace of mind so conscious was he that the gentle and timid would turn aside to avoid him and that others would make it a point of hardihood to throw themselves in his way The impertinence of the latter class compelled him to give up his customary walk at sunset to the burial ground for when he leaned pensively over the gate there would always be faces behind the gravestones peeping at his black veil A fable went the rounds that the stare of the dead people drove him thence It grieved him to the very depth of his kind heart to observe how the children fled from his approach breaking up their merriest sports while his melancholy figure was yet afar off Their instinctive dread caused him to feel more strongly than aught else that a preternatural horror was interwoven with the threads of the black crape In truth his own antipathy to the veil was known to be so great that he never willingly passed before a mirror nor stooped to drink at a still fountain lest in its peaceful bosom he should be affrighted by himself This was what gave plausibility to the whispers that mister Hooper s conscience tortured him for some great crime too horrible to be entirely concealed or otherwise than so obscurely intimated Thus from beneath the black veil there rolled a cloud into the sunshine an ambiguity of sin or sorrow which enveloped the poor minister so that love or sympathy could never reach him It was said that ghost and fiend consorted with him there With self shudderings and outward terrors he walked continually in its shadow groping darkly within his own soul or gazing through a medium that saddened the whole world Even the lawless wind it was believed respected his dreadful secret and never blew aside the veil But still good mister Hooper sadly smiled at the pale visages of the worldly throng as he passed by Among all its bad influences the black veil had the one desirable effect of making its wearer a very efficient clergyman By the aid of his mysterious emblem for there was no other apparent cause he became a man of awful power over souls that were in agony for sin His converts always regarded him with a dread peculiar to themselves affirming though but figuratively that before he brought them to celestial light they had been with him behind the black veil Its gloom indeed enabled him to sympathize with all dark affections Dying sinners cried aloud for mister Hooper and would not yield their breath till he appeared though ever as he stooped to whisper consolation they shuddered at the veiled face so near their own Such were the terrors of the black veil even when Death had bared his visage Strangers came long distances to attend service at his church with the mere idle purpose of gazing at his figure because it was forbidden them to behold his face But many were made to quake ere they departed Once during Governor Belcher s administration mister Hooper was appointed to preach the election sermon Covered with his black veil he stood before the chief magistrate the council and the representatives and wrought so deep an impression that the legislative measures of that year were characterized by all the gloom and piety of our earliest ancestral sway In this manner mister Hooper spent a long life irreproachable in outward act yet shrouded in dismal suspicions kind and loving though unloved and dimly feared a man apart from men shunned in their health and joy but ever summoned to their aid in mortal anguish As years wore on shedding their snows above his sable veil he acquired a name throughout the New England churches and they called him Father Hooper Nearly all his parishioners who were of mature age when he was settled had been borne away by many a funeral he had one congregation in the church and a more crowded one in the churchyard and having wrought so late into the evening and done his work so well it was now good Father Hooper s turn to rest Several persons were visible by the shaded candlelight in the death chamber of the old clergyman Natural connections he had none But there was the decorously grave though unmoved physician seeking only to mitigate the last pangs of the patient whom he could not save There were the deacons and other eminently pious members of his church There also was the Reverend mister Clark of Westbury a young and zealous divine who had ridden in haste to pray by the bedside of the expiring minister There was the nurse no hired handmaiden of Death but one whose calm affection had endured thus long in secrecy in solitude amid the chill of age and would not perish even at the dying hour Who but Elizabeth And there lay the hoary head of good Father Hooper upon the death pillow with the black veil still swathed about his brow and reaching down over his face so that each more difficult gasp of his faint breath caused it to stir All through life that piece of crape had hung between him and the world it had separated him from cheerful brotherhood and woman s love and kept him in that saddest of all prisons his own heart and still it lay upon his face as if to deepen the gloom of his darksome chamber and shade him from the sunshine of eternity For some time previous his mind had been confused wavering doubtfully between the past and the present and hovering forward as it were at intervals into the indistinctness of the world to come There had been feverish turns which tossed him from side to side and wore away what little strength he had But in his most convulsive struggles and in the wildest vagaries of his intellect when no other thought retained its sober influence he still showed an awful solicitude lest the black veil should slip aside Even if his bewildered soul could have forgotten there was a faithful woman at his pillow who with averted eyes would have covered that aged face which she had last beheld in the comeliness of manhood At length the death stricken old man lay quietly in the torpor of mental and bodily exhaustion with an imperceptible pulse and breath that grew fainter and fainter except when a long deep and irregular inspiration seemed to prelude the flight of his spirit The minister of Westbury approached the bedside Venerable Father Hooper said he the moment of your release is at hand Are you ready for the lifting of the veil that shuts in time from eternity Father Hooper at first replied merely by a feeble motion of his head then apprehensive perhaps that his meaning might be doubtful he exerted himself to speak Yea said he in faint accents my soul hath a patient weariness until that veil be lifted And is it fitting resumed the Reverend mister Clark that a man so given to prayer of such a blameless example holy in deed and thought so far as mortal judgment may pronounce is it fitting that a father in the Church should leave a shadow on his memory that may seem to blacken a life so pure I pray you my venerable brother let not this thing be Suffer us to be gladdened by your triumphant aspect as you go to your reward Before the veil of eternity be lifted let me cast aside this black veil from your face and thus speaking the Reverend mister Clark bent forward to reveal the mystery of so many years But exerting a sudden energy that made all the beholders stand aghast Father Hooper snatched both his hands from beneath the bedclothes and pressed them strongly on the black veil resolute to struggle if the minister of Westbury would contend with a dying man Never cried the veiled clergyman On earth never Dark old man exclaimed the affrighted minister with what horrible crime upon your soul are you now passing to the judgment Father Hooper s breath heaved it rattled in his throat but with a mighty effort grasping forward with his hands he caught hold of life and held it back till he should speak He even raised himself in bed and there he sat shivering with the arms of Death around him while the black veil hung down awful at that last moment in the gathered terrors of a lifetime And yet the faint sad smile so often there now seemed to glimmer from its obscurity and linger on Father Hooper s lips Why do you tremble at me alone cried he turning his veiled face round the circle of pale spectators Tremble also at each other Have men avoided me and women shown no pity and children screamed and fled only for my black veil What but the mystery which it obscurely typifies has made this piece of crape so awful When the friend shows his inmost heart to his friend the lover to his best beloved when man does not vainly shrink from the eye of his Creator loathsomely treasuring up the secret of his sin then deem me a monster for the symbol beneath which I have lived and die I look around me and lo on every visage a black veil While his auditors shrank from one another in mutual affright Father Hooper fell back upon his pillow a veiled corpse with a faint smile lingering on the lips Still veiled they laid him in his coffin and a veiled corpse they bore him to the grave The grass of many years has sprung up and withered on that grave the burial stone is moss grown and good mister Hooper s face is dust but awful is still the thought that it mouldered beneath the black veil THE MAYPOLE OF MERRY MOUNT There is an admirable foundation for a philosophic romance in the curious history of the early settlement of Mount Wollaston or Merry Mount In the slight sketch here attempted the facts recorded on the grave pages of our New England annalists have wrought themselves almost spontaneously into a sort of allegory The masques mummeries and festive customs described in the text are in accordance with the manners of the age Authority on these points may be found in Strutt s Book of English Sports and Pastimes Bright were the days at Merry Mount when the Maypole was the banner staff of that gay colony They who reared it should their banner be triumphant were to pour sunshine over New England s rugged hills and scatter flower seeds throughout the soil Jollity and gloom were contending for an empire Midsummer eve had come bringing deep verdure to the forest and roses in her lap of a more vivid hue than the tender buds of spring But May or her mirthful spirit dwelt all the year round at Merry Mount sporting with the summer months and revelling with autumn and basking in the glow of winter s fireside Through a world of toil and care she flitted with a dream like smile and came hither to find a home among the lightsome hearts of Merry Mount Never had the Maypole been so gayly decked as at sunset on Midsummer eve This venerated emblem was a pine tree which had preserved the slender grace of youth while it equalled the loftiest height of the old wood monarchs From its top streamed a silken banner colored like the rainbow Down nearly to the ground the pole was dressed with birchen boughs and others of the liveliest green and some with silvery leaves fastened by ribbons that fluttered in fantastic knots of twenty different colors but no sad ones Garden flowers and blossoms of the wilderness laughed gladly forth amid the verdure so fresh and dewy that they must have grown by magic on that happy pine tree Where this green and flowery splendor terminated the shaft of the Maypole was stained with the seven brilliant hues of the banner at its top On the lowest green bough hung an abundant wreath of roses some that had been gathered in the sunniest spots of the forest and others of still richer blush which the colonists had reared from English seed O people of the Golden Age the chief of your husbandry was to raise flowers But what was the wild throng that stood hand in hand about the Maypole It could not be that the fauns and nymphs when driven from their classic groves and homes of ancient fable had sought refuge as all the persecuted did in the fresh woods of the West These were Gothic monsters though perhaps of Grecian ancestry On the shoulders of a comely youth uprose the head and branching antlers of a stag a second human in all other points had the grim visage of a wolf a third still with the trunk and limbs of a mortal man showed the beard and horns of a venerable he goat There was the likeness of a bear erect brute in all but his hind legs which were adorned with pink silk stockings And here again almost as wondrous stood a real bear of the dark forest lending each of his forepaws to the grasp of a human hand and as ready for the dance as any in that circle His inferior nature rose halfway to meet his companions as they stooped Other faces wore the similitude of man or woman but distorted or extravagant with red noses pendulous before their mouths which seemed of awful depth and stretched from ear to ear in an eternal fit of laughter Here might be seen the salvage man well known in heraldry hairy as a baboon and girdled with green leaves By his side a nobler figure but still a counterfeit appeared an Indian hunter with feathery crest and wampum belt Many of this strange company wore foolscaps and had little bells appended to their garments tinkling with a silvery sound responsive to the inaudible music of their gleesome spirits Some youths and maidens were of soberer garb yet well maintained their places in the irregular throng by the expression of wild revelry upon their features Such were the colonists of Merry Mount as they stood in the broad smile of sunset round their venerated Maypole Had a wanderer bewildered in the melancholy forest heard their mirth and stolen a half affrighted glance he might have fancied them the crew of Comus some already transformed to brutes some midway between man and beast and the others rioting in the flow of tipsy jollity that foreran the change but a band of Puritans who watched the scene invisible themselves compared the masques to those devils and ruined souls with whom their superstition peopled the black wilderness Within the ring of monsters appeared the two airiest forms that had ever trodden on any more solid footing than a purple and golden cloud One was a youth in glistening apparel with a scarf of the rainbow pattern crosswise on his breast His right hand held a gilded staff the ensign of high dignity among the revellers and his left grasped the slender fingers of a fair maiden not less gayly decorated than himself Bright roses glowed in contrast with the dark and glossy curls of each and were scattered round their feet or had sprung up spontaneously there Behind this lightsome couple so close to the Maypole that its boughs shaded his jovial face stood the figure of an English priest canonically dressed yet decked with flowers in heathen fashion and wearing a chaplet of the native vine leaves By the riot of his rolling eye and the pagan decorations of his holy garb he seemed the wildest monster there and the very Comus of the crew Votaries of the Maypole cried the flower decked priest merrily all day long have the woods echoed to your mirth But be this your merriest hour my hearts Lo here stand the Lord and Lady of the May whom I a clerk of Oxford and high priest of Merry Mount am presently to join in holy matrimony Up with your nimble spirits ye morrice dancers green men and glee maidens bears and wolves and horned gentlemen Come a chorus now rich with the old mirth of Merry England and the wilder glee of this fresh forest and then a dance to show the youthful pair what life is made of and how airily they should go through it All ye that love the Maypole lend your voices to the nuptial song of the Lord and Lady of the May This wedlock was more serious than most affairs of Merry Mount where jest and delusion trick and fantasy kept up a continual carnival The Lord and Lady of the May though their titles must be laid down at sunset were really and truly to be partners for the dance of life beginning the measure that same bright eve The wreath of roses that hung from the lowest green bough of the Maypole had been twined for them and would be thrown over both their heads in symbol of their flowery union When the priest had spoken therefore a riotous uproar burst from the rout of monstrous figures Begin you the stave reverend sir cried they all and never did the woods ring to such a merry peal as we of the Maypole shall send up Immediately a prelude of pipe cittern and viol touched with practised minstrelsy began to play from a neighboring thicket in such a mirthful cadence that the boughs of the Maypole quivered to the sound But the May lord he of the gilded staff chancing to look into his lady s eyes was wonder struck at the almost pensive glance that met his own Edith sweet Lady of the May whispered he reproachfully is yon wreath of roses a garland to hang above our graves that you look so sad Oh Edith this is our golden time Tarnish it not by any pensive shadow of the mind for it may be that nothing of futurity will be brighter than the mere remembrance of what is now passing That was the very thought that saddened me How came it in your mind too said Edith in a still lower tone than he for it was high treason to be sad at Merry Mount Therefore do I sigh amid this festive music And besides dear Edgar I struggle as with a dream and fancy that these shapes of our jovial friends are visionary and their mirth unreal and that we are no true lord and lady of the May What is the mystery in my heart Just then as if a spell had loosened them down came a little shower of withering rose leaves from the Maypole Alas for the young lovers No sooner had their hearts glowed with real passion than they were sensible of something vague and unsubstantial in their former pleasures and felt a dreary presentiment of inevitable change From the moment that they truly loved they had subjected themselves to earth s doom of care and sorrow and troubled joy and had no more a home at Merry Mount That was Edith s mystery Now leave we the priest to marry them and the masquers to sport round the Maypole till the last sunbeam be withdrawn from its summit and the shadows of the forest mingle gloomily in the dance Meanwhile we may discover who these gay people were Two hundred years ago and more the Old World and its inhabitants became mutually weary of each other Men voyaged by thousands to the West some to barter glass and such like jewels for the furs of the Indian hunter some to conquer virgin empires and one stern band to pray But none of these motives had much weight with the striving to communicate their mirth to the grave Indian or masquerading in the skins of deer and wolves which they had hunted for that especial purpose Often the whole colony were playing at Blindman s Buff magistrates and all with their eyes bandaged except a single scapegoat whom the blinded sinners pursued by the tinkling of the bells at his garments Once it is said they were seen following a flower decked corpse with merriment and festive music to his grave But did the dead man laugh In their quietest times they sang ballads and told tales for the edification of their pious visitors or perplexed them with juggling tricks or grinned at them through horse collars and when sport itself grew wearisome they made game of their own stupidity and began a yawning match At the very least of these enormities the men of iron shook their heads and frowned so darkly that the revellers looked up imagining that a momentary cloud had overcast the sunshine which was to be perpetual there On the other hand the Puritans affirmed that when a psalm was pealing from their place of worship the echo which the forest sent them back seemed often like the chorus of a jolly catch closing with a roar of laughter Who but the fiend and his bond slaves the crew of Merry Mount had thus disturbed them In due time a feud arose stern and bitter on one side and as serious on the other as anything could be among such light spirits as had sworn allegiance to the Maypole The future complexion of New England was involved in this important quarrel Should the grisly saints establish their jurisdiction over the gay sinners then would their spirits darken all the clime and make it a land of clouded visages of hard toil of sermon and psalm for ever but should the banner staff of Merry Mount be fortunate sunshine would break upon the hills and flowers would beautify the forest and late posterity do homage to the Maypole After these authentic passages from history we return to the nuptials of the Lord and Lady of the May Alas we have delayed too long and must darken our tale too suddenly As we glance again at the Maypole a solitary sunbeam is fading from the summit and leaves only a faint golden tinge blended with the hues of the rainbow banner Even that dim light is now withdrawn relinquishing the whole domain of Merry Mount to the evening gloom which has rushed so instantaneously from the black surrounding woods But some of these black shadows have rushed forth in human shape Yes with the setting sun the last day of mirth had passed from Merry Mount The ring of gay masquers was disordered and broken the stag lowered his antlers in dismay the wolf grew weaker than a lamb the bells of the morrice dancers tinkled with tremulous affright The Puritans had played a characteristic part in the Maypole mummeries Their darksome figures were intermixed with the wild shapes of their foes and made the scene a picture of the moment when waking thoughts start up amid the scattered fantasies of a dream The leader of the hostile party stood in the centre of the circle while the rout of monsters cowered around him like evil spirits in the presence of a dread magician No fantastic foolery could look him in the face So stern was the energy of his aspect that the whole man visage frame and soul seemed wrought of iron gifted with life and thought yet all of one substance with his headpiece and breastplate It was the Puritan of Puritans it was Endicott himself Stand off priest of Baal said he with a grim frown and laying no reverent hand upon the surplice I know thee Blackstone one Thou art the man who couldst not abide the rule even of thine own corrupted Church and hast come hither to preach iniquity and to give example of it in thy life But now shall it be seen that the Lord hath sanctified this wilderness for his peculiar people Woe unto them that would defile it And first for this flower decked abomination the altar of thy worship Footnote one Did Governor Endicott speak less positively we should suspect a mistake here The reverend mister Blackstone though an eccentric is not known to have been an immoral man We rather doubt his identity with the priest of Merry Mount And with his keen sword Endicott assaulted the hallowed Maypole Nor long did it resist his arm It groaned with a dismal sound it showered leaves and rosebuds upon the remorseless enthusiast and finally with all its green boughs and ribbons and flowers symbolic of departed pleasures down fell the banner staff of Merry Mount As it sank tradition says the evening sky grew darker and the woods threw forth a more sombre shadow There cried Endicott looking triumphantly on his work there lies the only Maypole in New England The thought is strong within me that by its fall is shadowed forth the fate of light and idle mirthmakers amongst us and our posterity Amen saith John Endicott Amen echoed his followers But the votaries of the Maypole gave one groan for their idol At the sound the Puritan leader glanced at the crew of Comus each a figure of broad mirth yet at this moment strangely expressive of sorrow and dismay Valiant captain quoth Peter Palfrey the ancient of the band what order shall be taken with the prisoners I thought not to repent me of cutting down a Maypole replied Endicott yet now I could find in my heart to plant it again and give each of these bestial pagans one other dance round their idol It would have served rarely for a whipping post But there are pine trees enow suggested the lieutenant True good ancient said the leader Wherefore bind the heathen crew and bestow on them a small matter of stripes apiece as earnest of our future justice Set some of the rogues in the stocks to rest themselves so soon as Providence shall bring us to one of our own well ordered settlements where such accommodations may be found Further penalties such as branding and cropping of ears shall be thought of hereafter How many stripes for the priest inquired Ancient Palfrey None as yet answered Endicott bending his iron frown upon the culprit It must be for the Great and General Court to determine whether stripes and long imprisonment and other grievous penalty may atone for his transgressions Let him look to himself For such as violate our civil order it may be permitted us to show mercy but woe to the wretch that troubleth our religion And this dancing bear resumed the officer Must he share the stripes of his fellows Shoot him through the head said the energetic Puritan I suspect witchcraft in the beast Here be a couple of shining ones continued Peter Palfrey pointing his weapon at the Lord and Lady of the May They seem to be of high station among these misdoers Methinks their dignity will not be fitted with less than a double share of stripes Endicott rested on his sword and closely surveyed the dress and aspect of the hapless pair There they stood pale downcast and apprehensive yet there was an air of mutual support and of pure affection seeking aid and giving it that showed them to be man and wife with the sanction of a priest upon their love The youth in the peril of the moment had dropped his gilded staff and thrown his arm about the Lady of the May who leaned against his breast too lightly to burden him but with weight enough to express that their destinies were linked together for good or evil They looked first at each other and then into the grim captain s face There they stood in the first hour of wedlock while the idle pleasures of which their companions were the emblems had given place to the sternest cares of life personified by the dark Puritans But never had their youthful beauty seemed so pure and high as when its glow was chastened by adversity Youth said Endicott ye stand in an evil case thou and thy maiden wife Make ready presently for I am minded that ye shall both have a token to remember your wedding day Stern man cried the May lord how can I move thee Were the means at hand I would resist to the death being powerless I entreat Do with me as thou wilt but let Edith go untouched Not so replied the immitigable zealot We are not wont to show an idle courtesy to that sex which requireth the stricter discipline What sayest thou maid Shall thy silken bridegroom suffer thy share of the penalty besides his own Be it death said Edith and lay it all on me Truly as Endicott had said the poor lovers stood in a woeful case Their foes were triumphant their friends captive and abased their home desolate the benighted wilderness around them and a rigorous destiny in the shape of the Puritan leader their only guide Yet the deepening twilight could not altogether conceal that the iron man was softened He smiled at the fair spectacle of early love he almost sighed for the inevitable blight of early hopes The troubles of life have come hastily on this young couple observed Endicott We will see how they comport themselves under their present trials ere we burden them with greater If among the spoil there be any garments of a more decent fashion let them be put upon this May lord and his Lady instead of their glistening vanities Look to it some of you And shall not the youth s hair be cut asked Peter Palfrey looking with abhorrence at the lovelock and long glossy curls of the young man Crop it forthwith and that in the true pumpkin shell fashion answered the captain Then bring them along with us but more gently than their fellows There be qualities in the youth which may make him valiant to fight and sober to toil and pious to pray and in the maiden that may fit her to become a mother in our Israel bringing up babes in better nurture than her own hath been Nor think ye young ones that they are the happiest even in our lifetime of a moment who misspend it in dancing round a Maypole And Endicott the severest Puritan of all who laid the rock foundation of New England lifted the wreath of roses from the ruin of the Maypole and threw it with his own gauntleted hand over the heads of the Lord and Lady of the May It was a deed of prophecy As the moral gloom of the world overpowers all systematic gayety even so was their home of wild mirth made desolate amid the sad forest They returned to it no more But as their flowery garland was wreathed of the brightest roses that had grown there so in the tie that united them were intertwined all the purest and best of their early joys They went heavenward supporting each other along the difficult path which it was their lot to tread and never wasted one regretful thought on the vanities of Merry Mount THE GENTLE BOY In the course of the year sixteen fifty six several of the people called Quakers led as they professed by the inward movement of the spirit made their appearance in New England Their reputation as holders of mystic and pernicious principles having spread before them the Puritans early endeavored to banish and to prevent the further intrusion of the rising sect But the measures by which it was intended to purge the land of heresy though more than sufficiently vigorous were entirely unsuccessful The Quakers esteeming persecution as a divine call to the post of danger laid claim to a holy courage unknown to the Puritans themselves who had shunned the cross by providing for the peaceable exercise of their religion in a distant wilderness Though it was the singular fact that every nation of the earth rejected the wandering enthusiasts who practised peace toward all men the place of greatest uneasiness and peril and therefore in their eyes the most eligible was the province of Massachusetts Bay The fines imprisonments and stripes liberally distributed by our pious forefathers the popular antipathy so strong that it endured nearly a hundred years after actual persecution had ceased were attractions as powerful for the Quakers as peace honor and reward would have been for the worldly minded Every European vessel brought new cargoes of the sect eager to testify against the oppression which they hoped to share and when shipmasters were restrained by heavy fines from affording them passage they made long and circuitous journeys through the Indian country and appeared in the province as if conveyed by a supernatural power Their enthusiasm heightened almost to madness by the treatment which they received produced actions contrary to the rules of decency as well as of rational religion and presented a singular contrast to the calm and staid deportment of their sectarian successors of the present day The command of the Spirit inaudible except to the soul and not to be controverted on grounds of human wisdom was made a plea for most indecorous exhibitions which abstractedly considered well deserved the moderate chastisement of the rod These extravagances and the persecution which was at once their cause and consequence continued to increase till in the year sixteen fifty nine the government of Massachusetts Bay indulged two members of the Quaker sect with the crown of martyrdom An indelible stain of blood is upon the hands of all who consented to this act but a large share of the awful responsibility must rest upon the person then at the head of the government He was a man of narrow mind and imperfect education and his uncompromising bigotry was made hot and mischievous by violent and hasty passions he exerted his influence indecorously and unjustifiably to compass the death of the enthusiasts and his whole conduct in respect to them was marked by brutal cruelty The Quakers whose revengeful feelings were not less deep because they were inactive remembered this man and his associates in after times The historian of the sect affirms that by the wrath of Heaven a blight fell upon the land in the vicinity of the bloody town of Boston so that no wheat would grow there and he takes his stand as it were among the graves of the ancient persecutors and triumphantly recounts the judgments that overtook them in old age or at the parting hour He tells us that they died suddenly and violently and in madness but nothing can exceed the bitter mockery with which he records the loathsome disease and death by rottenness of the fierce and cruel governor On the evening of the autumn day that had witnessed the martyrdom of two men of the Quaker persuasion a Puritan settler was returning from the metropolis to the neighboring country town in which he resided The air was cool the sky clear and the lingering twilight was made brighter by the rays of a young moon which had now nearly reached the verge of the horizon The traveller a man of middle age wrapped in a gray frieze cloak quickened his pace when he had reached the outskirts of the town for a gloomy extent of nearly four miles lay between him and his home The low straw thatched houses were scattered at considerable intervals along the road and the country having been settled but about thirty years the tracts of original forest still bore no small proportion to the cultivated ground The autumn wind wandered among the branches whirling away the leaves from all except the pine trees and moaning as if it lamented the desolation of which it was the instrument The road had penetrated the mass of woods that lay nearest to the town and was just emerging into an open space when the traveller s ears were saluted by a sound more mournful than even that of the wind It was like the wailing of some one in distress and it seemed to proceed from beneath a tall and lonely fir tree in the centre of a cleared but unenclosed and uncultivated field The Puritan could not but remember that this was the very spot which had been made accursed a few hours before by the execution of the Quakers whose bodies had been thrown together into one hasty grave beneath the tree on which they suffered He struggled however against the superstitious fears which belonged to the age and compelled himself to pause and listen The voice is most likely mortal nor have I cause to tremble if it be otherwise thought he straining his eyes through the dim moonlight Methinks it is like the wailing of a child some infant it may be which has strayed from its mother and chanced upon this place of death For the ease of mine own conscience I must search this matter out He therefore left the path and walked somewhat fearfully across the field Though now so desolate its soil was pressed down and trampled by the thousand footsteps of those who had witnessed the spectacle of that day all of whom had now retired leaving the dead to their loneliness The traveller at length reached the fir tree which from the middle upward was covered with living branches although a scaffold had been erected beneath and other preparations made for the work of death Under this unhappy tree which in after times was believed to drop poison with its dew sat the one solitary mourner for innocent blood It was a slender and light clad little boy who leaned his face upon a hillock of fresh turned and half frozen earth and wailed bitterly yet in a suppressed tone as if his grief might receive the punishment of crime The Puritan whose approach had been unperceived laid his hand upon the child s shoulder and addressed him compassionately You have chosen a dreary lodging my poor boy and no wonder that you weep said he But dry your eyes and tell me where your mother dwells I promise you if the journey be not too far I will leave you in her arms tonight The boy had hushed his wailing at once and turned his face upward to the stranger It was a pale bright eyed countenance certainly not more than six years old but sorrow fear and want had destroyed much of its infantile expression The Puritan seeing the boy s frightened gaze and feeling that he trembled under his hand endeavored to reassure him Nay if I intended to do you harm little lad the readiest way were to leave you here What you do not fear to sit beneath the gallows on a new made grave and yet you tremble at a friend s touch Take heart child and tell me what is your name and where is your home Friend replied the little boy in a sweet though faltering voice they call me Ilbrahim and my home is here The pale spiritual face the eyes that seemed to mingle with the moonlight the sweet airy voice and the outlandish name almost made the Puritan believe that the boy was in truth a being which had sprung up out of the grave on which he sat but perceiving that the apparition stood the test of a short mental prayer and remembering that the arm which he had touched was lifelike he adopted a more rational supposition The poor child is stricken in his intellect thought he but verily his words are fearful in a place like this He then spoke soothingly intending to humor the boy s fantasy Your home will scarce be comfortable Ilbrahim this cold autumn night and I fear you are ill provided with food I am hastening to a warm supper and bed and if you will go with me you shall share them I thank thee friend but though I be hungry and shivering with cold thou wilt not give me food nor lodging replied the boy in the quiet tone which despair had taught him even so young My father was of the people whom all men hate they have laid him under this heap of earth and here is my home The Puritan who had laid hold of little Ilbrahim s hand relinquished it as if he were touching a loathsome reptile But he possessed a compassionate heart which not even religious prejudice could harden into stone God forbid that I should leave this child to perish though he comes of the accursed sect said he to himself Do we not all spring from an evil root Are we not all in darkness till the light doth shine upon us He shall not perish neither in body nor if prayer and instruction may avail for him in soul He then spoke aloud and kindly to Ilbrahim who had again hid his face in the cold earth of the grave Was every door in the land shut against you my child that you have wandered to this unhallowed spot They drove me forth from the prison when they took my father thence said the boy and I stood afar off watching the crowd of people and when they were gone I came hither and found only this grave I knew that my father was sleeping here and I said This shall be my home No child no not while I have a roof over my head or a morsel to share with you exclaimed the Puritan whose sympathies were now fully excited Rise up and come with me and fear not any harm The boy wept afresh and clung to the heap of earth as if the cold heart beneath it were warmer to him than any in a living breast The traveller however continued to entreat him tenderly and seeming to acquire some degree of confidence he at length arose but his slender limbs tottered with weakness his little head grew dizzy and he leaned against the tree of death for support My poor boy are you so feeble said the Puritan When did you taste food last I ate of bread and water with my father in the prison replied Ilbrahim but they brought him none neither yesterday nor to day saying that he had eaten enough to bear him to his journey s end Trouble not thyself for my hunger kind friend for I have lacked food many times ere now The traveller took the child in his arms and wrapped his cloak about him while his heart stirred with shame and anger against the gratuitous cruelty of the instruments in this persecution In the awakened warmth of his feelings he resolved that at whatever risk he would not forsake the poor little defenceless being whom Heaven had confided to his care With this determination he left the accursed field and resumed the homeward path from which the wailing of the boy had called him The light and motionless burden scarcely impeded his progress and he soon beheld the fire rays from the windows of the cottage which he a native of a distant clime had built in the Western wilderness It was surrounded by a considerable extent of cultivated ground and the dwelling was situated in the nook of a wood covered hill whither it seemed to have crept for protection Look up child said the Puritan to Ilbrahim whose faint head had sunk upon his shoulder there is our home At the word home a thrill passed through the child s frame but he continued silent A few moments brought them to the cottage door at which the owner knocked for at that early period when savages were wandering everywhere among the settlers bolt and bar were indispensable to the security of a dwelling The summons was answered by a bond servant a coarse clad and dull featured piece of humanity who after ascertaining that his master was the applicant undid the door and held a flaring pine knot torch to light him in Farther back in the passageway the red blaze discovered a matronly woman but no little crowd of children came bounding forth to greet their father s return As the Puritan entered he thrust aside his cloak and displayed Ilbrahim s face to the female Dorothy here is a little outcast whom Providence hath put into our hands observed he Be kind to him even as if he were of those dear ones who have departed from us What pale and bright eyed little boy is this Tobias she inquired Is he one whom the wilderness folk have ravished from some Christian mother No Dorothy this poor child is no captive from the wilderness he replied The heathen savage would have given him to eat of his scanty morsel and to drink of his birchen cup but Christian men alas had cast him out to die Then he told her how he had found him beneath the gallows upon his father s grave and how his heart had prompted him like the speaking of an inward voice to take the little outcast home and be kind unto him He acknowledged his resolution to feed and clothe him as if he were his own child and to afford him the instruction which should counteract the pernicious errors hitherto instilled into his infant mind Dorothy was gifted with even a quicker tenderness than her husband and she approved of all his doings and intentions Have you a mother dear child she inquired The tears burst forth from his full heart as he attempted to reply but Dorothy at length understood that he had a mother who like the rest of her sect was a persecuted wanderer She had been taken from the prison a short time before carried into the uninhabited wilderness and left to perish there by hunger or wild beasts This was no uncommon method of disposing of the Quakers and they were accustomed to boast that the inhabitants of the desert were more hospitable to them than civilized man Fear not little boy you shall not need a mother and a kind one said Dorothy when she had gathered this information Dry your tears Ilbrahim and be my child as I will be your mother The good woman prepared the little bed from which her own children had successively been borne to another resting place Before Ilbrahim would consent to occupy it he knelt down and as Dorothy listed to his simple and affecting prayer she marvelled how the parents that had taught it to him could have been judged worthy of death When the boy had fallen asleep she bent over his pale and spiritual countenance pressed a kiss upon his white brow drew the bedclothes up about his neck and went away with a pensive gladness in her heart Tobias Pearson was not among the earliest emigrants from the old country He had remained in England during the first years of the Civil War in which he had borne some share as a cornet of dragoons under Cromwell But when the ambitious designs of his leader began to develop themselves he quitted the army of the Parliament and sought a refuge from the strife which was no longer holy among the people of his persuasion in the colony of Massachusetts A more worldly consideration had perhaps an influence in drawing him thither for New England offered advantages to men of unprosperous fortunes as well as to dissatisfied religionists and Pearson had hitherto found it difficult to provide for a wife and increasing family To this supposed impurity of motive the more bigoted Puritans were inclined to impute the removal by death of all the children for whose earthly good the father had been over thoughtful They had left their native country blooming like roses and like roses they had perished in a foreign soil Those expounders of the ways of Providence who had thus judged their brother and attributed his domestic sorrows to his sin were not more charitable when they saw him and Dorothy endeavoring to fill up the void in their hearts by the adoption of an infant of the accursed sect Nor did they fail to communicate their disapprobation to Tobias but the latter in reply merely pointed at the little quiet lovely boy whose appearance and deportment were indeed as powerful arguments as could possibly have been adduced in his own favor Even his beauty however and his winning manners sometimes produced an effect ultimately unfavorable for the bigots when the outer surfaces of their iron hearts had been softened and again grew hard affirmed that no merely natural cause could have so worked upon them Their antipathy to the poor infant was also increased by the ill success of divers theological discussions in which it was attempted to convince him of the errors of his sect Ilbrahim it is true was not a skilful controversialist but the feeling of his religion was strong as instinct in him and he could neither be enticed nor driven from the faith which his father had died for The odium of this stubbornness was shared in a great measure by the child s protectors insomuch that Tobias and Dorothy very shortly began to experience a most bitter species of persecution in the cold regards of many a friend whom they had valued The common people manifested their opinions more openly Pearson was a man of some consideration being a representative to the General Court and an approved lieutenant in the train bands yet within a week after his adoption of Ilbrahim he had been both hissed and hooted Once also when walking through a solitary piece of woods he heard a loud voice from some invisible speaker and it cried What shall be done to the backslider Lo the scourge is knotted for him even the whip of nine cords and every cord three knots These insults irritated Pearson s temper for the moment they entered also into his heart and became imperceptible but powerful workers toward an end which his most secret thought had not yet whispered On the second Sabbath after Ilbrahim became a member of their family Pearson and his wife deemed it proper that he should appear with them at public worship They had anticipated some opposition to this measure from the boy but he prepared himself in silence and at the appointed hour was clad in the new mourning suit which Dorothy had wrought for him As the parish was then and during many subsequent years unprovided with a bell the signal for the commencement of religious exercises was the beat of a drum At the first sound of that martial call to the place of holy and quiet thoughts Tobias and Dorothy set forth each holding a hand of little Ilbrahim like two parents linked together by the infant of their love On their path through the leafless woods they were overtaken by many persons of their acquaintance all of whom avoided them and passed by on the other side but a severer trial awaited their constancy when they had descended the hill and drew near the pine built and undecorated house of prayer Around the door from which the drummer still sent forth his thundering summons was drawn up a formidable phalanx including several of the oldest members of the congregation many of the middle aged and nearly all the younger males Pearson found it difficult to sustain their united and disapproving gaze but Dorothy whose mind was differently circumstanced merely drew the boy closer to her and faltered not in her approach As they entered the door they overheard the muttered sentiments of the assemblage and when the reviling voices of the little children smote Ilbrahim s ear he wept The interior aspect of the meeting house was rude The low ceiling the unplastered walls the naked woodwork and the undraperied pulpit offered nothing to excite the devotion which without such external aids often remains latent in the heart The floor of the building was occupied by rows of long cushionless benches supplying the place of pews and the broad aisle formed a sexual division impassable except by children beneath a certain age Pearson and Dorothy separated at the door of the meeting house and Ilbrahim being within the years of infancy was retained under the care of the latter The wrinkled beldams involved themselves in their rusty cloaks as he passed by even the mild featured maidens seemed to dread contamination and many a stern old man arose and turned his repulsive and unheavenly countenance upon the gentle boy as if the sanctuary were polluted by his presence He was a sweet infant of the skies that had strayed away from his home and all the inhabitants of this miserable world closed up their impure hearts against him drew back their earth soiled garments from his touch and said We are holier than thou Ilbrahim seated by the side of his adopted mother and retaining fast hold of her hand assumed a grave and decorous demeanor such as might befit a person of matured taste and understanding who should find himself in a temple dedicated to some worship which he did not recognize but felt himself bound to respect The exercises had not yet commenced however when the boy s attention was arrested by an event apparently of trifling interest A woman having her face muffled in a hood and a cloak drawn completely about her form advanced slowly up the broad aisle and took place upon the foremost bench Ilbrahim s faint color varied his nerves fluttered he was unable to turn his eyes from the muffled female When the preliminary prayer and hymn were over the minister arose and having turned the hour glass which stood by the great Bible commenced his discourse He was now well stricken in years a man of pale thin countenance and his gray hairs were closely covered by a black velvet skull cap In his younger days he had practically learned the meaning of persecution from Archbishop Laud and he was not now disposed to forget the lesson against which he had murmured then Introducing the often discussed subject of the Quakers he gave a history of that sect and a description of their tenets in which error predominated and prejudice distorted the aspect of what was true He adverted to the recent measures in the province and cautioned his hearers of weaker parts against calling in question the just severity which God fearing magistrates had at length been compelled to exercise He spoke of the danger of pity in some cases a commendable and Christian virtue but inapplicable to this pernicious sect He observed that such was their devilish obstinacy in error that even the little children the sucking babes were hardened and desperate heretics He affirmed that no man without Heaven s especial warrant should attempt their conversion lest while he lent his hand to draw them from the slough he should himself be precipitated into its lowest depths The sands of the second hour were principally in the lower half of the glass when the sermon concluded An approving murmur followed and the clergyman having given out a hymn took his seat with much self congratulation and endeavored to read the effect of his eloquence in the visages of the people But while voices from all parts of the house were tuning themselves to sing a scene occurred which though not very unusual at that period in the province happened to be without precedent in this parish The muffled female who had hitherto sat motionless in the front rank of the audience now arose and with slow stately and unwavering step ascended the pulpit stairs The quaverings of incipient harmony were hushed and the divine sat in speechless and almost terrified astonishment while she undid the door and stood up in the sacred desk from which his maledictions had just been thundered She then divested herself of the cloak and hood and appeared in a most singular array A shapeless robe of sackcloth was girded about her waist with a knotted cord her raven hair fell down upon her shoulders and its blackness was defiled by pale streaks of ashes which she had strewn upon her head Her eyebrows dark and strongly defined added to the deathly whiteness of a countenance which emaciated with want and wild with enthusiasm and strange sorrows retained no trace of earlier beauty This figure stood gazing earnestly on the audience and there was no sound nor any movement except a faint shuddering which every man observed in his neighbor but was scarcely conscious of in himself At length when her fit of inspiration came she spoke for the first few moments in a low voice and not invariably distinct utterance Her discourse gave evidence of an imagination hopelessly entangled with her reason it was a vague and incomprehensible rhapsody which however seemed to spread its own atmosphere round the hearer s soul and to move his feelings by some influence unconnected with the words As she proceeded beautiful but shadowy images would sometimes be seen like bright things moving in a turbid river or a strong and singularly shaped idea leapt forth and seized at once on the understanding or the heart But the course of her unearthly eloquence soon led her to the persecutions of her sect and from thence the step was short to her own peculiar sorrows She was naturally a woman of mighty passions and hatred and revenge now wrapped themselves in the garb of piety The character of her speech was changed her images became distinct though wild and her denunciations had an almost hellish bitterness The governor and his mighty men she said have gathered together taking counsel among themselves and saying What shall we do unto this people even unto the people that have come into this land to put our iniquity to the blush And lo the devil entereth into the council chamber like a lame man of low stature and gravely apparelled with a dark and twisted countenance and a bright downcast eye And he standeth up among the rulers yea he goeth to and fro whispering to each and every man lends his ear for his word is Slay Slay But I say unto ye Woe to them that slay Woe to them that shed the blood of saints Woe to them that have slain the husband and cast forth the child the tender infant to wander homeless and hungry and cold till he die and have saved the mother alive in the cruelty of their tender mercies Woe to them in their lifetime Cursed are they in the delight and pleasure of their hearts Woe to them in their death hour whether it come swiftly with blood and violence or after long and lingering pain Woe in the dark house in the rottenness of the grave when the children s children shall revile the ashes of the fathers Woe woe woe at the judgment when all the persecuted and all the slain in this bloody land and the father the mother and the child shall await them in a day that they cannot escape Seed of the faith seed of the faith ye whose hearts are moving with a power that ye know not arise wash your hands of this innocent blood Lift your voices chosen ones cry aloud and call down a woe and a judgment with me Having thus given vent to the flood of malignity which she mistook for inspiration the speaker was silent Her voice was succeeded by the hysteric shrieks of several women but the feelings of the audience generally had not been drawn onward in the current with her own They remained stupefied stranded as it were in the midst of a torrent which deafened them by its roaring but might not move them by its violence The clergyman who could not hitherto have ejected the usurper of his pulpit otherwise than by bodily force now addressed her in the tone of just indignation and legitimate authority Get you down woman from the holy place which you profane he said Is it to the Lord s house that you come to pour forth the foulness of your heart and the inspiration of the devil Get you down and remember that the sentence of death is on you yea and shall be executed were it but for this day s work I go friend I go for the voice hath had its utterance replied she in a depressed and even mild tone I have done my mission unto thee and to thy people reward me with stripes imprisonment or death as ye shall be permitted The weakness of exhausted passion caused her steps to totter as she descended the pulpit stairs The people in the mean while were stirring to and fro on the floor of the house whispering among themselves and glancing toward the intruder Many of them now recognized her as the woman who had assaulted the governor with frightful language as he passed by the window of her prison they knew also that she was adjudged to suffer death and had been preserved only by an involuntary banishment into the wilderness The new outrage by which she had provoked her fate seemed to render further lenity impossible and a gentleman in military dress with a stout man of inferior rank drew toward the door of the meetinghouse and awaited her approach Scarcely did her feet press the floor however when an unexpected scene occurred In that moment of her peril when every eye frowned with death a little timid boy threw his arms round his mother I am here mother it is I and I will go with thee to prison he exclaimed She gazed at him with a doubtful and almost frightened expression for she knew that the boy had been cast out to perish and she had not hoped to see his face again She feared perhaps that it was but one of the happy visions with which her excited fancy had often deceived her in the solitude of the desert or in prison but when she felt his hand warm within her own and heard his little eloquence of childish love she began to know that she was yet a mother Blessed art thou my son she sobbed My heart was withered yea dead with thee and with thy father and now it leaps as in the first moment when I pressed thee to my bosom She knelt down and embraced him again and again while the joy that could find no words expressed itself in broken accents like the bubbles gushing up to vanish at the surface of a deep fountain The sorrows of past years and the darker peril that was nigh cast not a shadow on the brightness of that fleeting moment Soon however the spectators saw a change upon her face as the consciousness of her sad estate returned and grief supplied the fount of tears which joy had opened By the words she uttered it would seem that the indulgence of natural love had given her mind a momentary sense of its errors and made her know how far she had strayed from duty in following the dictates of a wild fanaticism In a doleful hour art thou returned to me poor boy she said for thy mother s path has gone darkening onward till now the end is death Son son I have borne thee in my arms when my limbs were tottering and I have fed thee with the food that I was fainting for yet I have ill performed a mother s part by thee in life and now I leave thee no inheritance but woe and shame Thou wilt go seeking through the world and find all hearts closed against thee and their sweet affections turned to bitterness for my sake My child my child how many a pang awaits thy gentle spirit and I the cause of all She hid her face on Ilbrahim s head and her long raven hair discolored with the ashes of her mourning fell down about him like a veil A low and interrupted moan was the voice of her heart s anguish and it did not fail to move the sympathies of many who mistook their involuntary virtue for a sin Sobs were audible in the female section of the house and every man who was a father drew his hand across his eyes Tobias Pearson was agitated and uneasy but a certain feeling like the consciousness of guilt oppressed him so that he could not go forth and offer himself as the protector of the child Dorothy however had watched her husband s eye Her mind was free from the influence that had begun to work on his and she drew near the Quaker woman and addressed her in the hearing of all the congregation Stranger trust this boy to me and I will be his mother she said taking Ilbrahim s hand Providence has signally marked out my husband to protect him and he has fed at our table and lodged under our roof now many days till our hearts have grown very strongly unto him Leave the tender child with us and be at ease concerning his welfare The Quaker rose from the ground but drew the boy closer to her while she gazed earnestly in Dorothy s face Her mild but saddened features and neat matronly attire harmonized together and were like a verse of fireside poetry Her very aspect proved that she was blameless so far as mortal could be so in respect to God and man while the enthusiast in her robe of sackcloth and girdle of knotted cord had as evidently violated the duties of the present life and the future by fixing her attention wholly on the latter The two females as they held each a hand of Ilbrahim formed a practical allegory it was rational piety and unbridled fanaticism contending for the empire of a young heart Thou art not of our people said the Quaker mournfully No we are not of your people replied Dorothy with mildness but we are Christians looking upward to the same heaven with you Doubt not that your boy shall meet you there if there be a blessing on our tender and prayerful guidance of him Thither I trust my own children have gone before me for I also have been a mother I am no longer so she added in a faltering tone and your son will have all my care But will ye lead him in the path which his parents have trodden demanded the Quaker Can ye teach him the enlightened faith which his father has died for and for which I even I am soon to become an unworthy martyr The boy has been baptized in blood will ye keep the mark fresh and ruddy upon his forehead I will not deceive you answered Dorothy If your child become our child we must breed him up in the instruction which Heaven has imparted to us we must pray for him the prayers of our own faith we must do toward him according to the dictates of our own consciences and not of yours Were we to act otherwise we should abuse your trust even in complying with your wishes The mother looked down upon her boy with a troubled countenance and then turned her eyes upward to heaven She seemed to pray internally and the contention of her soul was evident Friend she said at length to Dorothy I doubt not that my son shall receive all earthly tenderness at thy hands Nay I will believe that even thy imperfect lights may guide him to a better world for surely thou art on the path thither But thou hast spoken of a husband Doth he stand here among this multitude of people Let him come forth for I must know to whom I commit this most precious trust She turned her face upon the male auditors and after a momentary delay Tobias Pearson came forth from among them The Quaker saw the dress which marked his military rank and shook her head but then she noted the hesitating air the eyes that struggled with her own and were vanquished the color that went and came and could find no resting place As she gazed an unmirthful smile spread over her features like sunshine that grows melancholy in some desolate spot Her lips moved inaudibly but at length she spake I hear it I hear it The voice speaketh within me and saith Leave thy child Catharine for his place is here and go hence for I have other work for thee Break the bonds of natural affection martyr thy love and know that in all these things eternal wisdom hath its ends I go friends I go Take ye my boy my precious jewel I go hence trusting that all shall be well and that even for his infant hands there is a labor in the vineyard She knelt down and whispered to Ilbrahim who at first struggled and clung to his mother with sobs and tears but remained passive when she had kissed his cheek and arisen from the ground Having held her hands over his head in mental prayer she was ready to depart Farewell friends in mine extremity she said to Pearson and his wife the good deed ye have done me is a treasure laid up in heaven to be returned a thousandfold hereafter And farewell ye mine enemies to whom it is not permitted to harm so much as a hair of my head nor to stay my footsteps even for a moment The day is coming when ye shall call upon me to witness for ye to this one sin uncommitted and I will rise up and answer She turned her steps toward the door and the men who had stationed themselves to guard it withdrew and suffered her to pass A general sentiment of pity overcame the virulence of religious hatred Sanctified by her love and her affliction she went forth and all the people gazed after her till she had journeyed up the hill and was lost behind its brow She went the apostle of her own unquiet heart to renew the wanderings of past years For her voice had been already heard in many lands of Christendom and she had pined in the cells of a Catholic Inquisition before she felt the lash and lay in the dungeons of the Puritans Her mission had extended also to the followers of the Prophet and from them she had received the courtesy and kindness which all the contending sects of our purer religion united to deny her Her husband and herself had resided many months in Turkey where even the sultan s countenance was gracious to them in that pagan land too was Ilbrahim s birthplace and his Oriental name was a mark of gratitude for the good deeds of an unbeliever When Pearson and his wife had thus acquired all the rights over Ilbrahim that could be delegated their affection for him became like the memory of their native land or their mild sorrow for the dead a piece of the immovable furniture of their hearts The boy also after a week or two of mental disquiet began to gratify his protectors by many inadvertent proofs that he considered them as parents and their house as home Before the winter snows were melted the persecuted infant the little wanderer from a remote and heathen country seemed native in the New England cottage and inseparable from the warmth and security of its hearth Under the influence of kind treatment and in the consciousness that he was loved Ilbrahim s demeanor lost a premature manliness which had resulted from his earlier situation he became more childlike and his natural character displayed itself with freedom It was in many respects a beautiful one yet the disordered imaginations of both his father and mother had perhaps propagated a certain unhealthiness in the mind of the boy In his general state Ilbrahim would derive enjoyment from the most trifling events and from every object about him he seemed to discover rich treasures of happiness by a faculty analogous to that of the witch hazel which points to hidden gold where all is barren to the eye His airy gayety coming to him from a thousand sources communicated itself to the family and Ilbrahim was like a domesticated sunbeam brightening moody countenances and chasing away the gloom from the dark corners of the cottage On the other hand as the susceptibility of pleasure is also that of pain the exuberant cheerfulness of the boy s prevailing temper sometimes yielded to moments of deep depression His sorrows could not always be followed up to their original source but most frequently they appeared to flow though Ilbrahim was young to be sad for such a cause from wounded love The flightiness of his mirth rendered him often guilty of offences against the decorum of a Puritan household and on these occasions he did not invariably escape rebuke But the slightest word of real bitterness which he was infallible in distinguishing from pretended anger seemed to sink into his heart and poison all his enjoyments till he became sensible that he was entirely forgiven Of the malice which generally accompanies a superfluity of sensitiveness Ilbrahim was altogether destitute When trodden upon he would not turn when wounded he could but die His mind was wanting in the stamina of self support It was a plant that would twine beautifully round something stronger than itself but if repulsed or torn away it had no choice but to wither on the ground Dorothy s acuteness taught her that severity would crush the spirit of the child and she nurtured him with the gentle care of one who handles a butterfly Her husband manifested an equal affection although it grew daily less productive of familiar caresses The feelings of the neighboring people in regard to the Quaker infant and his protectors had not undergone a favorable change in spite of the momentary triumph which the desolate mother had obtained over their sympathies The scorn and bitterness of which he was the object were very grievous to Ilbrahim especially when any circumstance made him sensible that the children his equals in age partook of the enmity of their parents His tender and social nature had already overflowed in attachments to everything about him and still there was a residue of unappropriated love which he yearned to bestow upon the little ones who were taught to hate him As the warm days of spring came on Ilbrahim was accustomed to remain for hours silent and inactive within hearing of the children s voices at their play yet with his usual delicacy of feeling he avoided their notice and would flee and hide himself from the smallest individual among them Chance however at length seemed to open a medium of communication between his heart and theirs it was by means of a boy about two years older than Ilbrahim who was injured by a fall from a tree in the vicinity of Pearson s habitation As the sufferer s own home was at some distance Dorothy willingly received him under her roof and became his tender and careful nurse Ilbrahim was the unconscious possessor of much skill in physiognomy and it would have deterred him in other circumstances from attempting to make a friend of this boy The countenance of the latter immediately impressed a beholder disagreeably but it required some examination to discover that the cause was a very slight distortion of the mouth and the irregular broken line and near approach of the eyebrows Analogous perhaps to these trifling deformities was an almost imperceptible twist of every joint and the uneven prominence of the breast forming a body regular in its general outline but faulty in almost all its details The disposition of the boy was sullen and reserved and the village schoolmaster stigmatized him as obtuse in intellect although at a later period of life he evinced ambition and very peculiar talents But whatever might be his personal or moral irregularities Ilbrahim s heart seized upon and clung to him from the moment that he was brought wounded into the cottage the child of persecution seemed to compare his own fate with that of the sufferer and to feel that even different modes of misfortune had created a sort of relationship between them Food rest and the fresh air for which he languished were neglected he nestled continually by the bedside of the little stranger and with a fond jealousy endeavored to be the medium of all the cares that were bestowed upon him As the boy became convalescent Ilbrahim contrived games suitable to his situation or amused him by a faculty which he had perhaps breathed in with the air of his barbaric birthplace It was that of reciting imaginary adventures on the spur of the moment and apparently in inexhaustible succession His tales were of course monstrous disjointed and without aim but they were curious on account of a vein of human tenderness which ran through them all and was like a sweet familiar face encountered in the midst of wild and unearthly scenery The auditor paid much attention to these romances and sometimes interrupted them by brief remarks upon the incidents displaying shrewdness above his years mingled with a moral obliquity which grated very harshly against Ilbrahim s instinctive rectitude Nothing however could arrest the progress of the latter s affection and there were many proofs that it met with a response from the dark and stubborn nature on which it was lavished The boy s parents at length removed him to complete his cure under their own roof Ilbrahim did not visit his new friend after his departure but he made anxious and continual inquiries respecting him and informed himself of the day when he was to reappear among his playmates On a pleasant summer afternoon the children of the neighborhood had assembled in the little forest crowned amphitheatre behind the meeting house and the recovering invalid was there leaning on a staff The glee of a score of untainted bosoms was heard in light and airy voices which danced among the trees like sunshine become audible the grown men of this weary world as they journeyed by the spot marvelled why life beginning in such brightness should proceed in gloom and their hearts or their imaginations answered them and said that the bliss of childhood gushes from its innocence But it happened that an unexpected addition was made to the heavenly little band It was Ilbrahim who came toward the children with a look of sweet confidence on his fair and spiritual face as if having manifested his love to one of them he had no longer to fear a repulse from their society A hush came over their mirth the moment they beheld him and they stood whispering to each other while he drew nigh but all at once the devil of their fathers entered into the unbreeched fanatics and sending up a fierce shrill cry they rushed upon the poor Quaker child In an instant he was the centre of a brood of baby fiends who lifted sticks against him pelted him with stones and displayed an instinct of destruction far more loathsome than the bloodthirstiness of manhood The invalid in the mean while stood apart from the tumult crying out with a loud voice Fear not Ilbrahim come hither and take my hand and his unhappy friend endeavored to obey him After watching the victim s struggling approach with a calm smile and unabashed eye the foul hearted little villain lifted his staff and struck Ilbrahim on the mouth so forcibly that the blood issued in a stream The poor child s arms had been raised to guard his head from the storm of blows but now he dropped them at once His persecutors beat him down trampled upon him dragged him by his long fair locks and Ilbrahim was on the point of becoming as veritable a martyr as ever entered bleeding into heaven The uproar however attracted the notice of a few neighbors who put themselves to the trouble of rescuing the little heretic and of conveying him to Pearson s door Ilbrahim s bodily harm was severe but long and careful nursing accomplished his recovery the injury done to his sensitive spirit was more serious though not so visible Its signs were principally of a negative character and to be discovered only by those who had previously known him His gait was thenceforth slow even and unvaried by the sudden bursts of sprightlier motion which had once corresponded to his overflowing gladness his countenance was heavier and its former play of expression the dance of sunshine reflected from moving water was destroyed by the cloud over his existence his notice was attracted in a far less degree by passing events and he appeared to find greater difficulty in comprehending what was new to him than at a happier period A stranger founding his judgment upon these circumstances would have said that the dulness of the child s intellect widely contradicted the promise of his features but the secret was in the direction of Ilbrahim s thoughts which were brooding within him when they should naturally have been wandering abroad An attempt of Dorothy to revive his former sportiveness was the single occasion on which his quiet demeanor yielded to a violent display of grief he burst into passionate weeping and ran and hid himself for his heart had become so miserably sore that even the hand of kindness tortured it like fire Sometimes at night and probably in his dreams he was heard to cry Mother Mother as if her place which a stranger had supplied while Ilbrahim was happy admitted of no substitute in his extreme affliction Perhaps among the many life weary wretches then upon the earth there was not one who combined innocence and misery like this poor broken hearted infant so soon the victim of his own heavenly nature While this melancholy change had taken place in Ilbrahim one of an earlier origin and of different character had come to its perfection in his adopted father The incident with which this tale commences found Pearson in a state of religious dulness yet mentally disquieted and longing for a more fervid faith than he possessed The first effect of his kindness to Ilbrahim was to produce a softened feeling an incipient love for the child s whole sect but joined to this and resulting perhaps from self suspicion was a proud and ostentatious contempt of their tenets and practical extravagances In the course of much thought however for the subject struggled irresistibly into his mind the foolishness of the doctrine began to be less evident and the points which had particularly offended his reason assumed another aspect or vanished entirely away The work within him appeared to go on even while he slept and that which had been a doubt when he laid down to rest would often hold the place of a truth confirmed by some forgotten demonstration when he recalled his thoughts in the morning But while he was thus becoming assimilated to the enthusiasts his contempt in nowise decreasing toward them grew very fierce against himself he imagined also that every face of his acquaintance wore a sneer and that every word addressed to him was a gibe Such was his state of mind at the period of Ilbrahim s misfortune and the emotions consequent upon that event completed the change of which the child had been the original instrument In the mean time neither the fierceness of the persecutors nor the infatuation of their victims had decreased The dungeons were never empty the streets of almost every village echoed daily with the lash the life of a woman whose mild and Christian spirit no cruelty could embitter had been sacrificed and more innocent blood was yet to pollute the hands that were so often raised in prayer Early after the Restoration the English Quakers represented to Charles II that a vein of blood was open in his dominions but though the displeasure of the voluptuous king was roused his interference was not prompt And now the tale must stride forward over many months leaving Pearson to encounter ignominy and misfortune his wife to a firm endurance of a thousand sorrows poor Ilbrahim to pine and droop like a cankered rose bud his mother to wander on a mistaken errand neglectful of the holiest trust which can be committed to a woman A winter evening a night of storm had darkened over Pearson s habitation and there were no cheerful faces to drive the gloom from his broad hearth The fire it is true sent forth a glowing heat and a ruddy light and large logs dripping with half melted snow lay ready to cast upon the embers But the apartment was saddened in its aspect by the absence of much of the homely wealth which had once adorned it for the exaction of repeated fines and his own neglect of temporal affairs had greatly impoverished the owner And with the furniture of peace the implements of war had likewise disappeared the sword was broken the helm and cuirass were cast away for ever the soldier had done with battles and might not lift so much as his naked hand to guard his head But the Holy Book remained and the table on which it rested was drawn before the fire while two of the persecuted sect sought comfort from its pages He who listened while the other read was the master of the house now emaciated in form and altered as to the expression and healthiness of his countenance for his mind had dwelt too long among visionary thoughts and his body had been worn by imprisonment and stripes The hale and weatherbeaten old man who sat beside him had sustained less injury from a far longer course of the same mode of life In person he was tall and dignified and which alone would have made him hateful to the Puritans his gray locks fell from beneath the broad brimmed hat and rested on his shoulders As the old man read the sacred page the snow drifted against the windows or eddied in at the crevices of the door while a blast kept laughing in the chimney and the blaze leaped fiercely up to seek it And sometimes when the wind struck the hill at a certain angle and swept down by the cottage across the wintry plain its voice was the most doleful that can be conceived it came as if the past were speaking as if the dead had contributed each a whisper as if the desolation of ages were breathed in that one lamenting sound The Quaker at length closed the book retaining however his hand between the pages which he had been reading while he looked steadfastly at Pearson The attitude and features of the latter might have indicated the endurance of bodily pain he leaned his forehead on his hands his teeth were firmly closed and his frame was tremulous at intervals with a nervous agitation Friend Tobias inquired the old man compassionately hast thou found no comfort in these many blessed passages of Scripture Thy voice has fallen on my ear like a sound afar off and indistinct replied Pearson without lifting his eyes Yea and when I have hearkened carefully the words seemed cold and lifeless and intended for another and a lesser grief than mine Remove the book he added in a tone of sullen bitterness I have no part in its consolations and they do but fret my sorrow the more Nay feeble brother be not as one who hath never known the light said the elder Quaker earnestly but with mildness Art thou he that wouldst be content to give all and endure all for conscience sake desiring even peculiar trials that thy faith might be purified and thy heart weaned from worldly desires And wilt thou sink beneath an affliction which happens alike to them that have their portion here below and to them that lay up treasure in heaven Faint not for thy burden is yet light It is heavy It is heavier than I can bear exclaimed Pearson with the impatience of a variable spirit From my youth upward I have been a man marked out for wrath and year by year yea day after day I have endured sorrows such as others know not in their lifetime And now I speak not of the love that has been turned to hatred the honor to ignominy the ease and plentifulness of all things to danger want and nakedness All this I could have borne and counted myself blessed But when my heart was desolate with many losses I fixed it upon the child of a stranger and he became dearer to me than all my buried ones and now he too must die as if my love were poison Verily I am an accursed man and I will lay me down in the dust and lift up my head no more Thou sinnest brother but it is not for me to rebuke thee for I also have had my hours of darkness wherein I have murmured against the cross said the old Quaker He continued perhaps in the hope of distracting his companion s thoughts from his own sorrows Even of late was the light obscured within me when the men of blood had banished me on pain of death and the constables led me onward from village to village toward the wilderness A strong and cruel hand was wielding the knotted cords they sunk deep into the flesh and thou mightst have tracked every reel and totter of my footsteps by the blood that followed As we went on Have I not borne all this and have I murmured interrupted Pearson impatiently Nay friend but hear me continued the other As we journeyed on night darkened on our path so that no man could see the rage of the persecutors or the constancy of my endurance though Heaven forbid that I should glory therein The lights began to glimmer in the cottage windows and I could discern the inmates as they gathered in comfort and security every man with his wife and children by their own evening hearth At length we came to a tract of fertile land In the dim light the forest was not visible around it and behold there was a straw thatched dwelling which bore the very aspect of my home far over the wild ocean far in our own England Then came bitter thoughts upon me yea remembrances that were like death to my soul The happiness of my early days was painted to me the disquiet of my manhood the altered faith of my declining years I remembered how I had been moved to go forth a wanderer when my daughter the youngest the dearest of my flock lay on her dying bed and Couldst thou obey the command at such a moment exclaimed Pearson shuddering Yea yea replied the old man hurriedly I was kneeling by her bedside when the voice spoke loud within me but immediately I rose and took my staff and gat me gone Oh that it were permitted me to forget her woeful look when I thus withdrew my arm and left her journeying through the dark valley alone for her soul was faint and she had leaned upon my prayers Now in that night of horror I was assailed by the thought that I had been an erring Christian and a cruel parent yea even my daughter with her pale dying features seemed to stand by me and whisper Father you are deceived go home and shelter your gray head O Thou to whom I have looked in my furthest wanderings continued the Quaker raising his agitated eyes to heaven inflict not upon the bloodiest of our persecutors the unmitigated agony of my soul when I believed that all I had done and suffered for thee was at the instigation of a mocking fiend But I yielded not I knelt down and wrestled with the tempter while the scourge bit more fiercely into the flesh My prayer was heard and I went on in peace and joy toward the wilderness The old man though his fanaticism had generally all the calmness of reason was deeply moved while reciting this tale and his unwonted emotion seemed to rebuke and keep down that of his companion They sat in silence with their faces to the fire imagining perhaps in its red embers new scenes of persecution yet to be encountered The snow still drifted hard against the windows and sometimes as the blaze of the logs had gradually sunk came down the spacious chimney and hissed upon the hearth A cautious footstep might now and then be heard in a neighboring apartment and the sound invariably drew the eyes of both Quakers to the door which led thither When a fierce and riotous gust of wind had led his thoughts by a natural association to homeless travellers on such a night Pearson resumed the conversation I have wellnigh sunk under my own share of this trial observed he sighing heavily yet I would that it might be doubled to me if so the child s mother could be spared Her wounds have been deep and many but this will be the sorest of all Fear not for Catharine replied the old Quaker for I know that valiant woman and have seen how she can bear the cross A mother s heart indeed is strong in her and may seem to contend mightily with her faith but soon she will stand up and give thanks that her son has been thus early an accepted sacrifice The boy hath done his work and she will feel that he is taken hence in kindness both to him and her Blessed blessed are they that with so little suffering can enter into peace The fitful rush of the wind was now disturbed by a portentous sound it was a quick and heavy knocking at the outer door Pearson s wan countenance grew paler for many a visit of persecution had taught him what to dread the old man on the other hand stood up erect and his glance was firm as that of the tried soldier who awaits his enemy The men of blood have come to seek me he observed with calmness They have heard how I was moved to return from banishment and now am I to be led to prison and thence to death It is an end I have long looked for I will open unto them lest they say Lo he feareth Nay I will present myself before them said Pearson with recovered fortitude It may be that they seek me alone and know not that thou abidest with me Let us go boldly both one and the other rejoined his companion It is not fitting that thou or I should shrink They therefore proceeded through the entry to the door which they opened bidding the applicant Come in in God s name A furious blast of wind drove the storm into their faces and extinguished the lamp they had barely time to discern a figure so white from head to foot with the drifted snow that it seemed like Winter s self come in human shape to seek refuge from its own desolation Enter friend and do thy errand be it what it may said Pearson It must needs be pressing since thou comest on such a bitter night Peace be with this household said the stranger when they stood on the floor of the inner apartment Pearson started the elder Quaker stirred the slumbering embers of the fire till they sent up a clear and lofty blaze It was a female voice that had spoken it was a female form that shone out cold and wintry in that comfortable light Catharine blessed woman exclaimed the old man art thou come to this darkened land again Art thou come to bear a valiant testimony as in former years The scourge hath not prevailed against thee and from the dungeon hast thou come forth triumphant but strengthen strengthen now thy heart Catharine for Heaven will prove thee yet this once ere thou go to thy reward Rejoice friends she replied Thou who hast long been of our people and thou whom a little child hath led to us rejoice Lo I come the messenger of glad tidings for the day of persecution is over past The heart of the king even Charles hath been moved in gentleness toward us and he hath sent forth his letters to stay the hands of the men of blood A ship s company of our friends hath arrived at yonder town and I also sailed joyfully among them As Catharine spoke her eyes were roaming about the room in search of him for whose sake security was dear to her Pearson made a silent appeal to the old man nor did the latter shrink from the painful task assigned him Sister he began in a softened yet perfectly calm tone thou tellest us of his love manifested in temporal good and now must we speak to thee of that selfsame love displayed in chastenings Hitherto Catharine thou hast been as one journeying in a darksome and difficult path and leading an infant by the hand fain wouldst thou have looked heavenward continually but still the cares of that little child have drawn thine eyes and thy affections to the earth Sister go on rejoicing for his tottering footsteps shall impede thine own no more But the unhappy mother was not thus to be consoled She shook like a leaf she turned white as the very snow that hung drifted into her hair The firm old man extended his hand and held her up keeping his eye upon hers as if to repress any outbreak of passion I am a woman I am but a woman will He try me above my strength said Catharine very quickly and almost in a whisper I have been wounded sore I have suffered much many things in the body many in the mind crucified in myself and in them that were dearest to me Surely added she with a long shudder he hath spared me in this one thing She broke forth with sudden and irrepressible violence Tell me man of cold heart what has God done to me Hath he cast me down never to rise again Hath he crushed my very heart in his hand And thou to whom I committed my child how hast thou fulfilled thy trust Give me back the boy well sound alive alive or earth and heaven shall avenge me The agonized shriek of Catharine was answered by the faint the very faint voice of a child On this day it had become evident to Pearson to his aged guest and to Dorothy that Ilbrahim s brief and troubled pilgrimage drew near its close The two former would willingly have remained by him to make use of the prayers and pious discourses which they deemed appropriate to the time and which if they be impotent as to the departing traveller s reception in the world whither he goes may at least sustain him in bidding adieu to earth But though Ilbrahim uttered no complaint he was disturbed by the faces that looked upon him so that Dorothy s entreaties and their own conviction that the child s feet might tread heaven s pavement and not soil it had induced the two Quakers to remove Ilbrahim then closed his eyes and grew calm and except for now and then a kind and low word to his nurse might have been thought to slumber As nightfall came on however and the storm began to rise something seemed to trouble the repose of the boy s mind and to render his sense of hearing active and acute If a passing wind lingered to shake the casement he strove to turn his head toward it if the door jarred to and fro upon its hinges he looked long and anxiously thitherward if the heavy voice of the old man as he read the Scriptures rose but a little higher the child almost held his dying breath to listen if a snowdrift swept by the cottage with a sound like the trailing of a garment Ilbrahim seemed to watch that some visitant should enter But after a little time he relinquished whatever secret hope had agitated him and with one low complaining whisper turned his cheek upon the pillow He then addressed Dorothy with his usual sweetness and besought her to draw near him she did so and Ilbrahim took her hand in both of his grasping it with a gentle pressure as if to assure himself that he retained it At intervals and without disturbing the repose of his countenance a very faint trembling passed over him from head to foot as if a mild but somewhat cool wind had breathed upon him and made him shiver As the boy thus led her by the hand in his quiet progress over the borders of eternity Dorothy almost imagined that she could discern the near though dim delightfulness of the home he was about to reach she would not have enticed the little wanderer back though she bemoaned herself that she must leave him and return But just when Ilbrahim s feet were pressing on the soil of Paradise he heard a voice behind him and it recalled him a few few paces of the weary path which he had travelled As Dorothy looked upon his features she perceived that their placid expression was again disturbed Her own thoughts had been so wrapped in him that all sounds of the storm and of human speech were lost to her but when Catharine s shriek pierced through the room the boy strove to raise himself Friend she is come Open unto her cried he In a moment his mother was kneeling by the bedside she drew Ilbrahim to her bosom and he nestled there with no violence of joy but contentedly as if he were hushing himself to sleep He looked into her face and reading its agony said with feeble earnestness Mourn not dearest mother I am happy now and with these words the gentle boy was dead The king s mandate to stay the New England persecutors was effectual in preventing further martyrdoms but the colonial authorities trusting in the remoteness of their situation and perhaps in the supposed instability of the royal government shortly renewed their severities in all other respects Catharine s fanaticism had become wilder by the sundering of all human ties and wherever a scourge was lifted there was she to receive the blow and whenever a dungeon was unbarred thither she came to cast herself upon the floor But in process of time a more Christian spirit a spirit of forbearance though not of cordiality or approbation began to pervade the land in regard to the persecuted sect And then when the rigid old Pilgrims eyed her rather in pity than in wrath when the matrons fed her with the fragments of their children s food and offered her a lodging on a hard and lowly bed when no little crowd of schoolboys left their sports to cast stones after the roving enthusiast then did Catharine return to Pearson s dwelling and made that her home As if Ilbrahim s sweetness yet lingered round his ashes as if his gentle spirit came down from heaven to teach his parent a true religion her fierce and vindictive nature was softened by the same griefs which had once irritated it When the course of years had made the features of the unobtrusive mourner familiar in the settlement she became a subject of not deep but general interest a being on whom the otherwise superfluous sympathies of all might be bestowed Every one spoke of her with that degree of pity which it is pleasant to experience every one was ready to do her the little kindnesses which are not costly yet manifest good will and when at last she died a long train of her once bitter persecutors followed her with decent sadness and tears that were not painful to her place by Ilbrahim s green and sunken grave mister HIGGINBOTHAM S CATASTROPHE A young fellow a tobacco pedler by trade was on his way from Morristown where he had dealt largely with the deacon of the Shaker settlement to the village of Parker s Falls on Salmon River He had a neat little cart painted green with a box of cigars depicted on each side panel and an Indian chief holding a pipe and a golden tobacco stalk on the rear The pedler drove a smart little mare and was a young man of excellent character keen at a bargain but none the worse liked by the Yankees who as I have heard them say would rather be shaved with a sharp razor than a dull one Especially was he beloved by the pretty girls along the Connecticut whose favor he used to court by presents of the best smoking tobacco in his stock knowing well that the country lasses of New England are generally great performers on pipes Moreover as will be seen in the course of my story the pedler was inquisitive and something of a tattler always itching to hear the news and anxious to tell it again After an early breakfast at Morristown the tobacco pedler whose name was Dominicus Pike had travelled seven miles through a solitary piece of woods without speaking a word to anybody but himself and his little gray mare It being nearly seven o clock he was as eager to hold a morning gossip as a city shopkeeper to read the morning paper An opportunity seemed at hand when after lighting a cigar with a sun glass he looked up and perceived a man coming over the brow of the hill at the foot of which the pedler had stopped his green cart Dominicus watched him as he descended and noticed that he carried a bundle over his shoulder on the end of a stick and travelled with a weary yet determined pace He did not look as if he had started in the freshness of the morning but had footed it all night and meant to do the same all day Good morning mister said Dominicus when within speaking distance You go a pretty good jog What s the latest news at Parker s Falls The man pulled the broad brim of a gray hat over his eyes and answered rather sullenly that he did not come from Parker s Falls which as being the limit of his own day s journey the pedler had naturally mentioned in his inquiry Well then rejoined Dominicus Pike let s have the latest news where you did come from I m not particular about Parker s Falls Any place will answer Being thus importuned the traveller who was as ill looking a fellow as one would desire to meet in a solitary piece of woods appeared to hesitate a little as if he was either searching his memory for news or weighing the expediency of telling it At last mounting on the step of the cart he whispered in the ear of Dominicus though he might have shouted aloud and no other mortal would have heard him I do remember one little trifle of news said he Old mister Higginbotham of Kimballton was murdered in his orchard at eight o clock last night by an Irishman and a nigger They strung him up to the branch of a saint Michael s pear tree where nobody would find him till the morning As soon as this horrible intelligence was communicated the stranger betook himself to his journey again with more speed than ever not even turning his head when Dominicus invited him to smoke a Spanish cigar and relate all the particulars The pedler whistled to his mare and went up the hill pondering on the doleful fate of mister Higginbotham whom he had known in the way of trade having sold him many a bunch of long nines and a great deal of pig tail lady s twist and fig tobacco He was rather astonished at the rapidity with which the news had spread Kimballton was nearly sixty miles distant in a straight line the murder had been perpetrated only at eight o clock the preceding night yet Dominicus had heard of it at seven in the morning when in all probability poor mister Higginbotham s own family had but just discovered his corpse hanging on the saint Michael s pear tree The stranger on foot must have worn seven league boots to travel at such a rate Ill news flies fast they say thought Dominicus Pike but this beats railroads The fellow ought to be hired to go express with the President s message The difficulty was solved by supposing that the narrator had made a mistake of one day in the date of the occurrence so that our friend did not hesitate to introduce the story at every tavern and country store along the road expending a whole bunch of Spanish wrappers among at least twenty horrified audiences He found himself invariably the first bearer of the intelligence and was so pestered with questions that he could not avoid filling up the outline till it became quite a respectable narrative He met with one piece of corroborative evidence mister Higginbotham was a trader and a former clerk of his to whom Dominicus related the facts testified that the old gentleman was accustomed to return home through the orchard about nightfall with the money and valuable papers of the store in his pocket The clerk manifested but little grief at mister Higginbotham s catastrophe hinting what the pedler had discovered in his own dealings with him that he was a crusty old fellow as close as a vise His property would descend to a pretty niece who was now keeping school in Kimballton What with telling the news for the public good and driving bargains for his own Dominicus was so much delayed on the road that he chose to put up at a tavern about five miles short of Parker s Falls After supper lighting one of his prime cigars he seated himself in the bar room and went through the story of the murder which had grown so fast that it took him half an hour to tell There were as many as twenty people in the room nineteen of whom received it all for gospel But the twentieth was an elderly farmer who had arrived on horseback a short time before and was now seated in a corner smoking his pipe When the story was concluded he rose up very deliberately brought his chair right in front of Dominicus and stared him full in the face puffing out the vilest tobacco smoke the pedler had ever smelt Will you make affidavit demanded he in the tone of a country justice taking an examination that old Squire Higginbotham of Kimballton was murdered in his orchard the night before last and found hanging on his great pear tree yesterday morning I tell the story as I heard it mister answered Dominicus dropping his half burnt cigar I don t say that I saw the thing done so I can t take my oath that he was murdered exactly in that way But I can take mine said the farmer that if Squire Higginbotham was murdered night before last I drank a glass of bitters with his ghost this morning Being a neighbor of mine he called me into his store as I was riding by and treated me and then asked me to do a little business for him on the road He didn t seem to know any more about his own murder than I did Why then it can t be a fact exclaimed Dominicus Pike I guess he d have mentioned if it was said the old farmer and he removed his chair back to the corner leaving Dominicus quite down in the mouth Here was a sad resurrection of old mister Higginbotham The pedler had no heart to mingle in the conversation any more but comforted himself with a glass of gin and water and went to bed where all night long he dreamed of hanging on the saint Michael s pear tree To avoid the old farmer whom he so detested that his suspension would have pleased him better than mister Higginbotham s Dominicus rose in the gray of the morning put the little mare into the green cart and trotted swiftly away toward Parker s Falls The fresh breeze the dewy road and the pleasant summer dawn revived his spirits and might have encouraged him to repeat the old story had there been anybody awake to bear it but he met neither ox team light wagon chaise horseman nor foot traveller till just as he crossed Salmon River a man came trudging down to the bridge with a bundle over his shoulder on the end of a stick Good morning mister said the pedler reining in his mare If you come from Kimballton or that neighborhood maybe you can tell me the real fact about this affair of old mister Higginbotham Was the old fellow actually murdered two or three nights ago by an Irishman and a nigger Dominicus had spoken in too great a hurry to observe at first that the stranger himself had a deep tinge of negro blood On hearing this sudden question the Ethiopian appeared to change his skin its yellow hue becoming a ghastly white while shaking and stammering he thus replied No no There was no colored man It was an Irishman that hanged him last night at eight o clock I came away at seven His folks can t have looked for him in the orchard yet Scarcely had the yellow man spoken when he interrupted himself and though he seemed weary enough before continued his journey at a pace which would have kept the pedler s mare on a smart trot Dominicus stared after him in great perplexity If the murder had not been committed till Tuesday night who was the prophet that had foretold it in all its circumstances on Tuesday morning If mister Higginbotham s corpse were not yet discovered by his own family how came the mulatto at above thirty miles distance to know that he was hanging in the orchard especially as he had left Kimballton before the unfortunate man was hanged at all These ambiguous circumstances with the stranger s surprise and terror made Dominicus think of raising a hue and cry after him as an accomplice in the murder since a murder it seemed had really been perpetrated But let the poor devil go thought the pedler I don t want his black blood on my head and hanging the nigger wouldn t unhang mister Higginbotham Unhang the old gentleman It s a sin I know but I should hate to have him come to life a second time and give me the lie With these meditations Dominicus Pike drove into the street of Parker s Falls which as everybody knows is as thriving a village as three cotton factories and a slitting mill can make it The machinery was not in motion and but a few of the shop doors unbarred when he alighted in the stable yard of the tavern and made it his first business to order the mare four quarts of oats His second duty of course was to impart mister Higginbotham s catastrophe to the hostler He deemed it advisable however not to be too positive as to the date of the direful fact and also to be uncertain whether it were perpetrated by an Irishman and a mulatto or by the son of Erin alone Neither did he profess to relate it on his own authority or that of any one person but mentioned it as a report generally diffused The story ran through the town like fire among girdled trees and became so much the universal talk that nobody could tell whence it had originated mister Higginbotham was as well known at Parker s Falls as any citizen of the place being part owner of the slitting mill and a considerable stockholder in the cotton factories The inhabitants felt their own prosperity interested in his fate Such was the excitement that the Parker s Falls Gazette anticipated its regular day of publication and came out with half a form of blank paper and a column of double pica emphasized with capitals and headed HORRID MURDER OF mister HIGGINBOTHAM Among other dreadful details the printed account described the mark of the cord round the dead man s neck and stated the number of thousand dollars of which he had been robbed there was much pathos also about the affliction of his niece who had gone from one fainting fit to another ever since her uncle was found hanging on the saint Michael s pear tree with his pockets inside out The village poet likewise commemorated the young lady s grief in seventeen stanzas of a ballad The selectmen held a meeting and in consideration of mister Higginbotham s claims on the town determined to issue handbills offering a reward of five hundred dollars for the apprehension of his murderers and the recovery of the stolen property Meanwhile the whole population of Parker s Falls consisting of shopkeepers mistresses of boarding houses factory girls mill men and schoolboys rushed into the street and kept up such a terrible loquacity as more than compensated for the silence of the cotton machines which refrained from their usual din out of respect to the deceased Had mister Higginbotham cared about posthumous renown his untimely ghost would have exulted in this tumult Our friend Dominicus in his vanity of heart forgot his intended precautions and mounting on the town pump announced himself as the bearer of the authentic intelligence which had caused so wonderful a sensation He immediately became the great man of the moment and had just begun a new edition of the narrative with a voice like a field preacher when the mail stage drove into the village street It had travelled all night and must have shifted horses at Kimballton at three in the morning Now we shall hear all the particulars shouted the crowd The coach rumbled up to the piazza of the tavern followed by a thousand people for if any man had been minding his own business till then he now left it at sixes and sevens to hear the news The pedler foremost in the race discovered two passengers both of whom had been startled from a comfortable nap to find themselves in the centre of a mob Every man assailing them with separate questions all propounded at once the couple were struck speechless though one was a lawyer and the other a young lady mister Higginbotham mister Higginbotham Tell us the particulars about old mister Higginbotham bawled the mob What is the coroner s verdict Are the murderers apprehended Is mister Higginbotham s niece come out of her fainting fits mister Higginbotham mister Higginbotham The coachman said not a word except to swear awfully at the hostler for not bringing him a fresh team of horses The lawyer inside had generally his wits about him even when asleep the first thing he did after learning the cause of the excitement was to produce a large red pocketbook Meantime Dominicus Pike being an extremely polite young man and also suspecting that a female tongue would tell the story as glibly as a lawyer s had handed the lady out of the coach She was a fine smart girl now wide awake and bright as a button and had such a sweet pretty mouth that Dominicus would almost as lief have heard a love tale from it as a tale of murder Gentlemen and ladies said the lawyer to the shopkeepers the mill men and the factory girls I can assure you that some unaccountable mistake or more probably a wilful falsehood maliciously contrived to injure mister Higginbotham s credit has excited this singular uproar We passed through Kimballton at three o clock this morning and most certainly should have been informed of the murder had any been perpetrated But I have proof nearly as strong as mister Higginbotham s own oral testimony in the negative Here is a note relating to a suit of his in the Connecticut courts which was delivered me from that gentleman himself I find it dated at ten o clock last evening So saying the lawyer exhibited the date and signature of the note which irrefragably proved either that this perverse mister Higginbotham was alive when he wrote it or as some deemed the more probable case of two doubtful ones that he was so absorbed in worldly business as to continue to transact it even after his death But unexpected evidence was forthcoming The young lady after listening to the pedler s explanation merely seized a moment to smooth her gown and put her curls in order and then appeared at the tavern door making a modest signal to be heard Good people said she I am mister Higginbotham s niece A wondering murmur passed through the crowd on beholding her so rosy and bright that same unhappy niece whom they had supposed on the authority of the Parker s Falls Gazette to be lying at death s door in a fainting fit But some shrewd fellows had doubted all along whether a young lady would be quite so desperate at the hanging of a rich old uncle You see continued Miss Higginbotham with a smile that this strange story is quite unfounded as to myself and I believe I may affirm it to be equally so in regard to my dear uncle Higginbotham He has the kindness to give me a home in his house though I contribute to my own support by teaching a school I left Kimballton this morning to spend the vacation of commencement week with a friend about five miles from Parker s Falls My generous uncle when he heard me on the stairs called me to his bedside and gave me two dollars and fifty cents to pay my stage fare and another dollar for my extra expenses He then laid his pocketbook under his pillow shook hands with me and advised me to take some biscuit in my bag instead of breakfasting on the road I feel confident therefore that I left my beloved relative alive and trust that I shall find him so on my return The young lady courtesied at the close of her speech which was so sensible and well worded and delivered with such grace and propriety that everybody thought her fit to be preceptress of the best academy in the State But a stranger would have supposed that mister Higginbotham was an object of abhorrence at Parker s Falls and that a thanksgiving had been proclaimed for his murder so excessive was the wrath of the inhabitants on learning their mistake The mill men resolved to bestow public honors on Dominicus Pike only hesitating whether to tar and feather him ride him on a rail or refresh him with an ablution at the town pump on the top of which he had declared himself the bearer of the news The selectmen by advice of the lawyer spoke of prosecuting him for a misdemeanor in circulating unfounded reports to the great disturbance of the peace of the commonwealth Nothing saved Dominicus either from mob law or a court of justice but an eloquent appeal made by the young lady in his behalf Addressing a few words of heartfelt gratitude to his benefactress he mounted the green cart and rode out of town under a discharge of artillery from the schoolboys who found plenty of ammunition in the neighboring clay pits and mud holes As he turned his head to exchange a farewell glance with mister Higginbotham s niece a ball of the consistence of hasty pudding hit him slap in the mouth giving him a most grim aspect His whole person was so bespattered with the like filthy missiles that he had almost a mind to ride back and supplicate for the threatened ablution at the town pump for though not meant in kindness it would now have been a deed of charity However the sun shone bright on poor Dominicus and the mud an emblem of all stains of undeserved opprobrium was easily brushed off when dry Being a funny rogue his heart soon cheered up nor could he refrain from a hearty laugh at the uproar which his story had excited The handbills of the selectmen would cause the commitment of all the vagabonds in the State the paragraph in the Parker s Falls Gazette would be reprinted from Maine to Florida and perhaps form an item in the London newspapers and many a miser would tremble for his moneybags and life on learning the catastrophe of mister Higginbotham The pedler meditated with much fervor on the charms of the young schoolmistress and swore that Daniel Webster never spoke nor looked so like an angel as Miss Higginbotham while defending him from the wrathful populace at Parker s Falls Dominicus was now on the Kimballton turnpike having all along determined to visit that place though business had drawn him out of the most direct road from Morristown As he approached the scene of the supposed murder he continued to revolve the circumstances in his mind and was astonished at the aspect which the whole case assumed Had nothing occurred to corroborate the story of the first traveller it might now have been considered as a hoax but the yellow man was evidently acquainted either with the report or the fact and there was a mystery in his dismayed and guilty look on being abruptly questioned When to this singular combination of incidents it was added that the rumor tallied exactly with mister Higginbotham s character and habits of life and that he had an orchard and a saint Michael s pear tree near which he always passed at nightfall the circumstantial evidence appeared so strong that Dominicus doubted whether the autograph produced by the lawyer or even the niece s direct testimony ought to be equivalent Making cautious inquiries along the road the pedler further learned that mister Higginbotham had in his service an Irishman of doubtful character whom he had hired without a recommendation on the score of economy May I be hanged myself exclaimed Dominicus Pike aloud on reaching the top of a lonely hill if I ll believe old Higginbotham is unhanged till I see him with my own eyes and hear it from his own mouth And as he s a real shaver I ll have the minister or some other responsible man for an endorser It was growing dusk when he reached the toll house on Kimballton turnpike about a quarter of a mile from the village of this name His little mare was fast bringing him up with a man on horseback who trotted through the gate a few rods in advance of him nodded to the toll gatherer and kept on towards the village Dominicus was acquainted with the toll man and while making change the usual remarks on the weather passed between them I suppose said the pedler throwing back his whiplash to bring it down like a feather on the mare s flank you have not seen anything of old mister Higginbotham within a day or two Yes answered the toll gatherer he passed the gate just before you drove up and yonder he rides now if you can see him through the dusk He s been to Woodfield this afternoon attending a sheriff s sale there The old man generally shakes hands and has a little chat with me but to night he nodded as if to say Charge my toll and jogged on for wherever he goes he must always be at home by eight o clock So they tell me said Dominicus I never saw a man look so yellow and thin as the squire does continued the toll gatherer Says I to myself tonight He s more like a ghost or an old mummy than good flesh and blood The pedler strained his eyes through the twilight and could just discern the horseman now far ahead on the village road He seemed to recognize the rear of mister Higginbotham but through the evening shadows and amid the dust from the horse s feet the figure appeared dim and unsubstantial as if the shape of the mysterious old man were faintly moulded of darkness and gray light Dominicus shivered mister Higginbotham has come back from the other world by way of the Kimballton turnpike thought he He shook the reins and rode forward keeping about the same distance in the rear of the gray old shadow till the latter was concealed by a bend of the road On reaching this point the pedler no longer saw the man on horseback but found himself at the head of the village street not far from a number of stores and two taverns clustered round the meeting house steeple On his left was a stone wall and a gate the boundary of a wood lot beyond which lay an orchard farther still a mowing field and last of all a house These were the premises of mister Higginbotham whose dwelling stood beside the old highway but had been left in the background by the Kimballton turnpike Dominicus knew the place and the little mare stopped short by instinct for he was not conscious of tightening the reins For the soul of me I cannot get by this gate said he trembling I never shall be my own man again till I see whether mister Higginbotham is hanging on the saint Michael s pear tree He leaped from the cart gave the rein a turn round the gate post and ran along the green path of the wood lot as if Old Nick were chasing behind Just then the village clock tolled eight and as each deep stroke fell Dominicus gave a fresh bound and flew faster than before till dim in the solitary centre of the orchard he saw the fated pear tree One great branch stretched from the old contorted trunk across the path and threw the darkest shadow on that one spot But something seemed to struggle beneath the branch The pedler had never pretended to more courage than befits a man of peaceable occupation nor could he account for his valor on this awful emergency Certain it is however that he rushed forward prostrated a sturdy Irishman with the butt end of his whip and found not indeed hanging on the saint Michael s pear tree but trembling beneath it with a halter round his neck the old identical mister Higginbotham mister Higginbotham said Dominicus tremulously you re an honest man and I ll take your word for it Have you been hanged or not If the riddle be not already guessed a few words will explain the simple machinery by which this coming event was made to cast its shadow before Three men had plotted the robbery and murder of mister Higginbotham two of them successively lost courage and fled each delaying the crime one night by their disappearance the third was in the act of perpetration when a champion blindly obeying the call of fate like the heroes of old romance appeared in the person of Dominicus Pike It only remains to say that mister Higginbotham took the pedler into high favor sanctioned his addresses to the pretty schoolmistress and settled his whole property on their children allowing themselves the interest In due time the old gentleman capped the climax of his favors by dying a Christian death in bed since which melancholy event Dominicus Pike has removed from Kimballton and established a large tobacco manufactory in my native village LITTLE ANNIE S RAMBLE Ding dong Ding dong Ding dong The town crier has rung his bell at a distant corner and little Annie stands on her father s doorsteps trying to hear what the man with the loud voice is talking about Let me listen too Oh he is telling the people that an elephant and a lion and a royal tiger and a horse with horns and other strange beasts from foreign countries have come to town and will receive all visitors who choose to wait upon them Perhaps little Annie would like to go Yes and I can see that the pretty child is weary of this wide and pleasant street with the green trees flinging their shade across the quiet sunshine and the pavements and the sidewalks all as clean as if the housemaid had just swept them with her broom She feels that impulse to go strolling away that longing after the mystery of the great world which many children feel and which I felt in my childhood Little Annie shall take a ramble with me See I do but hold out my hand and like some bright bird in the sunny air with her blue silk frock fluttering upward from her white pantalets she comes bounding on tiptoe across the street Smooth back your brown curls Annie and let me tie on your bonnet and we will set forth What a strange couple to go on their rambles together One walks in black attire with a measured step and a heavy brow and his thoughtful eyes bent down while the gay little girl trips lightly along as if she were forced to keep hold of my hand lest her feet should dance away from the earth Yet there is sympathy between us If I pride myself on anything it is because I have a smile that children love and on the other hand there are few grown ladies that could entice me from the side of little Annie for I delight to let my mind go hand in hand with the mind of a sinless child So come Annie but if I moralize as we go do not listen to me only look about you and be merry Now we turn the corner Here are hacks with two horses and stage coaches with four thundering to meet each other and trucks and carts moving at a slower pace being heavily laden with barrels from the wharves and here are rattling gigs which perhaps will be smashed to pieces before our eyes Hitherward also comes a man trundling a wheelbarrow along the pavement Is not little Annie afraid of such a tumult No she does not even shrink closer to my side but passes on with fearless confidence a happy child amidst a great throng of grown people who pay the same reverence to her infancy that they would to extreme old age Nobody jostles her all turn aside to make way for little Annie and what is most singular she appears conscious of her claim to such respect Now her eyes brighten with pleasure A street musician has seated himself on the steps of yonder church and pours forth his strains to the busy town a melody that has gone astray among the tramp of footsteps the buzz of voices and the war of passing wheels Who heeds the poor organ grinder None but myself and little Annie whose feet begin to move in unison with the lively tune as if she were loth that music should be wasted without a dance But where would Annie find a partner Some have the gout in their toes or the rheumatism in their joints some are stiff with age some feeble with disease some are so lean that their bones would rattle and others of such ponderous size that their agility would crack the flagstones but many many have leaden feet because their hearts are far heavier than lead It is a sad thought that I have chanced upon What a company of dancers should we be For I too am a gentleman of sober footsteps and therefore little Annie let us walk sedately on It is a question with me whether this giddy child or my sage self have most pleasure in looking at the shop windows We love the silks of sunny hue that glow within the darkened premises of the spruce dry goods men we are pleasantly dazzled by the burnished silver and the chased gold the rings of wedlock and the costly love ornaments glistening at the window of the jeweller but Annie more than I seeks for a glimpse of her passing figure in the dusty looking glasses at the hardware stores All that is bright and gay attracts us both Here is a shop to which the recollections of my boyhood as well as present partialities give a peculiar magic How delightful to let the fancy revel on the dainties of a confectioner those pies with such white and flaky paste their contents being a mystery whether rich mince with whole plums intermixed or piquant apple delicately rose flavored those cakes heart shaped or round piled in a lofty pyramid those sweet little circlets sweetly named kisses those dark majestic masses fit to be bridal loaves at the wedding of an heiress mountains in size their summits deeply snow covered with sugar Then the mighty treasures of sugarplums white and crimson and yellow in large glass vases and candy of all varieties and those little cockles or whatever they are called much prized by children for their sweetness and more for the mottoes which they enclose by love sick maids and bachelors Oh my mouth waters little Annie and so doth yours but we will not be tempted except to an imaginary feast so let us hasten onward devouring the vision of a plum cake Here are pleasures as some people would say of a more exalted kind in the window of a bookseller Is Annie a literary lady Yes she is deeply read in Peter Parley s tomes and has an increasing love for fairy tales though seldom met with nowadays and she will subscribe next year to the Juvenile Miscellany But truth to tell she is apt to turn away from the printed page and keep gazing at the pretty pictures such as the gay colored ones which make this shop window the continual loitering place of children What would Annie think if in the book which I mean to send her on New Year s day she should find her sweet little self bound up in silk or morocco with gilt edges there to remain till she become a woman grown with children of her own to read about their mother s childhood That would be very queer Little Annie is weary of pictures and pulls me onward by the hand till suddenly we pause at the most wondrous shop in all the town Oh my stars Is this a toyshop or is it fairy land For here are gilded chariots in which the king and queen of the fairies might ride side by side while their courtiers on these small horses should gallop in triumphal procession before and behind the royal pair Here too are dishes of chinaware fit to be the dining set of those same princely personages when they make a regal banquet in the stateliest hall of their palace full five feet high and behold their nobles feasting adown the long perspective of the table Betwixt the king and queen should sit my little Annie the prettiest fairy of them all Here stands a turbaned Turk threatening us with his sabre like an ugly heathen as he is and next a Chinese mandarin who nods his head at Annie and myself Here we may review a whole army of horse and foot in red and blue uniforms with drums fifes trumpets and all kinds of noiseless music they have halted on the shelf of this window after their weary march from Liliput But what cares Annie for soldiers No conquering queen is she neither a Semiramis nor a Catharine her whole heart is set upon that doll who gazes at us with such a fashionable stare This is the little girl s true plaything Though made of wood a doll is a visionary and ethereal personage endowed by childish fancy with a peculiar life the mimic lady is a heroine of romance an actor and a sufferer in a thousand shadowy scenes the chief inhabitant of that wild world with which children ape the real one Little Annie does not understand what I am saying but looks wishfully at the proud lady in the window We will invite her home with us as we return Meantime good bye Dame Doll A toy yourself you look forth from your window upon many ladies that are also toys though they walk and speak and upon a crowd in pursuit of toys though they wear grave visages Oh with your never closing eyes had you but an intellect to moralize on all that flits before them what a wise doll would you be Come little Annie we shall find toys enough go where we may Now we elbow our way among the throng again It is curious in the most crowded part of a town to meet with living creatures that had their birthplace in some far solitude but have acquired a second nature in the wilderness of men Look up Annie at that canary bird hanging out of the window in his cage Poor little fellow His golden feathers are all tarnished in this smoky sunshine he would have glistened twice as brightly among the summer islands but still he has become a citizen in all his tastes and habits and would not sing half so well without the uproar that drowns his music What a pity that he does not know how miserable he is There is a parrot too calling out Pretty Poll Pretty Poll as we pass by Foolish bird to be talking about her prettiness to strangers especially as she is not a pretty Poll though gaudily dressed in green and yellow If she had said Pretty Annie there would have been some sense in it See that gray squirrel at the door of the fruit shop whirling round and round so merrily within his wire wheel Being condemned to the treadmill he makes it an amusement Admirable philosophy Here comes a big rough dog a countryman s dog in search of his master smelling at everybody s heels and touching little Annie s hand with his cold nose but hurrying away though she would fain have patted him Success to your search Fidelity And there sits a great yellow cat upon a window sill a very corpulent and comfortable cat gazing at this transitory world with owl s eyes and making pithy comments doubtless or what appear such to the silly beast Oh sage puss make room for me beside you and we will be a pair of philosophers Here we see something to remind us of the town crier and his ding dong bell Look look at that great cloth spread out in the air pictured all over with wild beasts as if they had met together to choose a king according to their custom in the days of AEsop But they are choosing neither a king nor a President else we should hear a most horrible snarling They have come from the deep woods and the wild mountains and the desert sands and the polar snows only to do homage to my little Annie As we enter among them the great elephant makes us a bow in the best style of elephantine courtesy bending lowly down his mountain bulk with trunk abased and leg thrust out behind Annie returns the salute much to the gratification of the elephant who is certainly the best bred monster in the caravan The lion and the lioness are busy with two beef bones The royal tiger the beautiful the untamable keeps pacing his narrow cage with a haughty step unmindful of the spectators or recalling the fierce deeds of his former life when he was wont to leap forth upon such inferior animals from the jungles of Bengal Here we see the very same wolf do not go near him Annie the selfsame wolf that devoured little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother In the next cage a hyena from Egypt who has doubtless howled around the pyramids and a black bear from our own forests are fellow prisoners and most excellent friends Are there any two living creatures who have so few sympathies that they cannot possibly be friends Here sits a great white bear whom common observers would call a very stupid beast though I perceive him to be only absorbed in contemplation he is thinking of his voyages on an iceberg and of his comfortable home in the vicinity of the north pole and of the little cubs whom he left rolling in the eternal snows In fact he is a bear of sentiment But oh those unsentimental monkeys The ugly grinning aping chattering ill natured mischievous and queer little brutes Annie does not love the monkeys their ugliness shocks her pure instinctive delicacy of taste and makes her mind unquiet because it bears a wild and dark resemblance to humanity But here is a little pony just big enough for Annie to ride and round and round he gallops in a circle keeping time with his trampling hoofs to a band of music And here with a laced coat and a cocked hat and a riding whip in his hand here comes a little gentleman small enough to be king of the fairies and ugly enough to be king of the gnomes and takes a flying leap into the saddle Merrily merrily plays the music and merrily gallops the pony and merrily rides the little old gentleman Come Annie into the street again perchance we may see monkeys on horseback there Mercy on us What a noisy world we quiet people live in Did Annie ever read the cries of London city With what lusty lungs doth yonder man proclaim that his wheelbarrow is full of lobsters Here comes another mounted on a cart and blowing a hoarse and dreadful blast from a tin horn as much as to say Fresh fish And hark a voice on high like that of a muezzin from the summit of a mosque announcing that some chimney sweeper has emerged from smoke and soot and darksome caverns into the upper air What cares the world for that But well a day we hear a shrill voice of affliction the scream of a little child rising louder with every repetition of that smart sharp slapping sound produced by an open hand on tender flesh Annie sympathizes though without experience of such direful woe Lo the town crier again with some new secret for the public ear Will he tell us of an auction or of a lost pocket book or a show of beautiful wax figures or of some monstrous beast more horrible than any in the caravan I guess the latter See how he uplifts the bell in his right hand and shakes it slowly at first then with a hurried motion till the clapper seems to strike both sides at once and the sounds are scattered forth in quick succession far and near Ding dong Ding dong Ding dong Now he raises his clear loud voice above all the din of the town It drowns the buzzing talk of many tongues and draws each man s mind from his own business it rolls up and down the echoing street and ascends to the hushed chamber of the sick and penetrates downward to the cellar kitchen where the hot cook turns from the fire to listen Who of all that address the public ear whether in church or court house or hall of state has such an attentive audience as the town crier What saith the people s orator Strayed from her home a LITTLE GIRL of five years old in a blue silk frock and white pantalets with brown curling hair and hazel eyes Whoever will bring her back to her afflicted mother Stop stop town crier The lost is found Oh my pretty Annie we forgot to tell your mother of our ramble and she is in despair and has sent the town crier to bellow up and down the streets affrighting old and young for the loss of a little girl who has not once let go my hand Well let us hasten homeward and as we go forget not to thank Heaven my Annie that after wandering a little way into the world you may return at the first summons with an untainted and unwearied heart and be a happy child again But I have gone too far astray for the town crier to call me back Sweet has been the charm of childhood on my spirit throughout my ramble with little Annie Say not that it has been a waste of precious moments an idle matter a babble of childish talk and a reverie of childish imaginations about topics unworthy of a grown man s notice Has it been merely this Not so not so They are not truly wise who would affirm it As the pure breath of children revives the life of aged men so is our moral nature revived by their free and simple thoughts their native feeling their airy mirth for little cause or none their grief soon roused and soon allayed Their influence on us is at least reciprocal with ours on them When our infancy is almost forgotten and our boyhood long departed though it seems but as yesterday when life settles darkly down upon us and we doubt whether to call ourselves young any more then it is good to steal away from the society of bearded men and even of gentler woman and spend an hour or two with children After drinking from those fountains of still fresh existence we shall return into the crowd as I do now to struggle onward and do our part in life perhaps as fervently as ever but for a time with a kinder and purer heart and a spirit more lightly wise All this by thy sweet magic dear little Annie WAKEFIELD In some old magazine or newspaper I recollect a story told as truth of a man let us call him Wakefield who absented himself for a long time from his wife The fact thus abstractedly stated is not very uncommon nor without a proper distinction of circumstances to be condemned either as naughty or nonsensical Howbeit this though far from the most aggravated is perhaps the strangest instance on record of marital delinquency and moreover as remarkable a freak as may be found in the whole list of human oddities The wedded couple lived in London The man under pretence of going a journey took lodgings in the next street to his own house and there unheard of by his wife or friends and without the shadow of a reason for such self banishment dwelt upward of twenty years During that period he beheld his home every day and frequently the forlorn missus Wakefield And after so great a gap in his matrimonial felicity when his death was reckoned certain his estate settled his name dismissed from memory and his wife long long ago resigned to her autumnal widowhood he entered the door one evening quietly as from a day s absence and became a loving spouse till death This outline is all that I remember But the incident though of the purest originality unexampled and probably never to be repeated is one I think which appeals to the general sympathies of mankind We know each for himself that none of us would perpetrate such a folly yet feel as if some other might To my own contemplations at least it has often recurred always exciting wonder but with a sense that the story must be true and a conception of its hero s character Whenever any subject so forcibly affects the mind time is well spent in thinking of it If the reader choose let him do his own meditation or if he prefer to ramble with me through the twenty years of Wakefield s vagary I bid him welcome trusting that there will be a pervading spirit and a moral even should we fail to find them done up neatly and condensed into the final sentence Thought has always its efficacy and every striking incident its moral What sort of a man was Wakefield We are free to shape out our own idea and call it by his name He was now in the meridian of life his matrimonial affections never violent were sobered into a calm habitual sentiment of all husbands he was likely to be the most constant because a certain sluggishness would keep his heart at rest wherever it might be placed He was intellectual but not actively so his mind occupied itself in long and lazy musings that tended to no purpose or had not vigor to attain it his thoughts were seldom so energetic as to seize hold of words Imagination in the proper meaning of the term made no part of Wakefield s gifts With a cold but not depraved nor wandering heart and a mind never feverish with riotous thoughts nor perplexed with originality who could have anticipated that our friend would entitle himself to a foremost place among the doers of eccentric deeds Had his acquaintances been asked who was the man in London the surest to perform nothing to day which should be remembered on the morrow they would have thought of Wakefield Only the wife of his bosom might have hesitated She without having analyzed his character was partly aware of a quiet selfishness that had rusted into his inactive mind of a peculiar sort of vanity the most uneasy attribute about him of a disposition to craft which had seldom produced more positive effects than the keeping of petty secrets hardly worth revealing and lastly of what she called a little strangeness sometimes in the good man This latter quality is indefinable and perhaps non existent Let us now imagine Wakefield bidding adieu to his wife It is the dusk of an October evening His equipment is a drab greatcoat a hat covered with an oil cloth top boots an umbrella in one hand and a small portmanteau in the other He has informed missus Wakefield that he is to take the night coach into the country She would fain inquire the length of his journey its object and the probable time of his return but indulgent to his harmless love of mystery interrogates him only by a look He tells her not to expect him positively by the return coach nor to be alarmed should he tarry three or four days but at all events to look for him at supper on Friday evening Wakefield himself be it considered has no suspicion of what is before him He holds out his hand she gives her own and meets his parting kiss in the matter of course way of a ten years matrimony and forth goes the middle aged mister Wakefield almost resolved to perplex his good lady by a whole week s absence After the door has closed behind him she perceives it thrust partly open and a vision of her husband s face through the aperture smiling on her and gone in a moment For the time this little incident is dismissed without a thought but long afterward when she has been more years a widow than a wife that smile recurs and flickers across all her reminiscences of Wakefield s visage In her many musings she surrounds the original smile with a multitude of fantasies which make it strange and awful as for instance if she imagines him in a coffin that parting look is frozen on his pale features or if she dreams of him in heaven still his blessed spirit wears a quiet and crafty smile Yet for its sake when all others have given him up for dead she sometimes doubts whether she is a widow But our business is with the husband We must hurry after him along the street ere he lose his individuality and melt into the great mass of London life It would be vain searching for him there Let us follow close at his heels therefore until after several superfluous turns and doublings we find him comfortably established by the fireside of a small apartment previously bespoken He is in the next street to his own and at his journey s end He can scarcely trust his good fortune in having got thither unperceived recollecting that at one time he was delayed by the throng in the very focus of a lighted lantern and again there were footsteps that seemed to tread behind his own distinct from the multitudinous tramp around him and anon he heard a voice shouting afar and fancied that it called his name Doubtless a dozen busybodies had been watching him and told his wife the whole affair Poor Wakefield little knowest thou thine own insignificance in this great world No mortal eye but mine has traced thee Go quietly to thy bed foolish man and on the morrow if thou wilt be wise get thee home to good missus Wakefield and tell her the truth Remove not thyself even for a little week from thy place in her chaste bosom Were she for a single moment to deem thee dead or lost or lastingly divided from her thou wouldst be woefully conscious of a change in thy true wife for ever after It is perilous to make a chasm in human affections not that they gape so long and wide but so quickly close again Almost repenting of his frolic or whatever it may be termed Wakefield lies down betimes and starting from his first nap spreads forth his arms into the wide and solitary waste of the unaccustomed bed No thinks he gathering the bedclothes about him I will not sleep alone another night In the morning he rises earlier than usual and sets himself to consider what he really means to do Such are his loose and rambling modes of thought that he has taken this very singular step with the consciousness of a purpose indeed but without being able to define it sufficiently for his own contemplation The vagueness of the project and the convulsive effort with which he plunges into the execution of it are equally characteristic of a feeble minded man Wakefield sifts his ideas however as minutely as he may and finds himself curious to know the progress of matters at home how his exemplary wife will endure her widowhood of a week and briefly how the little sphere of creatures and circumstances in which he was a central object will be affected by his removal A morbid vanity therefore lies nearest the bottom of the affair But how is he to attain his ends Not certainly by keeping close in this comfortable lodging where though he slept and awoke in the next street to his home he is as effectually abroad as if the stage coach had been whirling him away all night Yet should he reappear the whole project is knocked in the head His poor brains being hopelessly puzzled with this dilemma he at length ventures out partly resolving to cross the head of the street and send one hasty glance toward his forsaken domicile Habit for he is a man of habits takes him by the hand and guides him wholly unaware to his own door where just at the critical moment he is aroused by the scraping of his foot upon the step Wakefield whither are you going At that instant his fate was turning on the pivot Little dreaming of the doom to which his first backward step devotes him he hurries away breathless with agitation hitherto unfelt and hardly dares turn his head at the distant corner Can it be that nobody caught sight of him Will not the whole household the decent missus Wakefield the smart maid servant and the dirty little footboy raise a hue and cry through London streets in pursuit of their fugitive lord and master Wonderful escape He gathers courage to pause and look homeward but is perplexed with a sense of change about the familiar edifice such as affects us all when after a separation of months or years we again see some hill or lake or work of art with which we were friends of old In ordinary cases this indescribable impression is caused by the comparison and contrast between our imperfect reminiscences and the reality In Wakefield the magic of a single night has wrought a similar transformation because in that brief period a great moral change has been effected But this is a secret from himself Before leaving the spot he catches a far and momentary glimpse of his wife passing athwart the front window with her face turned toward the head of the street The crafty nincompoop takes to his heels scared with the idea that among a thousand such atoms of mortality her eye must have detected him Right glad is his heart though his brain be somewhat dizzy when he finds himself by the coal fire of his lodgings So much for the commencement of this long whim wham After the initial conception and the stirring up of the man s sluggish temperament to put it in practice the whole matter evolves itself in a natural train We may suppose him as the result of deep deliberation buying a new wig of reddish hair and selecting sundry garments in a fashion unlike his customary suit of brown from a Jew s old clothes bag It is accomplished Wakefield is another man The new system being now established a retrograde movement to the old would be almost as difficult as the step that placed him in his unparalleled position Furthermore he is rendered obstinate by a sulkiness occasionally incident to his temper and brought on at present by the inadequate sensation which he conceives to have been produced in the bosom of missus Wakefield He will not go back until she be frightened half to death Well twice or thrice has she passed before his sight each time with a heavier step a paler cheek and more anxious brow and in the third week of his non appearance he detects a portent of evil entering the house in the guise of an apothecary Next day the knocker is muffled Toward nightfall comes the chariot of a physician and deposits its big wigged and solemn burden at Wakefield s door whence after a quarter of an hour s visit he emerges perchance the herald of a funeral Dear woman will she die By this time Wakefield is excited to something like energy of feeling but still lingers away from his wife s bedside pleading with his conscience that she must not be disturbed at such a juncture If aught else restrains him he does not know it In the course of a few weeks she gradually recovers The crisis is over her heart is sad perhaps but quiet and let him return soon or late it will never be feverish for him again Such ideas glimmer through the mist of Wakefield s mind and render him indistinctly conscious that an almost impassable gulf divides his hired apartment from his former home It is but in the next street he sometimes says Fool it is in another world Hitherto he has put off his return from one particular day to another henceforward he leaves the precise time undetermined not to morrow probably next week pretty soon Poor man The dead have nearly as much chance of revisiting their earthly homes as the self banished Wakefield Would that I had a folio to write instead of an article of a dozen pages Then might I exemplify how an influence beyond our control lays its strong hand on every deed which we do and weaves its consequences into an iron tissue of necessity Wakefield is spellbound We must leave him for ten years or so to haunt around his house without once crossing the threshold and to be faithful to his wife with all the affection of which his heart is capable while he is slowly fading out of hers Long since it must be remarked he has lost the perception of singularity in his conduct Now for a scene Amid the throng of a London street we distinguish a man now waxing elderly with few characteristics to attract careless observers yet bearing in his whole aspect the handwriting of no common fate for such as have the skill to read it He is meagre his low and narrow forehead is deeply wrinkled his eyes small and lustreless sometimes wander apprehensively about him but oftener seem to look inward He bends his head and moves with an indescribable obliquity of gait as if unwilling to display his full front to the world Watch him long enough to see what we have described and you will allow that circumstances which often produce remarkable men from Nature s ordinary handiwork have produced one such here Next leaving him to sidle along the footwalk cast your eyes in the opposite direction where a portly female considerably in the wane of life with a prayer book in her hand is proceeding to yonder church She has the placid mien of settled widowhood Her regrets have either died away or have become so essential to her heart that they would be poorly exchanged for joy Just as the lean man and well conditioned woman are passing a slight obstruction occurs and brings these two figures directly in contact Their hands touch the pressure of the crowd forces her bosom against his shoulder they stand face to face staring into each other s eyes After a ten years separation thus Wakefield meets his wife The throng eddies away and carries them asunder The sober widow resuming her former pace proceeds to church but pauses in the portal and throws a perplexed glance along the street She passes in however opening her prayer book as she goes And the man With so wild a face that busy and selfish London stands to gaze after him he hurries to his lodgings bolts the door and throws himself upon the bed The latent feelings of years break out his feeble mind acquires a brief energy from their strength all the miserable strangeness of his life is revealed to him at a glance and he cries out passionately Wakefield Wakefield You are mad Perhaps he was so The singularity of his situation must have so moulded him to itself that considered in regard to his fellow creatures and the business of life he could not be said to possess his right mind He had contrived or rather he had happened to dissever himself from the world to vanish to give up his place and privileges with living men without being admitted among the dead The life of a hermit is nowise parallel to his He was in the bustle of the city as of old but the crowd swept by and saw him not he was we may figuratively say always beside his wife and at his hearth yet must never feel the warmth of the one nor the affection of the other It was Wakefield s unprecedented fate to retain his original share of human sympathies and to be still involved in human interests while he had lost his reciprocal influence on them It would be a most curious speculation to trace out the effect of such circumstances on his heart and intellect separately and in unison Yet changed as he was he would seldom be conscious of it but deem himself the same man as ever glimpses of the truth indeed would come but only for the moment and still he would keep saying I shall soon go back nor reflect that he had been saying so for twenty years I conceive also that these twenty years would appear in the retrospect scarcely longer than the week to which Wakefield had at first limited his absence He would look on the affair as no more than an interlude in the main business of his life When after a little while more he should deem it time to re enter his parlor his wife would clap her hands for joy on beholding the middle aged mister Wakefield Alas what a mistake Would Time but await the close of our favorite follies we should be young men all of us and till Doomsday One evening in the twentieth year since he vanished Wakefield is taking his customary walk toward the dwelling which he still calls his own It is a gusty night of autumn with frequent showers that patter down upon the pavement and are gone before a man can put up his umbrella Pausing near the house Wakefield discerns through the parlor windows of the second floor the red glow and the glimmer and fitful flash of a comfortable fire On the ceiling appears a grotesque shadow of good missus Wakefield The cap the nose and chin and the broad waist form an admirable caricature which dances moreover with the up flickering and down sinking blaze almost too merrily for the shade of an elderly widow At this instant a shower chances to fall and is driven by the unmannerly gust full into Wakefield s face and bosom He is quite penetrated with its autumnal chill Shall he stand wet and shivering here when his own hearth has a good fire to warm him and his own wife will run to fetch the gray coat and small clothes which doubtless she has kept carefully in the closet of their bedchamber No Wakefield is no such fool He ascends the steps heavily for twenty years have stiffened his legs since he came down but he knows it not Stay Wakefield Would you go to the sole home that is left you Then step into your grave The door opens As he passes in we have a parting glimpse of his visage and recognize the crafty smile which was the precursor of the little joke that he has ever since been playing off at his wife s expense How unmercifully has he quizzed the poor woman Well a good night s rest to Wakefield This happy event supposing it to be such could only have occurred at an unpremeditated moment We will not follow our friend across the threshold He has left us much food for thought a portion of which shall lend its wisdom to a moral and be shaped into a figure Amid the seeming confusion of our mysterious world individuals are so nicely adjusted to a system and systems to one another and to a whole that by stepping aside for a moment a man exposes himself to a fearful risk of losing his place for ever Like Wakefield he may become as it were the outcast of the universe A RILL FROM THE TOWN PUMP SCENE the corner of two principal streets one the TOWN PUMP talking through its nose Noon by the north clock Noon by the east High noon too by these hot sunbeams which full scarcely aslope upon my head and almost make the water bubble and smoke in the trough under my nose Truly we public characters have a tough time of it And among all the town officers chosen at March meeting where is he that sustains for a single year the burden of such manifold duties as are imposed in perpetuity upon the town pump The title of town treasurer is rightfully mine as guardian of the best treasure that the town has The overseers of the poor ought to make me their chairman since I provide bountifully for the pauper without expense to him that pays taxes I am at the head of the fire department and one of the physicians to the board of health As a keeper of the peace all water drinkers will confess me equal to the constable I perform some of the duties of the town clerk by promulgating public notices when they are posted on my front To speak within bounds I am the chief person of the municipality and exhibit moreover an admirable pattern to my brother officers by the cool steady upright downright and impartial discharge of my business and the constancy with which I stand to my post Summer or winter nobody seeks me in vain for all day long I am seen at the busiest corner just above the market stretching out my arms to rich and poor alike and at night I hold a lantern over my head both to show where I am and keep people out of the gutters At this sultry noontide I am cupbearer to the parched populace for whose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist Like a dramseller on the mall at muster day I cry aloud to all and sundry in my plainest accents and at the very tiptop of my voice Footnote one Essex and Washington streets Salem Here it is gentlemen Here is the good liquor Walk up walk up gentlemen Walk up walk up Here is the superior stuff Here is the unadulterated ale of Father Adam better than Cognac Hollands Jamaica strong beer or wine of any price here it is by the hogshead or the single glass and not a cent to pay Walk up gentlemen walk up and help yourselves It were a pity if all this outcry should draw no customers Here they come A hot day gentlemen Quaff and away again so as to keep yourselves in a nice cool sweat You my friend will need another cupful to wash the dust out of your throat if it be as thick there as it is on your cowhide shoes I see that you have trudged half a score of miles to day and like a wise man have passed by the taverns and stopped at the running brooks and well curbs Otherwise betwixt heat without and fire within you would have been burnt to a cinder or melted down to nothing at all in the fashion of a jelly fish Drink and make room for that other fellow who seeks my aid to quench the fiery fever of last night s potations which he drained from no cup of mine Welcome most rubicund sir You and I have been great strangers hitherto nor to confess the truth will my nose be anxious for a closer intimacy till the fumes of your breath be a little less potent Mercy on you man the water absolutely hisses down your red hot gullet and is converted quite to steam in the miniature Tophet which you mistake for a stomach Fill again and tell me on the word of an honest toper did you ever in cellar tavern or any kind of a dram shop spend the price of your children s food for a swig half so delicious Now for the first time these ten years you know the flavor of cold water Good bye and whenever you are thirsty remember that I keep a constant supply at the old stand Who next Oh my little friend you are let loose from school and come hither to scrub your blooming face and drown the memory of certain taps of the ferule and other schoolboy troubles in a draught from the town pump Take it pure as the current of your young life Take it and may your heart and tongue never be scorched with a fiercer thirst than now There my dear child put down the cup and yield your place to this elderly gentleman who treads so tenderly over the paving stones that I suspect he is afraid of breaking them What he limps by without so much as thanking me as if my hospitable offers were meant only for people who have no wine cellars Well well sir no harm done I hope Go draw the cork tip the decanter but when your great toe shall set you a roaring it will be no affair of mine If gentlemen love the pleasant titillation of the gout it is all one to the town pump This thirsty dog with his red tongue lolling out does not scorn my hospitality but stands on his hind legs and laps eagerly out of the trough See how lightly he capers away again Jowler did your worship ever have the gout Are you all satisfied Then wipe your mouths my good friends and while my spout has a moment s leisure I will delight the town with a few historical remniscences In far antiquity beneath a darksome shadow of venerable boughs a spring bubbled out of the leaf strewn earth in the very spot where you now behold me on the sunny pavement The water was as bright and clear and deemed as precious as liquid diamonds The Indian sagamores drank of it from time immemorial till the fatal deluge of the firewater burst upon the red men and swept their whole race away from the cold fountains Endicott and his followers came next and often knelt down to drink dipping their long beards in the spring The richest goblet then was of birch bark Governor Winthrop after a journey afoot from Boston drank here out of the hollow of his hand The elder Higginson here wet his palm and laid it on the brow of the first town born child For many years it was the watering place and as it were the washbowl of the vicinity whither all decent folks resorted to purify their visages and gaze at them afterward at least the pretty maidens did in the mirror which it made On Sabbath days whenever a babe was to be baptized the sexton filled his basin here and placed it on the communion table of the humble meeting house which partly covered the site of yonder stately brick one Thus one generation after another was consecrated to Heaven by its waters and cast their waxing and waning shadows into its glassy bosom and vanished from the earth as if mortal life were but a flitting image in a fountain Finally the fountain vanished also Cellars were dug on all sides and cart loads of gravel flung upon its source whence oozed a turbid stream forming a mud puddle at the corner of two streets In the hot months when its refreshment was most needed the dust flew in clouds over the forgotten birthplace of the waters now their grave But in the course of time a town pump was sunk into the source of the ancient spring and when the first decayed another took its place and then another and still another till here stand I gentlemen and ladies to serve you with my iron goblet Drink and be refreshed The water is as pure and cold as that which slaked the thirst of the red sagamore beneath the aged boughs though now the gem of the wilderness is treasured under these hot stones where no shadow falls but from the brick buildings And be it the moral of my story that as this wasted and long lost fountain is now known and prized again so shall the virtues of cold water too little valued since your fathers days be recognized by all Your pardon good people I must interrupt my stream of eloquence and spout forth a stream of water to replenish the trough for this teamster and his two yoke of oxen who have come from Topsfield or somewhere along that way No part of my business is pleasanter than the watering of cattle Look how rapidly they lower the water mark on the sides of the trough till their capacious stomachs are moistened with a gallon or two apiece and they can afford time to breathe it in with sighs of calm enjoyment Now they roll their quiet eyes around the brim of their monstrous drinking vessel An ox is your true toper But I perceive my dear auditors that you are impatient for the remainder of my discourse Impute it I beseech you to no defect of modesty if I insist a little longer on so fruitful a topic as my own multifarious merits It is altogether for your good The better you think of me the better men and women you will find yourselves I shall say nothing of my all important aid on washing days though on that account alone I might call myself the household god of a hundred families Far be it from me also to hint my respectable friends at the show of dirty faces which you would present without my pains to keep you clean Nor will I remind you how often when the midnight bells make you tremble for your combustible town you have fled to the town pump and found me always at my post firm amid the confusion and ready to drain my vital current in your behalf Neither is it worth while to lay much stress on my claims to a medical diploma as the physician whose simple rule of practice is preferable to all the nauseous lore which has found men sick or left them so since the days of Hippocrates Let us take a broader view of my beneficial influence on mankind No these are trifles compared with the merits which wise men concede to me if not in my single self yet as the representative of a class of being the grand reformer of the age From my spout and such spouts as mine must flow the stream that shall cleanse our earth of the vast portion of its crime and anguish which has gushed from the fiery fountains of the still In this mighty enterprise the cow shall be my great confederate Milk and water the TOWN PUMP and the Cow Such is the glorious copartnership that shall tear down the distilleries and brewhouses uproot the vineyards shatter the cider presses ruin the tea and coffee trade and finally monopolize the whole business of quenching thirst Blessed consummation Then Poverty shall pass away from the land finding no hovel so wretched where her squalid form may shelter herself Then Disease for lack of other victims shall gnaw its own heart and die Then Sin if she do not die shall lose half her strength Until now the frenzy of hereditary fever has raged in the human blood transmitted from sire to son and rekindled in every generation by fresh draughts of liquid flame When that inward fire shall be extinguished the heat of passion cannot but grow cool and war the drunkenness of nations perhaps will cease At least there will be no war of households The husband and wife drinking deep of peaceful joy a calm bliss of temperate affections shall pass hand in hand through life and lie down not reluctantly at its protracted close To them the past will be no turmoil of mad dreams nor the future an eternity of such moments as follow the delirium of the drunkard Their dead faces shall express what their spirits were and are to be by a lingering smile of memory and hope Ahem Dry work this speechifying especially to an unpractised orator I never conceived till now what toil the temperance lecturers undergo for my sake hereafter they shall have the business to themselves Do some kind Christian pump a stroke or two just to wet my whistle Thank you sir My dear hearers when the world shall have been regenerated by my instrumentality you will collect your useless vats and liquor casks into one great pile and make a bonfire in honor of the town pump And when I shall have decayed like my predecessors then if you revere my memory let a marble fountain richly sculptured take my place upon this spot Such monuments should be erected everywhere and inscribed with the names of the distinguished champions of my cause Now listen for something very important is to come next There are two or three honest friends of mine and true friends I know they are who nevertheless by their fiery pugnacity in my behalf do put me in fearful hazard of a broken nose or even a total overthrow upon the pavement and the loss of the treasure which I guard I pray you gentlemen let this fault be amended Is it decent think you to get tipsy with zeal for temperance and take up the honorable cause of the town pump in the style of a toper fighting for his brandy bottle Or can the excellent qualities of cold water be no otherwise exemplified than by plunging slapdash into hot water and woefully scalding yourselves and other people Trust me they may In the moral warfare which you are to wage and indeed in the whole conduct of your lives you cannot choose a better example than myself who have never permitted the dust and sultry atmosphere the turbulence and manifold disquietudes of the world around me to reach that deep calm well of purity which may be called my soul And whenever I pour out that soul it is to cool earth s fever or cleanse its stains One o clock Nay then if the dinner bell begins to speak I may as well hold my peace Here comes a pretty young girl of my acquaintance with a large stone pitcher for me to fill May she draw a husband while drawing her water as Rachel did of old Hold out your vessel my dear There it is full to the brim so now run home peeping at your sweet image in the pitcher as you go and forget not in a glass of my own liquor to drink SUCCESS TO THE TOWN PUMP THE GREAT CARBUNCLE one A MYSTERY OF THE WHITE MOUNTAINS At nightfall once in the olden time on the rugged side of one of the Crystal Hills a party of adventurers were refreshing themselves after a toilsome and fruitless quest for the Great Carbuncle They had come thither not as friends nor partners in the enterprise but each save one youthful pair impelled by his own selfish and solitary longing for this wondrous gem Their feeling of brotherhood however was strong enough to induce them to contribute a mutual aid in building a rude hut of branches and kindling a great fire of shattered pines that had drifted down the headlong current of the Amonoosuck on the lower bank of which they were to pass the night There was but one of their number perhaps who had become so estranged from natural sympathies by the absorbing spell of the pursuit as to acknowledge no satisfaction at the sight of human faces in the remote and solitary region whither they had ascended A vast extent of wilderness lay between them and the nearest settlement while scant a mile above their heads was that bleak verge where the hills throw off their shaggy mantle of forest trees and either robe themselves in clouds or tower naked into the sky The roar of the Amonoosuck would have been too awful for endurance if only a solitary man had listened while the mountain stream talked with the wind Footnote one The Indian tradition on which this somewhat extravagant tale is founded is both too wild and too beautiful to be adequately wrought up in prose Sullivan in his history of Maine written since the Revolution remarks that even then the existence of the Great Carbuncle was not entirely discredited The adventurers therefore exchanged hospitable greetings and welcomed one another to the hut where each man was the host and all were the guests of the whole company They spread their individual supplies of food on the flat surface of a rock and partook of a general repast at the close of which a sentiment of good fellowship was perceptible among the party though repressed by the idea that the renewed search for the Great Carbuncle must make them strangers again in the morning Seven men and one young woman they warmed themselves together at the fire which extended its bright wall along the whole front of their wigwam As they observed the various and contrasted figures that made up the assemblage each man looking like a caricature of himself in the unsteady light that flickered over him they came mutually to the conclusion that an odder society had never met in city or wilderness on mountain or plain The eldest of the group a tall lean weatherbeaten man some sixty years of age was clad in the skins of wild animals whose fashion of dress he did well to imitate since the deer the wolf and the bear had long been his most intimate companions He was one of those ill fated mortals such as the Indians told of whom in their early youth the Great Carbuncle smote with a peculiar madness and became the passionate dream of their existence All who visited that region knew him as the Seeker and by no other name As none could remember when he first took up the search there went a fable in the valley of the Saco that for his inordinate lust after the Great Carbuncle he had been condemned to wander among the mountains till the end of time still with the same feverish hopes at sunrise the same despair at eve Near this miserable Seeker sat a little elderly personage wearing a high crowned hat shaped somewhat like a crucible He was from beyond the sea a Doctor Cacaphodel who had wilted and dried himself into a mummy by continually stooping over charcoal furnaces and inhaling unwholesome fumes during his researches in chemistry and alchemy It was told of him whether truly or not that at the commencement of his studies he had drained his body of all its richest blood and wasted it with other inestimable ingredients in an unsuccessful experiment and had never been a well man since Another of the adventurers was Master Ichabod Pigsnort a weighty merchant and selectman of Boston and an elder of the famous mister Norton s church His enemies had a ridiculous story that Master Pigsnort was accustomed to spend a whole hour after prayer time every morning and evening in wallowing naked among an immense quantity of pine tree shillings which were the earliest silver coinage of Massachusetts The fourth whom we shall notice had no name that his companions knew of and was chiefly distinguished by a sneer that always contorted his thin visage and by a prodigious pair of spectacles which were supposed to deform and discolor the whole face of nature to this gentleman s perception The fifth adventurer likewise lacked a name which was the greater pity as he appeared to be a poet He was a bright eyed man but woefully pined away which was no more than natural if as some people affirmed his ordinary diet was fog morning mist and a slice of the densest cloud within his reach sauced with moonshine whenever he could get it Certain it is that the poetry which flowed from him had a smack of all these dainties The sixth of the party was a young man of haughty mien and sat somewhat apart from the rest wearing his plumed hat loftily among his elders while the fire glittered on the rich embroidery of his dress and gleamed intensely on the jewelled pommel of his sword This was the lord De Vere who when at home was said to spend much of his time in the burial vault of his dead progenitors rummaging their mouldy coffins in search of all the earthly pride and vainglory that was hidden among bones and dust so that besides his own share he had the collected haughtiness of his whole line of ancestry Lastly there was a handsome youth in rustic garb and by his side a blooming little person in whom a delicate shade of maiden reserve was just melting into the rich glow of a young wife s affection Her name was Hannah and her husband s Matthew two homely names yet well enough adapted to the simple pair who seemed strangely out of place among the whimsical fraternity whose wits had been set agog by the Great Carbuncle Beneath the shelter of one hut in the bright blaze of the same fire sat this varied group of adventurers all so intent upon a single object that of whatever else they began to speak their closing words were sure to be illuminated with the Great Carbuncle Several related the circumstances that brought them thither One had listened to a traveller s tale of this marvellous stone in his own distant country and had immediately been seized with such a thirst for beholding it as could only be quenched in its intensest lustre Another so long ago as when the famous Captain Smith visited these coasts had seen it blazing far at sea and had felt no rest in all the intervening years till now that he took up the search A third being encamped on a hunting expedition full forty miles south of the White Mountains awoke at midnight and beheld the Great Carbuncle gleaming like a meteor so that the shadows of the trees fell backward from it They spoke of the innumerable attempts which had been made to reach the spot and of the singular fatality which had hitherto withheld success from all adventurers though it might seem so easy to follow to its source a light that overpowered the moon and almost matched the sun It was observable that each smiled scornfully at the madness of every other in anticipating better fortune than the past yet nourished a scarcely hidden conviction that he would himself be the favored one As if to allay their too sanguine hopes they recurred to the Indian traditions that a spirit kept watch about the gem and bewildered those who sought it either by removing it from peak to peak of the higher hills or by calling up a mist from the enchanted lake over which it hung But these tales were deemed unworthy of credit all professing to believe that the search had been baffled by want of sagacity or perseverance in the adventurers or such other causes as might naturally obstruct the passage to any given point among the intricacies of forest valley and mountain In a pause of the conversation the wearer of the prodigious spectacles looked round upon the party making each individual in turn the object of the sneer which invariably dwelt upon his countenance So fellow pilgrims said he here we are seven wise men and one fair damsel who doubtless is as wise as any graybeard of the company Here we are I say all bound on the same goodly enterprise Methinks now it were not amiss that each of us declare what he proposes to do with the Great Carbuncle provided he have the good hap to clutch it What says our friend in the bearskin How mean you good sir to enjoy the prize which you have been seeking the Lord knows how long among the Crystal Hills How enjoy it exclaimed the aged Seeker bitterly I hope for no enjoyment from it that folly has past long ago I keep up the search for this accursed stone because the vain ambition of my youth has become a fate upon me in old age The pursuit alone is my strength the energy of my soul the warmth of my blood and the pith and marrow of my bones Were I to turn my back upon it I should fall down dead on the hither side of the notch which is the gateway of this mountain region Yet not to have my wasted lifetime back again would I give up my hopes of is deemed little better than a traffic with the evil one Now think ye that I would have done this grievous wrong to my soul body reputation and estate without a reasonable chance of profit Not I pious Master Pigsnort said the man with the spectacles I never laid such a great folly to thy charge Truly I hope not said the merchant Now as touching this Great Carbuncle I am free to own that I have never had a glimpse of it but be it only the hundredth part so bright as people tell it will surely outvalue the Great Mogul s best diamond which he holds at an incalculable sum wherefore I am minded to put the Great Carbuncle on shipboard and voyage with it to England France Spain Italy or into heathendom if Providence should send me thither and in a word dispose of the gem to the best bidder among the potentates of the earth that he may place it among his crown jewels If any of ye have a wiser plan let him expound it That have I thou sordid man exclaimed the poet Dost thou desire nothing brighter than gold that thou wouldst transmute all this ethereal lustre into such dross as thou wallowest in already For myself hiding the jewel under my cloak I shall hie me back to my attic chamber in one of the darksome alleys of London There night and day will I gaze upon it My soul shall drink its radiance it shall be diffused throughout my intellectual powers and gleam brightly in every line of poesy that I indite Thus long ages after I am gone the splendor of the Great Carbuncle will blaze around my name Well said Master Poet cried he of the spectacles Hide it under thy cloak sayest thou Why it will gleam through the holes and make thee look like a jack o lantern To think ejaculated the lord De Vere rather to himself than his companions the best of whom he held utterly unworthy of his intercourse to think that a fellow in a tattered cloak should talk of conveying the Great Carbuncle to a garret in Grubb street Have not I resolved within myself that the whole earth contains no fitter ornament for the great hall of my ancestral castle There shall it flame for ages making a noonday of midnight glittering on the suits of armor the banners and escutcheons that hang around the wall and keeping bright the memory of heroes Wherefore have all other adventurers sought the prize in vain but that I might win it and make it a symbol of the glories of our lofty line And never on the diadem of the White Mountains did the Great Carbuncle hold a place half so honored as is reserved for it in the hall of the De Veres It is a noble thought said the cynic with an obsequious sneer Yet might I presume to say so the gem would make a rare sepulchral lamp and would display the glories of Your Lordship s progenitors more truly in the ancestral vault than in the castle hall Nay forsooth observed Matthew the young rustic who sat hand in hand with his bride the gentleman has bethought himself of a profitable use for this bright stone Hannah here and I are seeking it for a like purpose How fellow exclaimed His Lordship in surprise What castle hall hast thou to hang it in No castle replied Matthew but as neat a cottage as any within sight of the Crystal Hills Ye must know friends that Hannah and I being wedded the last week have taken up the search of the Great Carbuncle because we shall need its light in the long winter evenings and it will be such a pretty thing to show the neighbors when they visit us It will shine through the house so that we may pick up a pin in any corner and will set all the windows a glowing as if there were a great fire of pine knots in the chimney And then how pleasant when we awake in the night to be able to see one another s faces There was a general smile among the adventurers at the simplicity of the young couple s project in regard to this wondrous and invaluable stone with which the greatest monarch on earth might have been proud to adorn his palace Especially the man with spectacles who had sneered at all the company in turn now twisted his visage into such an expression of ill natured mirth that Matthew asked him rather peevishly what he himself meant to do with the Great Carbuncle The Great Carbuncle answered the cynic with ineffable scorn Why you blockhead there is no such thing in rerum natura I have come three thousand miles and am resolved to set my foot on every peak of these mountains and poke my head into every chasm for the sole purpose of demonstrating to the satisfaction of any man one whit less an ass than thyself that the Great Carbuncle is all a humbug Vain and foolish were the motives that had brought most of the adventurers to the Crystal Hills but none so vain so foolish and so impious too as that of the scoffer with the prodigious spectacles He was one of those wretched and evil men whose yearnings are downward to the darkness instead of heavenward and who could they but extinguish the lights which God hath kindled for us would count the midnight gloom their chiefest glory As the cynic spoke several of the party were startled by a gleam of red splendor that showed the huge shapes of the surrounding mountains and the rock bestrewn bed of the turbulent river with an illumination unlike that of their fire on the trunks and black boughs of the forest trees They listened for the roll of thunder but heard nothing and were glad that the tempest came not near them The stars those dial points of heaven now warned the adventurers to close their eyes on the blazing logs and open them in dreams to the glow of the Great Carbuncle The young married couple had taken their lodgings in the farthest corner of the wigwam and were separated from the rest of the party by a curtain of curiously woven twigs such as might have hung in deep festoons around the bridal bower of Eve The modest little wife had wrought this piece of tapestry while the other guests were talking She and her husband fell asleep with hands tenderly clasped and awoke from visions of unearthly radiance to meet the more blessed light of one another s eyes They awoke at the same instant and with one happy smile beaming over their two faces which grew brighter with their consciousness of the reality of life and love But no sooner did she recollect where they were than the bride peeped through the interstices of the leafy curtain and saw that the outer room of the hut was deserted Up dear Matthew cried she in haste The strange folk are all gone Up this very minute or we shall lose the Great Carbuncle In truth so little did these poor young people deserve the mighty prize which had lured them thither that they had slept peacefully all night and till the summits of the hills were glittering with sunshine while the other adventurers had tossed their limbs in feverish wakefulness or dreamed of climbing precipices and set off to realize their dreams with the curliest peep of dawn But Matthew and Hannah after their calm rest were as light as two young deer and merely stopped to say their prayers and wash themselves in a cold pool of the Amonoosuck and then to taste a morsel of food ere they turned their faces to the mountain side It was a sweet emblem of conjugal affection as they toiled up the difficult ascent gathering strength from the mutual aid which they afforded After several little accidents such as a torn robe a lost shoe and the entanglement of Hannah s hair in a bough they reached the upper verge of the forest and were now to pursue a more adventurous course The innumerable trunks and heavy foliage of the trees had hitherto shut in their thoughts which now shrank affrighted from the region of wind and cloud and naked rocks and desolate sunshine that rose immeasurably above them They gazed back at the obscure wilderness which they had traversed and longed to be buried again in its depths rather than trust themselves to so vast and visible a solitude Shall we go on said Matthew throwing his arm round Hannah s waist both to protect her and to comfort his heart by drawing her close to it But the little bride simple as she was had a woman s love of jewels and could not forego the hope of possessing the very brightest in the world in spite of the perils with which it must be won Let us climb a little higher whispered she yet tremulously as she turned her face upward to the lonely sky Come then said Matthew mustering his manly courage and drawing her along with him for she became timid again the moment that he grew bold And upward accordingly went the pilgrims of the Great Carbuncle now treading upon the tops and thickly interwoven branches of dwarf pines which by the growth of centuries though mossy with age had barely reached three feet in altitude Next they came to masses and fragments of naked rock heaped confusedly together like a cairn reared by giants in memory of a giant chief In this bleak realm of upper air nothing breathed nothing grew there was no life but what was concentred in their two hearts they had climbed so high that Nature herself seemed no longer to keep them company She lingered beneath them within the verge of the forest trees and sent a farewell glance after her children as they strayed where her own green footprints had never been But soon they were to be hidden from her eye Densely and dark the mists began to gather below casting black spots of shadow on the vast landscape and sailing heavily to one centre as if the loftiest mountain peak had summoned a council of its kindred clouds Finally the vapors welded themselves as it were into a mass presenting the appearance of a pavement over which the wanderers might have trodden but where they would vainly have sought an avenue to the blessed earth which they had lost And the lovers yearned to behold that green earth again more intensely alas than beneath a clouded sky they had ever desired a glimpse of heaven They even felt it a relief to their desolation when the mists creeping gradually up the mountain concealed its lonely peak and thus annihilated at least for them the whole region of visible space But they drew closer together with a fond and melancholy gaze dreading lest the universal cloud should snatch them from each other s sight Still perhaps they would have been resolute to climb as far and as high between earth and heaven as they could find foothold if Hannah s strength had not begun to fail and with that her courage also Her breath grew short She refused to burden her husband with her weight but often tottered against his side and recovered herself each time by a feebler effort At last she sank down on one of the rocky steps of the acclivity We are lost dear Matthew said she mournfully we shall never find our way to the earth again And oh how happy we might have been in our cottage Dear heart we will yet be happy there answered Matthew Look In this direction the sunshine penetrates the dismal mist by its aid I can direct our course to the passage of the Notch Let us go back love and dream no more of the Great Carbuncle The sun cannot be yonder said Hannah with despondence By this time it must be noon if there could ever be any sunshine here it would come from above our heads But look repeated Matthew in a somewhat altered tone It is brightening every moment If not sunshine what can it be Nor could the young bride any longer deny that a radiance was breaking through the mist and changing its dim hue to a dusky red which continually grew more vivid as if brilliant particles were interfused with the gloom Now also the cloud began to roll away from the mountain while as it heavily withdrew one object after another started out of its impenetrable obscurity into sight with precisely the effect of a new creation before the indistinctness of the old chaos had been completely swallowed up As the process went on they saw the gleaming of water close at their feet and found themselves on the very border of a mountain lake deep bright clear and calmly beautiful spreading from brim to brim of a basin that had been scooped out of the solid rock A ray of glory flashed across its surface The pilgrims looked whence it should proceed but closed their eyes with a thrill of awful admiration to exclude the fervid splendor that glowed from the brow of a cliff impending over the enchanted lake For the simple pair had reached that lake of mystery and found the long sought shrine of the Great Carbuncle They threw their arms around each other and trembled at their own success for as the legends of this wondrous gem rushed thick upon their memory they felt themselves marked out by fate and the consciousness was fearful Often from childhood upward they had seen it shining like a distant star and now that star was throwing its intensest lustre on their hearts They seemed changed to one another s eyes in the red brilliancy that flamed upon their cheeks while it lent the same fire to the lake the rocks and sky and to the mists which had rolled back before its power But with their next glance they beheld an object that drew their attention even from the mighty stone At the base of the cliff directly beneath the Great Carbuncle appeared the figure of a man with his arms extended in the act of climbing and his face turned upward as if to drink the full gush of splendor But he stirred not no more than if changed to marble It is the Seeker whispered Hannah convulsively grasping her husband s arm Matthew he is dead The joy of success has killed him replied Matthew trembling violently Or perhaps the very light of the Great Carbuncle was death The Great Carbuncle cried a peevish voice behind them The great humbug If you have found it prithee point it out to me They turned their heads and there was the cynic with his prodigious spectacles set carefully on his nose staring now at the lake now at the rocks now at the distant masses of vapor now right at the Great Carbuncle itself yet seemingly as unconscious of its light as if all the scattered clouds were condensed about his person Though its radiance actually threw the shadow of the unbeliever at his own feet as he turned his back upon the glorious jewel he would not be convinced that there was the least glimmer there Where is your great humbug he repeated I challenge you to make me see it There said Matthew incensed at such perverse blindness and turning the cynic round toward the illuminated cliff Take off those abominable spectacles and you cannot help seeing it Now these colored spectacles probably darkened the cynic s sight in at least as great a degree as the smoked glasses through which people gaze at an eclipse With resolute bravado however he snatched them from his nose and fixed a bold stare full upon the ruddy blaze of the Great Carbuncle But scarcely had he encountered it when with a deep shuddering groan he dropped his head and pressed both hands across his miserable eyes Thenceforth there was in very truth no light of the Great Carbuncle nor any other light on earth nor light of heaven itself for the poor cynic So long accustomed to view all objects through a medium that deprived them of every glimpse of brightness a single flash of so glorious a phenomenon striking upon his naked vision had blinded him for ever Matthew said Hannah clinging to him let us go hence Matthew saw that she was faint and kneeling down supported her in his arms while he threw some of the thrillingly cold water of the enchanted lake upon her face and bosom It revived her but could not renovate her courage Yes dearest cried Matthew pressing her tremulous form to his breast we will go hence and return to our humble cottage The blessed sunshine and the quiet moonlight shall come through our window We will kindle the cheerful glow of our hearth at eventide and be happy in its light But never again will we desire more light than all the world may share with us No said his bride for how could we live by day or sleep by night in this awful blaze of the Great Carbuncle Out of the hollow of their hands they drank each a draught from the lake which presented them its waters uncontaminated by an earthly lip Then lending their guidance to the blinded cynic who uttered not a word and even stifled his groans in his own most wretched heart they began to descend the mountain Yet as they left the shore till then untrodden of the spirit s lake they threw a farewell glance toward the cliff and beheld the vapors gathering in dense volumes through which the gem burned duskily As touching the other pilgrims of the Great Carbuncle the legend goes on to tell that the worshipful Master Ichabod Pigsnort soon gave up the quest as a desperate speculation and wisely resolved to betake himself again to his warehouse near the town dock in Boston But as he passed through the Notch of the mountains a war party of Indians captured our unlucky merchant and carried him to Montreal there holding him in bondage till by the payment of a heavy ransom he had woefully subtracted from his hoard of pine tree shillings By his long absence moreover his affairs had become so disordered that for the rest of his life instead of wallowing in silver he had seldom a sixpence worth of copper Doctor Cacaphodel the alchemist returned to his laboratory with a prodigious fragment of granite which he ground to powder dissolved in acids melted in the crucible and burnt with the blowpipe and published the result of his experiments in one of the heaviest folios of the day And for all these purposes the gem itself could not have answered better than the granite The poet by a somewhat similar mistake made prize of a great piece of ice which he found in a sunless chasm of the mountains and swore that it corresponded in all points with his idea of the Great Carbuncle The critics say that if his poetry lacked the splendor of the gem it retained all the coldness of the ice The lord De Vere went back to his ancestral hall where he contented himself with a wax lighted chandelier and filled in due course of time another coffin in the ancestral vault As the funeral torches gleamed within that dark receptacle there was no need of the Great Carbuncle to show the vanity of earthly pomp The cynic having cast aside his spectacles wandered about the world a miserable object and was punished with an agonizing desire of light for the wilful blindness of his former life The whole night long he would lift his splendor blasted orbs to the moon and stars he turned his face eastward at sunrise as duly as a Persian idolater he made a pilgrimage to Rome to witness the magnificent illumination of Saint Peter s church and finally perished in the Great Fire of London into the midst of which he had thrust himself with the desperate idea of catching one feeble ray from the blaze that was kindling earth and heaven Matthew and his bride spent many peaceful years and were fond of telling the legend of the Great Carbuncle The tale however toward the close of their lengthened lives did not meet with the full credence that had been accorded to it by those who remembered the ancient lustre of the gem For it is affirmed that from the hour when two mortals had shown themselves so simply wise as to reject a jewel which would have dimmed all earthly things its splendor waned When our pilgrims reached the cliff they found only an opaque stone with particles of mica glittering on its surface There is also a tradition that as the youthful pair departed the gem was loosened from the forehead of the cliff and fell into the enchanted lake and that at noontide the Seeker s form may still be seen to bend over its quenchless gleam Some few believe that this inestimable stone is blazing as of old and say that they have caught its radiance like a flash of summer lightning far down the valley of the Saco And be it owned that many a mile from the Crystal Hills I saw a wondrous light around their summits and was lured by the faith of poesy to be the latest pilgrim of the Great Carbuncle THE PROPHETIC PICTURES one But this painter cried Walter Ludlow with animation He not only excels in his peculiar art but possesses vast acquirements in all other learning and science He talks Hebrew with doctor Mather and gives lectures in anatomy to doctor Boylston In a word he will meet the best instructed man among us on his own ground Moreover he is a polished gentleman a citizen of the world yes a true cosmopolite for he will speak like a native of each clime and country on the globe except our own forests whither he is now going Nor is all this what I most admire in him Footnote one This story was suggested by an anecdote of Stuart related in Dunlap s History of the Arts of Designs a most entertaining book to the general reader and a deeply interesting one we should think to the artist Indeed said Elinor who had listened with a women s interest to the description of such a man Yet this is admirable enough Surely it is replied her lover but far less so than his natural gift of adapting himself to every variety of character insomuch that all men and all women too Elinor shall find a mirror of themselves in this wonderful painter But the greatest wonder is yet to be told Nay if he have more wonderful attributes than these said Elinor laughing Boston is a perilous abode for the poor gentleman Are you telling me of a painter or a wizard In truth answered he that question might be asked much more seriously than you suppose They say that he paints not merely a man s features but his mind and heart He catches the secret sentiments and passions and throws them upon the canvas like sunshine or perhaps in the portraits of dark souled men like a gleam of infernal fire It is an awful gift added Walter lowering his voice from its tone of enthusiasm I shall be almost afraid to sit to him Walter are you in earnest exclaimed Elinor For Heaven s sake dearest Elinor do not let him paint the look which you now wear said her lover smiling though rather perplexed There it is passing away now but when you spoke you seemed frightened to death and very sad besides What were you thinking of Nothing nothing answered Elinor hastily You paint my face with your own fantasies Well come for me tomorrow and we will visit this wonderful artist But when the young man had departed it cannot be denied that a remarkable expression was again visible on the fair and youthful face of his mistress It was a sad and anxious look little in accordance with what should have been the feelings of a maiden on the eve of wedlock Yet Walter Ludlow was the chosen of her heart A look said Elinor to herself No wonder that it startled him if it expressed what I sometimes feel I know by my own experience how frightful a look may be But it was all fancy I thought nothing of it at the time I have seen nothing of it since I did but dream it and she busied herself about the embroidery of a ruff in which she meant that her portrait should be taken The painter of whom they had been speaking was not one of those native artists who at a later period than this borrowed their colors from the Indians and manufactured their pencils of the furs of wild beasts Perhaps if he could have revoked his life and prearranged his destiny he might have chosen to belong to that school without a master in the hope of being at least original since there were no works of art to imitate nor rules to follow But he had been born and educated in Europe People said that he had studied the grandeur or beauty of conception and every touch of the master hand in all the most famous pictures in cabinets and galleries and on the walls of churches till there was nothing more for his powerful mind to learn Art could add nothing to its lessons but Nature might He had therefore visited a world whither none of his professional brethren had preceded him to feast his eyes on visible images that were noble and picturesque yet had never been transferred to canvas America was too poor to afford other temptations to an artist of eminence though many of the colonial gentry on the painter s arrival had expressed a wish to transmit their lineaments to posterity by moans of his skill Whenever such proposals were made he fixed his piercing eyes on the applicant and seemed to look him through and through If he beheld only a sleek and comfortable visage though there were a gold laced coat to adorn the picture and golden guineas to pay for it he civilly rejected the task and the reward but if the face were the index of anything uncommon in thought sentiment or experience or if he met a beggar in the street with a white beard and a furrowed brow or if sometimes a child happened to look up and smile he would exhaust all the art on them that he denied to wealth Pictorial skill being so rare in the colonies the painter became an object of general curiosity If few or none could appreciate the technical merit of his productions yet there were points in regard to which the opinion of the crowd was as valuable as the refined judgment of the amateur He watched the effect that each picture produced on such untutored beholders and derived profit from their remarks while they would as soon have thought of instructing Nature herself as him who seemed to rival her Their admiration it must be owned was tinctured with the prejudices of the age and country Some deemed it an offence against the Mosaic law and even a presumptuous mockery of the Creator to bring into existence such lively images of his creatures Others frightened at the art which could raise phantoms at will and keep the form of the dead among the living were inclined to consider the painter as a magician or perhaps the famous Black Man of old witch times plotting mischief in a new guise These foolish fancies were more than half believed among the mob Even in superior circles his character was invested with a vague awe partly rising like smoke wreaths from the popular superstitions but chiefly caused by the varied knowledge and talents which he made subservient to his profession Being on the eve of marriage Walter Ludlow and Elinor were eager to obtain their portraits as the first of what they doubtless hoped would be a long series of family pictures The day after the conversation above recorded they visited the painter s rooms A servant ushered them into an apartment where though the artist himself was not visible there were personages whom they could hardly forbear greeting with reverence They knew indeed that the whole assembly were but pictures yet felt it impossible to separate the idea of life and intellect from such striking counterfeits Several of the portraits were known to them either as distinguished characters of the day or their private acquaintances There was Governor Burnett looking as if he had just received an undutiful communication from the House of Representatives and were inditing a most sharp response mister Cooke hung beside the ruler whom he opposed sturdy and somewhat puritanical as befitted a popular leader The ancient lady of Sir William Phipps eyed them from the wall in ruff and farthingale an imperious old dame not unsuspected of witchcraft John Winslow then a very young man wore the expression of warlike enterprise which long afterward made him a distinguished general Their personal friends were recognized at a glance In most of the pictures the whole mind and character were brought out on the countenance and concentrated into a single look so that to speak paradoxically the originals hardly resembled themselves so strikingly as the portraits did Among these modern worthies there were two old bearded saints who had almost vanished into the darkening canvas There was also a pale but unfaded Madonna who had perhaps been worshipped in Rome and now regarded the lovers with such a mild and holy look that they longed to worship too How singular a thought observed Walter Ludlow that this beautiful face has been beautiful for above two hundred years Oh if all beauty would endure so well Do you not envy her Elinor If earth were heaven I might she replied But where all things fade how miserable to be the one that could not fade This dark old saint Peter has a fierce and ugly scowl saint though he be continued Walter he troubles me But the Virgin looks kindly at us Yes but very sorrowfully methinks said Elinor The easel stood beneath these three old pictures sustaining one that had been recently commenced After a little inspection they began to recognize the features of their own minister the reverend doctor Colman growing into shape and life as it were out of a cloud Kind old man exclaimed Elinor He gazes at me as if he were about to utter a word of paternal advice And at me said Walter as if he were about to shake his head and rebuke me for some suspected iniquity But so does the original I shall never feel quite comfortable under his eye till we stand before him to be married They now heard a footstep on the floor and turning beheld the painter who had been some moments in the room and had listened to a few of their remarks He was a middle aged man with a countenance well worthy of his own pencil Indeed by the picturesque though careless arrangement of his rich dress and perhaps because his soul dwelt always among painted shapes he looked somewhat like a portrait himself His visitors were sensible of a kindred between the artist and his works and felt as if one of the pictures had stepped from the canvas to salute them Walter Ludlow who was slightly known to the painter explained the object of their visit While he spoke a sunbeam was falling athwart his figure and Elinor s with so happy an effect that they also seemed living pictures of youth and beauty gladdened by bright fortune The artist was evidently struck My easel is occupied for several ensuing days and my stay in Boston must be brief said he thoughtfully then after an observant glance he added But your wishes shall be gratified though I disappoint the chief justice and Madame Oliver I must not lose this opportunity for the sake of painting a few ells of broadcloth and brocade The painter expressed a desire to introduce both their portraits into one picture and represent them engaged in some appropriate action This plan would have delighted the lovers but was necessarily rejected because so large a space of canvas would have been unfit for the room which it was intended to decorate Two half length portraits were therefore fixed upon After they had taken leave Walter Ludlow asked Elinor with a smile whether she knew what an influence over their fates the painter was about to acquire The old women of Boston affirm continued he that after he has once got possession of a person s face and figure he may paint him in any act or situation whatever and the picture will be prophetic Do you believe it Not quite said Elinor smiling Yet if he has such magic there is something so gentle in his manner that I am sure he will use it well It was the painter s choice to proceed with both the portraits at the same time assigning as a reason in the mystical language which he sometimes used that the faces threw light upon each other Accordingly he gave now a touch to Walter and now to Elinor and the features of one and the other began to start forth so vividly that it appeared as if his triumphant art would actually disengage them from the canvas Amid the rich light and deep shade they beheld their phantom selves but though the likeness promised to be perfect they were not quite satisfied with the expression it seemed more vague than in most of the painter s works He however was satisfied with the prospect of success and being much interested in the lovers employed his leisure moments unknown to them in making a crayon sketch of their two figures During their sittings he engaged them in conversation and kindled up their faces with characteristic traits which though continually varying it was his purpose to combine and fix At length he announced that at their next visit both the portraits would be ready for delivery If my pencil will but be true to my conception in the few last touches which I meditate observed he these two pictures will be my very best performances Seldom indeed has an artist such subjects While speaking he still bent his penetrative eye upon them nor withdrew it till they had reached the bottom of the stairs Nothing in the whole circle of human vanities takes stronger hold of the imagination than this affair of having a portrait painted Yet why should it be so The looking glass the polished globes of the andirons the mirror like water and all other reflecting surfaces continually present us with portraits or rather ghosts of ourselves which we glance at and straightway forget them But we forget them only because they vanish It is the idea of duration of earthly immortality that gives such a mysterious interest to our own portraits Walter and Elinor were not insensible to this feeling and hastened to the painter s room punctually at the appointed hour to meet those pictured shapes which were to be their representatives with posterity The sunshine flashed after them into the apartment but left it somewhat gloomy as they closed the door Their eyes were immediately attracted to their portraits which rested against the farthest wall of the room At the first glance through the dim light and the distance seeing themselves in precisely their natural attitudes and with all the air that they recognized so well they uttered a simultaneous exclamation of delight There we stand cried Walter enthusiastically fixed in sunshine for ever No dark passions can gather on our faces No said Elinor more calmly no dreary change can sadden us This was said while they were approaching and had yet gained only an imperfect view of the pictures The painter after saluting them busied himself at a table in completing a crayon sketch leaving his visitors to form their own judgment as to his perfected labors At intervals he sent a glance from beneath his deep eyebrows watching their countenances in profile with his pencil suspended over the sketch They had now stood some moments each in front of the other s picture contemplating it with entranced attention but without uttering a word At length Walter stepped forward then back viewing Elinor s portrait in various lights and finally spoke Is there not a change said he in a doubtful and meditative tone Yes the perception of it grows more vivid the longer I look It is certainly the same picture that I saw yesterday the dress the features all are the same and yet something is altered Is then the picture less like than it was yesterday inquired the painter now drawing near with irrepressible interest The features are perfect Elinor answered Walter and at the first glance the expression seemed also hers but I could fancy that the portrait has changed countenance while I have been looking at it The eyes are fixed on mine with a strangely sad and anxious expression Nay it is grief and terror Is this like Elinor Compare the living face with the pictured one said the painter Walter glanced sidelong at his mistress and started Motionless and absorbed fascinated as it were in contemplation of Walter s portrait Elinor s face had assumed precisely the expression of which he had just been complaining Had she practised for whole hours before a mirror she could not have caught the look so successfully Had the picture itself been a mirror it could not have thrown back her present aspect with stronger and more melancholy truth She appeared quite unconscious of the dialogue between the artist and her lover Elinor exclaimed Walter in amazement what change has come over you She did not hear him nor desist from her fixed gaze till he seized her hand and thus attracted her notice then with a sudden tremor she looked from the picture to the face of the original Do you see no change in your portrait asked she In mine None replied Walter examining it But let me see Yes there is a slight change an improvement I think in the picture though none in the likeness It has a livelier expression than yesterday as if some bright thought were flashing from the eyes and about to be uttered from the lips Now that I have caught the look it becomes very decided While he was intent on these observations Elinor turned to the painter She regarded him with grief and awe and felt that he repaid her with sympathy and commiseration though wherefore she could but vaguely guess That look whispered she and shuddered How came it there Madam said the painter sadly taking her hand and leading her apart in both these pictures I have painted what I saw The artist the true artist must look beneath the exterior It is his gift his proudest but often a melancholy one to see the inmost soul and by a power indefinable even to himself to make it glow or darken upon the canvas in glances that express the thought and sentiment of years Would that I might convince myself of error in the present instance They had now approached the table on which were heads in chalk hands almost as expressive as ordinary faces ivied church towers thatched cottages old thunder stricken trees Oriental and antique costume and all such picturesque vagaries of an artist s idle moments Turning them over with seeming carelessness a crayon sketch of two figures was disclosed If I have failed continued he if your heart does not see itself reflected in your own portrait if you have no secret cause to trust my delineation of the other it is not yet too late to alter them I might change the action of these figures too But would it influence the event He directed her notice to the sketch A thrill ran through Elinor s frame a shriek was upon her lips but she stifled it with the self command that becomes habitual to all who hide thoughts of fear and anguish within their bosoms Turning from the table she perceived that Walter had advanced near enough to have seen the sketch though she could not determine whether it had caught his eye We will not have the pictures altered said she hastily If mine is sad I shall but look the gayer for the contrast Be it so answered the painter bowing May your griefs be such fanciful ones that only your pictures may mourn for them For your joys may they be true and deep and paint themselves upon this lovely face till it quite belie my art After the marriage of Walter and Elinor the pictures formed the two most splendid ornaments of their abode They hung side by side separated by a narrow panel appearing to eye each other constantly yet always returning the gaze of the spectator Travelled gentlemen who professed a knowledge of such subjects reckoned these among the most admirable specimens of modern portraiture while common observers compared them with the originals feature by feature and were rapturous in praise of the likeness But it was on a third class neither travelled connoisseurs nor common observers but people of natural sensibility that the pictures wrought their strongest effect Such persons might gaze carelessly at first but becoming interested would return day after day and study these painted faces like the pages of a mystic volume Walter Ludlow s portrait attracted their earliest notice In the absence of himself and his bride they sometimes disputed as to the expression which the painter had intended to throw upon the features all agreeing that there was a look of earnest import though no two explained it alike There was less diversity of opinion in regard to Elinor s picture They differed indeed in their attempts to estimate the nature and depth of the gloom that dwelt upon her face but agreed that it was gloom and alien from the natural temperament of their youthful friend A certain fanciful person announced as the result of much scrutiny that both these pictures were parts of one design and that the melancholy strength of feeling in Elinor s countenance bore reference to the more vivid emotion or as he termed it the wild passion in that of Walter Though unskilled in the art he even began a sketch in which the action of the two figures was to correspond with their mutual expression It was whispered among friends that day by day Elinor s face was assuming a deeper shade of pensiveness which threatened soon to render her too true a counterpart of her melancholy picture Walter on the other hand instead of acquiring the vivid look which the painter had given him on the canvas became reserved and downcast with no outward flashes of emotion however it might be smouldering within In course of time Elinor hung a gorgeous curtain of purple silk wrought with flowers and fringed with heavy golden tassels before the pictures under pretence that the dust would tarnish their hues or the light dim them It was enough Her visitors felt that the massive folds of the silk must never be withdrawn nor the portraits mentioned in her presence Time wore on and the painter came again He had been far enough to the north to see the silver cascade of the Crystal Hills and to look over the vast round of cloud and forest from the summit of New England s loftiest mountain But he did not profane that scene by the mockery of his art He had also lain in a canoe on the bosom of Lake George making his soul the mirror of its loveliness and grandeur till not a picture in the Vatican was more vivid than his recollection He had gone with the Indian hunters to Niagara and there again had flung his hopeless pencil down the precipice feeling that he could as soon paint the roar as aught else that goes to make up the wondrous cataract In truth it was seldom his impulse to copy natural scenery except as a framework for the delineations of the human form and face instinct with thought passion or suffering With store of such his adventurous ramble had enriched him The stern dignity of Indian chiefs the dusky loveliness of Indian girls the domestic life of wigwams the stealthy march the battle beneath gloomy pine trees the frontier fortress with its garrison the anomaly of the old French partisan bred in courts but grown gray in shaggy deserts such were the scenes and portraits that he had sketched The glow of perilous moments flashes of wild feeling struggles of fierce power love hate grief frenzy in a word all the worn out heart of the old earth had been revealed to him under a new form His portfolio was filled with graphic illustrations of the volume of his memory which genius would transmute into its own substance and imbue with immortality He felt that the deep wisdom in his art which he had sought so far was found But amid stern or lovely nature in the perils of the forest or its overwhelming peacefulness still there had been two phantoms the companions of his way Like all other men around whom an engrossing purpose wreathes itself he was insulated from the mass of humankind He had no aim no pleasure no sympathies but what were ultimately connected with his art Though gentle in manner and upright in intent and action he did not possess kindly feelings his heart was cold no living creature could be brought near enough to keep him warm For these two beings however he had felt in its greatest intensity the sort of interest which always allied him to the subjects of his pencil He had pried into their souls with his keenest insight and pictured the result upon their features with his utmost skill so as barely to fall short of that standard which no genius ever reached his own severe conception He had caught from the duskiness of the future at least so he fancied a fearful secret and had obscurely revealed it on the portraits So much of himself of his imagination and all other powers had been lavished on the study of Walter and Elinor that he almost regarded them as creations of his own like the thousands with which he had peopled the realms of Picture Therefore did they flit through the twilight of the woods hover on the mist of waterfalls look forth from the mirror of the lake nor melt away in the noontide sun They haunted his pictorial fancy not as mockeries of life nor pale goblins of the dead but in the guise of portraits each with an unalterable expression which his magic had evoked from the caverns of the soul He could not recross the Atlantic till he had again beheld the originals of those airy pictures O glorious Art Thus mused the enthusiastic painter as he trod the street Thou art the image of the Creator s own The innumerable forms that wander in nothingness start into being at thy beck The dead live again thou recallest them to their old scenes and givest their gray shadows the lustre of a better life at once earthly and immortal Thou snatchest back the fleeting moments of history With then there is no past for at thy touch all that is great becomes for ever present and illustrious men live through long ages in the visible performance of the very deeds which made them what they are O potent Art as thou bringest the faintly revealed past to stand in that narrow strip of sunlight which we call now canst thou summon the shrouded future to meet her there Have I not achieved it Am I not thy prophet Thus with a proud yet melancholy fervor did he almost cry aloud as he passed through the toilsome street among people that knew not of his reveries nor could understand nor care for them It is not good for man to cherish a solitary ambition Unless there be those around him by whose example he may regulate himself his thoughts desires and hopes will become extravagant and he the semblance perhaps the reality of a madman Reading other bosoms with an acuteness almost preternatural the painter failed to see the disorder of his own And this should be the house said he looking up and down the front before he knocked Heaven help my brains That picture Methinks it will never vanish Whether I look at the windows or the door there it is framed within them painted strongly and glowing in the richest tints the faces of the portraits the figures and action of the sketch He knocked The portraits are they within inquired he of the domestic then recollecting himself Your master and mistress are they at home They are sir said the servant adding as he noticed that picturesque aspect of which the painter could never divest himself and the portraits too The guest was admitted into a parlor communicating by a central door with an interior room of the same size As the first apartment was empty he passed to the entrance of the second within which his eyes were greeted by those living personages as well as their pictured representatives who had long been the objects of so singular an interest He involuntarily paused on the threshold They had not perceived his approach Walter and Elinor were standing before the portraits whence the former had just flung back the rich and voluminous folds of the silken curtain holding its golden tassel with one hand while the other grasped that of his bride The pictures concealed for months gleamed forth again in undiminished splendor appearing to throw a sombre light across the room rather than to be disclosed by a borrowed radiance That of Elinor had been almost prophetic A pensiveness and next a gentle sorrow had successively dwelt upon her countenance deepening with the lapse of time into a quiet anguish A mixture of affright would now have made it the very expression of the portrait Walter s face was moody and dull or animated only by fitful flashes which left a heavier darkness for their momentary illumination He looked from Elinor to her portrait and thence to his own in the contemplation of which he finally stood absorbed The painter seemed to hear the step of Destiny approaching behind him on its progress toward its victims A strange thought darted into his mind Was not his own the form in which that Destiny had embodied itself and he a chief agent of the coming evil which he had foreshadowed Still Walter remained silent before the picture communing with it as with his own heart and abandoning himself to the spell of evil influence that the painter had cast upon the features Gradually his eyes kindled while as Elinor watched the increasing wildness of his face her own assumed a look of terror and when at last he turned upon her the resemblance of both to their portraits was complete Our fate is upon us howled Walter Die Drawing a knife he sustained her as she was sinking to the ground and aimed it at her bosom In the action and in the look and attitude of each the painter beheld the figures of his sketch The picture with all its tremendous coloring was finished Hold madman cried he sternly He had advanced from the door and interposed himself between the wretched beings with the same sense of power to regulate their destiny as to alter a scene upon the canvas He stood like a magician controlling the phantoms which he had evoked What muttered Walter Ludlow as he relapsed from fierce excitement into sullen gloom Does Fate impede its own decree Wretched lady said the painter did I not warn you You did replied Elinor calmly as her terror gave place to the quiet grief which it had disturbed But I loved him Is there not a deep moral in the tale Could the result of one or all our deeds be shadowed forth and set before us some would call it fate and hurry onward others be swept along by their passionate desires and none be turned aside by the prophetic pictures DAVID SWAN A FANTASY We can be but partially acquainted even with the events which actually influence our course through life and our final destiny There are innumerable other events if such they may be called which come close upon us yet pass away without actual results or even betraying their near approach by the reflection of any light or shadow across our minds Could we know all the vicissitudes of our fortunes life would be too full of hope and fear exultation or disappointment to afford us a single hour of true serenity This idea may be illustrated by a page from the secret history of David Swan We have nothing to do with David until we find him at the age of twenty on the high road from his native place to the city of Boston where his uncle a small dealer in the grocery line was to take him behind the counter Be it enough to say that he was a native of New Hampshire born of respectable parents and had received an ordinary school education with a classic finish by a year at Gilmanton Academy After journeying on foot from sunrise till nearly noon of a summer s day his weariness and the increasing heat determined him to sit down in the first convenient shade and await the coming up of the stage coach As if planted on purpose for him there soon appeared a little tuft of maples with a delightful recess in the midst and such a fresh bubbling spring that it seemed never to have sparkled for any wayfarer but David Swan Virgin or not he kissed it with his thirsty lips and then flung himself along the brink pillowing his head upon some shirts and a pair of pantaloons tied up in a striped cotton handkerchief The sunbeams could not reach him the dust did not yet rise from the road after the heavy rain of yesterday and his grassy lair suited the young man better than a bed of down The spring murmured drowsily beside him the branches waved dreamily across the blue sky overhead and a deep sleep perchance hiding dreams within its depths fell upon David Swan But we are to relate events which he did not dream of While he lay sound asleep in the shade other people were wide awake and passed to and fro afoot on horseback and in all sorts of vehicles along the sunny road by his bedchamber Some looked neither to the right hand nor the left and knew not that he was there some merely glanced that way without admitting the slumberer among their busy thoughts some laughed to see how soundly he slept and several whose hearts were brimming full of scorn ejected their venomous superfluity on David Swan A middle aged widow when nobody else was near thrust her head a little way into the recess and vowed that the young fellow looked charming in his sleep A temperance lecturer saw him and wrought poor David into the texture of his evening s discourse as an awful instance of dead drunkenness by the roadside But censure praise merriment scorn and indifference were all one or rather all nothing to David Swan He had slept only a few moments when a brown carriage drawn by a handsome pair of horses bowled easily along and was brought to a standstill nearly in front of David s resting place A linch pin had fallen out and permitted one of the wheels to slide off The damage was slight and occasioned merely a momentary alarm to an elderly merchant and his wife who were returning to Boston in the carriage While the coachman and a servant were replacing the wheel the lady and gentleman sheltered themselves beneath the maple trees and there espied the bubbling fountain and David Swan asleep beside it Impressed with the awe which the humblest sleeper usually sheds around him the merchant trod as lightly as the gout would allow and his spouse took good heed not to rustle her silk gown lest David should start up all of a sudden How soundly he sleeps whispered the old gentleman From what a depth he draws that easy breath Such sleep as that brought on without an opiate would be worth more to me than half my income for it would suppose health and an untroubled mind And youth besides said the lady Healthy and quiet age does not sleep thus Our slumber is no more like his than our wakefulness The longer they looked the more did this elderly couple feel interested in the unknown youth to whom the wayside and the maple shade were as a secret chamber with the rich gloom of damask curtains brooding over him Perceiving that a stray sunbeam glimmered down upon his face the lady contrived to twist a branch aside so as to intercept it and having done this little act of kindness she began to feel like a mother to him Providence seems to have laid him here whispered she to her husband and to have brought us hither to find him after our disappointment in our cousin s son Methinks I can see a likeness to our departed Henry Shall we waken him To what purpose said the merchant hesitating We know nothing of the youth s character That open countenance replied his wife in the same hushed voice yet earnestly This innocent sleep While these whispers were passing the sleeper s heart did not throb nor his breath become agitated nor his features betray the least token of interest Yet Fortune was bending over him just ready to let fall a burden of gold The old merchant had lost his only son and had no heir to his wealth except a distant relative with whose conduct he was dissatisfied In such cases people sometimes do stranger things than to act the magician and awaken a young man to splendor who fell asleep in poverty Shall we not waken him repeated the lady persuasively The coach is ready sir said the servant behind The old couple started reddened and hurried away mutually wondering that they should ever have dreamed of doing anything so very ridiculous The merchant threw himself back in the carriage and occupied his mind with the plan of a magnificent asylum for unfortunate men of business Meanwhile David Swan enjoyed his nap The carriage could not have gone above a mile or two when a pretty young girl came along with a tripping pace which showed precisely how her little heart was dancing in her bosom Perhaps it was this merry kind of motion that caused is there any harm in saying it her garter to slip its knot Conscious that the silken girth if silk it were was relaxing its hold she turned aside into the shelter of the maple trees and there found a young man asleep by the spring Blushing as red as any rose that she should have intruded into a gentleman s bedchamber and for such a purpose too she was about to make her escape on tiptoe But there was peril near the sleeper A monster of a bee had been wandering overhead buzz buzz buzz now among the leaves now flashing through the strips of sunshine and now lost in the dark shade till finally he appeared to be settling on the eyelid of David Swan The sting of a bee is sometimes deadly As free hearted as she was innocent the girl attacked the intruder with her handkerchief brushed him soundly and drove him from beneath the maple shade How sweet a picture This good deed accomplished with quickened breath and a deeper blush she stole a glance at the youthful stranger for whom she had been battling with a dragon in the air He is handsome thought she and blushed redder yet How could it be that no dream of bliss grew so strong within him that shattered by its very strength it should part asunder and allow him to perceive the girl among its phantoms Why at least did no smile of welcome brighten upon his face She was come the maid whose soul according to the old and beautiful idea had been severed from his own and whom in all his vague but passionate desires he yearned to meet Her only could he love with a perfect love him only could she receive into the depths of her heart and now her image was faintly blushing in the fountain by his side should it pass away its happy lustre would never gleam upon his life again How sound he sleeps murmured the girl She departed but did not trip along the road so lightly as when she came Now this girl s father was a thriving country merchant in the neighborhood and happened at that identical time to be looking out for just such a young man as David Swan Had David formed a wayside acquaintance with the daughter he would have become the father s clerk and all else in natural succession So here again had good fortune the best of fortunes stolen so near that her garments brushed against him and he knew nothing of the matter The girl was hardly out of sight when two men turned aside beneath the maple shade Both had dark faces set off by cloth caps which were drawn down aslant over their brows Their dresses were shabby yet had a certain smartness These were a couple of rascals who got their living by whatever the devil sent them and now in the interim of other business had staked the joint profits of their next piece of villainy on a game of cards which was to have been decided here under the trees But finding David asleep by the spring one of the rogues whispered to his fellow Hist Do you see that bundle under his head The other villain nodded winked and leered I ll bet you a horn of brandy said the first that the chap has either a pocketbook or a snug little hoard of small change stowed away amongst his shirts And if not there we will find it in his pantaloons pocket But how if he wakes said the other His companion thrust aside his waistcoat pointed to the handle of a dirk and nodded So be it muttered the second villain They approached the unconscious David and while one pointed the dagger toward his heart the other began to search the bundle beneath his head Their two faces grim wrinkled and ghastly with guilt and fear bent over their victim looking horrible enough to be mistaken for fiends should he suddenly awake Nay had the villains glanced aside into the spring even they would hardly have known themselves as reflected there But David Swan had never worn a more tranquil aspect even when asleep on his mother s breast I must take away the bundle whispered one If he stirs I ll strike muttered the other But at this moment a dog scenting along the ground came in beneath the maple trees and gazed alternately at each of these wicked men and then at the quiet sleeper He then lapped out of the fountain Pshaw said one villain We can do nothing now The dog s master must be close behind Let s take a drink and be off said the other The man with the dagger thrust back the weapon into his bosom and drew forth a pocket pistol but not of that kind which kills by a single discharge It was a flask of liquor with a block tin tumbler screwed upon the mouth Each drank a comfortable dram and left the spot with so many jests and such laughter at their unaccomplished wickedness that they might be said to have gone on their way rejoicing In a few hours they had forgotten the whole affair nor once imagined that the recording angel had written down the crime of murder against their souls in letters as durable as eternity As for David Swan he still slept quietly neither conscious of the shadow of death when it hung over him nor of the glow of renewed life when that shadow was withdrawn He slept but no longer so quietly as at first An hour s repose had snatched from his elastic frame the weariness with which many hours of toil had burdened it Now he stirred now moved his lips without a sound now talked in an inward tone to the noonday spectres of his dream But a noise of wheels came rattling louder and louder along the road until it dashed through the dispersing mist of David s slumber and there was the stagecoach He started up with all his ideas about him Halloo driver Take a passenger shouted he Room on top answered the driver Up mounted David and bowled away merrily toward Boston without so much as a parting glance at that fountain of dreamlike vicissitude He knew not that a phantom of Wealth had thrown a golden hue upon its waters nor that one of Love had sighed softly to their murmur nor that one of Death had threatened to crimson them with his blood all in the brief hour since he lay down to sleep Sleeping or waking we hear not the airy footsteps of the strange things that almost happen Does it not argue a superintending Providence that while viewless and unexpected events thrust themselves continually athwart our path there should still be regularity enough in mortal life to render foresight even partially available SIGHTS FROM A STEEPLE So I have climbed high and my reward is small Here I stand with wearied knees earth indeed at a dizzy depth below but heaven far far beyond me still Oh that I could soar up into the very zenith where man never breathed nor eagle ever flew and where the ethereal azure melts away from the eye and appears only a deepened shade of nothingness And yet I shiver at that cold and solitary thought What clouds are gathering in the golden west with direful intent against the brightness and the warmth of this summer afternoon They are ponderous air ships black as death and freighted with the tempest and at intervals their thunder the signal guns of that unearthly squadron rolls distant along the deep of heaven These nearer heaps of fleecy vapor methinks I could roll and toss upon them the whole day long seem scattered here and there for the repose of tired pilgrims through the sky Perhaps for who can tell beautiful spirits are disporting themselves there and will bless my mortal eye with the brief appearance of their curly locks of golden light and laughing faces fair and faint as the people of a rosy dream Or where the floating mass so imperfectly obstructs the color of the firmament a slender foot and fairy limb resting too heavily upon the frail support may be thrust through and suddenly withdrawn while longing fancy follows them in vain Yonder again is an airy archipelago where the sunbeams love to linger in their journeyings through space Every one of those little clouds has been dipped and steeped in radiance which the slightest pressure might disengage in silvery profusion like water wrung from a sea maid s hair Bright they are as a young man s visions and like them would be realized in dullness obscurity and tears I will look on them no more In three parts of the visible circle whose centre is this spire I discern cultivated fields villages white country seats the waving lines of rivulets little placid lakes and here and there a rising ground that would fain be termed a hill On the fourth side is the sea stretching away toward a viewless boundary blue and calm except where the passing anger of a shadow flits across its surface and is gone Hitherward a broad inlet penetrates far into the land on the verge of the harbor formed by its extremity is a town and over it am I a watchman all heeding and unheeded Oh that the multitude of chimneys could speak like those of Madrid and betray in smoky whispers the secrets of all who since their first foundation have assembled at the hearths within Oh that the Limping Devil of Le Sage would perch beside me here extend his wand over this contiguity of roofs uncover every chamber and make me familiar with their inhabitants The most desirable mode of existence might be that of a spiritualized Paul Pry hovering invisible round man and woman witnessing their deeds searching into their hearts borrowing brightness from their felicity and shade from their sorrow and retaining no emotion peculiar to himself But none of these things are possible and if I would know the interior of brick walls or the mystery of human bosoms I can but guess Yonder is a fair street extending north and south The stately mansions are placed each on its carpet of verdant grass and a long flight of steps descends from every door to the pavement Ornamental trees the broadleafed horse chestnut the elm so lofty and bending the graceful but infrequent willow and others whereof I know not the names grow thrivingly among brick and stone The oblique rays of the sun are intercepted by these green citizens and by the houses so that one side of the street is a shaded and pleasant walk On its whole extent there is now but a single passenger advancing from the upper end and he unless distance and the medium of a pocket spyglass do him more than justice is a fine young man of twenty He saunters slowly forward slapping his left hand with his folded gloves bending his eyes upon the pavement and sometimes raising them to throw a glance before him Certainly he has a pensive air Is he in doubt or in debt Is he if the question be allowable in love Does he strive to be melancholy and gentlemanlike or is he merely overcome by the heat But I bid him farewell for the present The door of one of the houses an aristocratic edifice with curtains of purple and gold waving from the windows is now opened and down the steps come two ladies swinging their parasols and lightly arrayed for a summer ramble Both are young both are pretty but methinks the left hand lass is the fairer of the twain and though she be so serious at this moment I could swear that there is a treasure of gentle fun within her They stand talking a little while upon the steps and finally proceed up the street Meantime as their faces are now turned from me I may look elsewhere Upon that wharf and down the corresponding street is a busy contrast to the quiet scene which I have just noticed Business evidently has its centre there and many a man is wasting the summer afternoon in labor and anxiety in losing riches or in gaining them when he would be wiser to flee away to some pleasant country village or shaded lake in the forest or wild and cool sea beach I see vessels unlading at the wharf and precious merchandise strown upon the ground abundantly as at the bottom of the sea that market whence no goods return and where there is no captain nor supercargo to render an account of sales Here the clerks are diligent with their paper and pencils and sailors ply the block and tackle that hang over the hold accompanying their toil with cries long drawn and roughly melodious till the bales and puncheons ascend to upper air At a little distance a group of gentlemen are assembled round the door of a warehouse Grave seniors be they and I would wager if it were safe in these times to be responsible for any one that the least eminent among them might vie with old Vincentio that incomparable trafficker of Pisa I can even select the wealthiest of the company It is the elderly personage in somewhat rusty black with powdered hair the superfluous whiteness of which is visible upon the cape of his coat His twenty ships are wafted on some of their many courses by every breeze that blows and his name I will venture to say though I know it not is a familiar sound among the far separated merchants of Europe and the Indies But I bestow too much of my attention in this quarter On looking again to the long and shady walk I perceive that the two fair girls have encountered the young man After a sort of shyness in the recognition he turns back with them Moreover he has sanctioned my taste in regard to his companions by placing himself on the inner side of the pavement nearest the Venus to whom I enacting on a steeple top the part of Paris on the top of Ida adjudged the golden apple In two streets converging at right angles toward my watch tower I distinguish three different processions One is a proud array of voluntary soldiers in bright uniform resembling from the height whence I look down the painted veterans that garrison the windows of a toy shop And yet it stirs my heart Their regular advance their nodding plumes the sun flash on their bayonets and musket barrels the roll of their drums ascending past me and the fife ever and anon piercing through these things have wakened a warlike fire peaceful though I be Close to their rear marches a battalion of schoolboys ranged in crooked and irregular platoons shouldering sticks thumping a harsh and unripe clatter from an instrument of tin and ridiculously aping the intricate manoeuvres of the foremost band Nevertheless as slight differences are scarcely perceptible from a church spire one might be tempted to ask Which are the boys or rather Which the men But leaving these let us turn to the third procession which though sadder in outward show may excite identical reflections in the thoughtful mind It is a funeral a hearse drawn by a black and bony steed and covered by a dusty pall two or three coaches rumbling over the stones their drivers half asleep a dozen couple of careless mourners in their every day attire Such was not the fashion of our fathers when they carried a friend to his grave There is now no doleful clang of the bell to proclaim sorrow to the town Was the King of Terrors more awful in those days than in our own that wisdom and philosophy have been able to produce this change Not so Here is a proof that he retains his proper majesty The military men and the military boys are wheeling round the corner and meet the funeral full in the face Immediately the drum is silent all but the tap that regulates each simultaneous footfall The soldiers yield the path to the dusty hearse and unpretending train and the children quit their ranks and cluster on the sidewalks with timorous and instinctive curiosity The mourners enter the churchyard at the base of the steeple and pause by an open grave among the burial stones the lightning glimmers on them as they lower down the coffin and the thunder rattles heavily while they throw the earth upon its lid Verily the shower is near and I tremble for the young man and the girls who have now disappeared from the long and shady street How various are the situations of the people covered by the roofs beneath me and how diversified are the events at this moment befalling them The new born the aged the dying the strong in life and the recent dead are in the chambers of these many mansions The full of hope the happy the miserable and the desperate dwell together within the circle of my glance In some of the houses over which my eyes roam so coldly guilt is entering into hearts that are still tenanted by a debased and trodden virtue guilt is on the very edge of commission and the impending deed might be averted guilt is done and the criminal wonders if it be irrevocable There are broad thoughts struggling in my mind and were I able to give them distinctness they would make their way in eloquence Lo the raindrops are descending The clouds within a little time have gathered over all the sky hanging heavily as if about to drop in one unbroken mass upon the earth At intervals the lightning flashes from their brooding hearts quivers disappears and then comes the thunder travelling slowly after its twin born flame A strong wind has sprung up howls through the darkened streets and raises the dust in dense bodies to rebel against the approaching storm The disbanded soldiers fly the funeral has already vanished like its dead and all people hurry homeward all that have a home while a few lounge by the corners or trudge on desperately at their leisure In a narrow lane which communicates with the shady street I discern the rich old merchant putting himself to the top of his speed lest the rain should convert his hair powder to a paste Unhappy gentleman By the slow vehemence and painful moderation wherewith he journeys it is but too evident that Podagra has left its thrilling tenderness in his great toe But yonder at a far more rapid pace come three other of my acquaintance the two pretty girls and the young man unseasonably interrupted in their walk Their footsteps are supported by the risen dust the wind lends them its velocity they fly like three sea birds driven landward by the tempestuous breeze The ladies would not thus rival Atalanta if they but knew that any one were at leisure to observe them Ah as they hasten onward laughing in the angry face of nature a sudden catastrophe has chanced At the corner where the narrow lane enters into the street they come plump against the old merchant whose tortoise motion has just brought him to that point He likes not the sweet encounter the darkness of the whole air gathers speedily upon his visage and there is a pause on both sides Finally he thrusts aside the youth with little courtesy seizes an arm of each of the two girls and plods onward like a magician with a prize of captive fairies All this is easy to be understood How disconsolate the poor lover stands regardless of the rain that threatens an exceeding damage to his well fashioned habiliments till he catches a backward glance of mirth from a bright eye and turns away with whatever comfort it conveys The old man and his daughters are safely housed and now the storm lets loose its fury In every dwelling I perceive the faces of the chambermaids as they shut down the windows excluding the impetuous shower and shrinking away from the quick fiery glare The large drops descend with force upon the slated roofs and rise again in smoke There is a rush and roar as of a river through the air and muddy streams bubble majestically along the pavement whirl their dusky foam into the kennel and disappear beneath iron grates Thus did Arethusa sink I love not my station here aloft in the midst of the tumult which I am powerless to direct or quell with the blue lightning wrinkling on my brow and the thunder muttering its first awful syllables in my ear I will descend Yet let me give another glance to the sea where the foam breaks out in long white lines upon a broad expanse of blackness or boils up in far distant points like snowy mountain tops in the eddies of a flood and let me look once more at the green plain and little hills of the country over which the giant of the storm is striding in robes of mist and at the town whose obscured and desolate streets might beseem a city of the dead and turning a single moment to the sky now gloomy as an author s prospects I prepare to resume my station on lower earth But stay A little speck of azure has widened in the western heavens the sunbeams find a passage and go rejoicing through the tempest and on yonder darkest cloud born like hallowed hopes of the glory of another world and the trouble and tears of this brightens forth the rainbow THE HOLLOW OF THE THREE HILLS In those strange old times when fantastic dreams and madmen s reveries were realized among the actual circumstances of life two persons met together at an appointed hour and place One was a lady graceful in form and fair of feature though pale and troubled and smitten with an untimely blight in what should have been the fullest bloom of her years the other was an ancient and meanly dressed woman of ill favored aspect and so withered shrunken and decrepit that even the space since she began to decay must have exceeded the ordinary term of human existence In the spot where they encountered no mortal could observe them Three little hills stood near each other and down in the midst of them sunk a hollow basin almost mathematically circular two or three hundred feet in breadth and of such depth that a stately cedar might but just be visible above the sides Dwarf pines were numerous upon the hills and partly fringed the outer verge of the intermediate hollow within which there was nothing but the brown grass of October and here and there a tree trunk that had fallen long ago and lay mouldering with no green successor from its roots One of these masses of decaying wood formerly a majestic oak rested close beside a pool of green and sluggish water at the bottom of the basin Such scenes as this so gray tradition tells were once the resort of a power of evil and his plighted subjects and here at midnight or on the dim verge of evening they were said to stand round the mantling pool disturbing its putrid waters in the performance of an impious baptismal rite The chill beauty of an autumnal sunset was now gilding the three hill tops whence a paler tint stole down their sides into the hollow Here is our pleasant meeting come to pass said the aged crone according as thou hast desired Say quickly what thou wouldst have of me for there is but a short hour that we may tarry here As the old withered woman spoke a smile glimmered on her countenance like lamplight on the wall of a sepulchre The lady trembled and cast her eyes upward to the verge of the basin as if meditating to return with her purpose unaccomplished But it was not so ordained I am stranger in this land as you know said she at length Whence I come it matters not but I have left those behind me with whom my fate was intimately bound and from whom I am cut off for ever There is a weight in my bosom that I cannot away with and I have come hither to inquire of their welfare And who is there by this green pool that can bring thee news from the ends of the earth cried the old woman peering into the lady s face Not from my lips mayst thou hear these tidings yet be thou bold and the daylight shall not pass away from yonder hilltop before thy wish be granted I will do your bidding though I die replied the lady desperately The old woman seated herself on the trunk of the fallen tree threw aside the hood that shrouded her gray locks and beckoned her companion to draw near Kneel down she said and lay your forehead on my knees She hesitated a moment but the anxiety that had long been kindling burned fiercely up within her As she knelt down the border of her garment was dipped into the pool she laid her forehead on the old woman s knees and the latter drew a cloak about the lady s face so that she was in darkness Then she heard the muttered words of prayer in the midst of which she started and would have arisen Let me flee Let me flee and hide myself that they may not look upon me she cried But with returning recollection she hushed herself and was still as death for it seemed as if other voices familiar in infancy and unforgotten through many wanderings and in all the vicissitudes of her heart and fortune were mingling with the accents of the prayer At first the words were faint and indistinct not rendered so by distance but rather resembling the dim pages of a book which we strive to read by an imperfect and gradually brightening light In such a manner as the prayer proceeded did those voices strengthen upon the ear till at length the petition ended and the conversation of an aged man and of a woman broken and decayed like himself became distinctly audible to the lady as she knelt But those strangers appeared not to stand in the hollow depth between the three hills Their voices were encompassed and re echoed by the walls of a chamber the windows of which were rattling in the breeze the regular vibration of a clock the crackling of a fire and the tinkling of the embers as they fell among the ashes rendered the scene almost as vivid as if painted to the eye By a melancholy hearth sat these two old people the man calmly despondent the woman querulous and tearful and their words were all of sorrow They spoke of a daughter a wanderer they knew not where bearing dishonor along with her and leaving shame and affliction to bring their gray heads to the grave They alluded also to other and more recent woe but in the midst of their talk their voices seemed to melt into the sound of the wind sweeping mournfully among the autumn leaves and when the lady lifted her eyes there was she kneeling in the hollow between three hills A weary and lonesome time yonder old couple have of it remarked the old woman smiling in the lady s face And did you also hear them exclaimed she a sense of intolerable humiliation triumphing over her agony and fear Yea and we have yet more to hear replied the old woman wherefore cover thy face quickly Again the withered hag poured forth the monotonous words of a prayer that was not meant to be acceptable in heaven and soon in the pauses of her breath strange murmurings began to thicken gradually increasing so as to drown and overpower the charm by which they grew Shrieks pierced through the obscurity of sound and were succeeded by the singing of sweet female voices which in their turn gave way to a wild roar of laughter broken suddenly by groanings and sobs forming altogether a ghastly confusion of terror and mourning and mirth Chains were rattling fierce and stern voices uttered threats and the scourge resounded at their command All these noises deepened and became substantial to the listener s ear till she could distinguish every soft and dreamy accent of the love songs that died causelessly into funeral hymns She shuddered at the unprovoked wrath which blazed up like the spontaneous kindling of flume and she grew faint at the fearful merriment raging miserably around her In the midst of this wild scene where unbound passions jostled each other in a drunken career there was one solemn voice of a man and a manly and melodious voice it might once have been He went to and fro continually and his feet sounded upon the floor In each member of that frenzied company whose own burning thoughts had become their exclusive world he sought an auditor for the story of his individual wrong and interpreted their laughter and tears as his reward of scorn or pity He spoke of woman s perfidy of a wife who had broken her holiest vows of a home and heart made desolate Even as he went on the shout the laugh the shriek the sob rose up in unison till they changed into the hollow fitful and uneven sound of the wind as it fought among the pine trees on those three lonely hills The lady looked up and there was the withered woman smiling in her face Couldst thou have thought there were such merry times in a mad house inquired the latter True true said the lady to herself there is mirth within its walls but misery misery without Wouldst thou hear more demanded the old woman There is one other voice I would fain listen to again replied the lady faintly Then lay down thy head speedily upon my knees that thou mayst get thee hence before the hour be past The golden skirts of day were yet lingering upon the hills but deep shades obscured the hollow and the pool as if sombre night wore rising thence to overspread the world Again that evil woman began to weave her spell Long did it proceed unanswered till the knolling of a bell stole in among the intervals of her words like a clang that had travelled far over valley and rising ground and was just ready to die in the air The lady shook upon her companion s knees as she heard that boding sound Stronger it grew and sadder and deepened into the tone of a death bell knolling dolefully from some ivy mantled tower and bearing tidings of mortality and woe to the cottage to the hall and to the solitary wayfarer that all might weep for the doom appointed in turn to them Then came a measured tread passing slowly slowly on as of mourners with a coffin their garments trailing on the ground so that the ear could measure the length of their melancholy array Before them went the priest reading the burial service while the leaves of his book were rustling in the breeze And though no voice but his was heard to speak aloud still there were revilings and anathemas whispered but distinct from women and from men breathed against the daughter who had wrung the aged hearts of her parents the wife who had betrayed the trusting fondness of her husband the mother who had sinned against natural affection and left her child to die The sweeping sound of the funeral train faded away like a thin vapor and the wind that just before had seemed to shake the coffin pall moaned sadly round the verge of the hollow between three hills But when the old woman stirred the kneeling lady she lifted not her head Here has been a sweet hour s sport said the withered crone chuckling to herself THE TOLL GATHERER S DAY A SKETCH OF TRANSITORY LIFE Methinks for a person whose instinct bids him rather to pore over the current of life than to plunge into its tumultuous waves no undesirable retreat were a toll house beside some thronged thoroughfare of the land In youth perhaps it is good for the observer to run about the earth to leave the track of his footsteps far and wide to mingle himself with the action of numberless vicissitudes and finally in some calm solitude to feed a musing spirit on all that he has seen and felt But there are natures too indolent or too sensitive to endure the dust the sunshine or the rain the turmoil of moral and physical elements to which all the wayfarers of the world expose themselves For such a man how pleasant a miracle could life be made to roll its variegated length by the threshold of his own hermitage and the great globe as it were perform its revolutions and shift its thousand scenes before his eyes without whirling him onward in its course If any mortal be favored with a lot analogous to this it is the toll gatherer So at least have I often fancied while lounging on a bench at the door of a small square edifice which stands between shore and shore in the midst of a long bridge Beneath the timbers ebbs and flows an arm of the sea while above like the life blood through a great artery the travel of the north and east is continually throbbing Sitting on the aforesaid bench I amuse myself with a conception illustrated by numerous pencil sketches in the air of the toll gatherer s day In the morning dim gray dewy summer s morn the distant roll of ponderous wheels begins to mingle with my old friend s slumbers creaking more and more harshly through the midst of his dream and gradually replacing it with realities Hardly conscious of the change from sleep to wakefulness he finds himself partly clad and throwing wide the toll gates for the passage of a fragrant load of hay The timbers groan beneath the slow revolving wheels one sturdy yeoman stalks beside the oxen and peering from the summit of the hay by the glimmer of the half extinguished lantern over the toll house is seen the drowsy visage of his comrade who has enjoyed a nap some ten miles long The toll is paid creak creak again go the wheels and the huge hay mow vanishes into the morning mist As yet nature is but half awake and familiar objects appear visionary But yonder dashing from the shore with a rattling thunder of the wheels and a confused clatter of hoofs comes the never tiring mail which has hurried onward at the same headlong restless rate all through the quiet night The bridge resounds in one continued peal as the coach rolls on without a pause merely affording the toll gatherer a glimpse at the sleepy passengers who now bestir their torpid limbs and snuff a cordial in the briny air The morn breathes upon them and blushes and they forget how wearily the darkness toiled away And behold now the fervid day in his bright chariot glittering aslant over the waves nor scorning to throw a tribute of his golden beams on the toll gatherer s little hermitage The old man looks eastward and for he is a moralizer frames a simile of the stage coach and the sun While the world is rousing itself we may glance slightly at the scene of our sketch It sits above the bosom of the broad flood a spot not of earth but in the midst of waters which rush with a murmuring sound among the massive beams beneath Over the door is a weatherbeaten board inscribed with the rates of toll in letters so nearly effaced that the gilding of the sunshine can hardly make them legible Beneath the window is a wooden bench on which a long succession of weary wayfarers have reposed themselves Peeping within doors we perceive the whitewashed walls bedecked with sundry lithographic prints and advertisements of various import and the immense show bill of a wandering caravan And there sits our good old toll gatherer glorified by the early sunbeams He is a man as his aspect may announce of quiet soul and thoughtful shrewd yet simple mind who of the wisdom which the passing world scatters along the wayside has gathered a reasonable store Now the sun smiles upon the landscape and earth smiles back again upon the sky Frequent now are the travellers The toll gatherer s practised ear can distinguish the weight of every vehicle the number of its wheels and how many horses beat the resounding timbers with their iron tramp Here in a substantial family chaise setting forth betimes to take advantage of the dewy road come a gentleman and his wife with their rosy cheeked little girl sitting gladsomely between them The bottom of the chaise is heaped with multifarious bandboxes and carpet bags and beneath the axle swings a leathern trunk dusty with yesterday s journey Next appears a four wheeled carryall peopled with a round half dozen of pretty girls all drawn by a single horse and driven by a single gentleman Luckless wight doomed through a whole summer day to be the butt of mirth and mischief among the frolicsome maidens Bolt upright in a sulky rides a thin sour visaged man who as he pays his toll hands the toll gatherer a printed card to stick upon the wall The vinegar faced traveller proves to be a manufacturer of pickles Now paces slowly from timber to timber a horseman clad in black with a meditative brow as of one who whithersoever his steed might bear him would still journey through a mist of brooding thought He is a country preacher going to labor at a protracted meeting The next object passing townward is a butcher s cart canopied with its arch of snow white cotton Behind comes a sauceman driving a wagon full of new potatoes green ears of corn beets carrots turnips and summer squashes and next two wrinkled withered witch looking old gossips in an antediluvian chaise drawn by a horse of former generations and going to peddle out a lot of huckleberries See there a man trundling a wheelbarrow load of lobsters And now a milk cart rattles briskly onward covered with green canvas and conveying the contributions of a whole herd of cows in large tin canisters But let all these pay their toll and pass Here comes a spectacle that causes the old toll gatherer to smile benignantly as if the travellers brought sunshine with them and lavished its gladsome influence all along the road It is a barouche of the newest style the varnished panels of which reflect the whole moving panorama of the landscape and show a picture likewise of our friend with his visage broadened so that his meditative smile is transformed to grotesque merriment Within sits a youth fresh as the summer morn and beside him a young lady in white with white gloves upon her slender hands and a white veil flowing down over her face But methinks her blushing cheek burns through the snowy veil Another white robed virgin sits in front And who are these on whom and on all that appertains to them the dust of earth seems never to have settled Two lovers whom the priest has blessed this blessed morn and sent them forth with one of the bride maids on the matrimonial tour Take my blessing too ye happy ones May the sky not frown upon you nor clouds bedew you with their chill and sullen rain May the hot sun kindle no fever in your hearts May your whole life s pilgrimage be as blissful as this first day s journey and its close be gladdened with even brighter anticipations than those which hallow your bridal night They pass and ere the reflection of their joy has faded from his face another spectacle throws a melancholy shadow over the spirit of the observing man In a close carriage sits a fragile figure muffled carefully and shrinking even from the mild breath of summer She leans against a manly form and his arm enfolds her as if to guard his treasure from some enemy Let but a few weeks pass and when he shall strive to embrace that loved one he will press only desolation to his heart And now has Morning gathered up her dewy pearls and fled away The sun rolls blazing through the sky and cannot find a cloud to cool his face with The horses toil sluggishly along the bridge and heave their glistening sides in short quick pantings when the reins are tightened at the toll house Glisten too the faces of the travellers Their garments are thickly bestrewn with dust their whiskers and hair look hoary their throats are choked with the dusty atmosphere which they have left behind them No air is stirring on the road Nature dares draw no breath lest she should inhale a stifling cloud of dust A hot and dusty day cry the poor pilgrims as they wipe their begrimed foreheads and woo the doubtful breeze which the river bears along with it Awful hot Dreadful dusty answers the sympathetic toll gatherer They start again to pass through the fiery furnace while he re enters his cool hermitage and besprinkles it with a pail of briny water from the stream beneath He thinks within himself that the sun is not so fierce here as elsewhere and that the gentle air doth not forget him in these sultry days Yes old friend and a quiet heart will make a dog day temperate He hears a weary footstep and perceives a traveller with pack and staff who sits down upon the hospitable bench and removes the hat from his wet brow The toll gatherer administers a cup of cold water and discovering his guest to be a man of homely sense he engages him in profitable talk uttering the maxims of a philosophy which he has found in his own soul but knows not how it came there And as the wayfarer makes ready to resume his journey he tells him a sovereign remedy for blistered feet Now comes the noontide hour of all the hours nearest akin to midnight for each has its own calmness and repose Soon however the world begins to turn again upon its axis and it seems the busiest epoch of the day when an accident impedes the march of sublunary things The draw being lifted to permit the passage of a schooner laden with wood from the Eastern forests she sticks immovably right athwart the bridge Meanwhile on both sides of the chasm a throng of impatient travellers fret and fume Here are two sailors in a gig with the top thrown back both puffing cigars and swearing all sorts of forecastle oaths there in a smart chaise a dashingly dressed gentleman and lady he from a tailor s shop board and she from a milliner s back room the aristocrats of a summer afternoon And what are the haughtiest of us but the ephemeral aristocrats of a summer s day Here is a tin pedler whose glittering ware bedazzles all beholders like a travelling meteor or opposition sun and on the other side a seller of spruce beer which brisk liquor is confined in several dozen of stone bottles Here conic a party of ladies on horseback in green ridings habits and gentlemen attendant and there a flock of sheep for the market pattering over the bridge with a multitude nous clatter of their little hoofs here a Frenchman with a hand organ on his shoulder and there an itinerant Swiss jeweller On this side heralded by a blast of clarions and bugles appears a train of wagons conveying all the wild beasts of a caravan and on that a company of summer soldiers marching from village to village on a festival campaign attended by the brass band Now look at the scene and it presents an emblem of the mysterious confusion the apparently insolvable riddle in which individuals or the great world itself seem often to be involved What miracle shall set all things right again But see the schooner has thrust her bulky carcase through the chasm the draw descends horse and foot pass onward and leave the bridge vacant from end to end And thus muses the toll gatherer have I found it with all stoppages even though the universe seemed to be at a stand The sage old man Far westward now the reddening sun throws a broad sheet of splendor across the flood and to the eyes of distant boatmen gleams brightly among the timbers of the bridge Strollers come from the town to quaff the freshening breeze One or two let down long lines and haul up flapping flounders or cunners or small cod or perhaps an eel Others and fair girls among them with the flush of the hot day still on their cheeks bend over the railing and watch the heaps of seaweed floating upward with the flowing tide The horses now tramp heavily along the bridge and wistfully bethink them of their stables Rest rest thou weary world for to morrow s round of toil and pleasure will be as wearisome as to day s has been yet both shall bear thee onward a day s march of eternity Now the old toll gatherer looks seaward and discerns the lighthouse kindling on a far island and the stars too kindling in the sky as if but a little way beyond and mingling reveries of heaven with remembrances of earth the whole procession of mortal travellers all the dusty pilgrimage which he has witnessed seems like a flitting show of phantoms for his thoughtful soul to muse upon THE VISION OF THE FOUNTAIN At fifteen I became a resident in a country village more than a hundred miles from home The morning after my arrival a September morning but warm and bright as any in July I rambled into a wood of oaks with a few walnut trees intermixed forming the closest shade above my head The ground was rocky uneven overgrown with bushes and clumps of young saplings and traversed only by cattle paths The track which I chanced to follow led me to a crystal spring with a border of grass as freshly green as on May morning and overshadowed by the limb of a great oak One solitary sunbeam found its way down and played like a goldfish in the water From my childhood I have loved to gaze into a spring The water filled a circular basin small but deep and set round with stones some of which were covered with slimy moss the others naked and of variegated hue reddish white and brown The bottom was covered with coarse sand which sparkled in the lonely sunbeam and seemed to illuminate the spring with an unborrowed light In one spot the gush of the water violently agitated the sand but without obscuring the fountain or breaking the glassiness of its surface It appeared as if some living creature were about to emerge the naiad of the spring perhaps in the shape of a beautiful young woman with a gown of filmy water moss a belt of rainbow drops and a cold pure passionless countenance How would the beholder shiver pleasantly yet fearfully to see her sitting on one of the stones paddling her white feet in the ripples and throwing up water to sparkle in the sun Wherever she laid her hands on grass and flowers they would immediately be moist as with morning dew Then would she set about her labors like a careful housewife to clear the fountain of withered leaves and bits of slimy wood and old acorns from the oaks above and grains of corn left by cattle in drinking till the bright sand in the bright water were like a treasury of diamonds But should the intruder approach too near he would find only the drops of a summer shower glistening about the spot where he had seen her Reclining on the border of grass where the dewy goddess should have been I bent forward and a pair of eyes met mine within the watery mirror They were the reflection of my own I looked again and lo another face deeper in the fountain than my own image more distinct in all the features yet faint as thought The vision had the aspect of a fair young girl with locks of paly gold A mirthful expression laughed in the eyes and dimpled over the whole shadowy countenance till it seemed just what a fountain would be if while dancing merrily into the sunshine it should assume the shape of woman Through the dim rosiness of the cheeks I could see the brown leaves the slimy twigs the acorns and the sparkling sand The solitary sunbeam was diffused among the golden hair which melted into its faint brightness and became a glory round that head so beautiful My description can give no idea how suddenly the fountain was thus tenanted and how soon it was left desolate I breathed and there was the face I held my breath and it was gone Had it passed away or faded into nothing I doubted whether it had ever been My sweet readers what a dreamy and delicious hour did I spend where that vision found and left me For a long time I sat perfectly still waiting till it should reappear and fearful that the slightest motion or even the flutter of my breath might frighten it away Thus have I often started from a pleasant dream and then kept quiet in hopes to wile it back Deep were my musings as to the race and attributes of that ethereal being Had I created her Was she the daughter of my fancy akin to those strange shapes which peep under the lids of children s eyes And did her beauty gladden me for that one moment and then die Or was she a water nymph within the fountain or fairy or woodland goddess peeping over my shoulder or the ghost of some forsaken maid who had drowned herself for love Or in good truth had a lovely girl with a warm heart and lips that would bear pressure stolen softly behind me and thrown her image into the spring I watched and waited but no vision came again I departed but with a spell upon me which drew me back that same afternoon to the haunted spring There was the water gushing the sand sparkling and the sunbeam glimmering There the vision was not but only a great frog the hermit of that solitude who immediately withdrew his speckled snout and made himself invisible all except a pair of long legs beneath a stone Methought he had a devilish look I could have slain him as an enchanter who kept the mysterious beauty imprisoned in the fountain Sad and heavy I was returning to the village Between me and the church spire rose a little hill and on its summit a group of trees insulated from all the rest of the wood with their own share of radiance hovering on them from the west and their own solitary shadow falling to the east The afternoon being far declined the sunshine was almost pensive and the shade almost cheerful glory and gloom were mingled in the placid light as if the spirits of the Day and Evening had met in friendship under those trees and found themselves akin I was admiring the picture when the shape of a young girl emerged from behind the clump of oaks My heart knew her it was the vision but so distant and ethereal did she seem so unmixed with earth so imbued with the pensive glory of the spot where she was standing that my spirit sunk within me sadder than before How could I ever reach her While I gazed a sudden shower came pattering down upon the leaves In a moment the air was full of brightness each raindrop catching a portion of sunlight as it fell and the whole gentle shower appearing like a mist just substantial enough to bear the burden of radiance A rainbow vivid as Niagara s was painted in the air Its southern limb came down before the group of trees and enveloped the fair vision as if the hues of heaven were the only garment for her beauty When the rainbow vanished she who had seemed a part of it was no longer there Was her existence absorbed in nature s loveliest phenomenon and did her pure frame dissolve away in the varied light Yet I would not despair of her return for robed in the rainbow she was the emblem of Hope Thus did the vision leave me and many a doleful day succeeded to the parting moment By the spring and in the wood and on the hill and through the village at dewy sunrise burning noon and at that magic hour of sunset when she had vanished from my sight I sought her but in vain Weeks came and went months rolled away and she appeared not in them I imparted my mystery to none but wandered to and fro or sat in solitude like one that had caught a glimpse of heaven and could take no more joy on earth I withdrew into an inner world where my thoughts lived and breathed and the vision in the midst of them Without intending it I became at once the author and hero of a romance conjuring up rivals imagining events the actions of others and my own and experiencing every change of passion till jealousy and despair had their end in bliss Oh had I the burning fancy of my early youth with manhood s colder gift the power of expression your hearts sweet ladies should flutter at my tale In the middle of January I was summoned home The day before my departure visiting the spots which had been hallowed by the vision I found that the spring had a frozen bosom and nothing but the snow and a glare of winter sunshine on the hill of the rainbow Let me hope thought I or my heart will be as icy as the fountain and the whole world as desolate as this snowy hill Most of the day was spent in preparing for the journey which was to commence at four o clock the next morning About an hour after supper when all was in readiness I descended from my chamber to the sitting room to take leave of the old clergyman and his family with whom I had been an inmate A gust of wind blew out my lamp as I passed through the entry According to their invariable custom so pleasant a one when the fire blazes cheerfully the family were sitting in the parlor with no other light than what came from the hearth As the good clergyman s scanty stipend compelled him to use all sorts of economy the foundation of his fires was always a large heap of tan or ground bark which would smoulder away from morning till night with a dull warmth and no flame This evening the heap of tan was newly put on and surmounted with three sticks of red oak full of moisture and a few pieces of dry pine that had not yet kindled There was no light except the little that came sullenly from two half burnt brands without even glimmering on the andirons But I knew the position of the old minister s arm chair and also where his wife sat with her knitting work and how to avoid his two daughters one a stout country lass and the other a consumptive girl Groping through the gloom I found my own place next to that of the son a learned collegian who had come home to keep school in the village during the winter vacation I noticed that there was less room than usual to night between the collegian s chair and mine As people are always taciturn in the dark not a word was said for some time after my entrance Nothing broke the stillness but the regular click of the matron s knitting needles At times the fire threw out a brief and dusky gleam which twinkled on the old man s glasses and hovered doubtfully round our circle but was far too faint to portray the individuals who composed it Were we not like ghosts Dreamy as the scene was might it not be a type of the mode in which departed people who had known and loved each other here would hold communion in eternity We were aware of each other s presence not by sight nor sound nor touch but by an inward consciousness Would it not be so among the dead The silence was interrupted by the consumptive daughter addressing a remark to some one in the circle whom she called Rachel Her tremulous and decayed accents were answered by a single word but in a voice that made me start and bend toward the spot whence it had proceeded Had I ever heard that sweet low tone If not why did it rouse up so many old recollections or mockeries of such the shadows of things familiar yet unknown and fill my mind with confused images of her features who had spoken though buried in the gloom of the parlor Whom had my heart recognized that it throbbed so I listened to catch her gentle breathing and strove by the intensity of my gaze to picture forth a shape where none was visible Suddenly the dry pine caught the fire blazed up with a ruddy glow and where the darkness had been there was she the vision of the fountain A spirit of radiance only she had vanished with the rainbow and appeared again in the firelight perhaps to flicker with the blaze and be gone Vet her cheek was rosy and lifelike and her features in the bright warmth of the room were even sweeter and tenderer than my recollection of them She knew me The mirthful expression that had laughed in her eyes and dimpled over her countenance when I beheld her faint beauty in the fountain was laughing and dimpling there now One moment our glance mingled the next down rolled the heap of tan upon the kindled wood and darkness snatched away that daughter of the light and gave her back to me no more Fair ladies there is nothing more to tell Must the simple mystery be revealed then that Rachel was the daughter of the village squire and had left home for a boarding school the morning after I arrived and returned the day before my departure If I transformed her to an angel it is what every youthful lover does for his mistress Therein consists the essence of my story But slight the change sweet maids to make angels of yourselves FANCY S SHOW BOX A MORALITY What is guilt A stain upon the soul And it is a point of vast interest whether the soul may contract such stains in all their depth and flagrancy from deeds which may have been plotted and resolved upon but which physically have never had existence Must the fleshly hand and visible frame of man set its seal to the evil designs of the soul in order to give them their entire validity against the sinner Or while none but crimes perpetrated are cognizable before an earthly tribunal will guilty thoughts of which guilty deeds are no more than shadows will these draw down the full weight of a condemning sentence in the supreme court of eternity In the solitude of a midnight chamber or in a desert afar from men or in a church while the body is kneeling the soul may pollute itself even with those crimes which we are accustomed to deem altogether carnal If this be true it is a fearful truth Let us illustrate the subject by an imaginary example A venerable gentleman one mister Smith who had long been regarded as a pattern of moral excellence was warming his aged blood with a glass or two of generous wine His children being gone forth about their worldly business and his grandchildren at school he sat alone in a deep luxurious arm chair with his feet beneath a richly carved mahogany table Some old people have a dread of solitude and when better company may not be had rejoice even to hear the quiet breathing of a babe asleep upon the carpet But mister Smith whose silver hair was the bright symbol of a life unstained except by such spots as are inseparable from human nature he had no need of a babe to protect him by its purity nor of a grown person to stand between him and his own soul Nevertheless either manhood must converse with age or womanhood must soothe him with gentle cares or infancy must sport around his chair or his thoughts will stray into the misty region of the past and the old man be chill and sad Wine will not always cheer him Such might have been the case with mister Smith when through the brilliant medium of his glass of old Madeira he beheld three figures entering the room These were Fancy who had assumed the garb and aspect of an itinerant showman with a box of pictures on her back and Memory in the likeness of a clerk with a pen behind her ear an inkhorn at her buttonhole and a huge manuscript volume beneath her arm and lastly behind the other two a person shrouded in a dusky mantle which concealed both face and form But mister Smith had a shrewd idea that it was Conscience How kind of Fancy Memory and Conscience to visit the old gentleman just as he was beginning to imagine that the wine had neither so bright a sparkle nor so excellent a flavor as when himself and the liquor were less aged Through the dim length of the apartment where crimson curtains muffled the glare of sunshine and created a rich obscurity the three guests drew near the silver haired old man Memory with a finger between the leaves of her huge volume placed herself at his right hand Conscience with her face still hidden in the dusky mantle took her station on the left so as to be next his heart while Fancy set down her picture box upon the table with the magnifying glass convenient to his eye We can sketch merely the outlines of two or three out of the many pictures which at the pulling of a string successively peopled the box with the semblances of living scenes One was a moonlight picture in the background a lowly dwelling and in front partly shadowed by a tree yet besprinkled with flakes of radiance two youthful figures male and female The young man stood with folded arms a haughty smile upon his lip and a gleam of triumph in his eye as he glanced downward at the kneeling girl She was almost prostrate at his feet evidently sinking under a weight of shame and anguish which hardly allowed her to lift her clasped hands in supplication Her eyes she could not lift But neither her agony nor the lovely features on which it was depicted nor the slender grace of the form which it convulsed appeared to soften the obduracy of the young man He was the personification of triumphant scorn Now strange to say as old mister Smith peeped through the magnifying glass which made the objects start out from the canvas with magical deception he began to recognize the farmhouse the tree and both the figures of the picture The young man in times long past had often met his gaze within the looking glass the girl was the very image of his first love his cottage love his Martha Burroughs mister Smith was scandalized Oh vile and slanderous picture he exclaims When have I triumphed over ruined innocence Was not Martha wedded in her teens to David Tomkins who won her girlish love and long enjoyed her affection as a wife And ever since his death she has lived a reputable widow Meantime Memory was turning over the leaves of her volume rustling them to and fro with uncertain fingers until among the earlier pages she found one which had reference to this picture She reads it close to the old gentleman s ear it is a record merely of sinful thought which never was embodied in an act but while Memory is reading Conscience unveils her face and strikes a dagger to the heart of mister Smith Though not a death blow the torture was extreme The exhibition proceeded One after another Fancy displayed her pictures all of which appeared to have been painted by some malicious artist on purpose to vex mister Smith Not a shadow of proof could have been adduced in any earthly court that he was guilty of the slightest of those sins which were thus made to stare him in the face In one scene there was a table set out with several bottles and glasses half filled with wine which threw back the dull ray of an expiring lamp There had been mirth and revelry until the hand of the clock stood just at midnight when Murder stepped between the boon companions A young man had fallen on the floor and lay stone dead with a ghastly wound crushed into his temple while over him with a delirium of mingled rage and horror in his countenance stood the youthful likeness of mister Smith The murdered youth wore the features of Edward Spencer What does this rascal of a painter mean cries mister Smith provoked beyond all patience Edward Spencer was my earliest and dearest friend true to me as I to him through more than half a century Neither I nor any other ever murdered him Was he not alive within five years and did he not in token of our long friendship bequeath me his gold headed cane and a mourning ring Again had Memory been turning over her volume and fixed at length upon so confused a page that she surely must have scribbled it when she was tipsy The purport was however that while mister Smith and Edward Spencer were heating their young blood with wine a quarrel had flashed up between them and mister Smith in deadly wrath had flung a bottle at Spencer s head True it missed its aim and merely smashed a looking glass and the next morning when the incident was imperfectly remembered they had shaken hands with a hearty laugh Yet again while Memory was reading Conscience unveiled her face struck a dagger to the heart of mister Smith and quelled his remonstrance with her iron frown The pain was quite excruciating Some of the pictures had been painted with so doubtful a touch and in colors so faint and pale that the subjects could barely be conjectured A dull semi transparent mist had been thrown over the surface of the canvas into which the figures seemed to vanish while the eye sought most earnestly to fix them But in every scene however dubiously portrayed mister Smith was invariably haunted by his own lineaments at various ages as in a dusty mirror After poring several minutes over one of these blurred and almost indistinguishable pictures he began to see that the painter had intended to represent him now in the decline of life as stripping the clothes from the backs of three half starved children Really this puzzles me quoth mister Smith with the irony of conscious rectitude Asking pardon of the painter I pronounce him a fool as well as a scandalous knave A man of my standing in the world to be robbing little children of their clothes Ridiculous But while he spoke Memory had searched her fatal volume and found a page which with her sad calm voice she poured into his ear It was not altogether inapplicable to the misty scene It told how mister Smith had been grievously tempted by many devilish sophistries on the ground of a legal quibble to commence a lawsuit against three orphan children joint heirs to a considerable estate Fortunately before he was quite decided his claims had turned out nearly as devoid of law as justice As Memory ceased to read Conscience again thrust aside her mantle and would have struck her victim with the envenomed dagger only that he struggled and clasped his hands before his heart Even then however he sustained an ugly gash Why should we follow Fancy through the whole series of those awful pictures Painted by an artist of wondrous power and terrible acquaintance with the secret soul they embodied the ghosts of all the never perpetrated sins that had glided through the lifetime of mister Smith And could such beings of cloudy fantasy so near akin to nothingness give valid evidence against him at the day of judgment Be that the case or not there is reason to believe that one truly penitential tear would have washed away each hateful picture and left the canvas white as snow But mister Smith at a prick of Conscience too keen to be endured bellowed aloud with impatient agony and suddenly discovered that his three guests were gone There he sat alone a silver haired and highly venerated old man in the rich gloom of the crimsoned curtained room with no box of pictures on the table but only a decanter of most excellent Madeira Yet his heart still seemed to fester with the venom of the dagger Nevertheless the unfortunate old gentleman might have argued the matter with Conscience and alleged many reasons wherefore she should not smite him so pitilessly Were we to take up his cause it should be somewhat in the following fashion A scheme of guilt till it be put in execution greatly resembles a train of incidents in a projected tale The latter in order to produce a sense of reality in the reader s mind must be conceived with such proportionate strength by the author as to seem in the glow of fancy more like truth past present or to come than purely fiction The prospective sinner on the other hand weaves his plot of crime but seldom or never feels a perfect certainty that it will be executed There is a dreaminess diffused about his thoughts in a dream as it were he strikes the death blow into his victim s heart and starts to find an indelible blood stain on his hand Thus a novel writer or a dramatist in creating a villain of romance and fitting him with evil deeds and the villain of actual life in projecting crimes that will be perpetrated may almost meet each other halfway between reality and fancy It is not until the crime is accomplished that Guilt clenches its gripe upon the guilty heart and claims it for his own Then and not before sin is actually felt and acknowledged and if unaccompanied by repentance grows a thousandfold more virulent by its self consciousness Be it considered also that men often overestimate their capacity for evil At a distance while its attendant circumstances do not press upon their notice and its results are dimly seen they can bear to contemplate it They may take the steps which lead to crime impelled by the same sort of mental action as in working out a mathematical problem yet be powerless with compunction at the final moment They knew not what deed it was that they deemed themselves resolved to do In truth there is no such thing in man s nature as a settled and full resolve either for good or evil except at the very moment of execution Let us hope therefore that all the dreadful consequences of sin will not be incurred unless the act have set its seal upon the thought Yet with the slight fancy work which we have framed some sad and awful truths are interwoven Man must not disclaim his brotherhood even with the guiltiest since though his hand be clean his heart has surely been polluted by the flitting phantoms of iniquity He must feel that when he shall knock at the gate of heaven no semblance of an unspotted life can entitle him to entrance there Penitence must kneel and Mercy come from the footstool of the throne or that golden gate will never open doctor HEIDEGGER S EXPERIMENT That very singular man old doctor Heidegger once invited four venerable friends to meet him in his study There were three white bearded gentlemen mister Medbourne Colonel Killigrew and mister Gascoigne and a withered gentlewoman whose name was the widow Wycherly They were all melancholy old creatures who had been unfortunate in life and whose greatest misfortune it was that they were not long ago in their graves mister Medbourne in the vigor of his age had been a prosperous merchant but had lost his all by a frantic speculation and was now little better than a mendicant Colonel Killigrew had wasted his best years and his health and substance in the pursuit of sinful pleasures which had given birth to a brood of pains such as the gout and divers other torments of soul and body mister Gascoigne was a ruined politician a man of evil fame or at least had been so till time had buried him from the knowledge of the present generation and made him obscure instead of infamous As for the widow Wycherly tradition tells us that she was a great beauty in her day but for a long while past she had lived in deep seclusion on account of certain scandalous stories which had prejudiced the gentry of the town against her It is a circumstance worth mentioning that each of these three old gentlemen mister Medbourne Colonel Killigrew and mister Gascoigne were early lovers of the widow Wycherly and had once been on the point of cutting each other s throats for her sake And before proceeding farther I will merely hint that doctor Heidegger and all his four guests were sometimes thought to be a little beside themselves as is not infrequently the case with old people when worried either by present troubles or woeful recollections My dear old friends said doctor Heidegger motioning them to be seated I am desirous of your assistance in one of those little experiments with which I amuse myself here in my study If all stories were true doctor Heidegger s study must have been a very curious place It was a dim old fashioned chamber festooned with cobwebs and besprinkled with antique dust Around the walls stood several oaken bookcases the lower shelves of which were filled with rows of gigantic folios and black letter quartos and the upper with little parchment covered duodecimos Over the central bookcase was a bronze bust of Hippocrates with which according to some authorities doctor Heidegger was accustomed to hold consultations in all difficult cases of his practice In the obscurest corner of the room stood a tall and narrow oaken closet with its door ajar within which doubtfully appeared a skeleton Between two of the bookcases hung a looking glass presenting its high and dusty plate within a tarnished gilt frame Among many wonderful stories related of this mirror it was fabled that the spirits of all the doctor s deceased patients dwelt within its verge and would stare him in the face whenever he looked thitherward The opposite side of the chamber was ornamented with the full length portrait of a young lady arrayed in the faded magnificence of silk satin and brocade and with a visage as faded as her dress Above half a century ago doctor Heidegger had been on the point of marriage with this young lady but being affected with some slight disorder she had swallowed one of her lover s prescriptions and died on the bridal evening The greatest curiosity of the study remains to be mentioned it was a ponderous folio volume bound in black leather with massive silver clasps There were no letters on the back and nobody could tell the title of the book But it was well known to be a book of magic and once when a chambermaid had lifted it merely to brush away the dust the skeleton had rattled in its closet the picture of the young lady had stepped one foot upon the floor and several ghastly faces had peeped forth from the mirror while the brazen head of Hippocrates frowned and said Forbear Such was doctor Heidegger s study On the summer afternoon of our tale a small round table as black as ebony stood in the centre of the room sustaining a cut glass vase of beautiful form and elaborate workmanship The sunshine came through the window between the heavy festoons of two faded damask curtains and fell directly across this vase so that a mild splendor was reflected from it on the ashen visages of the five old people who sat around Four champagne glasses were also on the table My dear old friends repeated doctor Heidegger may I reckon on your aid in performing an exceedingly curious experiment Now doctor Heidegger was a very strange old gentleman whose eccentricity had become the nucleus for a thousand fantastic stories Some of these fables to my shame be it spoken might possibly be traced back to mine own veracious self and if any passages of the present tale should startle the reader s faith I must be content to bear the stigma of a fiction monger When the doctor s four guests heard him talk of his proposed experiment they anticipated nothing more wonderful than the murder of a mouse in an air pump or the examination of a cobweb by the microscope or some similar nonsense with which he was constantly in the habit of pestering his intimates But without waiting for a reply doctor Heidegger hobbled across the chamber and returned with the same ponderous folio bound in black leather which common report affirmed to be a book of magic Undoing the silver clasps he opened the volume and took from among its black letter pages a rose or what was once a rose though now the green leaves and crimson petals had assumed one brownish hue and the ancient flower seemed ready to crumble to dust in the doctor s hands This rose said doctor Heidegger with a sigh this same withered and crumbling flower blossomed five and fifty years ago It was given me by Sylvia Ward whose portrait hangs yonder and I meant to wear it in my bosom at our wedding Five and fifty years it has been treasured between the leaves of this old volume Now would you deem it possible that this rose of half a century could ever bloom again Nonsense said the widow Wycherly with a peevish toss of her head You might as well ask whether an old woman s wrinkled face could ever bloom again See answered doctor Heidegger He uncovered the vase and threw the faded rose into the water which it contained At first it lay lightly on the surface of the fluid appearing to imbibe none of its moisture Soon however a singular change began to be visible The crushed and dried petals stirred and assumed a deepening tinge of crimson as if the flower were reviving from a deathlike slumber the slender stalk and twigs of foliage became green and there was the rose of half a century looking as fresh as when Sylvia Ward had first given it to her lover It was scarcely full blown for some of its delicate red leaves curled modestly around its moist bosom within which two or three dewdrops were sparkling That is certainly a very pretty deception said the doctor s friends carelessly however for they had witnessed greater miracles at a conjurer s show Pray how was it effected Did you never hear of the Fountain of Youth asked doctor Heidegger which Ponce de Leon the Spanish adventurer went in search of two or three centuries ago But did Ponce de Leon ever find it said the widow Wycherly No answered doctor Heidegger for he never sought it in the right place The famous Fountain of Youth if I am rightly informed is situated in the southern part of the Floridian peninsula not far from Lake Macaco Its source is overshadowed by several gigantic magnolias which though numberless centuries old have been kept as fresh as violets by the virtues of this wonderful water An acquaintance of mine knowing my curiosity in such matters has sent me what you see in the vase Ahem said Colonel Killigrew who believed not a word of the doctor s story and what may be the effect of this fluid on the human frame You shall judge for yourself my dear colonel replied doctor Heidegger And all of you my respected friends are welcome to so much of this admirable fluid as may restore to you the bloom of youth For my own part having had much trouble in growing old I am in no hurry to grow young again With your permission therefore I will merely watch the progress of the experiment While he spoke doctor Heidegger had been filling the four champagne glasses with the water of the Fountain of Youth It was apparently impregnated with an effervescent gas for little bubbles were continually ascending from the depths of the glasses and bursting in silvery spray at the surface As the liquor diffused a pleasant perfume the old people doubted not that it possessed cordial and comfortable properties and though utter sceptics as to its rejuvenescent power they were inclined to swallow it at once But doctor Heidegger besought them to stay a moment Before you drink my respectable old friends said he it would be well that with the experience of a lifetime to direct you you should draw up a few general rules for your guidance in passing a second time through the perils of youth Think what a sin and shame it would be if with your peculiar advantages you should not become patterns of virtue and wisdom to all the young people of the age The doctor s four venerable friends made him no answer except by a feeble and tremulous laugh so very ridiculous was the idea that knowing how closely Repentance treads behind the steps of Error they should ever go astray again Drink then said the doctor bowing I rejoice that I have so well selected the subjects of my experiment With palsied hands they raised the glasses to their lips The liquor if it really possessed such virtues as doctor Heidegger imputed to it could not have been bestowed on four human beings who needed it more woefully They looked as if they had never known what youth or pleasure was but had been the offspring of Nature s dotage and always the gray decrepit sapless miserable creatures who now sat stooping round the doctor s table without life enough in their souls or bodies to be animated even by the prospect of growing young again They drank off the water and replaced their glasses on the table Assuredly there was an almost immediate improvement in the aspect of the party not unlike what might have been produced by a glass of generous wine together with a sudden glow of cheerful sunshine brightening over all their visages at once There was a healthful suffusion on their cheeks instead of the ashen hue that had made them look so corpse like They gazed at one another and fancied that some magic power had really begun to smooth away the deep and sad inscriptions which Father Time had been so long engraving on their brows The widow Wycherly adjusted her cap for she felt almost like a woman again Give us more of this wondrous water cried they eagerly We are younger but we are still too old Quick give us more Patience patience quoth doctor Heidegger who sat watching the experiment with philosophic coolness You have been a long time growing old surely you might be content to grow young in half an hour But the water is at your service Again he filled their glasses with the liquor of youth enough of which still remained in the vase to turn half the old people in the city to the age of their own grandchildren While the bubbles were yet sparkling on the brim the doctor s four guests snatched their glasses from the table and swallowed the contents at a single gulp Was it delusion Even while the draught was passing down their throats it seemed to have wrought a change on their whole systems Their eyes grew clear and bright a dark shade deepened among their silvery locks they sat around the table three gentlemen of middle age and a woman hardly beyond her buxom prime My dear widow you are charming cried Colonel Killigrew whose eyes had been fixed upon her face while the shadows of age were flitting from it like darkness from the crimson daybreak The fair widow knew of old that Colonel Killigrew s compliments were not always measured by sober truth so she started up and ran to the mirror still dreading that the ugly visage of an old woman would meet her gaze Meanwhile the three gentlemen behaved in such a manner as proved that the water of the Fountain of Youth possessed some intoxicating qualities unless indeed their exhilaration of spirits were merely a lightsome dizziness caused by the sudden removal of the weight of years mister Gascoigne s mind seemed to run on political topics but whether relating to the past present or future could not easily be determined since the same ideas and phrases have been in vogue these fifty years Now he rattled forth full throated sentences about patriotism national glory and the people s right now he muttered some perilous stuff or other in a sly and doubtful whisper so cautiously that even his own conscience could scarcely catch the secret and now again he spoke in measured accents and a deeply deferential tone as if a royal ear were listening to his well turned periods Colonel Killigrew all this time had been trolling forth a jolly bottle song and ringing his glass in symphony with the chorus while his eyes wandered toward the buxom figure of the widow Wycherly On the other side of the table mister Medbourne was involved in a calculation of dollars and cents with which was strangely intermingled a project for supplying the East Indies with ice by harnessing a team of whales to the polar icebergs As for the widow Wycherly she stood before the mirror courtesying and simpering to her own image and greeting it as the friend whom she loved better than all the world besides She thrust her face close to the glass to see whether some long remembered wrinkle or crow s foot had indeed vanished she examined whether the snow had so entirely melted from her hair that the venerable cap could be safely thrown aside At last turning briskly away she came with a sort of dancing step to the table My dear old doctor cried she pray favor me with another glass Certainly my dear madam certainly replied the complaisant doctor See I have already filled the glasses There in fact stood the four glasses brimful of this wonderful water the delicate spray of which as it effervesced from the surface resembled the tremulous glitter of diamonds It was now so nearly sunset that the chamber had grown duskier than ever but a mild and moonlike splendor gleamed from within the vase and rested alike on the four guests and on the doctor s venerable figure He sat in a high backed elaborately carved oaken arm chair with a gray dignity of aspect that might have well befitted that very Father Time whose power had never been disputed save by this fortunate company Even while quaffing the third draught of the Fountain of Youth they were almost awed by the expression of his mysterious visage But the next moment the exhilarating gush of young life shot through their veins They were now in the happy prime of youth Age with its miserable train of cares and sorrows and diseases was remembered only as the trouble of a dream from which they had joyously awoke The fresh gloss of the soul so early lost and without which the world s successive scenes had been but a gallery of faded pictures again threw its enchantment over all their prospects They felt like new created beings in a new created universe We are young We are young they cried exultingly Youth like the extremity of age had effaced the strongly marked characteristics of middle life and mutually assimilated them all They were a group of merry youngsters almost maddened with the exuberant frolicsomeness of their years The most singular effect of their gayety was an impulse to mock the infirmity and decrepitude of which they had so lately been the victims They laughed loudly at their old fashioned attire the wide skirted coats and flapped waistcoats of the young men and the ancient cap and gown of the blooming girl One limped across the floor like a gouty grandfather one set a pair of spectacles astride of his nose and pretended to pore over the black letter pages of the book of magic a third seated himself in an arm chair and strove to imitate the venerable dignity of doctor Heidegger Then all shouted mirthfully and leaped about the room The widow Wycherly if so fresh a damsel could be called a widow tripped up to the doctor s chair with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face Doctor you dear old soul cried she get up and dance with me and then the four young people laughed louder than ever to think what a queer figure the poor old doctor would cut Pray excuse me answered the doctor quietly I am old and rheumatic and my dancing days were over long ago But either of these gay young gentlemen will be glad of so pretty a partner Dance with me Clara cried Colonel Killigrew No no I will be her partner shouted mister Gascoigne She promised me her hand fifty years ago exclaimed mister Medbourne They all gathered round her One caught both her hands in his passionate grasp another threw his arm about her waist the third buried his hand among the glossy curls that clustered beneath the widow s cap Blushing panting struggling chiding laughing her warm breath fanning each of their faces by turns she strove to disengage herself yet still remained in their triple embrace Never was there a livelier picture of youthful rivalship with bewitching beauty for the prize Yet by a strange deception owing to the duskiness of the chamber and the antique dresses which they still wore the tall mirror is said to have reflected the figures of the three old gray withered grand sires ridiculously contending for the skinny ugliness of a shrivelled grandam But they were young their burning passions proved them so Inflamed to madness by the coquetry of the girl widow who neither granted nor quite withheld her favors the three rivals began to interchange threatening glances Still keeping hold of the fair prize they grappled fiercely at one another s throats As they struggled to and fro the table was overturned and the vase dashed into a thousand fragments The precious Water of Youth flowed in a bright stream across the floor moistening the wings of a butterfly which grown old in the decline of summer had alighted there to die The insect fluttered lightly through the chamber and settled on the snowy head of doctor Heidegger Come come gentlemen Come Madam Wycherly exclaimed the doctor I really must protest against this riot They stood still and shivered for it seemed as if gray Time were calling them back from their sunny youth far down into the chill and darksome vale of years They looked at old doctor Heidegger who sat in his carved armchair holding the rose of half a century which he had rescued from among the fragments of the shattered vase At the motion of his hand the four rioters resumed their seats the more readily because their violent exertions had wearied them youthful though they were My poor Sylvia s rose ejaculated doctor Heidegger holding it in the light of the sunset clouds It appears to be fading again And so it was Even while the party were looking at it the flower continued to shrivel up till it became as dry and fragile as when the doctor had first thrown it into the vase He shook off the few drops of moisture which clung to its petals I love it as well thus as in its dewy freshness observed he pressing the withered rose to his withered lips While he spoke the butterfly fluttered down from the doctor s snowy head and fell upon the floor His guests shivered again A strange dullness whether of the body or spirit they could not tell was creeping gradually over them all They gazed at one another and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm and left a deepening furrow where none had been before Was it an illusion Had the changes of a lifetime been crowded into so brief a space and were they now four aged people sitting with their old friend doctor Heidegger Are we grown old again so soon cried they dolefully In truth they had The Water of Youth possessed merely a virtue more transient than that of wine the delirium which it created had effervesced away Yes they were old again With a shuddering impulse that showed her a woman still the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face and wished that the coffin lid were over it since it could be no longer beautiful Yes friends ye are old again said doctor Heidegger and lo the Water of Youth is all lavished on the ground Well I bemoan it not for if the fountain gushed at my very doorstep I would not stoop to bathe my lips in it no though its delirium were for years instead of moments Such is the lesson ye have taught me But the doctor s four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida and quaff at morning noon and night from the Fountain of Youth LEGENDS OF THE PROVINCE HOUSE I HOWE S MASQUERADE II EDWARD RANDOLPH S PORTRAIT III LADY ELEANORE S MANTLE IV OLD ESTHER DUDLEY I HOWE S MASQUERADE One afternoon last summer while walking along Washington street my eye was attracted by a sign board protruding over a narrow archway nearly opposite the Old South Church The sign represented the front of a stately edifice which was designated as the OLD PROVINCE HOUSE kept by Thomas Waite I was glad to be thus reminded of a purpose long entertained of visiting and rambling over the mansion of the old royal governors of Massachusetts and entering the arched passage which penetrated through the middle of a brick row of shops a few steps transported me from the busy heart of modern Boston into a small and secluded court yard One side of this space was occupied by the square front of the Province House three stories high and surmounted by a cupola on the top of which a gilded Indian was discernible with his bow bent and his arrow on the string as if aiming at the weathercock on the spire of the Old South The figure has kept this attitude for seventy years or more ever since good Deacon Drowne a cunning carver of wood first stationed him on his long sentinel s watch over the city The Province House is constructed of brick which seems recently to have been overlaid with a coat of light colored paint A flight of red freestone steps fenced in by a balustrade of curiously wrought iron ascends from the court yard to the spacious porch over which is a balcony with an iron balustrade of similar pattern and workmanship to that beneath These letters and figures sixteen P S seventy nine are wrought into the ironwork of the balcony and probably express the date of the edifice with the initials of its founder s name A wide door with double leaves admitted me into the hall or entry on the right of which is the entrance to the bar room It was in this apartment I presume that the ancient governors held their levees with vice regal pomp surrounded by the military men the counsellors the judges and other officers of the Crown while all the loyalty of the province thronged to do them honor But the room in its present condition cannot boast even of faded magnificence The panelled wainscot is covered with dingy paint and acquires a duskier hue from the deep shadow into which the Province House is thrown by the brick block that shuts it in from Washington street A ray of sunshine never visits this apartment any more than the glare of the festal torches which have been extinguished from the era of the Revolution The most venerable and ornamental object is a chimney piece set round with Dutch tiles of blue figured china representing scenes from Scripture and for aught I know the lady of Pownall or Bernard may have sat beside this fireplace and told her children the story of each blue tile A bar in modern style well replenished with decanters bottles cigar boxes and network bags of lemons and provided with a beer pump and a soda fount extends along one side of the room At my entrance an elderly person was smacking his lips with a zest which satisfied me that the cellars of the Province House still hold good liquor though doubtless of other vintages than were quaffed by the old governors After sipping a glass of port sangaree prepared by the skilful hands of mister Thomas Waite I besought that worthy successor and representative of so many historic personages to conduct me over their time honored mansion He readily complied but to confess the truth I was forced to draw strenuously upon my imagination in order to find aught that was interesting in a house which without its historic associations would have seemed merely such a tavern as is usually favored by the custom of decent city boarders and old fashioned country gentlemen The chambers which were probably spacious in former times are now cut up by partitions and subdivided into little nooks each affording scanty room for the narrow bed and chair and dressing table of a single lodger The great staircase however may be termed without much hyperbole a feature of grandeur and magnificence It winds through the midst of the house by flights of broad steps each flight terminating in a square landing place whence the ascent is continued toward the cupola A carved balustrade freshly painted in the lower stories but growing dingier as we ascend borders the staircase with its quaintly twisted and intertwined pillars from top to bottom Up these stairs the military boots or perchance the gouty shoes of many a governor have trodden as the wearers mounted to the cupola which afforded them so wide a view over their metropolis and the surrounding country The cupola is an octagon with several windows and a door opening upon the roof From this station as I pleased myself with imagining Gage may have beheld his disastrous victory on Bunker Hill unless one of the tri mountains intervened and Howe have marked the approaches of Washington s besieging army although the buildings since erected in the vicinity have shut out almost every object save the steeple of the Old South which seems almost within arm s length Descending from the cupola I paused in the garret to observe the ponderous white oak framework so much more massive than the frames of modern houses and thereby resembling an antique skeleton The brick walls the materials of which were imported from Holland and the timbers of the mansion are still as sound as ever but the floors and other interior parts being greatly decayed it is contemplated to gut the whole and build a new house within the ancient frame and brickwork Among other inconveniences of the present edifice mine host mentioned that any jar or motion was apt to shake down the dust of ages out of the ceiling of one chamber upon the floor of that beneath it We stepped forth from the great front window into the balcony where in old times it was doubtless the custom of the king s representative to show himself to a loyal populace requiting their huzzas and tossed up hats with stately bendings of his dignified person In those days the front of the Province House looked upon the street and the whole site now occupied by the brick range of stores as well as the present court yard was laid out in grass plats overshadowed by trees and bordered by a wrought iron fence Now the old aristocratic edifice hides its time worn visage behind an upstart modern building at one of the back windows I observed some pretty tailoresses sewing and chatting and laughing with now and then a careless glance toward the balcony Descending thence we again entered the bar room where the elderly gentleman above mentioned the smack of whose lips had spoken so favorably for mister Waite s good liquor was still lounging in his chair He seemed to be if not a lodger at least a familiar visitor of the house who might be supposed to have his regular score at the bar his summer seat at the open window and his prescriptive corner at the winter s fireside Being of a sociable aspect I ventured to address him with a remark calculated to draw forth his historical reminiscences if any such were in his mind and it gratified me to discover that between memory and tradition the old gentleman was really possessed of some very pleasant gossip about the Province House The portion of his talk which chiefly interested me was the outline of the following legend He professed to have received it at one or two removes from an eye witness but this derivation together with the lapse of time must have afforded opportunities for many variations of the narrative so that despairing of literal and absolute truth I have not scrupled to make such further changes as seemed conducive to the reader s profit and delight At one of the entertainments given at the province house during the latter part of the siege of Boston there passed a scene which has never yet been satisfactorily explained The officers of the British army and the loyal gentry of the province most of whom were collected within the beleaguered town had been invited to a masqued ball for it was the policy for Sir William Howe to hide the distress and danger of the period and the desperate aspect of the siege under an ostentation of festivity The spectacle of this evening if the oldest members of the provincial court circle might be believed was the most gay and gorgeous affair that had occurred in the annals of the government The brilliantly lighted apartments were thronged with figures that seemed to have stepped from the dark canvas of historic portraits or to have flitted forth from the magic pages of romance or at least to have flown hither from one of the London theatres without a change of garments Steeled knights of the Conquest bearded statesmen of Queen Elizabeth and high ruffed ladies of her court were mingled with characters of comedy such as a parti colored Merry Andrew jingling his cap and bells a Falstaff almost as provocative of laughter as his prototype and a Don Quixote with a bean pole for a lance and a pot lid for a shield But the broadest merriment was excited by a group of figures ridiculously dressed in old regimentals which seemed to have been purchased at a military rag fair or pilfered from some receptacle of the cast off clothes of both the French and British armies Portions of their attire had probably been worn at the siege of Louisburg and the coats of most recent cut might have been rent and tattered by sword ball or bayonet as long ago as Wolfe s victory One of these worthies a tall lank figure brandishing a rusty sword of immense longitude purported to be no less a personage than General George Washington and the other principal officers of the American army such as Gates Lee Putnam Schuyler Ward and Heath were represented by similar scarecrows An interview in the mock heroic style between the rebel warriors and the British commander in chief was received with immense applause which came loudest of all from the loyalists of the colony There was one of the guests however who stood apart eying these antics sternly and scornfully at once with a frown and a bitter smile It was an old man formerly of high station and great repute in the province and who had been a very famous soldier in his day Some surprise had been expressed that a person of Colonel Joliffe s known Whig principles though now too old to take an active part in the contest should have remained in Boston during the siege and especially that he should consent to show himself in the mansion of Sir William Howe But thither he had come with a fair granddaughter under his arm and there amid all the mirth and buffoonery stood this stern old figure the best sustained character in the masquerade because so well representing the antique spirit of his native land The other guests affirmed that Colonel Joliffe s black puritanical scowl threw a shadow round about him although in spite of his sombre influence their gayety continued to blaze higher like an ominous comparison the flickering brilliancy of a lamp which has but a little while to burn Eleven strokes full half an hour ago had pealed from the clock of the Old South when a rumor was circulated among the company that some new spectacle or pageant was about to be exhibited which should put a fitting close to the splendid festivities of the night What new jest has Your Excellency in hand asked the Reverend Mather Byles whose Presbyterian scruples had not kept him from the entertainment Trust me sir I have already laughed more than beseems my cloth at your Homeric confabulation with yonder ragamuffin general of the rebels One other such fit of merriment and I must throw off my clerical wig and band Not so good doctor Byles answered Sir William Howe if mirth were a crime you had never gained your doctorate in divinity As to this new foolery I know no more about it than yourself perhaps not so much Honestly now doctor have you not stirred up the sober brains of some of your countrymen to enact a scene in our masquerade Perhaps slyly remarked the granddaughter of Colonel Joliffe whose high spirit had been stung by many taunts against New England perhaps we are to have a masque of allegorical figures Victory with trophies from Lexington and Bunker Hill Plenty with her overflowing horn to typify the present abundance in this good town and Glory with a wreath for His Excellency s brow Sir William Howe smiled at words which he would have answered with one of his darkest frowns had they been uttered by lips that wore a beard He was spared the necessity of a retort by a singular interruption A sound of music was heard without the house as if proceeding from a full band of military instruments stationed in the street playing not such a festal strain as was suited to the occasion but a slow funeral march The drums appeared to be muffled and the trumpets poured forth a wailing breath which at once hushed the merriment of the auditors filling all with wonder and some with apprehension The idea occurred to many that either the funeral procession of some great personage had halted in front of the province house or that a corpse in a velvet covered and gorgeously decorated coffin was about to be borne from the portal After listening a moment Sir William Howe called in a stern voice to the leader of the musicians who had hitherto enlivened the entertainment with gay and lightsome melodies The man was drum major to one of the British regiments Dighton demanded the general what means this foolery Bid your band silence that dead march or by my word they shall have sufficient cause for their lugubrious strains Silence it sirrah Please Your Honor answered the drum major whose rubicund visage had lost all its color the fault is none of mine I and my band are all here together and I question whether there be a man of us that could play that march without book I never heard it but once before and that was at the funeral of his late Majesty King George II Well well said Sir William Howe recovering his composure it is the prelude to some masquerading antic Let it pass A figure now presented itself but among the many fantastic masks that were dispersed through the apartments none could tell precisely from whence it came It was a man in an old fashioned dress of black serge and having the aspect of a steward or principal domestic in the household of a nobleman or great English landholder This figure advanced to the outer door of the mansion and throwing both its leaves wide open withdrew a little to one side and looked back toward the grand staircase as if expecting some person to descend At the same time the music in the street sounded a loud and doleful summons The eyes of Sir William Howe and his guests being directed to the staircase there appeared on the uppermost landing place that was discernible from the bottom several personages descending toward the door The foremost was a man of stern visage wearing a steeple crowned hat and a skull cap beneath it a dark cloak and huge wrinkled boots that came halfway up his legs Under his arm was a rolled up banner which seemed to be the banner of England but strangely rent and torn he had a sword in his right hand and grasped a Bible in his left The next figure was of milder aspect yet full of dignity wearing a broad ruff over which descended a beard a gown of wrought velvet and a doublet and hose of black satin he carried a roll of manuscript in his hand Close behind these two came a young man of very striking countenance and demeanor with deep thought and contemplation on his brow and perhaps a flash of enthusiasm in his eye his garb like that of his predecessors was of an antique fashion and there was a stain of blood upon his ruff In the same group with these were three or four others all men of dignity and evident command and bearing themselves like personages who were accustomed to the gaze of the multitude It was the idea of the beholders that these figures went to join the mysterious funeral that had halted in front of the province house yet that supposition seemed to be contradicted by the air of triumph with which they waved their hands as they crossed the threshold and vanished through the portal In the devil s name what is this muttered Sir William Howe to a gentleman beside him A procession of the regicide judges of King Charles the martyr These said Colonel Joliffe breaking silence almost for the first time that evening these if I interpret them aright are the Puritan governors the rulers of the old original democracy of Massachusetts Endicott with the banner from which he had torn the symbol of subjection and Winthrop and Sir Henry Vane and Dudley Haynes Bellingham and Leverett Why had that young man a stain of blood upon his ruff asked Miss Joliffe Because in after years answered her grandfather he laid down the wisest head in England upon the block for the principles of liberty Will not Your Excellency order out the guard whispered Lord Percy who with other British officers had now assembled round the general There may be a plot under this mummery Tush we have nothing to fear carelessly replied Sir William Howe There can be no worse treason in the matter than a jest and that somewhat of the dullest Even were it a sharp and bitter one our best policy would be to laugh it off See here come more of these gentry Another group of characters had now partly descended the staircase The first was a venerable and white bearded patriarch who cautiously felt his way downward with a staff Treading hastily behind him and stretching forth his gauntleted hand as if to grasp the old man s shoulder came a tall soldier like figure equipped with a plumed cap of steel a bright breastplate and a long sword which rattled against the stairs Next was seen a stout man dressed in rich and courtly attire but not of courtly demeanor his gait had the swinging motion of a seaman s walk and chancing to stumble on the staircase he suddenly grew wrathful and was heard to mutter an oath He was followed by a noble looking personage in a curled wig such as are represented in the portraits of Queen Anne s time and earlier and the breast of his coat was decorated with an embroidered star While advancing to the door he bowed to the right hand and to the left in a very gracious and insinuating style but as he crossed the threshold unlike the early Puritan governors he seemed to wring his hands with sorrow Prithee play the part of a chorus good doctor Byles said Sir William Howe What worthies are these If it please Your Excellency they lived somewhat before my day answered the doctor but doubtless our friend the colonel has been hand and glove with them Their living faces I never looked upon said Colonel Joliffe gravely although I have spoken face to face with many rulers of this land and shall greet yet another with an old man s blessing ere I die But we talk of these figures I take the venerable patriarch to be Bradstreet the last of the Puritans who was governor at ninety or thereabouts The next is Sir Edmund Andros a tyrant as any New England schoolboy will tell you and therefore the people cast him down from his high seat into a dungeon Then comes Sir William Phipps shepherd cooper sea captain and governor May many of his countrymen rise as high from as low an origin Lastly you saw the gracious earl of Bellamont who ruled us under King William But what is the meaning of it all asked Lord Percy Now were I a rebel said Miss Joliffe half aloud I might fancy that the ghosts of these ancient governors had been summoned to form the funeral procession of royal authority in New England Several other figures were now seen at the turn of the staircase The one in advance had a thoughtful anxious and somewhat crafty expression of face and in spite of his loftiness of manner which was evidently the result both of an ambitious spirit and of long continuance in high stations he seemed not incapable of cringing to a greater than himself A few steps behind came an officer in a scarlet and embroidered uniform cut in a fashion old enough to have been worn by the duke of Marlborough His nose had a rubicund tinge which together with the twinkle of his eye might have marked him as a lover of the wine cup and good fellowship notwithstanding which tokens he appeared ill at ease and often glanced around him as if apprehensive of some secret mischief Next came a portly gentleman wearing a coat of shaggy cloth lined with silken velvet he had sense shrewdness and humor in his face and a folio volume under his arm but his aspect was that of a man vexed and tormented beyond all patience and harassed almost to death He went hastily down and was followed by a dignified person dressed in a purple velvet suit with very rich embroidery his demeanor would have possessed much stateliness only that a grievous fit of the gout compelled him to hobble from stair to stair with contortions of face and body When doctor Byles beheld this figure on the staircase he shivered as with an ague but continued to watch him steadfastly until the gouty gentleman had reached the threshold made a gesture of anguish and despair and vanished into the outer gloom whither the funeral music summoned him Governor Belcher my old patron in his very shape and dress gasped doctor Byles This is an awful mockery A tedious foolery rather said Sir William Howe with an air of indifference But who were the three that preceded him Governor Dudley a cunning politician yet his craft once brought him to a prison replied Colonel Joliffe Governor Shute formerly a colonel under Marlborough and whom the people frightened out of the province and learned Governor Burnett whom the legislature tormented into a mortal fever Methinks they were miserable men these royal governors of Massachusetts observed Miss Joliffe Heavens how dim the light grows It was certainly a fact that the large lamp which illuminated the staircase now burned dim and duskily so that several figures which passed hastily down the stairs and went forth from the porch appeared rather like shadows than persons of fleshly substance Sir William Howe and his guests stood at the doors of the contiguous apartments watching the progress of this singular pageant with various emotions of anger contempt or half acknowledged fear but still with an anxious curiosity The shapes which now seemed hastening to join the mysterious procession were recognized rather by striking peculiarities of dress or broad characteristics of manner than by any perceptible resemblance of features to their prototypes Their faces indeed were invariably kept in deep shadow but doctor Byles and other gentlemen who had long been familiar with the successive rulers of the province were heard to whisper the names of Shirley of Pownall of Sir Francis Bernard and of the well remembered Hutchinson thereby confessing that the actors whoever they might be in this spectral march of governors had succeeded in putting on some distant portraiture of the real personages As they vanished from the door still did these shadows toss their arms into the gloom of night with a dread expression of woe Following the mimic representative of Hutchinson came a military figure holding before his face the cocked hat which he had taken from his powdered head but his epaulettes and other insignia of rank were those of a general officer and something in his mien reminded the beholders of one who had recently been master of the province house and chief of all the land The shape of Gage as true as in a looking glass exclaimed Lord Percy turning pale No surely cried Miss Joliffe laughing hysterically it could not be Gage or Sir William would have greeted his old comrade in arms Perhaps he will not suffer the next to pass unchallenged Of that be assured young lady answered Sir William Howe fixing his eyes with a very marked expression upon the immovable visage of her grandfather I have long enough delayed to pay the ceremonies of a host to these departing guests the next that takes his leave shall receive due courtesy A wild and dreary burst of music came through the open door It seemed as it the procession which had been gradually filling up its ranks were now about to move and that this loud peal of the wailing trumpets and roll of the muffled drums were a call to some loiterer to make haste Many eyes by an irresistible impulse were turned upon Sir William Howe as if it were he whom the dreary music summoned to the funeral of departed power See here comes the last whispered Miss Joliffe pointing her tremulous finger to the staircase A figure had come into view as if descending the stairs although so dusky was the region whence it emerged some of the spectators fancied that they had seen this human shape suddenly moulding itself amid the gloom Downward the figure came with a stately and martial tread and reaching the lowest stair was observed to be a tall man booted and wrapped in a military cloak which was drawn up around the face so as to meet the napped brim of a laced hat the features therefore were completely hidden But the British officers deemed that they had seen that military cloak before and even recognized the frayed embroidery on the collar as well as the gilded scabbard of a sword which protruded from the folds of the cloak and glittered in a vivid gleam of light Apart from these trifling particulars there were characteristics of gait and bearing which impelled the wondering guests to glance from the shrouded figure to Sir William Howe as if to satisfy themselves that their host had not suddenly vanished from the midst of them With a dark flush of wrath upon his brow they saw the general draw his sword and advance to meet the figure in the cloak before the latter had stepped one pace upon the floor Villain unmuffle yourself cried he You pass no farther The figure without blenching a hair s breadth from the sword which was pointed at his breast made a solemn pause and lowered the cape of the cloak from about his face yet not sufficiently for the spectators to catch a glimpse of it But Sir William Howe had evidently seen enough The sternness of his countenance gave place to a look of wild amazement if not horror while he recoiled several steps from the figure and let fall his sword upon the floor The martial shape again drew the cloak about his features and passed on but reaching the threshold with his back toward the spectators he was seen to stamp his foot and shake his clenched hands in the air It was afterward affirmed that Sir William Howe had repeated that selfsame gesture of rage and sorrow when for the last time and as the last royal governor he passed through the portal of the province house Hark The procession moves said Miss Joliffe The music was dying away along the street and its dismal strains were mingled with the knell of midnight from the steeple of the Old South and with the roar of artillery which announced that the beleaguered army of Washington had intrenched itself upon a nearer height than before As the deep boom of the cannon smote upon his ear Colonel Joliffe raised himself to the full height of his aged form and smiled sternly on the British general Would Your Excellency inquire further into the mystery of the pageant said he Take care of your gray head cried Sir William Howe fiercely though with a quivering lip It has stood too long on a traitor s shoulders You must make haste to chop it off then calmly replied the colonel for a few hours longer and not all the power of Sir William Howe nor of his master shall cause one of these gray hairs to fall The empire of Britain in this ancient province is at its last gasp to night almost while I speak it is a dead corpse and methinks the shadows of the old governors are fit mourners at its funeral With these words Colonel Joliffe threw on his cloak and drawing his granddaughter s arm within his own retired from the last festival that a British ruler ever held in the old province of Massachusetts Bay It was supposed that the colonel and the young lady possessed some secret intelligence in regard to the mysterious pageant of that night However this might be such knowledge has never become general The actors in the scene have vanished into deeper obscurity than even that wild Indian hand who scattered the cargoes of the tea ships on the waves and gained a place in history yet left no names But superstition among other legends of this mansion repeats the wondrous tale that on the anniversary night of Britain s discomfiture the ghosts of the ancient governors of Massachusetts still glide through the portal of the Province House And last of all comes a figure shrouded in a military cloak tossing his clenched hands into the air and stamping his iron shod boots upon the broad freestone steps with a semblance of feverish despair but without the sound of a foot tramp When the truth telling accents of the elderly gentleman were hushed I drew a long breath and looked round the room striving with the best energy of my imagination to throw a tinge of romance and historic grandeur over the realities of the scene But my nostrils snuffed up a scent of cigar smoke clouds of which the narrator had emitted by way of visible emblem I suppose of the nebulous obscurity of his tale Moreover my gorgeous fantasies were woefully disturbed by the rattling of the spoon in a tumbler of whiskey punch which mister Thomas Waite was mingling for a customer Nor did it add to the picturesque appearance of the panelled walls that the slate of the Brookline stage was suspended against them instead of the armorial escutcheon of some far descended governor A stage driver sat at one of the windows reading a penny paper of the day the Boston Times and presenting a figure which could nowise be brought into any picture of Times in Boston seventy or a hundred years ago On the window seat lay a bundle neatly done up in brown paper the direction of which I had the idle curiosity to read MISS SUSAN HUGGINS at the PROVINCE HOUSE A pretty chambermaid no doubt In truth it is desperately hard work when we attempt to throw the spell of hoar antiquity over localities with which the living world and the day that is passing over us have aught to do Yet as I glanced at the stately staircase down which the procession of the old governors had descended and as I emerged through the venerable portal whence their figures had preceded me it gladdened me to be conscious of a thrill of awe Then diving through the narrow archway a few strides transported me into the densest throng of Washington street II EDWARD RANDOLPH S PORTRAIT The old legendary guest of the Province House abode in my remembrance from midsummer till January One idle evening last winter confident that he would be found in the snuggest corner of the bar room I resolved to pay him another visit hoping to deserve well of my country by snatching from oblivion some else unheard of fact of history The night was chill and raw and rendered boisterous by almost a gale of wind which whistled along Washington street causing the gaslights to flare and flicker within the lamps As I hurried onward my fancy was busy with a comparison between the present aspect of the street and that which it probably wore when the British governors inhabited the mansion whither I was now going Brick edifices in those times were few till a succession of destructive fires had swept and swept again the wooden dwellings and warehouses from the most populous quarters of the town The buildings stood insulated and independent not as now merging their separate existences into connected ranges with a front of tiresome identity but each possessing features of its own as if the owner s individual taste had shaped it and the whole presenting a picturesque irregularity the absence of which is hardly compensated by any beauties of our modern architecture Such a scene dimly vanishing from the eye by the ray of here and there a tallow candle glimmering through the small panes of scattered windows would form a sombre contrast to the street as I beheld it with the gaslights blazing from corner to corner flaming within the shops and throwing a noonday brightness through the huge plates of glass But the black lowering sky as I turned my eyes upward wore doubtless the same visage as when it frowned upon the ante Revolutionary New Englanders The wintry blast had the same shriek that was familiar to their ears The Old South Church too still pointed its antique spire into the darkness and was lost between earth and heaven and as I passed its clock which had warned so many generations how transitory was their lifetime spoke heavily and slow the same unregarded moral to myself Only seven o clock thought I My old friend s legends will scarcely kill the hours twixt this and bedtime Passing through the narrow arch I crossed the courtyard the confined precincts of which were made visible by a lantern over the portal of the Province House On entering the bar room I found as I expected the old tradition monger seated by a special good fire of anthracite compelling clouds of smoke from a corpulent cigar He recognized me with evident pleasure for my rare properties as a patient listener invariably make me a favorite with elderly gentlemen and ladies of narrative propensites Drawing a chair to the fire I desired mine host to favor us with a glass apiece of whiskey punch which was speedily prepared steaming hot with a slice of lemon at the bottom a dark red stratum of port wine upon the surface and a sprinkling of nutmeg strewn over all As we touched our glasses together my legendary friend made himself known to me as mister Bela Tiffany and I rejoiced at the oddity of the name because it gave his image and character a sort of individuality in my conception The old gentleman s draught acted as a solvent upon his memory so that it overflowed with tales traditions anecdotes of famous dead people and traits of ancient manners some of which were childish as a nurse s lullaby while others might have been worth the notice of the grave historian Nothing impressed me more than a story of a black mysterious picture which used to hang in one of the chambers of the Province House directly above the room where we were now sitting The following is as correct a version of the fact as the reader would be likely to obtain from any other source although assuredly it has a tinge of romance approaching to the marvellous In one of the apartments of the province house there was long preserved an ancient picture the frame of which was as black as ebony and the canvas itself so dark with age damp and smoke that not a touch of the painter s art could be discerned Time had thrown an impenetrable veil over it and left to tradition and fable and conjecture to say what had once been there portrayed During the rule of many successive governors it had hung by prescriptive and undisputed right over the mantel piece of the same chamber and it still kept its place when Lieutenant governor Hutchinson assumed the administration of the province on the departure of Sir Francis Bernard The lieutenant governor sat one afternoon resting his head against the carved back of his stately arm chair and gazing up thoughtfully at the void blackness of the picture It was scarcely a time for such inactive musing when affairs of the deepest moment required the ruler s decision for within that very hour Hutchinson had received intelligence of the arrival of a British fleet bringing three regiments from Halifax to overawe the insubordination of the people These troops awaited his permission to occupy the fortress of Castle William and the town itself yet instead of affixing his signature to an official order there sat the lieutenant governor so carefully scrutinizing the black waste of canvas that his demeanor attracted the notice of two young persons who attended him One wearing a military dress of buff was his kinsman Francis Lincoln the provincial captain of Castle William the other who sat on a low stool beside his chair was Alice Vane his favorite niece She was clad entirely in white a pale ethereal creature who though a native of New England had been educated abroad and seemed not merely a stranger from another clime but almost a being from another world For several years until left an orphan she had dwelt with her father in sunny Italy and there had acquired a taste and enthusiasm for sculpture and painting which she found few opportunities of gratifying in the undecorated dwellings of the colonial gentry It was said that the early productions of her own pencil exhibited no inferior genius though perhaps the rude atmosphere of New England had cramped her hand and dimmed the glowing colors of her fancy But observing her uncle s steadfast gaze which appeared to search through the mist of years to discover the subject of the picture her curiosity was excited Is it known my dear uncle inquired she what this old picture once represented Possibly could it be made visible it might prove a masterpiece of some great artist else why has it so long held such a conspicuous place As her uncle contrary to his usual custom for he was as attentive to all the humors and caprices of Alice as if she had been his own best beloved child did not immediately reply the young captain of Castle William took that office upon himself This dark old square of canvas my fair cousin said he has been an heirloom in the province house from time immemorial As to the painter I can tell you nothing but if half the stories told of it be true not one of the great Italian masters has ever produced so marvellous a piece of work as that before you Captain Lincoln proceeded to relate some of the strange fables and fantasies which as it was impossible to refute them by ocular demonstration had grown to be articles of popular belief in reference to this old picture One of the wildest and at the same time the best accredited accounts stated it to be an original and authentic portrait of the evil one taken at a witch meeting near Salem and that its strong and terrible resemblance had been confirmed by several of the confessing wizards and witches at their trial in open court It was likewise affirmed that a familiar spirit or demon abode behind the blackness of the picture and had shown himself at seasons of public calamity to more than one of the royal governors Shirley for instance had beheld this ominous apparition on the eve of General Abercrombie s shameful and bloody defeat under the walls of Ticonderoga Many of the servants of the province house had caught glimpses of a visage frowning down upon them at morning or evening twilight or in the depths of night while raking up the fire that glimmered on the hearth beneath although if any were bold enough to hold a torch before the picture it would appear as black and undistinguishable as ever The oldest inhabitant of Boston recollected that his father in whose days the portrait had not wholly faded out of sight had once looked upon it but would never suffer himself to be questioned as to the face which was there represented In connection with such stories it was remarkable that over the top of the frame there were some ragged remnants of black silk indicating that a veil had formerly hung down before the picture until the duskiness of time had so effectually concealed it But after all it was the most singular part of the affair that so many of the pompous governors of Massachusetts had allowed the obliterated picture to remain in the state chamber of the province house Some of these fables are really awful observed Alice Vane who had occasionally shuddered as well as smiled while her cousin spoke It would be almost worth while to wipe away the black surface of the canvas since the original picture can hardly be so formidable as those which fancy paints instead of it But would it be possible inquired her cousin to restore this dark picture to its pristine hues Such arts are known in Italy said Alice The lieutenant governor had roused himself from his abstracted mood and listened with a smile to the conversation of his young relatives Yet his voice had something peculiar in its tones when he undertook the explanation of the mystery I am sorry Alice to destroy your faith in the legends of which you are so fond remarked he but my antiquarian researches have long since made me acquainted with the subject of this picture if picture it can be called which is no more visible nor ever will be than the face of the long buried man whom it once represented It was the portrait of Edward Randolph the founder of this house a person famous in the history of New England Of that Edward Randolph exclaimed Captain Lincoln who obtained the repeal of the first provincial charter under which our forefathers had enjoyed almost democratic privileges he that was styled the arch enemy of New England and whose memory is still held in detestation as the destroyer of our liberties It was the same Randolph answered Hutchinson moving uneasily in his chair It was his lot to taste the bitterness of popular odium Our annals tell us continued the captain of Castle William that the curse of the people followed this Randolph where he went and wrought evil in all the subsequent events of his life and that its effect was seen likewise in the manner of his death They say too that the inward misery of that curse worked itself outward and was visible on the wretched man s countenance making it too horrible to be looked upon If so and if this picture truly represented his aspect it was in mercy that the cloud of blackness has gathered over it These traditions are folly to one who has proved as I have how little of historic truth lies at the bottom said the lieutenant governor As regards the life and character of Edward Randolph too implicit credence has been given to doctor Cotton Mather who I must say it though some of his blood runs in my veins has filled our early history with old women s tales as fanciful and extravagant as those of Greece or Rome And yet whispered Alice Vane may not such fables have a moral And methinks if the visage of this portrait be so dreadful it is not without a cause that it has hung so long in a chamber of the province house When the rulers feel themselves irresponsible it were well that they should be reminded of the awful weight of a people s curse The lieutenant governor started and gazed for a moment at his niece as if her girlish fantasies had struck upon some feeling in his own breast which all his policy or principles could not entirely subdue He knew indeed that Alice in spite of her foreign education retained the native sympathies of a New England girl Peace silly child cried he at last more harshly than he had ever before addressed the gentle Alice The rebuke of a king is more to be dreaded than the clamor of a wild misguided multitude Captain Lincoln it is decided the fortress of Castle William must be occupied by the royal troops The two remaining regiments shall be billeted in the town or encamped upon the Common It is time after years of tumult and almost rebellion that His Majesty s government should have a wall of strength about it Trust sir trust yet a while to the loyalty of the people said Captain Lincoln nor teach them that they can ever be on other terms with British soldiers than those of brotherhood as when they fought side by side through the French war Do not convert the streets of your native town into a camp Think twice before you give up old Castle William the key of the province into other keeping than that of true born New Englanders Young man it is decided repeated Hutchinson rising from his chair A British officer will be in attendance this evening to receive the necessary instructions for the disposal of the troops Your presence also will be required Till then farewell With these words the lieutenant governor hastily left the room while Alice and her cousin more slowly followed whispering together and once pausing to glance back at the mysterious picture The captain of Castle William fancied that the girl s air and mien were such as might have belonged to one of those spirits of fable fairies or creatures of a more antique mythology who sometimes mingled their agency with mortal affairs half in caprice yet with a sensibility to human weal or woe As he held the door for her to pass Alice beckoned to the picture and smiled Come forth dark and evil shape cried she It is thine hour In the evening Lieutenant governor Hutchinson sat in the same chamber where the foregoing scene had occurred surrounded by several persons whose various interests had summoned them together There were the selectmen of Boston plain patriarchal fathers of the people excellent representatives of the old puritanical founders whose sombre strength had stamped so deep an impress upon the New England character Contrasting with these were one or two members of council richly dressed in the white wigs the embroidered waistcoats and other magnificence of the time and making a somewhat ostentatious display of courtier like ceremonial In attendance likewise was a major of the British army awaiting the lieutenant governor s orders for the landing of the troops which still remained on board the transports The captain of Castle William stood beside Hutchinson s chair with folded arms glancing rather haughtily at the British officer by whom he was soon to be superseded in his command On a table in the centre of the chamber stood a branched silver candlestick throwing down the glow of half a dozen waxlights upon a paper apparently ready for the lieutenant governor s signature Partly shrouded in the voluminous folds of one of the window curtains which fell from the ceiling to the floor was seen the white drapery of a lady s robe It may appear strange that Alice Vane should have been there at such a time but there was something so childlike so wayward in her singular character so apart from ordinary rules that her presence did not surprise the few who noticed it Meantime the chairman of the selectmen was addressing to the lieutenant governor a long and solemn protest against the reception of the British troops into the town And if Your Honor concluded this excellent but somewhat prosy old gentleman shall see fit to persist in bringing these mercenary sworders and musketeers into our quiet streets not on our heads be the responsibility Think sir while there is yet time that if one drop of blood be shed that blood shall be an eternal stain upon Your Honor s memory You sir have written with an able pen the deeds of our forefathers the more to be desired is it therefore that yourself should deserve honorable mention as a true patriot and upright ruler when your own doings shall be written down in history I am not insensible my good sir to the natural desire to stand well in the annals of my country replied Hutchinson controlling his impatience into courtesy nor know I any better method of attaining that end than by withstanding the merely temporary spirit of mischief which with your pardon seems to have infected older men than myself Would you have me wait till the mob shall sack the province house as they did my private mansion Trust me sir the time may come when you will be glad to flee for protection to the king s banner the raising of which is now so distasteful to you Yes said the British major who was impatiently expecting the lieutenant governor s orders The demagogues of this province have raised the devil and cannot lay him again We will exorcise him in God s name and the king s If you meddle with the devil take care of his claws answered the captain of Castle William stirred by the taunt against his countrymen Craving your pardon young sir said the venerable selectman let not an evil spirit enter into your words We will strive against the oppressor with prayer and fasting as our forefathers would have done Like them moreover we will submit to whatever lot a wise Providence may send us always after our own best exertions to amend it And there peep forth the devil s claws muttered Hutchinson who well understood the nature of Puritan submission This matter shall be expedited forthwith When there shall be a sentinel at every corner and a court of guard before the town house a loyal gentleman may venture to walk abroad What to me is the outcry of a mob in this remote province of the realm The king is my master and England is my country upheld by their armed strength I set my foot upon the rabble and defy them He snatched a pen and was about to affix his signature to the paper that lay on the table when the captain of Castle William placed his hand upon his shoulder The freedom of the action so contrary to the ceremonious respect which was then considered due to rank and dignity awakened general surprise and in none more than in the lieutenant governor himself Looking angrily up he perceived that his young relative was pointing his finger to the opposite wall Hutchinson s eye followed the signal and he saw what had hitherto been unobserved that a black silk curtain was suspended before the mysterious picture so as completely to conceal it His thoughts immediately recurred to the scene of the preceding afternoon and in his surprise confused by indistinct emotions yet sensible that his niece must have had an agency in this phenomenon he called loudly upon her Alice Come hither Alice No sooner had he spoken than Alice Vane glided from her station and pressing one hand across her eyes with the other snatched away the sable curtain that concealed the portrait An exclamation of surprise burst from every beholder but the lieutenant governor s voice had a tone of horror By Heaven said he in a low inward murmur speaking rather to himself than to those around him if the spirit of Edward Randolph were to appear among us from the place of torment he could not wear more of the terrors of hell upon his face For some wise end said the aged selectman solemnly hath Providence scattered away the mist of years that had so long hid this dreadful effigy Until this hour no living man hath seen what we behold Within the antique frame which so recently had enclosed a sable waste of canvas now appeared a visible picture still dark indeed in its hues and shadings but thrown forward in strong relief It was a half length figure of a gentleman in a rich but very old fashioned dress of embroidered velvet with a broad ruff and a beard and wearing a hat the brim of which overshadowed his forehead Beneath this cloud the eyes had a peculiar glare which was almost lifelike The whole portrait started so distinctly out of the background that it had the effect of a person looking down from the wall at the astonished and awe stricken spectators The expression of the face if any words can convey an idea of it was that of a wretch detected in some hideous guilt and exposed to the bitter hatred and laughter and withering scorn of a vast surrounding multitude There was the struggle of defiance beaten down and overwhelmed by the crushing weight of ignominy The torture of the soul had come forth upon the countenance It seemed as if the picture while hidden behind the cloud of immemorial years had been all the time acquiring an intenser depth and darkness of expression till now it gloomed forth again and threw its evil omen over the present hour Such if the wild legend may be credited was the portrait of Edward Randolph as he appeared when a people s curse had wrought its influence upon his nature Twould drive me mad that awful face said Hutchinson who seemed fascinated by the contemplation of it Be warned then whispered Alice He trampled on a people s rights Behold his punishment and avoid a crime like his The lieutenant governor actually trembled for an instant but exerting his energy which was not however his most characteristic feature he strove to shake off the spell of Randolph s countenance Girl cried he laughing bitterly as he turned to Alice have you brought hither your painter s art your Italian spirit of intrigue your tricks of stage effect and think to influence the councils of rulers and the affairs of nations by such shallow contrivances See here Stay yet a while said the selectman as Hutchinson again snatched the pen for if ever mortal man received a warning from a tormented soul Your Honor is that man Away answered Hutchinson fiercely Though yonder senseless picture cried Forbear it should not move me Casting a scowl of defiance at the pictured face which seemed at that moment to intensify the horror of its miserable and wicked look he scrawled on the paper in characters that betokened it a deed of desperation the name of Thomas Hutchinson Then it is said he shuddered as if that signature had granted away his salvation It is done said he and placed his hand upon his brow May Heaven forgive the deed said the soft sad accents of Alice Vane like the voice of a good spirit flitting away When morning came there was a stifled whisper through the household and spreading thence about the town that the dark mysterious picture had started from the wall and spoken face to face with Lieutenant governor Hutchinson If such a miracle had been wrought however no traces of it remained behind for within the antique frame nothing could be discerned save the impenetrable cloud which had covered the canvas since the memory of man If the figure had indeed stepped forth it had fled back spirit like at the day dawn and hidden itself behind a century s obscurity The truth probably was that Alice Vane s secret for restoring the hues of the picture had merely effected a temporary renovation But those who in that brief interval had beheld the awful visage of Edward Randolph desired no second glance and ever afterward trembled at the recollection of the scene as if an evil spirit had appeared visibly among them And as for Hutchinson when far over the ocean his dying hour drew on he gasped for breath and complained that he was choking with the blood of the Boston Massacre and Francis Lincoln the former captain of Castle William who was standing at his bedside perceived a likeness in his frenzied look to that of Edward Randolph Did his broken spirit feel at that dread hour the tremendous burden of a people s curse At the conclusion of this miraculous legend I inquired of mine host whether the picture still remained in the chamber over our heads but mister Tiffany informed me that it had long since been removed and was supposed to be hidden in some out of the way corner of the New England Museum Perchance some curious antiquary may light upon it there and with the assistance of mister Howorth the picture cleaner may supply a not unnecessary proof of the authenticity of the facts here set down During the progress of the story a storm had been gathering abroad and raging and rattling so loudly in the upper regions of the Province House that it seemed as if all the old governors and great men were running riot above stairs while mister Bela Tiffany babbled of them below In the course of generations when many people have lived and died in an ancient house the whistling of the wind through its crannies and the creaking of its beams and rafters become strangely like the tones of the human voice or thundering laughter or heavy footsteps treading the deserted chambers It is as if the echoes of half a century were revived Such were the ghostly sounds that roared and murmured in our ears when I took leave of the circle round the fireside of the Province House and plunging down the doorsteps fought my way homeward against a drifting snow storm III LADY ELEANORE S MANTLE Mine excellent friend the landlord of the Province House was pleased the other evening to invite mister Tiffany and myself to an oyster supper This slight mark of respect and gratitude as he handsomely observed was far less than the ingenious tale teller and I the humble note taker of his narratives had fairly earned by the public notice which our joint lucubrations had attracted to his establishment Many a cigar had been smoked within his premises many a glass of wine or more potent aqua vitae had been quaffed many a dinner had been eaten by curious strangers who save for the fortunate conjunction of mister Tiffany and me would never have ventured through that darksome avenue which gives access to the historic precincts of the Province House In short if any credit be due to the courteous assurances of mister Thomas Waite we had brought his forgotten mansion almost as effectually into public view as if we had thrown down the vulgar range of shoe shops and dry good stores which hides its aristocratic front from Washington street It may be unadvisable however to speak too loudly of the increased custom of the house lest mister Waite should find it difficult to renew the lease on so favorable terms as heretofore Being thus welcomed as benefactors neither mister Tiffany nor myself felt any scruple in doing full justice to the good things that were set before us If the feast were less magnificent than those same panelled walls had witnessed in a bygone century if mine host presided with somewhat less of state than might have befitted a successor of the royal governors if the guests made a less imposing show than the bewigged and powdered and embroidered dignitaries who erst banqueted at the gubernatorial table and now sleep within their armorial tombs on Copp s Hill or round King s Chapel yet never I may boldly say did a more comfortable little party assemble in the province house from Queen Anne s days to the Revolution The occasion was rendered more interesting by the presence of a venerable personage whose own actual reminiscences went back to the epoch of Gage and Howe and even supplied him with a doubtful anecdote or two of Hutchinson He was one of that small and now all but extinguished class whose attachment to royalty and to the colonial institutions and customs that were connected with it had never yielded to the democratic heresies of after times The young queen of Britain has not a more loyal subject in her realm perhaps not one who would kneel before her throne with such reverential love as this old grandsire whose head has whitened beneath the mild sway of the republic which still in his mellower moments he terms a usurpation Yet prejudices so obstinate have not made him an ungentle or impracticable companion If the truth must be told the life of the aged loyalist has been of such a scrambling and unsettled character he has had so little choice of friends and been so often destitute of any that I doubt whether he would refuse a cup of kindness with either Oliver Cromwell or John Hancock to say nothing of any democrat now upon the stage In another paper of this series I may perhaps give the reader a closer glimpse of his portrait Our host in due season uncorked a bottle of Madeira of such exquisite perfume and admirable flavor that he surely must have discovered it in an ancient bin down deep beneath the deepest cellar where some jolly old butler stored away the governor s choicest wine and forgot to reveal the secret on his death bed Peace to his red nosed ghost and a libation to his memory This precious liquor was imbibed by mister Tiffany with peculiar zest and after sipping the third glass it was his pleasure to give us one of the oddest legends which he had yet raked from the storehouse where he keeps such matters With some suitable adornments from my own fancy it ran pretty much as follows Not long after Colonel Shute had assumed the government of Massachusetts Bay now nearly a hundred and twenty years ago a young lady of rank and fortune arrived from England to claim his protection as her guardian He was her distant relative but the nearest who had survived the gradual extinction of her family so that no more eligible shelter could be found for the rich and high born Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe than within the province house of a Transatlantic colony The consort of Governor Shute moreover had been as a mother to her childhood and was now anxious to receive her in the hope that a beautiful young woman would be exposed to infinitely less peril from the primitive society of New England than amid the artifices and corruptions of a court If either the governor or his lady had especially consulted their own comfort they would probably have sought to devolve the responsibility on other hands since with some noble and splendid traits of character Lady Eleanore was remarkable for a harsh unyielding pride a haughty consciousness of her hereditary and personal advantages which made her almost incapable of control Judging from many traditionary anecdotes this peculiar temper was hardly less than a monomania or if the acts which it inspired were those of a sane person it seemed due from Providence that pride so sinful should be followed by as severe a retribution That tinge of the marvellous which is thrown over so many of these half forgotten legends has probably imparted an additional wildness to the strange story of Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe The ship in which she came passenger had arrived at Newport whence Lady Eleanore was conveyed to Boston in the governor s coach attended by a small escort of gentlemen on horseback The ponderous equipage with its four black horses attracted much notice as it rumbled through Cornhill surrounded by the prancing steeds of half a dozen cavaliers with swords dangling to their stirrups and pistols at their holsters Through the large glass windows of the coach as it rolled along the people could discern the figure of Lady Eleanore strangely combining an almost queenly stateliness with the grace and beauty of a maiden in her teens A singular tale had gone abroad among the ladies of the province that their fair rival was indebted for much of the irresistible charm of her appearance to a certain article of dress an embroidered mantle which had been wrought by the most skilful artist in London and possessed even magical properties of adornment On the present occasion however she owed nothing to the witchery of dress being clad in a riding habit of velvet which would have appeared stiff and ungraceful on any other form The coachman reined in his four black steeds and the whole cavalcade came to a pause in front of the contorted iron balustrade that fenced the province house from the public street It was an awkward coincidence that the bell of the Old South was just then tolling for a funeral so that instead of a gladsome peal with which it was customary to announce the arrival of distinguished strangers Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe was ushered by a doleful clang as if calamity had come embodied in her beautiful person A very great disrespect exclaimed Captain Langford an English officer who had recently brought despatches to Governor Shute The funeral should have been deferred lest Lady Eleanore s spirits be affected by such a dismal welcome With your pardon sir replied doctor Clarke a physician and a famous champion of the popular party whatever the heralds may pretend a dead beggar must have precedence of a living queen King Death confers high privileges These remarks were interchanged while the speakers waited a passage through the crowd which had gathered on each side of the gateway leaving an open avenue to the portal of the province house A black slave in livery now leaped from behind the coach and threw open the door while at the same moment Governor Shute descended the flight of steps from his mansion to assist Lady Eleanore in alighting But the governor s stately approach was anticipated in a manner that excited general astonishment A pale young man with his black hair all in disorder rushed from the throng and prostrated himself beside the coach thus offering his person as a footstool for Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe to tread upon She held back an instant yet with an expression as if doubting whether the young man were worthy to bear the weight of her footstep rather than dissatisfied to receive such awful reverence from a fellow mortal Up sir said the governor sternly at the same time lifting his cane over the intruder What means the Bedlamite by this freak Nay answered Lady Eleanore playfully but with more scorn than pity in her tone Your Excellency shall not strike him When men seek only to be trampled upon it were a pity to deny them a favor so easily granted and so well deserved Then though as lightly as a sunbeam on a cloud she placed her foot upon the cowering form and extended her hand to meet that of the governor There was a brief interval during which Lady Eleanore retained this attitude and never surely was there an apter emblem of aristocracy and hereditary pride trampling on human sympathies and the kindred of nature than these two figures presented at that moment Yet the spectators were so smitten with her beauty and so essential did pride seem to the existence of such a creature that they gave a simultaneous acclamation of applause Who is this insolent young fellow inquired Captain Langford who still remained beside doctor Clarke If he be in his senses his impertinence demands the bastinado if mad Lady Eleanore should be secured from further inconvenience by his confinement His name is Jervase Helwyse answered the doctor a youth of no birth or fortune or other advantages save the mind and soul that nature gave him and being secretary to our colonial agent in London it was his misfortune to meet this Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe He loved her and her scorn has driven him mad He was mad so to aspire observed the English officer It may be so said doctor Clarke frowning as he spoke but I tell you sir I could wellnigh doubt the justice of the Heaven above us if no signal humiliation overtake this lady who now treads so haughtily into yonder mansion She seeks to place herself above the sympathies of our common nature which envelops all human souls see if that nature do not assert its claim over her in some mode that shall bring her level with the lowest Never cried Captain Langford indignantly neither in life nor when they lay her with her ancestors Not many days afterward the governor gave a ball in honor of Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe The principal gentry of the colony received invitations which were distributed to their residences far and near by messengers on horseback bearing missives sealed with all the formality of official despatches In obedience to the summons there was a general gathering of rank wealth and beauty and the wide door of the province house had seldom given admittance to more numerous and honorable guests than on the evening of Lady Eleanore s ball Without much extravagance of eulogy the spectacle might even be termed splendid for according to the fashion of the times the ladies shone in rich silks and satins outspread over wide projecting hoops and the gentlemen glittered in gold embroidery laid unsparingly upon the purple or scarlet or sky blue velvet which was the material of their coats and waistcoats The latter article of dress was of great importance since it enveloped the wearer s body nearly to the knees and was perhaps bedizened with the amount of his whole year s income in golden flowers and foliage The altered taste of the present day a taste symbolic of a deep change in the whole system of society would look upon almost any of those gorgeous figures as ridiculous although that evening the guests sought their reflections in the pier glasses and rejoiced to catch their own glitter amid the glittering crowd What a pity that one of the stately mirrors has not preserved a picture of the scene which by the very traits that were so transitory might have taught us much that would be worth knowing and remembering Would at least that either painter or mirror could convey to us some faint idea of a garment already noticed in this legend the Lady Eleanore s embroidered mantle which the gossips whispered was invested with magic properties so as to lend a new and untried grace to her figure each time that she put it on Idle fancy as it is this mysterious mantle has thrown an awe around my image of her partly from its fabled virtues and partly because it was the handiwork of a dying woman and perchance owed the fantastic grace of its conception to the delirium of approaching death After the ceremonial greetings had been paid Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe stood apart from the mob of guests insulating herself within a small and distinguished circle to whom she accorded a more cordial favor than to the general throng The waxen torches threw their radiance vividly over the scene bringing out its brilliant points in strong relief but she gazed carelessly and with now and then an expression of weariness or scorn tempered with such feminine grace that her auditors scarcely perceived the moral deformity of which it was the utterance She beheld the spectacle not with vulgar ridicule as disdaining to be pleased with the provincial mockery of a court festival but with the deeper scorn of one whose spirit held itself too high to participate in the enjoyment of other human souls Whether or no the recollections of those who saw her that evening were influenced by the strange events with which she was subsequently connected so it was that her figure ever after recurred to them as marked by something wild and unnatural although at the time the general whisper was of her exceeding beauty and of the indescribable charm which her mantle threw around her Some close observers indeed detected a feverish flush and alternate paleness of countenance with a corresponding flow and revulsion of spirits and once or twice a painful and helpless betrayal of lassitude as if she were on the point of sinking to the ground Then with a nervous shudder she seemed to arouse her energies and threw some bright and playful yet half wicked sarcasm into the conversation There was so strange a characteristic in her manners and sentiments that it astonished every right minded listener till looking in her face a lurking and incomprehensible glance and smile perplexed them with doubts both as to her seriousness and sanity Gradually Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe s circle grew smaller till only four gentlemen remained in it These were Captain Langford the English officer before mentioned a Virginian planter who had come to Massachusetts on some political errand a young Episcopal clergyman the grandson of a British earl and lastly the private secretary of Governor Shute whose obsequiousness had won a sort of tolerance from Lady Eleanore At different periods of the evening the liveried servants of the province house passed among the guests bearing huge trays of refreshments and French and Spanish wines Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe who refused to wet her beautiful lips even with a bubble of champagne had sunk back into a large damask chair apparently overwearied either with the excitement of the scene or its tedium and while for an instant she was unconscious of voices laughter and music a young man stole forward and knelt down at her feet He bore a salver in his hand on which was a chased silver goblet filled to the brim with wine which he offered as reverentially as to a crowned queen or rather with the awful devotion of a priest doing sacrifice to his idol Conscious that some one touched her robe Lady Eleanore started and unclosed her eyes upon the pale wild features and dishevelled hair of Jervase Helwyse Why do you haunt me thus said she in a languid tone but with a kindlier feeling than she ordinarily permitted herself to express They tell me that I have done you harm Heaven knows if that be so replied the young man solemnly But Lady Eleanore in requital of that harm if such there be and for your own earthly and heavenly welfare I pray you to take one sip of this holy wine and then to pass the goblet round among the guests And this shall be a symbol that you have not sought to withdraw yourself from the chain of human sympathies which whoso would shake off must keep company with fallen angels Where has this mad fellow stolen that sacramental vessel exclaimed the Episcopal clergyman This question drew the notice of the guests to the silver cup which was recognized as appertaining to the communion plate of the Old South Church and for aught that could be known it was brimming over with the consecrated wine Perhaps it is poisoned half whispered the governor s secretary Pour it down the villain s throat cried the Virginian fiercely Turn him out of the house cried Captain Langford seizing Jervase Helwyse so roughly by the shoulder that the sacramental cup was overturned and its contents sprinkled upon Lady Eleanore s mantle Whether knave fool or Bedlamite it is intolerable that the fellow should go at large Pray gentlemen do my poor admirer no harm said Lady Eleanore with a faint and weary smile Take him out of my sight if such be your pleasure for I can find in my heart to do nothing but laugh at him whereas in all decency and conscience it would become me to weep for the mischief I have wrought But while the bystanders were attempting to lead away the unfortunate young man he broke from them and with a wild impassioned earnestness offered a new and equally strange petition to Lady Eleanore It was no other than that she should throw off the mantle which while he pressed the silver cup of wine upon her she had drawn more closely around her form so as almost to shroud herself within it Cast it from you exclaimed Jervase Helwyse clasping his hands in an agony of entreaty It may not yet be too late Give the accursed garment to the flames But Lady Eleanore with a laugh of scorn drew the rich folds of the embroidered mantle over her head in such a fashion as to give a completely new aspect to her beautiful face which half hidden half revealed seemed to belong to some being of mysterious character and purposes Farewell Jervase Helwyse said she Keep my image in your remembrance as you behold it now Alas lady he replied in a tone no longer wild but sad as a funeral bell we must meet shortly when your face may wear another aspect and that shall be the image that must abide within me He made no more resistance to the violent efforts of the gentlemen and servants who almost dragged him out of the apartment and dismissed him roughly from the iron gate of the province house Captain Langford who had been very active in this affair was returning to the presence of Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe when he encountered the physician doctor Clarke with whom he had held some casual talk on the day of her arrival The doctor stood apart separated from Lady Eleanore by the width of the room but eying her with such keen sagacity that Captain Langford involuntarily gave him credit for the discovery of some deep secret You appear to be smitten after all with the charms of this queenly maiden said he hoping thus to draw forth the physician s hidden knowledge God forbid answered doctor Clarke with a grave smile and if you be wise you will put up the same prayer for yourself Woe to those who shall be smitten by this beautiful Lady Eleanore But yonder stands the governor and I have a word or two for his private ear Good night He accordingly advanced to Governor Shute and addressed him in so low a tone that none of the bystanders could catch a word of what he said although the sudden change of His Excellency s hitherto cheerful visage betokened that the communication could be of no agreeable import A very few moments afterward it was announced to the guests that an unforeseen circumstance rendered it necessary to put a premature close to the festival The ball at the province house supplied a topic of conversation for the colonial metropolis for some days after its occurrence and might still longer have been the general theme only that a subject of all engrossing interest thrust it for a time from the public recollection This was the appearance of a dreadful epidemic which in that age and long before and afterward was wont to slay its hundreds and thousands on both sides of the Atlantic On the occasion of which we speak it was distinguished by a peculiar virulence insomuch that it has left its traces its pitmarks to use an appropriate figure on the history of the country the affairs of which were thrown into confusion by its ravages At first unlike its ordinary course the disease seemed to confine itself to the higher circles of society selecting its victims from among the proud the well born and the wealthy entering unabashed into stately chambers and lying down with the slumberers in silken beds Some of the most distinguished guests of the province house even those whom the haughty Lady Eleanore Rochcliffe had deemed not unworthy of her favor were stricken by this fatal scourge It was noticed with an ungenerous bitterness of feeling that the four gentlemen the Virginian the British officer the young clergyman and the governor s secretary who had been her most devoted attendants on the evening of the ball were the foremost on whom the plague stroke fell But the disease pursuing its onward progress soon ceased to be exclusively a prerogative of aristocracy Its red brand was no longer conferred like a noble s star or an order of knighthood It threaded its way through the narrow and crooked streets and entered the low mean darksome dwellings and laid its hand of death upon the artisans and laboring classes of the town It compelled rich and poor to feel themselves brethren then and stalking to and fro across the Three Hills with a fierceness which made it almost a new pestilence there was that mighty conqueror that scourge and horror of our forefathers the small pox We cannot estimate the affright which this plague inspired of yore by contemplating it as the fangless monster of the present day We must remember rather with what awe we watched the gigantic footsteps of the Asiatic cholera striding from shore to shore of the Atlantic and marching like Destiny upon cities far remote which flight had already half depopulated There is no other fear so horrible and unhumanizing as that which makes man dread to breathe heaven s vital air lest it be poison or to grasp the hand of a brother or friend lest the grip of the pestilence should clutch him Such was the dismay that now followed in the track of the disease or ran before it throughout the town Graves were hastily dug and the pestilential relics as hastily covered because the dead were enemies of the living and strove to draw them headlong as it were into their own dismal pit The public councils were suspended as if mortal wisdom might relinquish its devices now that an unearthly usurper had found his way into the ruler s mansion Had an enemy s fleet been hovering on the coast or his armies trampling on our soil the people would probably have committed their defence to that same direful conqueror who had wrought their own calamity and would permit no interference with his sway This conqueror had a symbol of his triumphs it was a blood red flag that fluttered in the tainted air over the door of every dwelling into which the small pox had entered Such a banner was long since waving over the portal of the province house for thence as was proved by tracking its footsteps back had all this dreadful mischief issued It had been traced back to a lady s luxurious chamber to the proudest of the proud to her that was so delicate and hardly owned herself of earthly mould to the haughty one who took her stand above human sympathies to Lady Eleanore There remained no room for doubt that the contagion had lurked in that gorgeous mantle which threw so strange a grace around her at the festival Its fantastic splendor had been conceived in the delirious brain of a woman on her death bed and was the last toil of her stiffening fingers which had interwoven fate and misery with its golden threads This dark tale whispered at first was now bruited far and wide The people raved against the Lady Eleanore and cried out that her pride and scorn had evoked a fiend and that between them both this monstrous evil had been born At times their rage and despair took the semblance of grinning mirth and whenever the red flag of the pestilence was hoisted over another and yet another door they clapped their hands and shouted through the streets in bitter mockery Behold a new triumph for the Lady Eleanore One day in the midst of these dismal times a wild figure approached the portal of the province house and folding his arms stood contemplating the scarlet banner which a passing breeze shook fitfully as if to fling abroad the contagion that it typified At length climbing one of the pillars by means of the iron balustrade he took down the flag and entered the mansion waving it above his head At the foot of the staircase he met the governor booted and spurred with his cloak drawn around him evidently on the point of setting forth upon a journey Wretched lunatic what do you seek here exclaimed Shute extending his cane to guard himself from contact There is nothing here but Death back or you will meet him Death will not touch me the banner bearer of the pestilence cried Jervase Helwyse shaking the red flag aloft Death and the pestilence who wears the aspect of the Lady Eleanore will walk through the streets to night and I must march before them with this banner Why do I waste words on the fellow muttered the governor drawing his cloak across his mouth What matters his miserable life when none of us are sure of twelve hours breath On fool to your own destruction He made way for Jervase Helwyse who immediately ascended the staircase but on the first landing place was arrested by the firm grasp of a hand upon his shoulder Looking fiercely up with a madman s impulse to struggle with and rend asunder his opponent he found himself powerless beneath a calm stern eye which possessed the mysterious property of quelling frenzy at its height The person whom he had now encountered was the physician doctor Clarke the duties of whose sad profession had led him to the province house where he was an infrequent guest in more prosperous times Young man what is your purpose demanded he I seek the Lady Eleanore answered Jervase Helwyse submissively All have fled from her said the physician Why do you seek her now I tell you youth her nurse fell death stricken on the threshold of that fatal chamber Know ye not that never came such a curse to our shores as this lovely Lady Eleanore that her breath has filled the air with poison that she has shaken pestilence and death upon the land from the folds of her accursed mantle Let me look upon her rejoined the mad youth more wildly Let me behold her in her awful beauty clad in the regal garments of the pestilence She and Death sit on a throne together let me kneel down before them Poor youth said doctor Clarke and moved by a deep sense of human weakness a smile of caustic humor curled his lip even then Wilt thou still worship the destroyer and surround her image with fantasies the more magnificent the more evil she has wrought Thus man doth ever to his tyrants Approach then Madness as I have noted has that good efficacy that it will guard you from contagion and perhaps its own cure may be found in yonder chamber Ascending another flight of stairs he threw open a door and signed to Jervase Helwyse that he should enter The poor lunatic it seems probable had cherished a delusion that his haughty mistress sat in state unharmed herself by the pestilential influence which as by enchantment she scattered round about her He dreamed no doubt that her beauty was not dimmed but brightened into superhuman splendor With such anticipations he stole reverentially to the door at which the physician stood but paused upon the threshold gazing fearfully into the gloom of the darkened chamber Where is the Lady Eleanore whispered he Call her replied the physician Lady Eleanore princess queen of Death cried Jervase Helwyse advancing three steps into the chamber She is not here There on yonder table I behold the sparkle of a diamond which once she wore upon her bosom There and he shuddered there hangs her mantle on which a dead woman embroidered a spell of dreadful potency But where is the Lady Eleanore Something stirred within the silken curtains of a canopied bed and a low moan was uttered which listening intently Jervase Helwyse began to distinguish as a woman s voice complaining dolefully of thirst He fancied even that he recognized its tones My throat My throat is scorched murmured the voice A drop of water What thing art thou said the brain stricken youth drawing near the bed and tearing asunder its curtains Whose voice hast thou stolen for thy murmurs and miserable petitions as if Lady Eleanore could be conscious of mortal infirmity Fie Heap of diseased mortality why lurkest thou in my lady s chamber Oh Jervase Helwyse said the voice and as it spoke the figure contorted itself struggling to hide its blasted face look not now on the woman you once loved The curse of Heaven hath stricken me because I would not call man my brother nor woman sister I wrapped myself in pride as in a mantle and scorned the sympathies of nature and therefore has Nature made this wretched body the medium of a dreadful sympathy You are avenged they are all avenged Nature is avenged for I am Eleanore Rochcliffe The malice of his mental disease the bitterness lurking at the bottom of his heart mad as he was for a blighted and ruined life and love that had been paid with cruel scorn awoke within the breast of Jervase Helwyse He shook his finger at the wretched girl and the chamber echoed the curtains of the bed were shaken with his outburst of insane merriment Another triumph for the Lady Eleanore he cried All have been her victims who so worthy to be the final victim as herself Impelled by some new fantasy of his crazed intellect he snatched the fatal mantle and rushed from the chamber and the house That night a procession passed by torchlight through the streets bearing in the midst the figure of a woman enveloped with a richly embroidered mantle while in advance stalked Jervase Helwyse waving the red flag of the pestilence Arriving opposite the province house the mob burned the effigy and a strong wind came and swept away the ashes It was said that from that very hour the pestilence abated as if its sway had some mysterious connection from the first plague stroke to the last with Lady Elcanore s mantle A remarkable uncertainty broods over that unhappy lady s fate There is a belief however that in a certain chamber of this mansion a female form may sometimes be duskily discerned shrinking into the darkest corner and muffling her face within an embroidered mantle Supposing the legend true can this be other than the once proud Lady Eleanore Mine host and the old loyalist and I bestowed no little Warmth of applause upon this narrative in which we had all been deeply interested for the reader can scarcely conceive how unspeakably the effect of such a tale is heightened when as in the present case we may repose perfect confidence in the veracity of him who tells it For my own part knowing how scrupulous is mister Tiffany to settle the foundation of his facts I could not have believed him one whit the more faithfully had he professed himself an eyewitness of the doings and sufferings of poor Lady Eleanore Some sceptics it is true might demand documentary evidence or even require him to produce the embroidered mantle forgetting that Heaven be praised it was consumed to ashes But now the old loyalist whose blood was warmed by the good cheer began to talk in his turn about the traditions of the Province House and hinted that he if it were agreeable might add a few reminiscences to our legendary stock mister Tiffany having no cause to dread a rival immediately besought him to favor us with a specimen my own entreaties of course were urged to the same effect and our venerable guest well pleased to find willing auditors awaited only the return of mister Thomas Waite who had been summoned forth to provide accommodations for several new arrivals Perchance the public but be this as its own caprice and ours shall settle the matter may read the result in another tale of the Province House IV OLD ESTHER DUDLEY Our host having resumed the chair he as well as mister Tiffany and myself expressed much eagerness to be made acquainted with the story to which the loyalist had alluded That venerable man first of all saw lit to moisten his throat with another glass of wine and then turning his face toward our coal fire looked steadfastly for a few moments into the depths of its cheerful glow Finally he poured forth a great fluency of speech The generous liquid that he had imbibed while it warmed his age chilled blood likewise took off the chill from his heart and mind and gave him an energy to think and feel which we could hardly have expected to find beneath the snows of fourscore winters His feelings indeed appeared to me more excitable than those of a younger man or at least the same degree of feeling manifested itself by more visible effects than if his judgment and will had possessed the potency of meridian life At the pathetic passages of his narrative he readily melted into tears When a breath of indignation swept across his spirit the blood flushed his withered visage even to the roots of his white hair and he shook his clinched fist at the trio of peaceful auditors seeming to fancy enemies in those who felt very kindly toward the desolate old soul But ever and anon sometimes in the midst of his most earnest talk this ancient person s intellect would wander vaguely losing its hold of the matter in hand and groping for it amid misty shadows Then would he cackle forth a feeble laugh and express a doubt whether his wits for by that phrase it pleased our ancient friend to signify his mental powers were not getting a little the worse for wear Under these disadvantages the old loyalist s story required more revision to render it fit for the public eye than those of the series which have preceded it nor should it be concealed that the sentiment and tone of the affair may have undergone some slight or perchance more than slight metamorphosis in its transmission to the reader through the medium of a thoroughgoing democrat The tale itself is a mere sketch with no involution of plot nor any great interest of events yet possessing if I have rehearsed it aright that pensive influence over the mind which the shadow of the old Province House flings upon the loiterer in its court yard The hour had come the hour of defeat and humiliation when Sir William Howe was to pass over the threshold of the province house and embark with no such triumphal ceremonies as he once promised himself on board the British fleet He bade his servants and military attendants go before him and lingered a moment in the loneliness of the mansion to quell the fierce emotions that struggled in his bosom as with a death throb Preferable then would he have deemed his fate had a warrior s death left him a claim to the narrow territory of a grave within the soil which the king had given him to defend With an ominous perception that as his departing footsteps echoed adown the staircase the sway of Britain was passing for ever from New England he smote his clenched hand on his brow and cursed the destiny that had flung the shame of a dismembered empire upon him Would to God cried he hardly repressing his tears of rage that the rebels were even now at the doorstep A blood stain upon the floor should then bear testimony that the last British ruler was faithful to his trust The tremulous voice of a woman replied to his exclamation Heaven s cause and the king s are one it said Go forth Sir William Howe and trust in Heaven to bring back a royal governor in triumph Subduing at once the passion to which he had yielded only in the faith that it was unwitnessed Sir William Howe became conscious that an aged woman leaning on a gold headed staff was standing betwixt him and the door It was old Esther Dudley who had dwelt almost immemorial years in this mansion until her presence seemed as inseparable from it as the recollections of its history She was the daughter of an ancient and once eminent family which had fallen into poverty and decay and left its last descendant no resource save the bounty of the king nor any shelter except within the walls of the province house An office in the household with merely nominal duties had been assigned to her as a pretext for the payment of a small pension the greater part of which she expended in adorning herself with an antique magnificence of attire The claims of Esther Dudley s gentle blood were acknowledged by all the successive governors and they treated her with the punctilious courtesy which it was her foible to demand not always with success from a neglectful world The only actual share which she assumed in the business of the mansion was to glide through its passages and public chambers late at night to see that the servants had dropped no fire from their flaring torches nor left embers crackling and blazing on the hearths Perhaps it was this invariable custom of walking her rounds in the hush of midnight that caused the superstition of the times to invest the old woman with attributes of awe and mystery fabling that she had entered the portal of the province house none knew whence in the train of the first royal governor and that it was her fate to dwell there till the last should have departed But Sir William Howe if he ever heard this legend had forgotten it Mistress Dudley why are you loitering here asked he with some severity of tone It is my pleasure to be the last in this mansion of the king Not so if it please Your Excellency answered the time stricken woman This roof has sheltered me long I will not pass from it until they bear me to the tomb of my forefathers What other shelter is there for old Esther Dudley save the province house or the grave Now Heaven forgive me said Sir William Howe to himself I was about to leave this wretched old creature to starve or beg Take this good Mistress Dudley he added putting a purse into her hands King George s head on these golden guineas is sterling yet and will continue so I warrant you even should the rebels crown John Hancock their king That purse will buy a better shelter than the province house can now afford While the burden of life remains upon me I will have no other shelter than this roof persisted Esther Dudley striking her stuff upon the floor with a gesture that expressed immovable resolve and when Your Excellency returns in triumph I will totter into the porch to welcome you My poor old friend answered the British general and all his manly and martial pride could no longer restrain a gush of bitter tears This is an evil hour for you and me The province which the king entrusted to my charge is lost I go hence in misfortune perchance in disgrace to return no more And you whose present being is incorporated with the past who have seen governor after governor in stately pageantry ascend these steps whose whole life has been an observance of majestic ceremonies and a worship of the king how will you endure the change Come with us bid farewell to a land that has shaken off its allegiance and live still under a royal government at Halifax Never never said the pertinacious old dame Here will I abide and King George shall still have one true subject in his disloyal province Beshrew the old fool muttered Sir William Howe growing impatient of her obstinacy and ashamed of the emotion into which he had been betrayed She is the very moral of old fashioned prejudice and could exist nowhere but in this musty edifice Well then Mistress Dudley since you will needs tarry I give the province house in charge to you Take this key and keep it safe until myself or some other royal governor shall demand it of you Smiling bitterly at himself and her he took the heavy key of the province house and delivering it into the old lady s hands drew his clonk around him for departure As the general glanced back at Esther Dudley s antique figure he deemed her well fitted for such a charge as being so perfect a representative of the decayed past of an age gone by with its manners opinions faith and feelings all fallen into oblivion or scorn of what had once been a reality but was now merely a vision of faded magnificence Then Sir William Howe strode forth smiting his clenched hands together in the fierce anguish of his spirit and old Esther Dudley was left to keep watch in the lonely province house dwelling there with Memory and if Hope ever seemed to flit around her still it was Memory in disguise The total change of affairs that ensued on the departure of the British troops did not drive the venerable lady from her stronghold There was not for many years afterward a governor of Massachusetts and the magistrates who had charge of such matters saw no objection to Esther Dudley s residence in the province house especially as they must otherwise have paid a hireling for taking care of the premises which with her was a labor of love and so they left her the undisturbed mistress of the old historic edifice Many and strange were the fables which the gossips whispered about her in all the chimney corners of the town Among the time worn articles of furniture that had been left in the mansion there was a tall antique mirror which was well worthy of a tale by itself and perhaps may hereafter be the theme of one The gold of its heavily wrought frame was tarnished and its surface so blurred that the old woman s figure whenever she paused before it looked indistinct and ghostlike But it was the general belief that Esther could cause the governors of the overthrown dynasty with the beautiful ladies who had once adorned their festivals the Indian chiefs who had come up to the province house to hold council or swear allegiance the grim provincial warriors the severe clergymen in short all the pageantry of gone days all the figures that ever swept across the broad plate of glass in former times she could cause the whole to reappear and people the inner world of the mirror with shadows of old life Such legends as these together with the singularity of her isolated existence her age and the infirmity that each added winter flung upon her made Mistress Dudley the object both of fear and pity and it was partly the result of either sentiment that amid all the angry license of the times neither wrong nor insult ever fell upon her unprotected head Indeed there was so much haughtiness in her demeanor toward intruders among whom she reckoned all persons acting under the new authorities that it was really an affair of no small nerve to look her in the face And to do the people justice stern republicans as they had now become they were well content that the old gentlewoman in her hoop petticoat and faded embroidery should still haunt the palace of ruined pride and overthrown power the symbol of a departed system embodying a history in her person So Esther Dudley dwelt year after year in the province house still reverencing all that others had flung aside still faithful to her king who so long as the venerable dame yet held her post might be said to retain one true subject in New England and one spot of the empire that had been wrested from him And did she dwell there in utter loneliness Rumor said Not so Whenever her chill and withered heart desired warmth she was wont to summon a black slave of Governor Shirley s from the blurred mirror and send him in search of guests who had long ago been familiar in those deserted chambers Forth went the sable messenger with the starlight or the moonshine gleaming through him and did his errand in the burial grounds knocking at the iron doors of tombs or upon the marble slabs that covered them and whispering to those within My mistress old Esther Dudley bids you to the province house at midnight and punctually as the clock of the Old South told twelve came the shadows of the Olivers the Hutchinsons the Dudleys all the grandees of a bygone generation gliding beneath the portal into the well known mansion where Esther mingled with them as if she likewise were a shade Without vouching for the truth of such traditions it is certain that Mistress Dudley sometimes assembled a few of the stanch though crestfallen old Tories who had lingered in the rebel town during those days of wrath and tribulation Out of a cobwebbed bottle containing liquor that a royal governor might have smacked his lips over they quaffed healths to the king and babbled treason to the republic feeling as if the protecting shadow of the throne were still flung around them But draining the last drops of their liquor they stole timorously homeward and answered not again if the rude mob reviled them in the street Yet Esther Dudley s most frequent and favored guests were the children of the town Toward them she was never stern A kindly and loving nature hindered elsewhere from its free course by a thousand rocky prejudices lavished itself upon these little ones By bribes of gingerbread of her own making stamped with a royal crown she tempted their sunny sportiveness beneath the gloomy portal of the province house and would often beguile them to spend a whole play day there sitting in a circle round the verge of her hoop petticoat greedily attentive to her stories of a dead world And when these little boys and girls stole forth again from the dark mysterious mansion they went bewildered full of old feelings that graver people had long ago forgotten rubbing their eyes at the world around them as if they had gone astray into ancient times and become children of the past At home when their parents asked where they had loitered such a weary while and with whom they had been at play the children would talk of all the departed worthies of the province as far back as Governor Belcher and the haughty dame of Sir William Phipps It would seem as though they had been sitting on the knees of these famous personages whom the grave had hidden for half a century and had toyed with the embroidery of their rich waistcoats or roguishly pulled the long curls of their flowing wigs But Governor Belcher has been dead this many a year would the mother say to her little boy And did you really see him at the province house Oh yes dear mother yes the half dreaming child would answer But when old Esther had done speaking about him he faded away out of his chair Thus without affrighting her little guests she led them by the hand into the chambers of her own desolate heart and made childhood s fancy discern the ghosts that haunted there Living so continually in her own circle of ideas and never regulating her mind by a proper reference to present things Esther Dudley appears to have grown partially crazed It was found that she had no right sense of the progress and true state of the Revolutionary war but held a constant faith that the armies of Britain were victorious on every field and destined to be ultimately triumphant Whenever the town rejoiced for a battle won by Washington or Gates or Morgan or Greene the news in passing through the door of the province house as through the ivory gate of dreams became metamorphosed into a strange tale of the prowess of Howe Clinton or Cornwallis Sooner or later it was her invincible belief the colonies would be prostrate at the footstool of the king Sometimes she seemed to take for granted that such was already the case On one occasion she startled the townspeople by a brilliant illumination of the province house with candles at every pane of glass and a transparency of the king s initials and a crown of light in the great balcony window The figure of the aged woman in the most gorgeous of her mildewed velvets and brocades was seen passing from casement to casement until she paused before the balcony and flourished a huge key above her head Her wrinkled visage actually gleamed with triumph as if the soul within her were a festal lamp What means this blaze of light What does old Esther s joy portend whispered a spectator It is frightful to see her gliding about the chambers and rejoicing there without a soul to bear her company It is as if she were making merry in a tomb said another Pshaw It is no such mystery observed an old man after some brief exercise of memory Mistress Dudley is keeping jubilee for the king of England s birthday Then the people laughed aloud and would have thrown mud against the blazing transparency of the king s crown and initials only that they pitied the poor old dame who was so dismally triumphant amid the wreck and ruin of the system to which she appertained Oftentimes it was her custom to climb the weary staircase that wound upward to the cupola and thence strain her dimmed eyesight seaward and countryward watching for a British fleet or for the march of a grand procession with the king s banner floating over it The passengers in the street below would discern her anxious visage and send up a shout When the golden Indian on the province house shall shoot his arrow and when the cock on the Old South spire shall crow then look for a royal governor again for this had grown a by word through the town And at last after long long years old Esther Dudley knew or perchance she only dreamed that a royal governor was on the eve of returning to the province house to receive the heavy key which Sir William Howe had committed to her charge Now it was the fact that intelligence bearing some faint analogy to Esther s version of it was current among the townspeople She set the mansion in the best order that her means allowed and arraying herself in silks and tarnished gold stood long before the blurred mirror to admire her own magnificence As she gazed the gray and withered lady moved her ashen lips murmuring half aloud talking to shapes that she saw within the mirror to shadows of her own fantasies to the household friends of memory and bidding them rejoice with her and come forth to meet the governor And while absorbed in this communion Mistress Dudley heard the tramp of many footsteps in the street and looking out at the window beheld what she construed as the royal governor s arrival Oh happy day Oh blessed blessed hour she exclaimed Let me but bid him welcome within the portal and my task in the province house and on earth is done Then with tottering feet which age and tremulous joy caused to tread amiss she hurried down the grand staircase her silks sweeping and rustling as she went so that the sound was as if a train of special courtiers were thronging from the dim mirror And Esther Dudley fancied that as soon as the wide door should be flung open all the pomp and splendor of bygone times would pace majestically into the province house and the gilded tapestry of the past would be brightened by the sunshine of the present She turned the key withdrew it from the lock unclosed the door and stepped across the threshold Advancing up the court yard appeared a person of most dignified mien with tokens as Esther interpreted them of gentle blood high rank and long accustomed authority even in his walk and every gesture He was richly dressed but wore a gouty shoe which however did not lessen the stateliness of his gait Around and behind him were people in plain civic dresses and two or three war worn veterans evidently officers of rank arrayed in a uniform of blue and buff But Esther Dudley firm in the belief that had fastened its roots about her heart beheld only the principal personage and never doubted that this was the long looked for governor to whom she was to surrender up her charge As he approached she involuntarily sank down on her knees and tremblingly held forth the heavy key Receive my trust Take it quickly cried she for methinks Death is striving to snatch away my triumph But he conies too late Thank Heaven for this blessed hour God save King George That madam is a strange prayer to be offered up at such a moment replied the unknown guest of the province house and courteously removing his hat he offered his arm to raise the aged woman Yet in reverence for your gray hairs and long kept faith Heaven forbid that any here should say you nay Over the realms which still acknowledge his sceptre God save King George Esther Dudley started to her feet and hastily clutching back the key gazed with fearful earnestness at the stranger and dimly and doubtfully as if suddenly awakened from a dream her bewildered eyes half recognized his face Years ago she had known him among the gentry of the province but the ban of the king had fallen upon him How then came the doomed victim here Proscribed excluded from mercy the monarch s most dreaded and hated foe this New England merchant had stood triumphantly against a kingdom s strength and his foot now trod upon humbled royalty as he ascended the steps of the province house the people s chosen governor of Massachusetts Wretch wretch that I am muttered the old woman with such a heartbroken expression that the tears gushed from the stranger s eyes Have I bidden a traitor welcome Come Death come quickly Alas venerable lady said Governor Hancock lending her his support with all the reverence that a courtier would have shown to a queen your life has been prolonged until the world has changed around you You have treasured up all that time has rendered worthless the principles feelings manners modes of being and acting which another generation has flung aside and you are a symbol of the past And I and these around me we represent a new race of men living no longer in the past scarcely in the present but projecting our lives forward into the future Ceasing to model ourselves on ancestral superstitions it is our faith and principle to press onward onward Yet continued he turning to his attendants let us reverence for the last time the stately and gorgeous prejudices of the tottering past While the republican governor spoke he had continued to support the helpless form of Esther Dudley her weight grew heavier against his arm but at last with a sudden effort to free herself the ancient woman sank down beside one of the pillars of the portal The key of the province house fell from her grasp and clanked against the stone I have been faithful unto death murmured she God save the king She hath done her office said Hancock solemnly We will follow her reverently to the tomb of her ancestors and then my fellow citizens onward onward We are no longer children of the past As the old loyalist concluded his narrative the enthusiasm which had been fitfully flashing within his sunken eyes and quivering across his wrinkled visage faded away as if all the lingering fire of his soul were extinguished Just then too a lamp upon the mantelpiece threw out a dying gleam which vanished as speedily as it shot upward compelling our eyes to grope for one another s features by the dim glow of the hearth With such a lingering fire methought with such a dying gleam had the glory of the ancient system vanished from the province house when the spirit of old Esther Dudley took its flight And now again the clock of the Old South threw its voice of ages on the breeze knolling the hourly knell of the past crying out far and wide through the multitudinous city and filling our ears as we sat in the dusky chamber with its reverberating depth of tone In that same mansion in that very chamber what a volume of history had been told off into hours by the same voice that was now trembling in the air Many a governor had heard those midnight accents and longed to exchange his stately cares for slumber And as for mine host and mister Bela Tiffany and the old loyalist and me we had babbled about dreams of the past until we almost fancied that the clock was still striking in a bygone century Neither of us would have wondered had a hoop petticoated phantom of Esther Dudley tottered into the chamber walking her rounds in the hush of midnight as of yore and motioned us to quench the fading embers of the fire and leave the historic precincts to herself and her kindred shades But as no such vision was vouchsafed I retired unbidden and would advise mister Tiffany to lay hold of another auditor being resolved not to show my face in the Province House for a good while hence if ever THE HAUNTED MIND 
3912-77626-0000	train-other-500	What a singular moment is the first one when you have hardly begun to recollect yourself after starting from midnight slumber By unclosing your eyes so suddenly
3912-77626-0001	train-other-500	you seem to have surprised the personages of your dream in full convocation round your bed
none	none	 and catch one broad glance at them before they can flit into obscurity 
3912-77626-0002	train-other-500	Or to vary the metaphor you find yourself for a single instant wide awake in that realm of illusions whither sleep has been the passport and behold its ghostly inhabitants and wondrous scenery with a perception of their strangeness
3912-77626-0003	train-other-500	such as you never attain while the dream is undisturbed The distant sound of a church clock is borne faintly on the wind You question with yourself half seriously
3912-77626-0004	train-other-500	whether it has stolen to your waking ear from some gray tower that stood within the precincts of your dream While yet in suspense another clock flings its heavy clang over the slumbering town with
3912-77626-0005	train-other-500	so full and distinct a sound and such a long murmur in the neighboring air that you are certain it must proceed from the steeple at the nearest corner You count the strokes one two
3912-77626-0006	train-other-500	and there they cease with a booming sound like the gathering of a third stroke within the bell If you could choose an hour of wakefulness out of the whole night it would be this Since your sober bedtime at eleven
3912-77626-0007	train-other-500	you have had rest enough to take off the pressure of yesterday s fatigue while before you till the sun comes from Far Cathay to brighten your window
none	none	 there is almost the space of a summer night one hour to be spent in thought with the mind s eye half shut and two in pleasant dreams 
3912-77626-0008	train-other-500	and two in that strangest of enjoyments the forgetfulness alike of joy and woe The moment of rising belongs to another period of time and appears so distant that the plunge out of a warm bed into the frosty air
3912-77626-0009	train-other-500	cannot yet be anticipated with dismay Yesterday has already vanished among the shadows of the past to morrow has not yet emerged from the future You have found an intermediate space where the business of life does not intrude
3912-77626-0010	train-other-500	where the passing moment lingers and becomes truly the present a spot where Father Time when he thinks nobody is watching him sits down by the wayside to take breath

3912-77626-0011	train-other-500	because the slightest motion would dissipate the fragments of your slumber Now being irrevocably awake you peep through the half drawn window curtain and observe that the glass is ornamented with fanciful devices in frost work
3912-77626-0012	train-other-500	and that each pane presents something like a frozen dream There will be time enough to trace out the analogy while waiting the summons to breakfast
3912-77626-0013	train-other-500	Seen through the clear portion of the glass where the silvery mountain peaks of the frost scenery do not ascend the most conspicuous object is the steeple
none	none	 the white spire of which directs you to the wintry lustre of the firmament 
3912-77626-0014	train-other-500	You may almost distinguish the figures on the clock that has just told the hour Such a frosty sky and the snow covered roofs and the long vista of the frozen street all white
3912-77626-0015	train-other-500	and the distant water hardened into rock might make you shiver even under four blankets and a woollen comforter Yet look at that one glorious star Its beams are distinguishable from all the rest
none	none	 and actually cast the shadow of the casement on the bed with a radiance of deeper hue than moonlight though not so accurate an outline You sink down and muffle your head in the clothes shivering all the while but less from bodily chill than the bare idea of a polar atmosphere 
3912-77626-0016	train-other-500	It is too cold even for the thoughts to venture abroad You speculate on the luxury of wearing out a whole existence in bed like an oyster in its shell
3912-77626-0017	train-other-500	content with the sluggish ecstasy of inaction and drowsily conscious of nothing but delicious warmth such as you now feel again Ah that idea has brought a hideous one in its train
3912-77626-0018	train-other-500	You think how the dead are lying in their cold shrouds and narrow coffins through the drear winter of the grave and cannot persuade your fancy that they neither shrink nor shiver
3912-77626-0019	train-other-500	when the snow is drifting over their little hillocks and the bitter blast howls against the door of the tomb That gloomy thought will collect a gloomy multitude and throw its complexion over your wakeful hour
3912-77626-0020	train-other-500	In the depths of every heart there is a tomb and a dungeon though the lights the music and revelry above may cause us to forget their existence and the buried ones or prisoners whom they hide
3912-77626-0021	train-other-500	But sometimes and oftenest at midnight those dark receptacles are flung wide open In an hour like this when the mind has a passive sensibility but no active strength
3912-77626-0022	train-other-500	when the imagination is a mirror imparting vividness to all ideas without the power of selecting or controlling them then pray that your griefs may slumber and the brotherhood of remorse not break their chain
3912-77626-0023	train-other-500	It is too late A funeral train comes gliding by your bed in which passion and feeling assume bodily shape and things of the mind become dim spectres to the eye

you There is a dimness over your figures You sit quivering indistinctly with each motion of the blaze which eddies about you like a flood so that you all have the look of visions or people that dwell only in the firelight and will vanish from existence as completely as your own shadows when the flame shall sink among the embers Hark let me listen for the swell of the surf it should be audible a mile inland on a night like this Yes there I catch the sound but only an uncertain murmur as if a good way down over the beach though by the almanac it is high tide at eight o clock and the billows must now be dashing within thirty yards of our door Ah the old man s ears are failing him and so is his eyesight and perhaps his mind else you would not all be so shadowy in the blaze of his Thanksgiving fire How strangely the past is peeping over the shoulders of the present To judge by my recollections it is but a few moments since I sat in another room Yonder model of a vessel was not there nor the old chest of drawers nor Susan s profile and mine in that gilt frame nothing in short except this same fire which glimmered on books papers and a picture and half discovered my solitary figure in a looking glass But it was paler than my rugged old self and younger too by almost half a century Speak to me Susan speak my beloved ones for the scene is glimmering on my sight again and as it brightens you fade away Oh I should be loth to lose my treasure of past happiness and become once more what I was then a hermit in the depths of my own mind sometimes yawning over drowsy volumes and anon a scribbler of wearier trash than what I read a man who had wandered out of the real world and got into its shadow where his troubles joys and vicissitudes were of such slight stuff that he hardly knew whether he lived or only dreamed of living Thank Heaven I am an old man now and have done with all such vanities Still this dimness of mine eyes Come nearer Susan and stand before the fullest blaze of the hearth Now I behold you illuminated from head to foot in your clean cap and decent gown with the dear lock of gray hair across your forehead and a quiet smile about your mouth while the eyes alone are concealed by the red gleam of the fire upon your spectacles There you made me tremble again When the flame quivered my sweet Susan you quivered with it and grew indistinct as if melting into the warm light that my last glimpse of you might be as visionary as the first was full many a year since Do you remember it You stood on the little bridge over the brook that runs across King s Beach into the sea It was twilight the waves rolling in the wind sweeping by the crimson clouds fading in the west and the silver moon brightening above the hill and on the bridge were you fluttering in the breeze like a sea bird that might skim away at your pleasure You seemed a daughter of the viewless wind a creature of the ocean foam and the crimson light whose merry life was spent in dancing on the crests of the billows that threw up their spray to support your footsteps As I drew nearer I fancied you akin to the race of mermaids and thought how pleasant it would be to dwell with you among the quiet coves in the shadow of the cliffs and to roam along secluded beaches of the purest sand and when our Northern shores grew bleak to haunt the islands green and lonely far amid summer seas And yet it gladdened me after all this nonsense to find you nothing but a pretty young girl sadly perplexed with the rude behavior of the wind about your petticoats Thus I did with Susan as with most other things in my earlier days dipping her image into my mind and coloring it of a thousand fantastic hues before I could see her as she really was Now Susan for a sober picture of our village It was a small collection of dwellings that seemed to have been cast up by the sea with the rock weed and marine plants that it vomits after a storm or to have come ashore among the pipe staves and other lumber which had been washed from the deck of an Eastern schooner There was just space for the narrow and sandy street between the beach in front and a precipitous hill that lifted its rocky forehead in the rear among a waste of juniper bushes and the wild growth of a broken pasture The village was picturesque in the variety of its edifices though all were rude Here stood a little old hovel built perhaps of driftwood there a row of boat houses and beyond them a two story dwelling of dark and weatherbeaten aspect the whole intermixed with one or two snug cottages painted white a sufficiency of pig styes and a shoemaker s shop Two grocery stores stood opposite each other in the centre of the village These were the places of resort at their idle hours of a hardy throng of fishermen in red baize shirts oilcloth trousers and boots of brown leather covering the whole leg true seven league boots but fitter to wade the ocean than walk the earth The wearers seemed amphibious as if they did but creep out of salt water to sun themselves nor would it have been wonderful to see their lower limbs covered with clusters of little shellfish such as cling to rocks and old ship timber over which the tide ebbs and flows When their fleet of boats was weather bound the butchers raised their price and the spit was busier than the frying pan for this was a place of fish and known as such to all the country round about The very air was fishy being perfumed with dead sculpins hard heads and dogfish strewn plentifully on the beach You see children the village is but little changed since your mother and I were young How like a dream it was when I bent over a pool of water one pleasant morning and saw that the ocean had dashed its spray over me and made me a fisherman There was the tarpaulin the baize shirt the oilcloth trousers and seven league boots and there my own features but so reddened with sunburn and sea breezes that methought I had another face and on other shoulders too The seagulls and the loons and I had now all one trade we skimmed the crested waves and sought our prey beneath them the man with as keen enjoyment as the birds Always when the east grew purple I launched my dory my little flat bottomed skiff and rowed cross handed to Point Ledge the Middle Ledge or perhaps beyond Egg Rock often too did I anchor off Dread Ledge a spot of peril to ships unpiloted and sometimes spread an adventurous sail and tracked across the bay to South Shore casting my lines in sight of Scituate Ere nightfall I hauled my skiff high and dry on the beach laden with red rock cod or the white bellied ones of deep water haddock bearing the black marks of saint Peter s fingers near the gills the long bearded hake whose liver holds oil enough for a midnight lamp and now and then a mighty halibut with a back broad as my boat In the autumn I toled and caught those lovely fish the mackerel When the wind was high when the whale boats anchored off the Point nodded their slender masts at each other and the dories pitched and tossed in the surf when Nahant Beach was thundering three miles off and the spray broke a hundred feet in the air round the distant base of Egg Rock when the brimful and boisterous sea threatened to tumble over the street of our village then I made a holiday on shore Many such a day did I sit snugly in mister Bartlett s store attentive to the yarns of Uncle Parker uncle to the whole village by right of seniority but of Southern blood with no kindred in New England His figure is before me now enthroned upon a mackerel barrel a lean old man of great height but bent with years and twisted into an uncouth shape by seven broken limbs furrowed also and weatherworn as if every gale for the better part of a century had caught him somewhere on the sea He looked like a harbinger of tempest a shipmate of the Flying Dutchman After innumerable voyages aboard men of war and merchantmen fishing schooners and chebacco boats the old salt had become master of a hand cart which he daily trundled about the vicinity and sometimes blew his fish horn through the streets of Salem One of Uncle Parker s eyes had been blown out with gunpowder and the other did but glimmer in its socket Turning it upward as he spoke it was his delight to tell of cruises against the French and battles with his own shipmates when he and an antagonist used to be seated astride of a sailor s chest each fastened down by a spike nail through his trousers and there to fight it out Sometimes he expatiated on the delicious flavor of the hagden a greasy and goose like fowl which the sailors catch with hook and line on the Grand Banks He dwelt with rapture on an interminable winter at the Isle of Sables where he had gladdened himself amid polar snows with the rum and sugar saved from the wreck of a West India schooner And wrathfully did he shake his fist as he related how a party of Cape Cod men had robbed him and his companions of their lawful spoils and sailed away with every keg of old Jamaica leaving him not a drop to drown his sorrow Villains they were and of that wicked brotherhood who are said to tie lanterns to horses tails to mislead the mariner along the dangerous shores of the Cape Even now I seem to see the group of fishermen with that old salt in the midst One fellow sits on the counter a second bestrides an oil barrel a third lolls at his length on a parcel of new cod lines and another has planted the tarry seat of his trousers on a heap of salt which will shortly be sprinkled over a lot of fish They are a likely set of men Some have voyaged to the East Indies or the Pacific and most of them have sailed in Marblehead schooners to Newfoundland a few have been no farther than the Middle Banks and one or two have always fished along the shore but as Uncle Parker used to say they have all been christened in salt water and know more than men ever learn in the bushes A curious figure by way of contrast is a fish dealer from far up country listening with eyes wide open to narratives that might startle Sinbad the Sailor Be it well with you my brethren Ye are all gone some to your graves ashore and others to the depths of ocean but my faith is strong that ye are happy for whenever I behold your forms whether in dream or vision each departed friend is puffing his long nine and a mug of the right blackstrap goes round from lip to lip But where was the mermaid in those delightful times At a certain window near the centre of the village appeared a pretty display of gingerbread men and horses picture books and ballads small fish hooks pins needles sugarplums and brass thimbles articles on which the young fishermen used to expend their money from pure gallantry What a picture was Susan behind the counter A slender maiden though the child of rugged parents she had the slimmest of all waists brown hair curling on her neck and a complexion rather pale except when the sea breeze flushed it A few freckles became beauty spots beneath her eyelids How was it Susan that you talked and acted so carelessly yet always for the best doing whatever was right in your own eyes and never once doing wrong in mine nor shocked a taste that had been morbidly sensitive till now And whence had you that happiest gift of brightening every topic with an unsought gayety quiet but irresistible so that even gloomy spirits felt your sunshine and did not shrink from it Nature wrought the charm She made you a frank simple kind hearted sensible and mirthful girl Obeying Nature you did free things without indelicacy displayed a maiden s thoughts to every eye and proved yourself as innocent as naked Eve It was beautiful to observe how her simple and happy nature mingled itself with mine She kindled a domestic fire within my heart and took up her dwelling there even in that chill and lonesome cavern hung round with glittering icicles of fancy She gave me warmth of feeling while the influence of my mind made her contemplative I taught her to love the moonlight hour when the expanse of the encircled bay was smooth as a great mirror and slept in a transparent shadow while beyond Nahant the wind rippled the dim ocean into a dreamy brightness which grew faint afar off without becoming gloomier I held her hand and pointed to the long surf wave as it rolled calmly on the beach in an unbroken line of silver we were silent together till its deep and peaceful murmur had swept by us When the Sabbath sun shone down into the recesses of the cliffs I led the mermaid thither and told her that those huge gray shattered rocks and her native sea that raged for ever like a storm against them and her own slender beauty in so stern a scene were all combined into a strain of poetry But on the Sabbath eve when her mother had gone early to bed and her gentle sister had smiled and left us as we sat alone by the quiet hearth with household things around it was her turn to make me feel that here was a deeper poetry and that this was the dearest hour of all Thus went on our wooing till I had shot wild fowl enough to feather our bridal bed and the daughter of the sea was mine I built a cottage for Susan and myself and made a gateway in the form of a Gothic arch by setting up a whale s jaw bones We bought a heifer with her first calf and had a little garden on the hillside to supply us with potatoes and green sauce for our fish Our parlor small and neat was ornamented with our two profiles in one gilt frame and with shells and pretty pebbles on the mantelpiece selected from the sea s treasury of such things on Nahant Beach On the desk beneath the looking glass lay the Bible which I had begun to read aloud at the book of Genesis and the singing book that Susan used for her evening psalm Except the almanac we had no other literature All that I heard of books was when an Indian history or tale of shipwreck was sold by a pedler or wandering subscription man to some one in the village and read through its owner s nose to a slumbrous auditory Like my brother fishermen I grew into the belief that all human erudition was collected in our pedagogue whose green spectacles and solemn phiz as he passed to his little schoolhouse amid a waste of sand might have gained him a diploma from any college in New England In truth I dreaded him When our children were old enough to claim his care you remember Susan how I frowned though you were pleased at this learned man s encomiums on their proficiency I feared to trust them even with the alphabet it was the key to a fatal treasure But I loved to lead them by their little hands along the beach and point to nature in the vast and the minute the sky the sea the green earth the pebbles and the shells Then did I discourse of the mighty works and coextensive goodness of the Deity with the simple wisdom of a man whose mind had profited by lonely days upon the deep and his heart by the strong and pure affections of his evening home Sometimes my voice lost itself in a tremulous depth for I felt his eye upon me as I spoke Once while my wife and all of us were gazing at ourselves in the mirror left by the tide in a hollow of the sand I pointed to the pictured heaven below and bade her observe how religion was strewn everywhere in our path since even a casual pool of water recalled the idea of that home whither we were travelling to rest for ever with our children Suddenly your image Susan and all the little faces made up of yours and mine seemed to fade away and vanish around me leaving a pale visage like my own of former days within the frame of a large looking glass Strange illusion My life glided on the past appearing to mingle with the present and absorb the future till the whole lies before me at a glance My manhood has long been waning with a stanch decay my earlier contemporaries after lives of unbroken health are all at rest without having known the weariness of later age and now with a wrinkled forehead and thin white hair as badges of my dignity I have become the patriarch the uncle of the village I love that name it widens the circle of my sympathies it joins all the youthful to my household in the kindred of affection Like Uncle Parker whose rheumatic bones were dashed against Egg Rock full forty years ago I am a spinner of long yarns Seated on the gunnel of a dory or on the sunny side of a boat house where the warmth is grateful to my limbs or by my own hearth when a friend or two are there I overflow with talk and yet am never tedious With a broken voice I give utterance to much wisdom Such Heaven be praised is the vigor of my faculties that many a forgotten usage and traditions ancient in my youth and early adventures of myself or others hitherto effaced by things more recent acquire new distinctness in my memory I remember the happy days when the haddock were more numerous on all the fishing grounds than sculpins in the surf when the deep water cod swam close in shore and the dogfish with his poisonous horn had not learnt to take the hook I can number every equinoctial storm in which the sea has overwhelmed the street flooded the cellars of the village and hissed upon our kitchen hearth I give the history of the great whale that was landed on Whale Beach and whose jaws being now my gateway will last for ages after my coffin shall have passed beneath them Thence it is an easy digression to the halibut scarcely smaller than the whale which ran out six codlines and hauled my dory to the mouth of Boston harbor before I could touch him with the gaff If melancholy accidents be the theme of conversation I tell how a friend of mine was taken out of his boat by an enormous shark and the sad true tale of a young man on the eve of marriage who had been nine days missing when his drowned body floated into the very pathway on Marble head Neck that had often led him to the dwelling of his bride as if the dripping corpse would have come where the mourner was With such awful fidelity did that lover return to fulfil his vows Another favorite story is of a crazy maiden who conversed with angels and had the gift of prophecy and whom all the village loved and pitied though she went from door to door accusing us of sin exhorting to repentance and foretelling our destruction by flood or earthquake If the young men boast their knowledge of the ledges and sunken rocks I speak of pilots who knew the wind by its scent and the wave by its taste and could have steered blindfold to any port between Boston and Mount Desert guided only by the rote of the shore the peculiar sound of the surf on each island beach and line of rocks along the coast Thus do I talk and all my auditors grow wise while they deem it pastime I recollect no happier portion of my life than this my calm old age It is like the sunny and sheltered slope of a valley where late in the autumn the grass is greener than in August and intermixed with golden dandelions that had not been seen till now since the first warmth of the year But with me the verdure and the flowers are not frost bitten in the midst of winter A playfulness has revisited my mind a sympathy with the young and gay an unpainful interest in the business of others a light and wandering curiosity arising perhaps from the sense that my toil on earth is ended and the brief hour till bedtime may be spent in play Still I have fancied that there is a depth of feeling and reflection under this superficial levity peculiar to one who has lived long and is soon to die Show me anything that would make an infant smile and you shall behold a gleam of mirth over the hoary ruin of my visage I can spend a pleasant hour in the sun watching the sports of the village children on the edge of the surf Now they chase the retreating wave far down over the wet sand now it steals softly up to kiss their naked feet now it comes onward with threatening front and roars after the laughing crew as they scamper beyond its reach Why should not an old man be merry too when the great sea is at play with those little children I delight also to follow in the wake of a pleasure party of young men and girls strolling along the beach after an early supper at the Point Here with handkerchiefs at nose they bend over a heap of eel grass entangled in which is a dead skate so oddly accoutred with two legs and a long tail that they mistake him for a drowned animal A few steps farther the ladies scream and the gentlemen make ready to protect them against a young shark of the dogfish kind rolling with a lifelike motion in the tide that has thrown him up Next they are smit with wonder at the black shells of a wagon load of live lobsters packed in rock weed for the country market And when they reach the fleet of dories just hauled ashore after the day s fishing how do I laugh in my sleeve and sometimes roar outright at the simplicity of these young folks and the sly humor of the fishermen In winter when our village is thrown into a bustle by the arrival of perhaps a score of country dealers bargaining for frozen fish to be transported hundreds of miles and eaten fresh in Vermont or Canada I am a pleased but idle spectator in the throng For I launch my boat no more When the shore was solitary I have found a pleasure that seemed even to exalt my mind in observing the sports or contentions of two gulls as they wheeled and hovered about each other with hoarse screams one moment flapping on the foam of the wave and then soaring aloft till their white bosoms melted into the upper sunshine In the calm of the summer sunset I drag my aged limbs with a little ostentation of activity because I am so old up to the rocky brow of the hill There I see the white sails of many a vessel outward bound or homeward from afar and the black trail of a vapor behind the Eastern steamboat there too is the sun going down but not in gloom and there the illimitable ocean mingling with the sky to remind me of eternity But sweetest of all is the hour of cheerful musing and pleasant talk that comes between the dusk and the lighted candle by my glowing fireside And never even on the first Thanksgiving night when Susan and I sat alone with our hopes nor the second when a stranger had been sent to gladden us and be the visible image of our affection did I feel such joy as now All that belongs to me are here Death has taken none nor Disease kept them away nor Strife divided them from their parents or each other with neither poverty nor riches to disturb them nor the misery of desires beyond their lot they have kept New England s festival round the patriarch s board For I am a patriarch Here I sit among my descendants in my old arm chair and immemorial corner while the firelight throws an appropriate glory round my venerable frame Susan My children Something whispers me that this happiest hour must be the final one and that nothing remains but to bless you all and depart with a treasure of recollected joys to heaven Will you meet me there Alas your figures grow indistinct fading into pictures on the air and now to fainter outlines while the fire is glimmering on the walls of a familiar room and shows the book that I flung down and the sheet that I left half written some fifty years ago I lift my eyes to the looking glass and perceive myself alone unless those be the mermaid s features retiring into the depths of the mirror with a tender and melancholy smile Ah One feels a chilliness not bodily but about the heart and moreover a foolish dread of looking behind him after these pastimes I can imagine precisely how a magician would sit down in gloom and terror after dismissing the shadows that had personated dead or distant people and stripping his cavern of the unreal splendor which had changed it to a palace And now for a moral to my reverie Shall it be that since fancy can create so bright a dream of happiness it were better to dream on from youth to age than to awake and strive doubtfully for something real Oh the slight tissue of a dream can no more preserve us from the stern reality of misfortune than a robe of cobweb could repel the wintry blast Be this the moral then In chaste and warm affections humble wishes and honest toil for some useful end there is health for the mind and quiet for the heart the prospect of a happy life and the fairest hope of heaven THE AMBITIOUS GUEST One September night a family had gathered round their hearth and piled it high with the driftwood of mountain streams the dry cones of the pine and the splintered ruins of great trees that had come crashing down the precipice Up the chimney roared the fire and brightened the room with its broad blaze The faces of the father and mother had a sober gladness the children laughed The eldest daughter was the image of Happiness at seventeen and the aged grandmother who sat knitting in the warmest place was the image of Happiness grown old They had found the herb heart s ease in the bleakest spot of all New England This family were situated in the Notch of the White Hills where the wind was sharp throughout the year and pitilessly cold in the winter giving their cottage all its fresh inclemency before it descended on the valley of the Saco They dwelt in a cold spot and a dangerous one for a mountain towered above their heads so steep that the stones would often rumble down its sides and startle them at midnight The daughter had just uttered some simple jest that filled them all with mirth when the wind came through the Notch and seemed to pause before their cottage rattling the door with a sound of wailing and lamentation before it passed into the valley For a moment it saddened them though there was nothing unusual in the tones But the family were glad again when they perceived that the latch was lifted by some traveller whose footsteps had been unheard amid the dreary blast which heralded his approach and wailed as he was entering and went moaning away from the door Though they dwelt in such a solitude these people held daily converse with the world The romantic pass of the Notch is a great artery through which the life blood of internal commerce is continually throbbing between Maine on one side and the Green Mountains and the shores of the saint Lawrence on the other The stage coach always drew up before the door of the cottage The wayfarer with no companion but his staff paused here to exchange a word that the sense of loneliness might not utterly overcome him ere he could pass through the cleft of the mountain or reach the first house in the valley And here the teamster on his way to Portland market would put up for the night and if a bachelor might sit an hour beyond the usual bedtime and steal a kiss from the mountain maid at parting It was one of those primitive taverns where the traveller pays only for food and lodging but meets with a homely kindness beyond all price When the footsteps were heard therefore between the outer door and the inner one the whole family rose up grandmother children and all as if about to welcome some one who belonged to them and whose fate was linked with theirs The door was opened by a young man His face at first wore the melancholy expression almost despondency of one who travels a wild and bleak road at nightfall and alone but soon brightened up when he saw the kindly warmth of his reception He felt his heart spring forward to meet them all from the old woman who wiped a chair with her apron to the little child that held out its arms to him One glance and smile placed the stranger on a footing of innocent familiarity with the eldest daughter Ah this fire is the right thing cried he especially when there is such a pleasant circle round it I am quite benumbed for the Notch is just like the pipe of a great pair of bellows it has blown a terrible blast in my face all the way from Bartlett Then you are going toward Vermont said the master of the house as he helped to take a light knapsack off the young man s shoulders Yes to Burlington and far enough beyond replied he I meant to have been at Ethan Crawford s to night but a pedestrian lingers along such a road as this It is no matter for when I saw this good fire and all your cheerful faces I felt as if you had kindled it on purpose for me and were waiting my arrival So I shall sit down among you and make myself at home The frank hearted stranger had just drawn his chair to the fire when something like a heavy footstep was heard without rushing down the steep side of the mountain as with long and rapid strides and taking such a leap in passing the cottage as to strike the opposite precipice The family held their breath because they knew the sound and their guest held his by instinct The old mountain has thrown a stone at us for fear we should forget him said the landlord recovering himself He sometimes nods his head and threatens to come down but we are old neighbors and agree together pretty well upon the whole Besides we have a sure place of refuge hard by if he should be coming in good earnest Let us now suppose the stranger to have finished his supper of bear s meat and by his natural felicity of manner to have placed himself on a footing of kindness with the whole family so that they talked as freely together as if he belonged to their mountain brood He was of a proud yet gentle spirit haughty and reserved among the rich and great but ever ready to stoop his head to the lowly cottage door and be like a brother or a son at the poor man s fireside In the household of the Notch he found warmth and simplicity of feeling the pervading intelligence of New England and a poetry of native growth which they had gathered when they little thought of it from the mountain peaks and chasms and at the very threshold of their romantic and dangerous abode He had travelled far and alone his whole life indeed had been a solitary path for with the lofty caution of his nature he had kept himself apart from those who might otherwise have been his companions The family too though so kind and hospitable had that consciousness of unity among themselves and separation from the world at large which in every domestic circle should still keep a holy place where no stranger may intrude But this evening a prophetic sympathy impelled the refined and educated youth to pour out his heart before the simple mountaineers and constrained them to answer him with the same free confidence And thus it should have been Is not the kindred of a common fate a closer tie than that of birth The secret of the young man s character was a high and abstracted ambition He could have borne to live an undistinguished life but not to be forgotten in the grave Yearning desire had been transformed to hope and hope long cherished had become like certainty that obscurely as he journeyed now a glory was to beam on all his pathway though not perhaps while he was treading it But when posterity should gaze back into the gloom of what was now the present they would trace the brightness of his footsteps brightening as meaner glories faded and confess that a gifted one had passed from his cradle to his tomb with none to recognize him As yet cried the stranger his cheek glowing and his eye flashing with enthusiasm as yet I have done nothing Were I to vanish from the earth to morrow none would know so much of me as you that a nameless youth came up at nightfall from the valley of the Saco and opened his heart to you in the evening and passed through the Notch by sunrise and was seen no more Not a soul would ask Who was he Whither did the wanderer go But I cannot die till I have achieved my destiny Then let Death come I shall have built my monument There was a continual flow of natural emotion gushing forth amid abstracted reverie which enabled the family to understand this young man s sentiments though so foreign from their own With quick sensibility of the ludicrous he blushed at the ardor into which he had been betrayed You laugh at me said he taking the eldest daughter s hand and laughing himself You think my ambition as nonsensical as if I were to freeze myself to death on the top of Mount Washington only that people might spy at me from the country roundabout And truly that would be a noble pedestal for a man s statue It is better to sit here by this fire answered the girl blushing and be comfortable and contented though nobody thinks about us I suppose said her father after a fit of musing there is something natural in what the young man says and if my mind had been turned that way I might have felt just the same It is strange wife how his talk has set my head running on things that are pretty certain never to come to pass Perhaps they may observed the wife Is the man thinking what he will do when he is a widower No no cried he repelling the idea with reproachful kindness When I think of your death Esther I think of mine too But I was wishing we had a good farm in Bartlett or Bethlehem or Littleton or some other township round the White Mountains but not where they could tumble on our heads I should want to stand well with my neighbors and be called squire and sent to General Court for a term or two for a plain honest man may do as much good there as a lawyer And when I should be grown quite an old man and you an old woman so as not to be long apart I might die happy enough in my bed and leave you all crying around me A slate gravestone would suit me as well as a marble one with just my name and age and a verse of a hymn and something to let people know that I lived an honest man and died a Christian There now exclaimed the stranger it is our nature to desire a monument be it slate or marble or a pillar of granite or a glorious memory in the universal heart of man We re in a strange way to night said the wife with tears in her eyes They say it s a sign of something when folks minds go a wandering so Hark to the children They listened accordingly The younger children had been put to bed in another room but with an open door between so that they could be heard talking busily among themselves One and all seemed to have caught the infection from the fireside circle and were outvying each other in wild wishes and childish projects of what they would do when they came to be men and women At length a little boy instead of addressing his brothers and sisters called out to his mother I ll tell you what I wish mother cried he I want you and father and grandma m and all of us and the stranger too to start right away and go and take a drink out of the basin of the Flume Nobody could help laughing at the child s notion of leaving a warm bed and dragging them from a cheerful fire to visit the basin of the Flume a brook which tumbles over the precipice deep within the Notch The boy had hardly spoken when a wagon rattled along the road and stopped a moment before the door It appeared to contain two or three men who were cheering their hearts with the rough chorus of a song which resounded in broken notes between the cliffs while the singers hesitated whether to continue their journey or put up here for the night Father said the girl they are calling you by name But the good man doubted whether they had really called him and was unwilling to show himself too solicitous of gain by inviting people to patronize his house He therefore did not hurry to the door and the lash being soon applied the travellers plunged into the Notch still singing and laughing though their music and mirth came back drearily from the heart of the mountain There mother cried the boy again they d have given us a ride to the Flume Again they laughed at the child s pertinacious fancy for a night ramble But it happened that a light cloud passed over the daughter s spirit she looked gravely into the fire and drew a breath that was almost a sigh It forced its way in spite of a little struggle to repress it Then starting and blushing she looked quickly around the circle as if they had caught a glimpse into her bosom The stranger asked what she had been thinking of Nothing answered she with a downcast smile only I felt lonesome just then Oh I have always had a gift of feeling what is in other people s hearts said he half seriously Shall I tell the secrets of yours For I know what to think when a young girl shivers by a warm hearth and complains of lonesomeness at her mother s side Shall I put these feelings into words They would not be a girl s feelings any longer if they could be put into words replied the mountain nymph laughing but avoiding his eye All this was said apart Perhaps a germ of love was springing in their hearts so pure that it might blossom in Paradise since it could not be matured on earth for women worship such gentle dignity as his and the proud contemplative yet kindly soul is oftenest captivated by simplicity like hers But while they spoke softly and he was watching the happy sadness the lightsome shadows the shy yearnings of a maiden s nature the wind through the Notch took a deeper and drearier sound It seemed as the fanciful stranger said like the choral strain of the spirits of the blast who in old Indian times had their dwelling among these mountains and made their heights and recesses a sacred region There was a wail along the road as if a funeral were passing To chase away the gloom the family threw pine branches on their fire till the dry leaves crackled and the flame arose discovering once again a scene of peace and humble happiness The light hovered about them fondly and caressed them all There were the little faces of the children peeping from their bed apart and here the father s frame of strength the mother s subdued and careful mien the high browed youth the budding girl and the good old grandam still knitting in the warmest place The aged woman looked up from her task and with fingers ever busy was the next to speak Old folks have their notions said she as well as young ones You ve been wishing and planning and letting your heads run on one thing and another till you ve set my mind a wandering too Now what should an old woman wish for when she can go but a step or two before she comes to her grave Children it will haunt me night and day till I tell you What is it mother cried the husband and wife at once Then the old woman with an air of mystery which drew the circle closer round the fire informed them that she had provided her grave clothes some years before a nice linen shroud a cap with a muslin ruff and everything of a finer sort than she had worn since her wedding day But this evening an old superstition had strangely recurred to her It used to be said in her younger days that if anything were amiss with a corpse if only the ruff were not smooth or the cap did not set right the corpse in the coffin and beneath the clods would strive to put up its cold hands and arrange it The bare thought made her nervous Don t talk so grandmother said the girl shuddering Now continued the old woman with singular earnestness yet smiling strangely at her own folly I want one of you my children when your mother is dressed and in the coffin I want one of you to hold a looking glass over my face Who knows but I may take a glimpse at myself and see whether all s right Old and young we dream of graves and monuments murmured the stranger youth I wonder how mariners feel when the ship is sinking and they unknown and undistinguished are to be buried together in the ocean that wide and nameless sepulchre For a moment the old woman s ghastly conception so engrossed the minds of her hearers that a sound abroad in the night rising like the roar of a blast had grown broad deep and terrible before the fated group were conscious of it The house and all within it trembled the foundations of the earth seemed to be shaken as if this awful sound were the peal of the last trump Young and old exchanged one wild glance and remained an instant pale affrighted without utterance or power to move Then the same shriek burst simultaneously from all their lips The slide The slide The simplest words must intimate but not portray the unutterable horror of the catastrophe The victims rushed from their cottage and sought refuge in what they deemed a safer spot where in contemplation of such an emergency a sort of barrier had been reared Alas they had quitted their security and fled right into the pathway of destruction Down came the whole side of the mountain in a cataract of ruin Just before it reached the house the stream broke into two branches shivered not a window there but overwhelmed the whole vicinity blocked up the road and annihilated everything in its dreadful course Long ere the thunder of that great slide had ceased to roar among the mountains the mortal agony had been endured and the victims were at peace Their bodies were never found The next morning the light smoke was seen stealing from the cottage chimney up the mountain side Within the fire was yet smouldering on the hearth and the chairs in a circle round it as if the inhabitants had but gone forth to view the devastation of the slide and would shortly return to thank Heaven for their miraculous escape All had left separate tokens by which those who had known the family were made to shed a tear for each Who has not heard their name The story has been told far and wide and will for ever be a legend of these mountains Poets have sung their fate There were circumstances which led some to suppose that a stranger had been received into the cottage on this awful night and had shared the catastrophe of all its inmates others denied that there were sufficient grounds for such a conjecture Woe for the high souled youth with his dream of earthly immortality His name and person utterly unknown his history his way of life his plans a mystery never to be solved his death and his existence equally a doubt whose was the agony of that death moment THE SISTER YEARS Last night between eleven and twelve o clock when the Old Year was leaving her final footprints on the borders of Time s empire she found herself in possession of a few spare moments and sat down of all places in the world on the steps of our new city hall The wintry moonlight showed that she looked weary of body and sad of heart like many another wayfarer of earth Her garments having been exposed to much foul weather and rough usage were in very ill condition and as the hurry of her journey had never before allowed her to take an instant s rest her shoes were so worn as to be scarcely worth the mending But after trudging only a little distance farther this poor Old Year was destined to enjoy a long long sleep I forgot to mention that when she seated herself on the steps she deposited by her side a very capacious bandbox in which as is the custom among travellers of her sex she carried a great deal of valuable property Besides this luggage there was a folio book under her arm very much resembling the annual volume of a newspaper Placing this volume across her knees and resting her elbows upon it with her forehead in her hands the weary bedraggled world worn Old Year heaved a heavy sigh and appeared to be taking no very pleasant retrospect of her past existence While she thus awaited the midnight knell that was to summon her to the innumerable sisterhood of departed years there came a young maiden treading lightsomely on tip toe along the street from the direction of the railroad depot She was evidently a stranger and perhaps had come to town by the evening train of cars There was a smiling cheerfulness in this fair maiden s face which bespoke her fully confident of a kind reception from the multitude of people with whom she was soon to form acquaintance Her dress was rather too airy for the season and was bedizened with fluttering ribbons and other vanities which were likely soon to be rent away by the fierce storms or to fade in the hot sunshine amid which she was to pursue her changeful course But still she was a wonderfully pleasant looking figure and had so much promise and such an indescribable hopefulness in her aspect that hardly anybody could meet her without anticipating some very desirable thing the consummation of some long sought good from her kind offices A few dismal characters there may be here and there about the world who have so often been trifled with by young maidens as promising as she that they have now ceased to pin any faith upon the skirts of the New Year But for my own part I have great faith in her and should I live to see fifty more such still from each of those successive sisters I shall reckon upon receiving something that will be worth living for The New Year for this young maiden was no less a personage carried all her goods and chattels in a basket of no great size or weight which hung upon her arm She greeted the disconsolate Old Year with great affection and sat down beside her on the steps of the city hall waiting for the signal to begin her rambles through the world The two were own sisters being both granddaughters of Time and though one looked so much older than the other it was rather owing to hardships and trouble than to age since there was but a twelvemonth s difference between them Well my dear sister said the New Year after the first salutations you look almost tired to death What have you been about during your sojourn in this part of infinite space Oh I have it all recorded here in my book of chronicles answered the Old Year in a heavy tone There is nothing that would amuse you and you will soon get sufficient knowledge of such matters from your own personal experience It is but tiresome reading Nevertheless she turned over the leaves of the folio and glanced at them by the light of the moon feeling an irresistible spell of interest in her own biography although its incidents were remembered without pleasure The volume though she termed it her book of chronicles seemed to be neither more nor less than the Salem Gazette for eighteen thirty eight in the accuracy of which journal this sagacious Old Year had so much confidence that she deemed it needless to record her history with her own pen What have you been doing in the political way asked the New Year Why my course here in the United States said the Old Year though perhaps I ought to blush at the confession my political course I must acknowledge has been rather vacillatory sometimes inclining toward the Whigs then causing the administration party to shout for triumph and now again uplifting what seemed the almost prostrate banner of the opposition so that historians will hardly know what to make of me in this respect But the Loco Focos I do not like these party nicknames interrupted her sister who seemed remarkably touchy about some points Perhaps we shall part in better humor if we avoid any political discussion With all my heart replied the Old Year who had already been tormented half to death with squabbles of this kind I care not if the name of Whig or Tory with their interminable brawls about banks and the sub treasury abolition Texas the Florida war and a million of other topics which you will learn soon enough for your own comfort I care not I say if no whisper of these matters ever reaches my ears again Yet they have occupied so large a share of my attention that I scarcely know what else to tell you There has indeed been a curious sort of war on the Canada border where blood has streamed in the names of liberty and patriotism but it must remain for some future perhaps far distant year to tell whether or no those holy names have been rightfully invoked Nothing so much depresses me in my view of mortal affairs as to see high energies wasted and human life and happiness thrown away for ends that appear oftentimes unwise and still oftener remain unaccomplished But the wisest people and the best keep a steadfast faith that the progress of mankind is onward and upward and that the toil and anguish of the path serve to wear away the imperfections of the immortal pilgrim and will be felt no more when they have done their office Perhaps cried the hopeful New Year perhaps I shall see that happy day I doubt whether it be so close at hand answered the Old Year gravely smiling You will soon grow weary of looking for that blessed consummation and will turn for amusement as has frequently been my own practice to the affairs of some sober little city like this of Salem Here we sit on the steps of the new city hall which has been completed under my administration and it would make you laugh to see how the game of politics of which the Capitol at Washington is the great chess board is here played in miniature Burning Ambition finds its fuel here here patriotism speaks boldly in the people s behalf and virtuous economy demands retrenchment in the emoluments of a lamplighter here the aldermen range their senatorial dignity around the mayor s chair of state and the common council feel that they have liberty in charge In short human weakness and strength passion and policy man s tendencies his aims and modes of pursuing them his individual character and his character in the mass may be studied almost as well here as on the theatre of nations and with this great advantage that be the lesson ever so disastrous its Liliputian scope still makes the beholder smile Have you done much for the improvement of the city asked the New Year Judging from what little I have seen it appears to be ancient and time worn I have opened the railroad said the elder Year and half a dozen times a day you will hear the bell which once summoned the monks of a Spanish convent to their devotions announcing the arrival or departure of the cars Old Salem now wears a much livelier expression than when I first beheld her Strangers rumble down from Boston by hundreds at a time New faces throng in Essex street Railroad hacks and omnibuses rattle over the pavements There is a perceptible increase of oyster shops and other establishments for the accommodation of a transitory diurnal multitude But a more important change awaits the venerable town An immense accumulation of musty prejudices will be carried off by the free circulation of society A peculiarity of character of which the inhabitants themselves are hardly sensible will be rubbed down and worn away by the attrition of foreign substances Much of the result will be good there will likewise be a few things not so good Whether for better or worse there will be a probable diminution of the moral influence of wealth and the sway of an aristocratic class which from an era far beyond my memory has held firmer dominion here than in any other New England town The Old Year having talked away nearly all of her little remaining breath now closed her book of chronicles and was about to take her departure but her sister detained her a while longer by inquiring the contents of the huge bandbox which she was so painfully lugging along with her These are merely a few trifles replied the Old Year which I have picked up in my rambles and am going to deposit in the receptacle of things past and forgotten We sisterhood of years never carry anything really valuable out of the world with us Here are patterns of most of the fashions which I brought into vogue and which have already lived out their allotted term you will supply their place with others equally ephemeral Here put up in little china pots like rouge is a considerable lot of beautiful women s bloom which the disconsolate fair ones owe me a bitter grudge for stealing I have likewise a quantity of men s dark hair instead of which I have left gray locks or none at all The tears of widows and other afflicted mortals who have received comfort during the last twelve months are preserved in some dozens of essence bottles well corked and sealed I have several bundles of love letters eloquently breathing an eternity of burning passion which grew cold and perished almost before the ink was dry Moreover here is an assortment of many thousand broken promises and other broken ware all very light and packed into little space The heaviest articles in my possession are a large parcel of disappointed hopes which a little while ago were buoyant enough to have inflated mister Lauriat s balloon I have a fine lot of hopes here in my basket remarked the New Year They are a sweet smelling flower a species of rose They soon lose their perfume replied the sombre Old Year What else have you brought to insure a welcome from the discontented race of mortals Why to say the truth little or nothing else said her sister with a smile save a few new Annuals and almanacs and some New Year s gifts for the children But I heartily wish well to poor mortals and mean to do all I can for their improvement and happiness It is a good resolution rejoined the Old Year And by the way I have a plentiful assortment of good resolutions which have now grown so stale and musty that I am ashamed to carry them any farther Only for fear that the city authorities would send Constable Mansfield with a warrant after me I should toss them into the street at once Many other matters go to make up the contents of my bandbox but the whole lot would not fetch a single bid even at an auction of worn out furniture and as they are worth nothing either to you or anybody else I need not trouble you with a longer catalogue And must I also pick up such worthless luggage in my travels asked the New Year Most certainly and well if you have no heavier load to bear replied the other And now my dear sister I must bid you farewell earnestly advising and exhorting you to expect no gratitude nor good will from this peevish unreasonable inconsiderate ill intending and worse behaving world However warmly its inhabitants may seem to welcome you yet do what you may and lavish on them what means of happiness you please they will still be complaining still craving what it is not in your power to give still looking forward to some other year for the accomplishment of projects which ought never to have been formed and which if successful would only provide new occasions of discontent If these ridiculous people ever see anything tolerable in you it will be after you are gone for ever But I cried the fresh hearted New Year I shall try to leave men wiser than I find them I will offer them freely whatever good gifts Providence permits me to distribute and will tell them to be thankful for what they have and humbly hopeful for more and surely if they are not absolute fools they will condescend to be happy and will allow me to be a happy year For my happiness must depend on them Alas for you then my poor sister said the Old Year sighing as she uplifted her burden We grandchildren of Time are born to trouble Happiness they say dwells in the mansions of eternity but we can only lead mortals thither step by step with reluctant murmurings and ourselves must perish on the threshold But hark my task is done The clock in the tall steeple of doctor Emerson s church struck twelve there was a response from doctor Flint s in the opposite quarter of the city and while the strokes were yet dropping into the air the Old Year either flitted or faded away and not the wisdom and might of angels to say nothing of the remorseful yearnings of the millions who had used her ill could have prevailed with that departed year to return one step But she in the company of Time and all her kindred must hereafter hold a reckoning with mankind So shall it be likewise with the maidenly New Year who as the clock ceased to strike arose from the steps of the city hall and set out rather timorously on her earthly course A happy New Year cried a watchman eying her figure very questionably but without the least suspicion that he was addressing the New Year in person Thank you kindly said the New Year and she gave the watchman one of the roses of hope from her basket May this flower keep a sweet smell long after I have bidden you good bye Then she stepped on more briskly through the silent streets and such as were awake at the moment heard her footfall and said The New Year is come Wherever there was a knot of midnight roisterers they quaffed her health She sighed however to perceive that the air was tainted as the atmosphere of this world must continually be with the dying breaths of mortals who had lingered just long enough for her to bury them But there were millions left alive to rejoice at her coming and so she pursued her way with confidence strewing emblematic flowers on the doorstep of almost every dwelling which some persons will gather up and wear in their bosoms and others will trample under foot The carrier boy can only say further that early this morning she filled his basket with New Year s addresses assuring him that the whole city with our new mayor and the aldermen and common council at its head would make a general rush to secure copies Kind patrons will not you redeem the pledge of the New Year SNOWFLAKES There is snow in yonder cold gray sky of the morning and through the partially frosted window panes I love to watch the gradual beginning of the storm A few feathery flakes are scattered widely through the air and hover downward with uncertain flight now almost alighting on the earth now whirled again aloft into remote regions of the atmosphere These are not the big flakes heavy with moisture which melt as they touch the ground and are portentous of a soaking rain It is to be in good earnest a wintry storm The two or three people visible on the sidewalks have an aspect of endurance a blue nosed frosty fortitude which is evidently assumed in anticipation of a comfortless and blustering day By nightfall or at least before the sun sheds another glimmering smile upon us the street and our little garden will be heaped with mountain snowdrifts The soil already frozen for weeks past is prepared to sustain whatever burden may be laid upon it and to a Northern eye the landscape will lose its melancholy bleakness and acquire a beauty of its own when Mother Earth like her children shall have put on the fleecy garb of her winter s wear The cloud spirits are slowly weaving her white mantle As yet indeed there is barely a rime like hoar frost over the brown surface of the street the withered green of the grass plat is still discernible and the slated roofs of the houses do but begin to look gray instead of black All the snow that has yet fallen within the circumference of my view were it heaped up together would hardly equal the hillock of a grave Thus gradually by silent and stealthy influences are great changes wrought These little snow particles which the storm spirit flings by handfuls through the air will bury the great Earth under their accumulated mass nor permit her to behold her sister Sky again for dreary months We likewise shall lose sight of our mother s familiar visage and must content ourselves with looking heavenward the oftener Now leaving the Storm to do his appointed office let us sit down pen in hand by our fireside Gloomy as it may seem there is an influence productive of cheerfulness and favorable to imaginative thought in the atmosphere of a snowy day The native of a Southern clime may woo the Muse beneath the heavy shade of summer foliage reclining on banks of turf while the sound of singing birds and warbling rivulets chimes in with the music of his soul In our brief summer I do not think but only exist in the vague enjoyment of a dream My hour of inspiration if that hour ever comes is when the green log hisses upon the hearth and the bright flame brighter for the gloom of the chamber rustles high up the chimney and the coals drop tinkling down among the growing heaps of ashes When the casement rattles in the gust and the snowflakes or the sleety raindrops pelt hard against the window panes then I spread out my sheet of paper with the certainty that thoughts and fancies will gleam forth upon it like stars at twilight or like violets in May perhaps to fade as soon However transitory their glow they at least shine amid the darksome shadow which the clouds of the outward sky fling through the room Blessed therefore and reverently welcomed by me her true born son be New England s winter which makes us one and all the nurslings of the storm and sings a familiar lullaby even in the wildest shriek of the December blast Now look we forth again and see how much of his task the storm spirit has done Slow and sure He has the day perchance the week before him and may take his own time to accomplish Nature s burial in snow A smooth mantle is scarcely yet thrown over the withered grass plat and the dry stalks of annuals still thrust themselves through the white surface in all parts of the garden The leafless rose bushes stand shivering in a shallow snowdrift looking poor things as disconsolate as if they possessed a human consciousness of the dreary scene This is a sad time for the shrubs that do not perish with the summer They neither live nor die what they retain of life seems but the chilling sense of death Very sad are the flower shrubs in midwinter The roofs of the houses are now all white save where the eddying wind has kept them bare at the bleak corners To discern the real intensity of the storm we must fix upon some distant object as yonder spire and observe how the riotous gust fights with the descending snow throughout the intervening space Sometimes the entire prospect is obscured then again we have a distinct but transient glimpse of the tall steeple like a giant s ghost and now the dense wreaths sweep between as if demons were flinging snowdrifts at each other in mid air Look next into the street where we have an amusing parallel to the combat of those fancied demons in the upper regions It is a snow battle of schoolboys What a pretty satire on war and military glory might be written in the form of a child s story by describing the snow ball fights of two rival schools the alternate defeats and victories of each and the final triumph of one party or perhaps of neither What pitched battles worthy to be chanted in Homeric strains What storming of fortresses built all of massive snow blocks What feats of individual prowess and embodied onsets of martial enthusiasm And when some well contested and decisive victory had put a period to the war both armies should unite to build a lofty monument of snow upon the battlefield and crown it with the victor s statue hewn of the same frozen marble In a few days or weeks thereafter the passer by would observe a shapeless mound upon the level common and unmindful of the famous victory would ask How came it there Who reared it And what means it The shattered pedestal of many a battle monument has provoked these questions when none could answer Turn we again to the fireside and sit musing there lending our ears to the wind till perhaps it shall seem like an articulate voice and dictate wild and airy matter for the pen Would it might inspire me to sketch out the personification of a New England winter And that idea if I can seize the snow wreathed figures that flit before my fancy shall be the theme of the next page How does Winter herald his approach By the shrieking blast of latter autumn which is Nature s cry of lamentation as the destroyer rushes among the shivering groves where she has lingered and scatters the sear leaves upon the tempest When that cry is heard the people wrap themselves in cloaks and shake their heads disconsolately saying Winter is at hand Then the axe of the woodcutter echoes sharp and diligently in the forest then the coal merchants rejoice because each shriek of Nature in her agony adds something to the price of coal per ton then the peat smoke spreads its aromatic fragrance through the atmosphere A few days more and at eventide the children look out of the window and dimly perceive the flaunting of a snowy mantle in the air It is stern Winter s vesture They crowd around the hearth and cling to their mother s gown or press between their father s knees affrighted by the hollow roaring voice that bellows adown the wide flue of the chimney It is the voice of Winter and when parents and children hear it they shudder and exclaim Winter is come Cold Winter has begun his reign already Now throughout New England each hearth becomes an altar sending up the smoke of a continued sacrifice to the immitigable deity who tyrannizes over forest country side and town Wrapped in his white mantle his staff a huge icicle his beard and hair a wind tossed snowdrift he travels over the land in the midst of the northern blast and woe to the homeless wanderer whom he finds upon his path There he lies stark and stiff a human shape of ice on the spot where Winter overtook him On strides the tyrant over the rushing rivers and broad lakes which turn to rock beneath his footsteps His dreary empire is established all around stretches the desolation of the pole Yet not ungrateful be his New England children for Winter is our sire though a stern and rough one not ungrateful even for the severities which have nourished our unyielding strength of character And let us thank him too for the sleigh rides cheered by the music of merry bells for the crackling and rustling hearth when the ruddy firelight gleams on hardy manhood and the blooming cheek of woman for all the home enjoyments and the kindred virtues which flourish in a frozen soil Not that we grieve when after some seven months of storm and bitter frost Spring in the guise of a flower crowned virgin is seen driving away the hoary despot pelting him with violets by the handful and strewing green grass on the path behind him Often ere he will give up his empire old Winter rushes fiercely buck and hurls a snowdrift at the shrinking form of Spring yet step by step he is compelled to retreat northward and spends the summer month within the Arctic circle Such fantasies intermixed among graver toils of mind have made the winter s day pass pleasantly Meanwhile the storm has raged without abatement and now as the brief afternoon declines is tossing denser volumes to and fro about the atmosphere On the window sill there is a layer of snow reaching halfway up the lowest pane of glass The garden is one unbroken bed Along the street are two or three spots of uncovered earth where the gust has whirled away the snow heaping it elsewhere to the fence tops or piling huge banks against the doors of houses A solitary passenger is seen now striding mid leg deep across a drift now scudding over the bare ground while his cloak is swollen with the wind And now the jingling of bells a sluggish sound responsive to the horse s toilsome progress through the unbroken drifts announces the passage of a sleigh with a boy clinging behind and ducking his head to escape detection by the driver Next comes a sledge laden with wood for some unthrifty housekeeper whom winter has surprised at a cold hearth But what dismal equipage now struggles along the uneven street A sable hearse bestrewn with snow is bearing a dead man through the storm to his frozen bed Oh how dreary is a burial in winter when the bosom of Mother Earth has no warmth for her poor child Evening the early eve of December begins to spread its deepening veil over the comfortless scene The firelight gradually brightens and throws my flickering shadow upon the walls and ceiling of the chamber but still the storm rages and rattles against the windows Alas I shiver and think it time to be disconsolate but taking a farewell glance at dead Nature in her shroud I perceive a flock of snowbirds skimming lightsomely through the tempest and flitting from drift to drift as sportively as swallows in the delightful prime of summer Whence come they Where do they build their nests and seek their food Why having airy wings do they not follow summer around the earth instead of making themselves the playmates of the storm and fluttering on the dreary verge of the winter s eve I know not whence they come nor why yet my spirit has been cheered by that wandering flock of snow birds THE SEVEN VAGABONDS Rambling on foot in the spring of my life and the summer of the year I came one afternoon to a point which gave me the choice of three directions Straight before me the main road extended its dusty length to Boston on the left a branch went toward the sea and would have lengthened my journey a trifle of twenty or thirty miles while by the right hand path I might have gone over hills and lakes to Canada visiting in my way the celebrated town of Stamford On a level spot of grass at the foot of the guide post appeared an object which though locomotive on a different principle reminded me of Gulliver s portable mansion among the Brobdignags It was a huge covered wagon or more properly a small house on wheels with a door on one side and a window shaded by green blinds on the other Two horses munching provender out of the baskets which muzzled them were fastened near the vehicle A delectable sound of music proceeded from the interior and I immediately conjectured that this was some itinerant show halting at the confluence of the roads to intercept such idle travellers as myself A shower had long been climbing up the western sky and now hung so blackly over my onward path that it was a point of wisdom to seek shelter here Halloo Who stands guard here Is the doorkeeper asleep cried I approaching a ladder of two or three steps which was let down from the wagon The music ceased at my summons and there appeared at the door not the sort of figure that I had mentally assigned to the wandering showman but a most respectable old personage whom I was sorry to have addressed in so free a style He wore a snuff colored coat and small clothes with white top boots and exhibited the mild dignity of aspect and manner which may often be noticed in aged schoolmasters and sometimes in deacons selectmen or other potentates of that kind A small piece of silver was my passport within his premises where I found only one other person hereafter to be described This is a dull day for business said the old gentleman as he ushered me in but I merely tarry here to refresh the cattle being bound for the camp meeting at Stamford Perhaps the movable scene of this narrative is still peregrinating New England and may enable the reader to test the accuracy of my description The spectacle for I will not use the unworthy term of puppet show consisted of a multitude of little people assembled on a miniature stage Among them were artisans of every kind in the attitudes of their toil and a group of fair ladies and gay gentlemen standing ready for the dance a company of foot soldiers formed a line across the stage looking stern grim and terrible enough to make it a pleasant consideration that they were but three inches high and conspicuous above the whole was seen a Merry Andrew in the pointed cap and motley coat of his profession All the inhabitants of this mimic world were motionless like the figures in a picture or like that people who one moment were alive in the midst of their business and delights and the next were transformed to statues preserving an eternal semblance of labor that was ended and pleasure that could be felt no more Anon however the old gentleman turned the handle of a barrel organ the first note of which produced a most enlivening effect upon the figures and awoke them all to their proper occupations and amusements By the selfsame impulse the tailor plied his needle the blacksmith s hammer descended upon the anvil and the dancers whirled away on feathery tiptoes the company of soldiers broke into platoons retreated from the stage and were succeeded by a troop of horse who came prancing onward with such a sound of trumpets and trampling of hoofs as might have startled Don Quixote himself while an old toper of inveterate ill habits uplifted his black bottle and took off a hearty swig Meantime the Merry Andrew began to caper and turn somersets shaking his sides nodding his head and winking his eyes in as lifelike a manner as if he were ridiculing the nonsense of all human affairs and making fun of the whole multitude beneath him At length the old magician for I compared the showman to Prospero entertaining his guests with a masque of shadows paused that I might give utterance to my wonder What an admirable piece of work is this exclaimed I lifting up my hands in astonishment Indeed I liked the spectacle and was tickled with the old man s gravity as he presided at it for I had none of that foolish wisdom which reproves every occupation that is not useful in this world of vanities If there be a faculty which I possess more perfectly than most men it is that of throwing myself mentally into situations foreign to my own and detecting with a cheerful eye the desirable circumstances of each I could have envied the life of this gray headed showman spent as it had been in a course of safe and pleasurable adventure in driving his huge vehicle sometimes through the sands of Cape Cod and sometimes over the rough forest roads of the north and east and halting now on the green before a village meeting house and now in a paved square of the metropolis How often must his heart have been gladdened by the delight of children as they viewed these animated figures or his pride indulged by haranguing learnedly to grown men on the mechanical powers which produced such wonderful effects or his gallantry brought into play for this is an attribute which such grave men do not lack by the visits of pretty maidens And then with how fresh a feeling must he return at intervals to his own peculiar home I would I were assured of as happy a life as his thought I Though the showman s wagon might have accommodated fifteen or twenty spectators it now contained only himself and me and a third person at whom I threw a glance on entering He was a neat and trim young man of two or three and twenty his drab hat and green frock coat with velvet collar were smart though no longer new while a pair of green spectacles that seemed needless to his brisk little eyes gave him something of a scholar like and literary air After allowing me a sufficient time to inspect the puppets he advanced with a bow and drew my attention to some books in a corner of the wagon These he forthwith began to extol with an amazing volubility of well sounding words and an ingenuity of praise that won him my heart as being myself one of the most merciful of critics Indeed his stock required some considerable powers of commendation in the salesman There were several ancient friends of mine the novels of those happy days when my affections wavered between the Scottish Chiefs and Thomas Thumb besides a few of later date whose merits had not been acknowledged by the public I was glad to find that dear little venerable volume the New England Primer looking as antique as ever though in its thousandth new edition a bundle of superannuated gilt picture books made such a child of me that partly for the glittering covers and partly for the fairy tales within I bought the whole and an assortment of ballads and popular theatrical songs drew largely on my purse To balance these expenditures I meddled neither with sermons nor science nor morality though volumes of each were there nor with a Life of Franklin in the coarsest of paper but so showily bound that it was emblematical of the doctor himself in the court dress which he refused to wear at Paris nor with Webster s spelling book nor some of Byron s minor poems nor half a dozen little Testaments at twenty five cents each Thus far the collection might have been swept from some great bookstore or picked up at an evening auction room but there was one small blue covered pamphlet which the pedler handed me with so peculiar an air that I purchased it immediately at his own price and then for the first time the thought struck me that I had spoken face to face with the veritable author of a printed book The literary man now evinced a great kindness for me and I ventured to inquire which way he was travelling Oh said he I keep company with this old gentlemen here and we are moving now toward the camp meeting at Stamford He then explained to me that for the present season he had rented a corner of the wagon as a book store which as he wittily observed was a true circulating library since there were few parts of the country where it had not gone its rounds I approved of the plan exceedingly and began to sum up within my mind the many uncommon felicities in the life of a book pedler especially when his character resembled that of the individual before me At a high rate was to be reckoned the daily and hourly enjoyment of such interviews as the present in which he seized upon the admiration of a passing stranger and made him aware that a man of literary taste and even of literary achievement was travelling the country in a showman s wagon A more valuable yet not infrequent triumph might be won in his conversations with some elderly clergyman long vegetating in a rocky woody watery back settlement of New England who as he recruited his library from the pedler s stock of sermons would exhort him to seek a college education and become the first scholar in his class Sweeter and prouder yet would be his sensations when talking poetry while he sold spelling books he should charm the mind and haply touch the heart of a fair country schoolmistress herself an unhonored poetess a wearer of blue stockings which none but himself took pains to look at But the scene of his completest glory would be when the wagon had halted for the night and his stock of books was transferred to some crowded bar room Then would he recommend to the multifarious company whether traveller from the city or teamster from the hills or neighboring squire or the landlord himself or his loutish hostler works suited to each particular taste and capacity proving all the while by acute criticism and profound remark that the lore in his books was even exceeded by that in his brain Thus happily would he traverse the land sometimes a herald before the march of Mind sometimes walking arm in arm with awful Literature and reaping everywhere a harvest of real and sensible popularity which the secluded bookworms by whose toil he lived could never hope for If ever I meddle with literature thought I fixing myself in adamantine resolution it shall be as a travelling bookseller Though it was still mid afternoon the air had now grown dark about us and a few drops of rain came down upon the roof of our vehicle pattering like the feet of birds that had flown thither to rest A sound of pleasant voices made us listen and there soon appeared halfway up the ladder the pretty person of a young damsel whose rosy face was so cheerful that even amid the gloomy light it seemed as if the sunbeams were peeping under her bonnet We next saw the dark and handsome features of a young man who with easier gallantry than might have been expected in the heart of Yankee land was assisting her into the wagon It became immediately evident to us when the two strangers stood within the door that they were of a profession kindred to those of my companions and I was delighted with the more than hospitable the even paternal kindness of the old showman s manner as he welcomed them while the man of literature hastened to lead the merry eyed girl to a seat on the long bench You are housed but just in time my young friends said the master of the wagon the sky would have been down upon you within five minutes The young man s reply marked him as a foreigner not by any variation from the idiom and accent of good English but because he spoke with more caution and accuracy than if perfectly familiar with the language We knew that a shower was hanging over us said he and consulted whether it were best to enter the house on the top of yonder hill but seeing your wagon in the road We agreed to come hither interrupted the girl with a smile because we should be more at home in a wandering house like this I meanwhile with many a wild and undetermined fantasy was narrowly inspecting these two doves that had flown into our ark The young man tall agile and athletic wore a mass of black shining curls clustering round a dark and vivacious countenance which if it had not greater expression was at least more active and attracted readier notice than the quiet faces of our countrymen At his first appearance he had been laden with a neat mahogany box of about two feet square but very light in proportion to its size which he had immediately unstrapped from his shoulders and deposited on the floor of the wagon The girl had nearly as fair a complexion as our own beauties and a brighter one than most of them the lightness of her figure which seemed calculated to traverse the whole world without weariness suited well with the glowing cheerfulness of her face and her gay attire combining the rainbow hues of crimson green and a deep orange was as proper to her lightsome aspect as if she had been born in it This gay stranger was appropriately burdened with that mirth inspiring instrument the fiddle which her companion took from her hands and shortly began the process of tuning Neither of us the previous company of the wagon needed to inquire their trade for this could be no mystery to frequenters of brigade musters ordinations cattle shows commencements and other festal meetings in our sober land and there is a dear friend of mine who will smile when this page recalls to his memory a chivalrous deed performed by us in rescuing the show box of such a couple from a mob of great double fisted countrymen Come said I to the damsel of gay attire shall we visit all the wonders of the world together She understood the metaphor at once though indeed it would not much have troubled me if she had assented to the literal meaning of my words The mahogany box was placed in a proper position and I peeped in through its small round magnifying window while the girl sat by my side and gave short descriptive sketches as one after another the pictures were unfolded to my view We visited together at least our imaginations did full many a famous city in the streets of which I had long yearned to tread Once I remember we were in the harbor of Barcelona gazing townward next she bore me through the air to Sicily and bade me look up at blazing AEtna then we took wing to Venice and sat in a gondola beneath the arch of the Rialto and anon she set me down among the thronged spectators at the coronation of Napoleon But there was one scene its locality she could not tell which charmed my attention longer than all those gorgeous palaces and churches because the fancy haunted me that I myself the preceding summer had beheld just such a humble meeting house in just such a pine surrounded nook among our own green mountains All these pictures were tolerably executed though far inferior to the girl s touches of description nor was it easy to comprehend how in so few sentences and these as I supposed in a language foreign to her she contrived to present an airy copy of each varied scene When we had travelled through the vast extent of the mahogany box I looked into my guide s face Where are you going my pretty maid inquired I in the words of an old song Ah said the gay damsel you might as well ask where the summer wind is going We are wanderers here and there and everywhere Wherever there is mirth our merry hearts are drawn to it To day indeed the people have told us of a great frolic and festival in these parts so perhaps we may be needed at what you call the camp meeting at Stamford Then in my happy youth and while her pleasant voice yet sounded in my ears I sighed for none but myself I thought should have been her companion in a life which seemed to realize my own wild fancies cherished all through visionary boyhood to that hour To these two strangers the world was in its Golden Age not that indeed it was less dark and sad than ever but because its weariness and sorrow had no community with their ethereal nature Wherever they might appear in their pilgrimage of bliss Youth would echo back their gladness care stricken Maturity would rest a moment from its toil and Age tottering among the graves would smile in withered joy for their sakes The lonely cot the narrow and gloomy street the sombre shade would catch a passing gleam like that now shining on ourselves as these bright spirits wandered by Blessed pair whose happy home was throughout all the earth I looked at my shoulders and thought them broad enough to sustain those pictured towns and mountains mine too was an elastic foot as tireless as the wing of the bird of Paradise mine was then an untroubled heart that would have gone singing on its delightful way Oh maiden said I aloud why did you not come hither alone While the merry girl and myself were busy with the show box the unceasing rain had driven another wayfarer into the wagon He seemed pretty nearly of the old showman s age but much smaller leaner and more withered than he and less respectably clad in a patched suit of gray withal he had a thin shrewd countenance and a pair of diminutive gray eyes which peeped rather too keenly out of their puckered sockets This old fellow had been joking with the showman in a manner which intimated previous acquaintance but perceiving that the damsel and I had terminated our affairs he drew forth a folded document and presented it to me As I had anticipated it proved to be a circular written in a very fair and legible hand and signed by several distinguished gentlemen whom I had never heard of stating that the bearer had encountered every variety of misfortune and recommending him to the notice of all charitable people Previous disbursements had left me no more than a five dollar bill out of which however I offered to make the beggar a donation provided he would give me change for it The object of my beneficence looked keenly in my face and discerned that I had none of that abominable spirit characteristic though it be of a full blooded Yankee which takes pleasure in detecting every little harmless piece of knavery Why perhaps said the ragged old mendicant if the bank is in good standing I can t say but I may have enough about me to change your bill It is a bill of the Suffolk Bank said I and better than the specie As the beggar had nothing to object he now produced a small buff leather bag tied up carefully with a shoe string When this was opened there appeared a very comfortable treasure of silver coins of all sorts and sizes and I even fancied that I saw gleaming among them the golden plumage of that rare bird in our currency the American eagle In this precious heap was my bank note deposited the rate of exchange being considerably against me His wants being thus relieved the destitute man pulled out of his pocket an old pack of greasy cards which had probably contributed to fill the buff leather bag in more ways than one Come said he I spy a rare fortune in your face and for twenty five cents more I ll tell you what it is I never refuse to take a glimpse into futurity so after shuffling the cards and when the fair damsel had cut them I dealt a portion to the prophetic beggar Like others of his profession before predicting the shadowy events that were moving on to meet me he gave proof of his preternatural science by describing scenes through which I had already passed Here let me have credit for a sober fact When the old man had read a page in his book of fate he bent his keen gray eyes on mine and proceeded to relate in all its minute particulars what was then the most singular event of my life It was one which I had no purpose to disclose till the general unfolding of all secrets nor would it be a much stranger instance of inscrutable knowledge or fortunate conjecture if the beggar were to meet me in the street today and repeat word for word the page which I have here written The fortune teller after predicting a destiny which time seems loth to make good put up his cards secreted his treasure bag and began to converse with the other occupants of the wagon Well old friend said the showman you have not yet told us which way your face is turned this afternoon I am taking a trip northward this warm weather replied the conjurer across the Connecticut first and then up through Vermont and maybe into Canada before the fall But I must stop and see the breaking up of the camp meeting at Stamford I began to think that all the vagrants in New England were converging to the camp meeting and had made this wagon their rendezvous by the way The showman now proposed that when the shower was over they should pursue the road to Stamford together it being sometimes the policy of these people to form a sort of league and confederacy And the young lady too observed the gallant bibliopolist bowing to her profoundly and this foreign gentleman as I understand are on a jaunt of pleasure to the same spot It would add incalculably to my own enjoyment and I presume to that of my colleague and his friend if they could be prevailed upon to join our party This arrangement met with approbation on all hands nor were any of those concerned more sensible of its advantages than myself who had no title to be included in it Having already satisfied myself as to the several modes in which the four others attained felicity I next set my mind at work to discover what enjoyments were peculiar to the old straggler as the people of the country would have termed the wandering mendicant and prophet As he pretended to familiarity with the devil so I fancied that he was fitted to pursue and take delight in his way of life by possessing some of the mental and moral characteristics the lighter and more comic ones of the devil in popular stories Among them might be reckoned a love of deception for its own sake a shrewd eye and keen relish for human weakness and ridiculous infirmity and the talent of petty fraud Thus to this old man there would be pleasure even in the consciousness so insupportable to some minds that his whole life was a cheat upon the world and that so far as he was concerned with the public his little cunning had the upper hand of its united wisdom Every day would furnish him with a succession of minute and pungent triumphs as when for instance his importunity wrung a pittance out of the heart of a miser or when my silly good nature transferred a part of my slender purse to his plump leather bag or when some ostentatious gentleman should throw a coin to the ragged beggar who was richer than himself or when though he would not always be so decidedly diabolical his pretended wants should make him a sharer in the scanty living of real indigence And then what an inexhaustible field of enjoyment both as enabling him to discern so much folly and achieve such quantities of minor mischief was opened to his sneering spirit by his pretensions to prophetic knowledge All this was a sort of happiness which I could conceive of though I had little sympathy with it Perhaps had I been then inclined to admit it I might have found that the roving life was more proper to him than to either of his companions for Satan to whom I had compared the poor man has delighted ever since the time of Job in wandering up and down upon the earth and indeed a crafty disposition which operates not in deep laid plans but in disconnected tricks could not have an adequate scope unless naturally impelled to a continual change of scene and society My reflections were here interrupted Another visitor exclaimed the old showman The door of the wagon had been closed against the tempest which was roaring and blustering with prodigious fury and commotion and beating violently against our shelter as if it claimed all those homeless people for its lawful prey while we caring little for the displeasure of the elements sat comfortably talking There was now an attempt to open the door succeeded by a voice uttering some strange unintelligible gibberish which my companions mistook for Greek and I suspected to be thieves Latin However the showman stepped forward and gave admittance to a figure which made me imagine either that our wagon had rolled back two hundred years into past ages or that the forest and its old inhabitants had sprung up around us by enchantment It was a red Indian armed with his bow and arrow His dress was a sort of cap adorned with a single feather of some wild bird and a frock of blue cotton girded tight about him on his breast like orders of knighthood hung a crescent and a circle and other ornaments of silver while a small crucifix betokened that our father the pope had interposed between the Indian and the Great Spirit whom he had worshipped in his simplicity This son of the wilderness and pilgrim of the storm took his place silently in the midst of us When the first surprise was over I rightly conjectured him to be one of the Penobscot tribe parties of which I had often seen in their summer excursions down our Eastern rivers There they paddle their birch canoes among the coasting schooners and build their wigwam beside some roaring mill dam and drive a little trade in basket work where their fathers hunted deer Our new visitor was probably wandering through the country toward Boston subsisting on the careless charity of the people while he turned his archery to profitable account by shooting at cents which were to be the prize of his successful aim The Indian had not long been seated ere our merry damsel sought to draw him into conversation She indeed seemed all made up of sunshine in the month of May for there was nothing so dark and dismal that her pleasant mind could not cast a glow over it and the wild man like a fir tree in his native forest soon began to brighten into a sort of sombre cheerfulness At length she inquired whether his journey had any particular end or purpose I go shoot at the camp meeting at Stamford replied the Indian And here are five more said the girl all aiming at the camp meeting too You shall be one of us for we travel with light hearts and as for me I sing merry songs and tell merry tales and am full of merry thoughts and I dance merrily along the road so that there is never any sadness among them that keep me company But oh you would find it very dull indeed to go all the way to Stamford alone My ideas of the aboriginal character led me to fear that the Indian would prefer his own solitary musings to the gay society thus offered him on the contrary the girl s proposal met with immediate acceptance and seemed to animate him with a misty expectation of enjoyment I now gave myself up to a course of thought which whether it flowed naturally from this combination of events or was drawn forth by a wayward fancy caused my mind to thrill as if I were listening to deep music I saw mankind in this weary old age of the world either enduring a sluggish existence amid the smoke and dust of cities or if they breathed a purer air still lying down at night with no hope but to wear out to morrow and all the to morrows which make up life among the same dull scenes and in the same wretched toil that had darkened the sunshine of today But there were some full of the primeval instinct who preserved the freshness of youth to their latest years by the continual excitement of new objects new pursuits and new associates and cared little though their birthplace might have been here in New England if the grave should close over them in Central Asia Fate was summoning a parliament of these free spirits unconscious of the impulse which directed them to a common centre they had come hither from far and near and last of all appeared the representatives of those mighty vagrants who had chased the deer during thousands of years and were chasing it now in the spirit land Wandering down through the waste of ages the woods had vanished around his path his arm had lost somewhat of its strength his foot of its fleetness his mien of its wild regality his heart and mind of their savage virtue and uncultured force but here untamable to the routine of artificial life roving now along the dusty road as of old over the forest leaves here was the Indian still Well said the old showman in the midst of my meditations here is an honest company of us one two three four five six all going to the camp meeting at Stamford Now hoping no offence I should like to know where this young gentleman may be going I started How came I among these wanderers The free mind that preferred its own folly to another s wisdom the open spirit that found companions everywhere above all the restless impulse that had so often made me wretched in the midst of enjoyments these were my claims to be of their society My friends cried I stepping into the centre of the wagon I am going with you to the camp meeting at Stamford But in what capacity asked the old showman after a moment s silence All of us here can get our bread in some creditable way Every honest man should have his livelihood You sir as I take it are a mere strolling gentleman I proceeded to inform the company that when Nature gave me a propensity to their way of life she had not left me altogether destitute of qualifications for it though I could not deny that my talent was less respectable and might be less profitable than the meanest of theirs My design in short was to imitate the story tellers of whom Oriental travellers have told us and become an itinerant novelist reciting my own extemporaneous fictions to such audiences as I could collect Either this said I is my vocation or I have been born in vain The fortune teller with a sly wink to the company proposed to take me as an apprentice to one or other of his professions either of which undoubtedly would have given full scope to whatever inventive talent I might possess The bibliopolist spoke a few words in opposition to my plan influenced partly I suspect by the jealousy of authorship and partly by an apprehension that the viva voce practice would become general among novelists to the infinite detriment of the book trade Dreading a rejection I solicited the interest of the merry damsel Mirth cried I most aptly appropriating the words of L Allegro to thee I sue Mirth admit me of thy crew Let us indulge the poor youth said Mirth with a kindness which made me love her dearly though I was no such coxcomb as to misinterpret her motives I have espied much promise in him True a shadow sometimes flits across his brow but the sunshine is sure to follow in a moment He is never guilty of a sad thought but a merry one is twin born with it We will take him with us and you shall see that he will set us all a laughing before we reach the camp meeting at Stamford Her voice silenced the scruples of the rest and gained me admittance into the league according to the terms of which without a community of goods or profits we were to lend each other all the aid and avert all the harm that might be in our power This affair settled a marvellous jollity entered into the whole tribe of us manifesting itself characteristically in each individual The old showman sitting down to his barrel organ stirred up the souls of the pigmy people with one of the quickest tunes in the music book tailors blacksmiths gentlemen and ladies all seemed to share in the spirit of the occasion and the Merry Andrew played his part more facetiously than ever nodding and winking particularly at me The young foreigner flourished his fiddle bow with a master s hand and gave an inspiring echo to the showman s melody The bookish man and the merry damsel started up simultaneously to dance the former enacting the double shuffle in a style which everybody must have witnessed ere election week was blotted out of time while the girl setting her arms akimbo with both hands at her slim waist displayed such light rapidity of foot and harmony of varying attitude and motion that I could not conceive how she ever was to stop imagining at the moment that Nature had made her as the old showman had made his puppets for no earthly purpose but to dance jigs The Indian bellowed forth a succession of most hideous outcries somewhat affrighting us till we interpreted them as the war song with which in imitation of his ancestors he was prefacing the assault on Stamford The conjurer meanwhile sat demurely in a corner extracting a sly enjoyment from the whole scene and like the facetious Merry Andrew directing his queer glance particularly at me As for myself with great exhilaration of fancy I began to arrange and color the incidents of a tale wherewith I proposed to amuse an audience that very evening for I saw that my associates were a little ashamed of me and that no time was to be lost in obtaining a public acknowledgment of my abilities Come fellow laborers at last said the old showman whom we had elected president the shower is over and we must be doing our duty by these poor souls at Stamford We ll come among them in procession with music and dancing cried the merry damsel Accordingly for it must be understood that our pilgrimage was to be performed on foot we sallied joyously out of the wagon each of us even the old gentleman in his white top boots giving a great skip as we came down the ladder Above our heads there was such a glory of sunshine and splendor of clouds and such brightness of verdure below that as I modestly remarked at the time Nature seemed to have washed her face and put on the best of her jewelry and a fresh green gown in honor of our confederation Casting our eyes northward we beheld a horseman approaching leisurely and splashing through the little puddle on the Stamford road Onward he came sticking up in his saddle with rigid perpendicularity a tall thin figure in rusty black whom the showman and the conjurer shortly recognized to be what his aspect sufficiently indicated a travelling preacher of great fame among the Methodists What puzzled us was the fact that his face appeared turned from instead of to the camp meeting at Stamford However as this new votary of the wandering life drew near the little green space where the guide post and our wagon were situated my six fellow vagabonds and myself rushed forward and surrounded him crying out with united voices What news What news from the camp meeting at Stamford The missionary looked down in surprise at as singular a knot of people as could have been selected from all his heterogeneous auditors Indeed considering that we might all be classified under the general head of Vagabond there was great diversity of character among the grave old showman the sly prophetic beggar the fiddling foreigner and his merry damsel the smart bibliopolist the sombre Indian and myself the itinerant novelist a slender youth of eighteen I even fancied that a smile was endeavoring to disturb the iron gravity of the preacher s mouth Good people answered he the camp meeting is broke up So saying the Methodist minister switched his steed and rode westward Our union being thus nullified by the removal of its object we were sundered at once to the four winds of heaven The fortune teller giving a nod to all and a peculiar wink to me departed on his Northern tour chuckling within himself as he took the Stamford road The old showman and his literary coadjutor were already tackling their horses to the wagon with a design to peregrinate south west along the sea coast The foreigner and the merry damsel took their laughing leave and pursued the eastern road which I had that day trodden as they passed away the young man played a lively strain and the girl s happy spirit broke into a dance and thus dissolving as it were into sunbeams and gay music that pleasant pair departed from my view Finally with a pensive shadow thrown across my mind yet emulous of the light philosophy of my late companions I joined myself to the Penobscot Indian and set forth toward the distant city THE WHITE OLD MAID The moonbeams came through two deep and narrow windows and showed a spacious chamber richly furnished in an antique fashion From one lattice the shadow of the diamond panes was thrown upon the floor the ghostly light through the other slept upon a bed falling between the heavy silken curtains and illuminating the face of a young man But how quietly the slumberer lay how pale his features And how like a shroud the sheet was wound about his frame Yes it was a corpse in its burial clothes Suddenly the fixed features seemed to move with dark emotion Strange fantasy It was but the shadow of the fringed curtain waving betwixt the dead face and the moonlight as the door of the chamber opened and a girl stole softly to the bedside Was there delusion in the moonbeams or did her gesture and her eye betray a gleam of triumph as she bent over the pale corpse pale as itself and pressed her living lips to the cold ones of the dead As she drew back from that long kiss her features writhed as if a proud heart were fighting with its anguish Again it seemed that the features of the corpse had moved responsive to her own Still an illusion The silken curtains had waved a second time betwixt the dead face and the moonlight as another fair young girl unclosed the door and glided ghostlike to the bedside There the two maidens stood both beautiful with the pale beauty of the dead between them But she who had first entered was proud and stately and the other a soft and fragile thing Away cried the lofty one Thou hadst him living the dead is mine Thine returned the other shuddering Well hast thou spoken the dead is thine The proud girl started and stared into her face with a ghastly look but a wild and mournful expression passed across the features of the gentle one and weak and helpless she sank down on the bed her head pillowed beside that of the corpse and her hair mingling with his dark locks A creature of hope and joy the first draught of sorrow had bewildered her Edith cried her rival Edith groaned as with a sudden compression of the heart and removing her cheek from the dead youth s pillow she stood upright fearfully encountering the eyes of the lofty girl Wilt thou betray me said the latter calmly Till the dead bid me speak I will be silent answered Edith Leave us alone together Go and live many years and then return and tell me of thy life He too will be here Then if thou tellest of sufferings more than death we will both forgive thee And what shall be the token asked the proud girl as if her heart acknowledged a meaning in these wild words This lock of hair said Edith lifting one of the dark clustering curls that lay heavily on the dead man s brow The two maidens joined their hands over the bosom of the corpse and appointed a day and hour far far in time to come for their next meeting in that chamber The statelier girl gave one deep look at the motionless countenance and departed yet turned again and trembled ere she closed the door almost believing that her dead lover frowned upon her And Edith too Was not her white form fading into the moonlight Scorning her own weakness she went forth and perceived that a negro slave was waiting in the passage with a waxlight which he held between her face and his own and regarded her as she thought with an ugly expression of merriment Lifting his torch on high the slave lighted her down the staircase and undid the portal of the mansion The young clergyman of the town had just ascended the steps and bowing to the lady passed in without a word Years many years rolled on The world seemed new again so much older was it grown since the night when those pale girls had clasped their hands across the bosom of the corpse In the interval a lonely woman had passed from youth to extreme age and was known by all the town as the Old Maid in the Winding Sheet A taint of insanity had affected her whole life but so quiet sad and gentle so utterly free from violence that she was suffered to pursue her harmless fantasies unmolested by the world with whose business or pleasures she had naught to do She dwelt alone and never came into the daylight except to follow funerals Whenever a corpse was borne along the street in sunshine rain or snow whether a pompous train of the rich and proud thronged after it or few and humble were the mourners behind them came the lonely woman in a long white garment which the people called her shroud She took no place among the kindred or the friends but stood at the door to hear the funeral prayer and walked in the rear of the procession as one whose earthly charge it was to haunt the house of mourning and be the shadow of affliction and see that the dead were duly buried So long had this been her custom that the inhabitants of the town deemed her a part of every funeral as much as the coffin pall or the very corpse itself and augured ill of the sinner s destiny unless the Old Maid in the Winding Sheet came gliding like a ghost behind Once it is said she affrighted a bridal party with her pale presence appearing suddenly in the illuminated hall just as the priest was uniting a false maid to a wealthy man before her lover had been dead a year Evil was the omen to that marriage Sometimes she stole forth by moonlight and visited the graves of venerable integrity and wedded love and virgin innocence and every spot where the ashes of a kind and faithful heart were mouldering Over the hillocks of those favored dead would she stretch out her arms with a gesture as if she were scattering seeds and many believed that she brought them from the garden of Paradise for the graves which she had visited were green beneath the snow and covered with sweet flowers from April to November Her blessing was better than a holy verse upon the tombstone Thus wore away her long sad peaceful and fantastic life till few were so old as she and the people of later generations wondered how the dead had ever been buried or mourners had endured their grief without the Old Maid in the Winding Sheet Still years went on and still she followed funerals and was not yet summoned to her own festival of death One afternoon the great street of the town was all alive with business and bustle though the sun now gilded only the upper half of the church spire having left the housetops and loftiest trees in shadow The scene was cheerful and animated in spite of the sombre shade between the high brick buildings Here were pompous merchants in white wigs and laced velvet the bronzed faces of sea captains the foreign garb and air of Spanish Creoles and the disdainful port of natives of Old England all contrasted with the rough aspect of one or two back settlers negotiating sales of timber from forests where axe had never sounded Sometimes a lady passed swelling roundly forth in an embroidered petticoat balancing her steps in high heeled shoes and courtesying with lofty grace to the punctilious obeisances of the gentlemen The life of the town seemed to have its very centre not far from an old mansion that stood somewhat back from the pavement surrounded by neglected grass with a strange air of loneliness rather deepened than dispelled by the throng so near it Its site would have been suitably occupied by a magnificent Exchange or a brick block lettered all over with various signs or the large house itself might have made a noble tavern with the King s Arms swinging before it and guests in every chamber instead of the present solitude But owing to some dispute about the right of inheritance the mansion had been long without a tenant decaying from year to year and throwing the stately gloom of its shadow over the busiest part of the town Such was the scene and such the time when a figure unlike any that have been described was observed at a distance down the street I espy a strange sail yonder remarked a Liverpool captain that woman in the long white garment The sailor seemed much struck by the object as were several others who at the same moment caught a glimpse of the figure that had attracted his notice Almost immediately the various topics of conversation gave place to speculations in an undertone on this unwonted occurrence Can there be a funeral so late this afternoon inquired some They looked for the signs of death at every door the sexton the hearse the assemblage of black clad relatives all that makes up the woeful pomp of funerals They raised their eyes also to the sun gilt spire of the church and wondered that no clang proceeded from its bell which had always tolled till now when this figure appeared in the light of day But none had heard that a corpse was to be borne to its home that afternoon nor was there any token of a funeral except the apparition of the Old Maid in the Winding Sheet What may this portend asked each man of his neighbor All smiled as they put the question yet with a certain trouble in their eyes as if pestilence or some other wide calamity were prognosticated by the untimely intrusion among the living of one whose presence had always been associated with death and woe What a comet is to the earth was that sad woman to the town Still she moved on while the hum of surprise was hushed at her approach and the proud and the humble stood aside that her white garment might not wave against them It was a long loose robe of spotless purity Its wearer appeared very old pale emaciated and feeble yet glided onward without the unsteady pace of extreme age At one point of her course a little rosy boy burst forth from a door and ran with open arms toward the ghostly woman seeming to expect a kiss from her bloodless lips She made a slight pause fixing her eye upon him with an expression of no earthly sweetness so that the child shivered and stood awestruck rather than affrighted while the Old Maid passed on Perhaps her garment might have been polluted even by an infant s touch perhaps her kiss would have been death to the sweet boy within the year She is but a shadow whispered the superstitious The child put forth his arms and could not grasp her robe The wonder was increased when the Old Maid passed beneath the porch of the deserted mansion ascended the moss covered steps lifted the iron knocker and gave three raps The people could only conjecture that some old remembrance troubling her bewildered brain had impelled the poor woman hither to visit the friends of her youth all gone from their home long since and for ever unless their ghosts still haunted it fit company for the Old Maid in the Winding Sheet An elderly man approached the steps and reverently uncovering his gray locks essayed to explain the matter None madam said he have dwelt in this house these fifteen years agone no not since the death of old Colonel Fenwicke whose funeral you may remember to have followed His heirs being ill agreed among themselves have let the mansion house go to ruin The Old Maid looked slowly round with a slight gesture of one hand and a finger of the other upon her lip appearing more shadow like than ever in the obscurity of the porch But again she lifted the hammer and gave this time a single rap Could it be that a footstep was now heard coming down the staircase of the old mansion which all conceived to have been so long untenanted Slowly feebly yet heavily like the pace of an aged and infirm person the step approached more distinct on every downward stair till it reached the portal The bar fell on the inside the door was opened One upward glance toward the church spire whence the sunshine had just faded was the last that the people saw of the Old Maid in the Winding Sheet Who undid the door asked many This question owing to the depth of shadow beneath the porch no one could satisfactorily answer Two or three aged men while protesting against an inference which might be drawn affirmed that the person within was a negro and bore a singular resemblance to old Caesar formerly a slave in the house but freed by death some thirty years before Her summons has waked up a servant of the old family said one half seriously Let us wait here replied another more guests will knock at the door anon But the gate of the graveyard should be thrown open Twilight had overspread the town before the crowd began to separate or the comments on this incident were exhausted One after another was wending his way homeward when a coach no common spectacle in those days drove slowly into the street It was an old fashioned equipage hanging close to the ground with arms on the panels a footman behind and a grave corpulent coachman seated high in front the whole giving an idea of solemn state and dignity There was something awful in the heavy rumbling of the wheels The coach rolled down the street till coming to the gateway of the deserted mansion it drew up and the footman sprang to the ground Whose grand coach is this asked a very inquisitive body The footman made no reply but ascended the steps of the old house gave three taps with the iron hammer and returned to open the coach door An old man possessed of the heraldic lore so common in that day examined the shield of arms on the panel Azure a lion s head erased between three flowers de luce said he then whispered the name of the family to whom these bearings belonged The last inheritor of its honors was recently dead after a long residence amid the splendor of the British court where his birth and wealth had given him no mean station He left no child continued the herald and these arms being in a lozenge betoken that the coach appertains to his widow Further disclosures perhaps might have been made had not the speaker been suddenly struck dumb by the stern eye of an ancient lady who thrust forth her head from the coach preparing to descend As she emerged the people saw that her dress was magnificent and her figure dignified in spite of age and infirmity a stately ruin but with a look at once of pride and wretchedness Her strong and rigid features had an awe about them unlike that of the white Old Maid but as of something evil She passed up the steps leaning on a gold headed cane The door swung open as she ascended and the light of a torch glittered on the embroidery of her dress and gleamed on the pillars of the porch After a momentary pause a glance backward and then a desperate effort she went in The decipherer of the coat of arms had ventured up the lower step and shrinking back immediately pale and tremulous affirmed that the torch was held by the very image of old Caesar But such a hideous grin added he was never seen on the face of mortal man black or white It will haunt me till my dying day Meantime the coach had wheeled round with a prodigious clatter on the pavement and rumbled up the street disappearing in the twilight while the ear still tracked its course Scarcely was it gone when the people began to question whether the coach and attendants the ancient lady the spectre of old Caesar and the Old Maid herself were not all a strangely combined delusion with some dark purport in its mystery The whole town was astir so that instead of dispersing the crowd continually increased and stood gazing up at the windows of the mansion now silvered by the brightening moon The elders glad to indulge the narrative propensity of age told of the long faded splendor of the family the entertainments they had given and the guests the greatest of the land and even titled and noble ones from abroad who had passed beneath that portal These graphic reminiscences seemed to call up the ghosts of those to whom they referred So strong was the impression on some of the more imaginative hearers that two or three were seized with trembling fits at one and the same moment protesting that they had distinctly heard three other raps of the iron knocker Impossible exclaimed others See The moon shines beneath the porch and shows every part of it except in the narrow shade of that pillar There is no one there Did not the door open whispered one of these fanciful persons Didst thou see it too said his companion in a startled tone But the general sentiment was opposed to the idea that a third visitant had made application at the door of the deserted house A few however adhered to this new marvel and even declared that a red gleam like that of a torch had shone through the great front window as if the negro were lighting a guest up the staircase This too was pronounced a mere fantasy But at once the whole multitude started and each man beheld his own terror painted in the faces of all the rest What an awful thing is this cried they A shriek too fearfully distinct for doubt had been heard within the mansion breaking forth suddenly and succeeded by a deep stillness as if a heart had burst in giving it utterance The people knew not whether to fly from the very sight of the house or to rush trembling in and search out the strange mystery Amid their confusion and affright they were somewhat reassured by the appearance of their clergyman a venerable patriarch and equally a saint who had taught them and their fathers the way to heaven for more than the space of an ordinary lifetime He was a reverend figure with long white hair upon his shoulders a white beard upon his breast and a back so bent over his staff that he seemed to be looking downward continually as if to choose a proper grave for his weary frame It was some time before the good old man being deaf and of impaired intellect could be made to comprehend such portions of the affair as were comprehensible at all But when possessed of the facts his energies assumed unexpected vigor Verily said the old gentleman it will be fitting that I enter the mansion house of the worthy Colonel Fenwicke lest any harm should have befallen that true Christian woman whom ye call the Old Maid in the Winding Sheet Behold then the venerable clergyman ascending the steps of the mansion with a torch bearer behind him It was the elderly man who had spoken to the Old Maid and the same who had afterward explained the shield of arms and recognized the features of the negro Like their predecessors they gave three raps with the iron hammer Old Caesar cometh not observed the priest Well I wot he no longer doth service in this mansion Assuredly then it was something worse in old Caesar s likeness said the other adventurer Be it as God wills answered the clergyman See my strength though it be much decayed hath sufficed to open this heavy door Let us enter and pass up the staircase Here occurred a singular exemplification of the dreamy state of a very old man s mind As they ascended the wide flight of stairs the aged clergyman appeared to move with caution occasionally standing aside and oftener bending his head as it were in salutation thus practising all the gestures of one who makes his way through a throng Reaching the head of the staircase he looked around with sad and solemn benignity laid aside his staff bared his hoary locks and was evidently on the point of commencing a prayer Reverend sir said his attendant who conceived this a very suitable prelude to their further search would it not be well that the people join with us in prayer Well a day cried the old clergyman staring strangely around him Art thou here with me and none other Verily past times were present to me and I deemed that I was to make a funeral prayer as many a time heretofore from the head of this staircase Of a truth I saw the shades of many that are gone Yea I have prayed at their burials one after another and the Old Maid in the Winding Sheet hath seen them to their graves Being now more thoroughly awake to their present purpose he took his staff and struck forcibly on the floor till there came an echo from each deserted chamber but no menial to answer their summons They therefore walked along the passage and again paused opposite to the great front window through which was seen the crowd in the shadow and partial moonlight of the street beneath On their right hand was the open door of a chamber and a closed one on their left The clergyman pointed his cane to the carved oak panel of the latter Within that chamber observed he a whole lifetime since did I sit by the death bed of a goodly young man who being now at the last gasp Apparently there was some powerful excitement in the ideas which had now flashed across his mind He snatched the torch from his companion s hand and threw open the door with such sudden violence that the flame was extinguished leaving them no other light than the moonbeams which fell through two windows into the spacious chamber It was sufficient to discover all that could be known In a high backed oaken arm chair upright with her hands clasped across her breast and her head thrown back sat the Old Maid in the Winding Sheet The stately dame had fallen on her knees with her forehead on the holy knees of the Old Maid one hand upon the floor and the other pressed convulsively against her heart It clutched a lock of hair once sable now discolored with a greenish mould As the priest and layman advanced into the chamber the Old Maid s features assumed such a semblance of shifting expression that they trusted to hear the whole mystery explained by a single word But it was only the shadow of a tattered curtain waving betwixt the dead face and the moonlight Both dead said the venerable man Then who shall divulge the secret Methinks it glimmers to and fro in my mind like the light and shadow across the Old Maid s face And now tis gone PETER GOLDTHWAITE S TREASURE And so Peter you won t even consider of the business said mister John Brown buttoning his surtout over the snug rotundity of his person and drawing on his gloves You positively refuse to let me have this crazy old house and the land under and adjoining at the price named Neither at that nor treble the sum responded the gaunt grizzled and threadbare Peter Goldthwaite The fact is mister Brown you must find another site for your brick block and be content to leave my estate with the present owner Next summer I intend to put a splendid new mansion over the cellar of the old house Pho Peter cried mister Brown as he opened the kitchen door content yourself with building castles in the air where house lots are cheaper than on earth to say nothing of the cost of bricks and mortar Such foundations are solid enough for your edifices while this underneath us is just the thing for mine and so we may both be suited What say you again Precisely what I said before mister Brown answered Peter Goldthwaite And as for castles in the air mine may not be as magnificent as that sort of architecture but perhaps as substantial mister Brown as the very respectable brick block with dry goods stores tailors shops and banking rooms on the lower floor and lawyers offices in the second story which you are so anxious to substitute And the cost Peter Eh said mister Brown as he withdrew in something of a pet That I suppose will be provided for off hand by drawing a check on Bubble Bank John Brown and Peter Goldthwaite had been jointly known to the commercial world between twenty and thirty years before under the firm of Goldthwaite Brown which copartnership however was speedily dissolved by the natural incongruity of its constituent parts Since that event John Brown with exactly the qualities of a thousand other John Browns and by just such plodding methods as they used had prospered wonderfully and become one of the wealthiest John Browns on earth Peter Goldthwaite on the contrary after innumerable schemes which ought to have collected all the coin and paper currency of the country into his coffers was as needy a gentleman as ever wore a patch upon his elbow The contrast between him and his former partner may be briefly marked for Brown never reckoned upon luck yet always had it while Peter made luck the main condition of his projects and always missed it While the means held out his speculations had been magnificent but were chiefly confined of late years to such small business as adventures in the lottery Once he had gone on a gold gathering expedition somewhere to the South and ingeniously contrived to empty his pockets more thoroughly than ever while others doubtless were filling theirs with native bullion by the handful More recently he had expended a legacy of a thousand or two of dollars in purchasing Mexican scrip and thereby became the proprietor of a province which however so far as Peter could find out was situated where he might have had an empire for the same money in the clouds From a search after this valuable real estate Peter returned so gaunt and threadbare that on reaching New England the scarecrows in the corn fields beckoned to him as he passed by They did but flutter in the wind quoth Peter Goldthwaite No Peter they beckoned for the scarecrows knew their brother At the period of our story his whole visible income would not have paid the tax of the old mansion in which we find him It was one of those rusty moss grown many peaked wooden houses which are scattered about the streets of our elder towns with a beetle browed second story projecting over the foundation as if it frowned at the novelty around it This old paternal edifice needy as he was and though being centrally situated on the principal street of the town it would have brought him a handsome sum the sagacious Peter had his own reasons for never parting with either by auction or private sale There seemed indeed to be a fatality that connected him with his birthplace for often as he had stood on the verge of ruin and standing there even now he had not yet taken the step beyond it which would have compelled him to surrender the house to his creditors So here he dwelt with bad luck till good should come Here then in his kitchen the only room where a spark of fire took off the chill of a November evening poor Peter Goldthwaite had just been visited by his rich old partner At the close of their interview Peter with rather a mortified look glanced downward at his dress parts of which appeared as ancient as the days of Goldthwaite Brown His upper garment was a mixed surtout woefully faded and patched with newer stuff on each elbow beneath this he wore a threadbare black coat some of the silk buttons of which had been replaced with others of a different pattern and lastly though he lacked not a pair of gray pantaloons they were very shabby ones and had been partially turned brown by the frequent toasting of Peter s shins before a scanty fire Peter s person was in keeping with his goodly apparel Gray headed hollow eyed pale cheeked and lean bodied he was the perfect picture of a man who had fed on windy schemes and empty hopes till he could neither live on such unwholesome trash nor stomach more substantial food But withal this Peter Goldthwaite crack brained simpleton as perhaps he was might have cut a very brilliant figure in the world had he employed his imagination in the airy business of poetry instead of making it a demon of mischief in mercantile pursuits After all he was no bad fellow but as harmless as a child and as honest and honorable and as much of the gentleman which Nature meant him for as an irregular life and depressed circumstances will permit any man to be As Peter stood on the uneven bricks of his hearth looking round at the disconsolate old kitchen his eyes began to kindle with the illumination of an enthusiasm that never long deserted him He raised his hand clenched it and smote it energetically against the smoky panel over the fireplace The time is come said he with such a treasure at command it were folly to be a poor man any longer Tomorrow morning I will begin with the garret nor desist till I have torn the house down Deep in the chimney corner like a witch in a dark cavern sat a little old woman mending one of the two pairs of stockings wherewith Peter Goldthwaite kept his toes from being frost bitten As the feet were ragged past all darning she had cut pieces out of a cast off flannel petticoat to make new soles Tabitha Porter was an old maid upward of sixty years of age fifty five of which she had sat in that same chimney corner such being the length of time since Peter s grandfather had taken her from the almshouse She had no friend but Peter nor Peter any friend but Tabitha so long as Peter might have a shelter for his own head Tabitha would know where to shelter hers or being homeless elsewhere she would take her master by the hand and bring him to her native home the almshouse Should it ever be necessary she loved him well enough to feed him with her last morsel and clothe him with her under petticoat But Tabitha was a queer old woman and though never infected with Peter s flightiness had become so accustomed to his freaks and follies that she viewed them all as matters of course Hearing him threaten to tear the house down she looked quietly up from her work Best leave the kitchen till the last mister Peter said she The sooner we have it all down the better said Peter Goldthwaite I am tired to death of living in this cold dark windy smoky creaking groaning dismal old house I shall feel like a younger man when we get into my splendid brick mansion as please Heaven we shall by this time next autumn You shall have a room on the sunny side old Tabby finished and furnished as best may suit your own notions I should like it pretty much such a room as this kitchen answered Tabitha It will never be like home to me till the chimney corner gets as black with smoke as this and that won t be these hundred years How much do you mean to lay out on the house mister Peter What is that to the purpose exclaimed Peter loftily Did not my great grand uncle Peter Goldthwaite who died seventy years ago and whose namesake I am leave treasure enough to build twenty such I can t say but he did mister Peter said Tabitha threading her needle Tabitha well understood that Peter had reference to an immense hoard of the precious metals which was said to exist somewhere in the cellar or walls or under the floors or in some concealed closet or other out of the way nook of the old house This wealth according to tradition had been accumulated by a former Peter Goldthwaite whose character seems to have borne a remarkable similitude to that of the Peter of our story Like him he was a wild projector seeking to heap up gold by the bushel and the cart load instead of scraping it together coin by coin Like Peter the second too his projects had almost invariably failed and but for the magnificent success of the final one would have left him with hardly a coat and pair of breeches to his gaunt and grizzled person Reports were various as to the nature of his fortunate speculation one intimating that the ancient Peter had made the gold by alchemy another that he had conjured it out of people s pockets by the black art and a third still more unaccountable that the devil had given him free access to the old provincial treasury It was affirmed however that some secret impediment had debarred him from the enjoyment of his riches and that he had a motive for concealing them from his heir or at any rate had died without disclosing the place of deposit The present Peter s father had faith enough in the story to cause the cellar to be dug over Peter himself chose to consider the legend as an indisputable truth and amid his many troubles had this one consolation that should all other resources fail he might build up his fortunes by tearing his house down Yet unless he felt a lurking distrust of the golden tale it is difficult to account for his permitting the paternal roof to stand so long since he had never yet seen the moment when his predecessor s treasure would not have found plenty of room in his own strong box But now was the crisis Should he delay the search a little longer the house would pass from the lineal heir and with it the vast heap of gold to remain in its burial place till the ruin of the aged walls should discover it to strangers of a future generation Yes cried Peter Goldthwaite again to morrow I will set about it The deeper he looked at the matter the more certain of success grew Peter His spirits were naturally so elastic that even now in the blasted autumn of his age he could often compete with the springtime gayety of other people Enlivened by his brightening prospects he began to caper about the kitchen like a hobgoblin with the queerest antics of his lean limbs and gesticulations of his starved features Nay in the exuberance of his feelings he seized both of Tabitha s hands and danced the old lady across the floor till the oddity of her rheumatic motions set him into a roar of laughter which was echoed back from the rooms and chambers as if Peter Goldthwaite were laughing in every one Finally he bounded upward almost out of sight into the smoke that clouded the roof of the kitchen and alighting safely on the floor again endeavored to resume his customary gravity To morrow at sunrise he repeated taking his lamp to retire to bed I ll see whether this treasure be hid in the wall of the garret And as we re out of wood mister Peter said Tabitha puffing and panting with her late gymnastics as fast as you tear the house down I ll make a fire with the pieces Gorgeous that night were the dreams of Peter Goldthwaite At one time he was turning a ponderous key in an iron door not unlike the door of a sepulchre but which being opened disclosed a vault heaped up with gold coin as plentifully as golden corn in a granary There were chased goblets also and tureens salvers dinner dishes and dish covers of gold or silver gilt besides chains and other jewels incalculably rich though tarnished with the damps of the vault for of all the wealth that was irrevocably lost to man whether buried in the earth or sunken in the sea Peter Goldthwaite had found it in this one treasure place Anon he had returned to the old house as poor as ever and was received at the door by the gaunt and grizzled figure of a man whom he might have mistaken for himself only that his garments were of a much elder fashion But the house without losing its former aspect had been changed into a palace of the precious metals The floors walls and ceilings were of burnished silver the doors the window frames the cornices the balustrades and the steps of the staircase of pure gold and silver with gold bottoms were the chairs and gold standing on silver legs the high chests of drawers and silver the bedsteads with blankets of woven gold and sheets of silver tissue The house had evidently been transmuted by a single touch for it retained all the marks that Peter remembered but in gold or silver instead of wood and the initials of his name which when a boy he had cut in the wooden door post remained as deep in the pillar of gold A happy man would have been Peter Goldthwaite except for a certain ocular deception which whenever he glanced backward caused the house to darken from its glittering magnificence into the sordid gloom of yesterday Up betimes rose Peter seized an axe hammer and saw which he had placed by his bedside and hied him to the garret It was but scantily lighted up as yet by the frosty fragments of a sunbeam which began to glimmer through the almost opaque bull eyes of the window A moralizer might find abundant themes for his speculative and impracticable wisdom in a garret There is the limbo of departed fashions aged trifles of a day and whatever was valuable only to one generation of men and which passed to the garret when that generation passed to the grave not for safekeeping but to be out of the way Peter saw piles of yellow and musty account books in parchment covers wherein creditors long dead and buried had written the names of dead and buried debtors in ink now so faded that their moss grown tombstones were more legible He found old moth eaten garments all in rags and tatters or Peter would have put them on Here was a naked and rusty sword not a sword of service but a gentleman s small French rapier which had never left its scabbard till it lost it Here were canes of twenty different sorts but no gold headed ones and shoebuckles of various pattern and material but not silver nor set with precious stones Here was a large box full of shoes with high heels and peaked toes Here on a shelf were a multitude of phials half filled with old apothecary s stuff which when the other half had done its business on Peter s ancestors had been brought hither from the death chamber Here not to give a longer inventory of articles that will never be put up at auction was the fragment of a full length looking glass which by the dust and dimness of its surface made the picture of these old things look older than the reality When Peter not knowing that there was a mirror there caught the faint traces of his own figure he partly imagined that the former Peter Goldthwaite had come back either to assist or impede his search for the hidden wealth And at that moment a strange notion glimmered through his brain that he was the identical Peter who had concealed the gold and ought to know whereabout it lay This however he had unaccountably forgotten Well mister Peter cried Tabitha on the garret stairs Have you torn the house down enough to heat the teakettle Not yet old Tabby answered Peter but that s soon done as you shall see With the word in his mouth he uplifted the axe and laid about him so vigorously that the dust flew the boards crashed and in a twinkling the old woman had an apron full of broken rubbish We shall get our winter s wood cheap quoth Tabitha The good work being thus commenced Peter beat down all before him smiting and hewing at the joints and timbers unclenching spike nails ripping and tearing away boards with a tremendous racket from morning till night He took care however to leave the outside shell of the house untouched so that the neighbors might not suspect what was going on Never in any of his vagaries though each had made him happy while it lasted had Peter been happier than now Perhaps after all there was something in Peter Goldthwaite s turn of mind which brought him an inward recompense for all the external evil that it caused If he were poor ill clad even hungry and exposed as it were to be utterly annihilated by a precipice of impending ruin yet only his body remained in these miserable circumstances while his aspiring soul enjoyed the sunshine of a bright futurity It was his nature to be always young and the tendency of his mode of life to keep him so Gray hairs were nothing no nor wrinkles nor infirmity he might look old indeed and be somewhat disagreeably connected with a gaunt old figure much the worse for wear but the true the essential Peter was a young man of high hopes just entering on the world At the kindling of each new fire his burnt out youth rose afresh from the old embers and ashes It rose exulting now Having lived thus long not too long but just to the right age a susceptible bachelor with warm and tender dreams he resolved so soon as the hidden gold should flash to light to go a wooing and win the love of the fairest maid in town What heart could resist him Happy Peter Goldthwaite Every evening as Peter had long absented himself from his former lounging places at insurance offices news rooms and book stores and as the honor of his company was seldom requested in private circles he and Tabitha used to sit down sociably by the kitchen hearth This was always heaped plentifully with the rubbish of his day s labor As the foundation of the fire there would be a goodly sized back log of red oak which after being sheltered from rain or damp above a century still hissed with the heat and distilled streams of water from each end as if the tree had been cut down within a week or two Next there were large sticks sound black and heavy which had lost the principle of decay and were indestructible except by fire wherein they glowed like red hot bars of iron On this solid basis Tabitha would rear a lighter structure composed of the splinters of door panels ornamented mouldings and such quick combustibles which caught like straw and threw a brilliant blaze high up the spacious flue making its sooty sides visible almost to the chimney top Meantime the gloom of the old kitchen would be chased out of the cobwebbed corners and away from the dusky cross beams overhead and driven nobody could tell whither while Peter smiled like a gladsome man and Tabitha seemed a picture of comfortable age All this of course was but an emblem of the bright fortune which the destruction of the house would shed upon its occupants While the dry pine was flaming and crackling like an irregular discharge of fairy musketry Peter sat looking and listening in a pleasant state of excitement but when the brief blaze and uproar were succeeded by the dark red glow the substantial heat and the deep singing sound which were to last throughout the evening his humor became talkative One night the hundredth time he teased Tabitha to tell him something new about his great granduncle You have been sitting in that chimney corner fifty five years old Tabby and must have heard many a tradition about him said Peter Did not you tell me that when you first came to the house there was an old woman sitting where you sit now who had been housekeeper to the famous Peter Goldthwaite So there was mister Peter answered Tabitha and she was near about a hundred years old She used to say that she and old Peter Goldthwaite had often spent a sociable evening by the kitchen fire pretty much as you and I are doing now mister Peter The old fellow must have resembled me in more points than one said Peter complacently or he never would have grown so rich But methinks he might have invested the money better than he did No interest nothing but good security and the house to be torn down to come at it What made him hide it so snug Tabby Because he could not spend it said Tabitha for as often as he went to unlock the chest the Old Scratch came behind and caught his arm The money they say was paid Peter out of his purse and he wanted Peter to give him a deed of this house and land which Peter swore he would not do Just as I swore to John Brown my old partner remarked Peter But this is all nonsense Tabby I don t believe the story Well it may not be just the truth said Tabitha for some folks say that Peter did make over the house to the Old Scratch and that s the reason it has always been so unlucky to them that lived in it And as soon as Peter had given him the deed the chest flew open and Peter caught up a handful of the gold But lo and behold there was nothing in his fist but a parcel of old rags Hold your tongue you silly old Tabby cried Peter in great wrath They were as good golden guineas as ever bore the effigies of the king of England It seems as if I could recollect the whole circumstance and how I or old Peter or whoever it was thrust in my hand or his hand and drew it out all of a blaze with gold Old rags indeed But it was not an old woman s legend that would discourage Peter Goldthwaite All night long he slept among pleasant dreams and awoke at daylight with a joyous throb of the heart which few are fortunate enough to feel beyond their boyhood Day after day he labored hard without wasting a moment except at meal times when Tabitha summoned him to the pork and cabbage or such other sustenance as she had picked up or Providence had sent them Being a truly pious man Peter never failed to ask a blessing if the food were none of the best then so much the more earnestly as it was more needed nor to return thanks if the dinner had been scanty yet for the good appetite which was better than a sick stomach at a feast Then did he hurry back to his toil and in a moment was lost to sight in a cloud of dust from the old walls though sufficiently perceptible to the ear by the clatter which he raised in the midst of it How enviable is the consciousness of being usefully employed Nothing troubled Peter or nothing but those phantoms of the mind which seem like vague recollections yet have also the aspect of presentiments He often paused with his axe uplifted in the air and said to himself Peter Goldthwaite did you never strike this blow before or Peter what need of tearing the whole house down Think a little while and you will remember where the gold is hidden Days and weeks passed on however without any remarkable discovery Sometimes indeed a lean gray rat peeped forth at the lean gray man wondering what devil had got into the old house which had always been so peaceable till now And occasionally Peter sympathized with the sorrows of a female mouse who had brought five or six pretty little soft and delicate young ones into the world just in time to see them crushed by its ruin But as yet no treasure By this time Peter being as determined as fate and as diligent as time had made an end with the uppermost regions and got down to the second story where he was busy in one of the front chambers It had formerly been the state bedchamber and was honored by tradition as the sleeping apartment of Governor Dudley and many other eminent guests The furniture was gone There were remnants of faded and tattered paper hangings but larger spaces of bare wall ornamented with charcoal sketches chiefly of people s heads in profile These being specimens of Peter s youthful genius it went more to his heart to obliterate them than if they had been pictures on a church wall by Michael Angelo One sketch however and that the best one affected him differently It represented a ragged man partly supporting himself on a spade and bending his lean body over a hole in the earth with one hand extended to grasp something that he had found But close behind him with a fiendish laugh on his features appeared a figure with horns a tufted tail and a cloven hoof Avaunt Satan cried Peter The man shall have his gold Uplifting his axe he hit the horned gentleman such a blow on the head as not only demolished him but the treasure seeker also and caused the whole scene to vanish like magic Moreover his axe broke quite through the plaster and laths and discovered a cavity Mercy on us mister Peter Are you quarrelling with the Old Scratch said Tabitha who was seeking some fuel to put under the dinner pot Without answering the old woman Peter broke down a further space of the wall and laid open a small closet or cupboard on one side of the fireplace about breast high from the ground It contained nothing but a brass lamp covered with verdigris and a dusty piece of parchment While Peter inspected the latter Tabitha seized the lamp and began to rub it with her apron There is no use in rubbing it Tabitha said Peter It is not Aladdin s lamp though I take it to be a token of as much luck Look here Tabby Tabitha took the parchment and held it close to her nose which was saddled with a pair of iron bound spectacles But no sooner had she begun to puzzle over it than she burst into a chuckling laugh holding both her hands against her sides You can t make a fool of the old woman cried she This is your own handwriting mister Peter the same as in the letter you sent me from Mexico There is certainly a considerable resemblance said Peter again examining the parchment But you know yourself Tabby that this closet must have been plastered up before you came to the house or I came into the world No this is old Peter Goldthwaite s writing These columns of pounds shillings and pence are his figures denoting the amount of the treasure and this at the bottom is doubtless a reference to the place of concealment But the ink has either faded or peeled off so that it is absolutely illegible What a pity Well this lamp is as good as new That s some comfort said Tabitha A lamp thought Peter That indicates light on my researches For the present Peter felt more inclined to ponder on this discovery than to resume his labors After Tabitha had gone down stairs he stood poring over the parchment at one of the front windows which was so obscured with dust that the sun could barely throw an uncertain shadow of the casement across the floor Peter forced it open and looked out upon the great street of the town while the sun looked in at his old house The air though mild and even warm thrilled Peter as with a dash of water It was the first day of the January thaw The snow lay deep upon the housetops but was rapidly dissolving into millions of water drops which sparkled downward through the sunshine with the noise of a summer shower beneath the eaves Along the street the trodden snow was as hard and solid as a pavement of white marble and had not yet grown moist in the spring like temperature But when Peter thrust forth his head he saw that the inhabitants if not the town were already thawed out by this warm day after two or three weeks of winter weather It gladdened him a gladness with a sigh breathing through it to see the stream of ladies gliding along the slippery sidewalks with their red cheeks set off by quilted hoods boas and sable capes like roses amidst a new kind of foliage The sleigh bells jingled to and fro continually sometimes announcing the arrival of a sleigh from Vermont laden with the frozen bodies of porkers or sheep and perhaps a deer or two sometimes of a regular marketman with chickens geese and turkeys comprising the whole colony of a barn yard and sometimes of a farmer and his dame who had come to town partly for the ride partly to go a shopping and partly for the sale of some eggs and butter This couple rode in an old fashioned square sleigh which had served them twenty winters and stood twenty summers in the sun beside their door Now a gentleman and lady skimmed the snow in an elegant car shaped somewhat like a cockle shell now a stage sleigh with its cloth curtains thrust aside to admit the sun dashed rapidly down the street whirling in and out among the vehicles that obstructed its passage now came round a corner the similitude of Noah s ark on runners being an immense open sleigh with seats for fifty people and drawn by a dozen horses This spacious receptacle was populous with merry maids and merry bachelors merry girls and boys and merry old folks all alive with fun and grinning to the full width of their mouths They kept up a buzz of babbling voices and low laughter and sometimes burst into a deep joyous shout which the spectators answered with three cheers while a gang of roguish boys let drive their snow balls right among the pleasure party The sleigh passed on and when concealed by a bend of the street was still audible by a distant cry of merriment Never had Peter beheld a livelier scene than was constituted by all these accessories the bright sun the flashing water drops the gleaming snow the cheerful multitude the variety of rapid vehicles and the jingle jangle of merry bells which made the heart dance to their music Nothing dismal was to be seen except that peaked piece of antiquity Peter Goldthwaite s house which might well look sad externally since such a terrible consumption was preying on its insides And Peter s gaunt figure half visible in the projecting second story was worthy of his house Peter How goes it friend Peter cried a voice across the street as Peter was drawing in his head Look out here Peter Peter looked and saw his old partner mister John Brown on the opposite sidewalk portly and comfortable with his furred cloak thrown open disclosing a handsome surtout beneath His voice had directed the attention of the whole town to Peter Goldthwaite s window and to the dusty scarecrow which appeared at it I say Peter cried mister Brown again what the devil are you about there that I hear such a racket whenever I pass by You are repairing the old house I suppose making a new one of it Eh Too late for that I am afraid mister Brown replied Peter If I make it new it will be new inside and out from the cellar upward Had not you better let me take the job said mister Brown significantly Not yet answered Peter hastily shutting the window for ever since he had been in search of the treasure he hated to have people stare at him As he drew back ashamed of his outward poverty yet proud of the secret wealth within his grasp a haughty smile shone out on Peter s visage with precisely the effect of the dim sunbeams in the squalid chamber He endeavored to assume such a mien as his ancestor had probably worn when he gloried in the building of a strong house for a home to many generations of his posterity But the chamber was very dark to his snow dazzled eyes and very dismal too in contrast with the living scene that he had just looked upon His brief glimpse into the street had given him a forcible impression of the manner in which the world kept itself cheerful and prosperous by social pleasures and an intercourse of business while he in seclusion was pursuing an object that might possibly be a phantasm by a method which most people would call madness It is one great advantage of a gregarious mode of life that each person rectifies his mind by other minds and squares his conduct to that of his neighbors so as seldom to be lost in eccentricity Peter Goldthwaite had exposed himself to this influence by merely looking out of the window For a while he doubted whether there were any hidden chest of gold and in that case whether it was so exceedingly wise to tear the house down only to be convinced of its non existence But this was momentary Peter the Destroyer resumed the task which Fate had assigned him nor faltered again till it was accomplished In the course of his search he met with many things that are usually found in the ruins of an old house and also with some that are not What seemed most to the purpose was a rusty key which had been thrust into a chink of the wall with a wooden label appended to the handle bearing the initials P G Another singular discovery was that of a bottle of wine walled up in an old oven A tradition ran in the family that Peter s grandfather a jovial officer in the old French war had set aside many dozens of the precious liquor for the benefit of topers then unborn Peter needed no cordial to sustain his hopes and therefore kept the wine to gladden his success Many half pence did he pick up that had been lost through the cracks of the floor and some few Spanish coins and the half of a broken sixpence which had doubtless been a love token There was likewise a silver coronation medal of George III But old Peter Goldthwaite s strong box fled from one dark corner to another or otherwise eluded the second Peter s clutches till should he seek much farther he must burrow into the earth We will not follow him in his triumphant progress step by step Suffice it that Peter worked like a steam engine and finished in that one winter the job which all the former inhabitants of the house with time and the elements to aid them had only half done in a century Except the kitchen every room and chamber was now gutted The house was nothing but a shell the apparition of a house as unreal as the painted edifices of a theatre It was like the perfect rind of a great cheese in which a mouse had dwelt and nibbled till it was a cheese no more And Peter was the mouse What Peter had torn down Tabitha had burnt up for she wisely considered that without a house they should need no wood to warm it and therefore economy was nonsense Thus the whole house might be said to have dissolved in smoke and flown up among the clouds through the great black flue of the kitchen chimney It was an admirable parallel to the feat of the man who jumped down his own throat On the night between the last day of winter and the first of spring every chink and cranny had been ransacked except within the precincts of the kitchen This fated evening was an ugly one A snow storm had set in some hours before and was still driven and tossed about the atmosphere by a real hurricane which fought against the house as if the prince of the air in person were putting the final stroke to Peter s labors The framework being so much weakened and the inward props removed it would have been no marvel if in some stronger wrestle of the blast the rotten walls of the edifice and all the peaked roofs had come crashing down upon the owner s head He however was careless of the peril but as wild and restless as the night itself or as the flame that quivered up the chimney at each roar of the tempestuous wind The wine Tabitha he cried my grandfather s rich old wine We will drink it now Tabitha arose from her smoke blackened bench in the chimney corner and placed the bottle before Peter close beside the old brass lamp which had likewise been the prize of his researches Peter held it before his eyes and looking through the liquid medium beheld the kitchen illuminated with a golden glory which also enveloped Tabitha and gilded her silver hair and converted her mean garments into robes of queenly splendor It reminded him of his golden dream mister Peter remarked Tabitha must the wine be drunk before the money is found The money is found exclaimed Peter with a sort of fierceness The chest is within my reach I will not sleep till I have turned this key in the rusty lock But first of all let us drink There being no corkscrew in the house he smote the neck of the bottle with old Peter Goldthwaite s rusty key and decapitated the sealed cork at a single blow He then filled two little china teacups which Tabitha had brought from the cupboard So clear and brilliant was this aged wine that it shone within the cups and rendered the sprig of scarlet flowers at the bottom of each more distinctly visible than when there had been no wine there Its rich and delicate perfume wasted itself round the kitchen Drink Tabitha cried Peter Blessings on the honest old fellow who set aside this good liquor for you and me And here s to Peter Goldthwaite s memory And good cause have we to remember him quoth Tabitha as she drank How many years and through what changes of fortune and various calamity had that bottle hoarded up its effervescent joy to be quaffed at last by two such boon companions A portion of the happiness of a former age had been kept for them and was now set free in a crowd of rejoicing visions to sport amid the storm and desolation of the present time Until they have finished the bottle we must turn our eyes elsewhere It so chanced that on this stormy night mister John Brown found himself ill at ease in his wire cushioned arm chair by the glowing grate of anthracite which heated his handsome parlor He was naturally a good sort of a man and kind and pitiful whenever the misfortunes of others happened to reach his heart through the padded vest of his own prosperity This evening he had thought much about his old partner Peter Goldthwaite his strange vagaries and continual ill luck the poverty of his dwelling at mister Brown s last visit and Peter s crazed and haggard aspect when he had talked with him at the window Poor fellow thought mister John Brown Poor crack brained Peter Goldthwaite For old acquaintance sake I ought to have taken care that he was comfortable this rough winter These feelings grew so powerful that in spite of the inclement weather he resolved to visit Peter Goldthwaite immediately The strength of the impulse was really singular Every shriek of the blast seemed a summons or would have seemed so had mister Brown been accustomed to hear the echoes of his own fancy in the wind Much amazed at such active benevolence he huddled himself in his cloak muffled his throat and ears in comforters and handkerchiefs and thus fortified bade defiance to the tempest But the powers of the air had rather the best of the battle mister Brown was just weathering the corner by Peter Goldthwaite s house when the hurricane caught him off his feet tossed him face downward into a snow bank and proceeded to bury his protuberant part beneath fresh drifts There seemed little hope of his reappearance earlier than the next thaw At the same moment his hat was snatched away and whirled aloft into some far distant region whence no tidings have as yet returned Nevertheless mister Brown contrived to burrow a passage through the snow drift and with his bare head bent against the storm floundered onward to Peter s door There was such a creaking and groaning and rattling and such an ominous shaking throughout the crazy edifice that the loudest rap would have been inaudible to those within He therefore entered without ceremony and groped his way to the kitchen His intrusion even there was unnoticed Peter and Tabitha stood with their backs to the door stooping over a large chest which apparently they had just dragged from a cavity or concealed closet on the left side of the chimney By the lamp in the old woman s hand mister Brown saw that the chest was barred and clamped with iron strengthened with iron plates and studded with iron nails so as to be a fit receptacle in which the wealth of one century might be hoarded up for the wants of another Peter Goldthwaite was inserting a key into the lock Oh Tabitha cried he with tremulous rapture how shall I endure the effulgence The gold the bright bright gold Methinks I can remember my last glance at it just as the iron plated lid fell down And ever since being seventy years it has been blazing in secret and gathering its splendor against this glorious moment It will flash upon us like the noonday sun Then shade your eyes mister Peter said Tabitha with somewhat less patience than usual But for mercy s sake do turn the key And with a strong effort of both hands Peter did force the rusty key through the intricacies of the rusty lock mister Brown in the mean time had drawn near and thrust his eager visage between those of the other two at the instant that Peter threw up the lid No sudden blaze illuminated the kitchen What s here exclaimed Tabitha adjusting her spectacles and holding the lamp over the open chest Old Peter Goldthwaite s hoard of old rags Pretty much so Tabby said mister Brown lifting a handful of the treasure Oh what a ghost of dead and buried wealth had Peter Goldthwaite raised to scare himself out of his scanty wits withal Here was the semblance of an incalculable sum enough to purchase the whole town and build every street anew but which vast as it was no sane man would have given a solid sixpence for What then in sober earnest were the delusive treasures of the chest Why here were old provincial bills of credit and treasury notes and bills of land banks and all other bubbles of the sort from the first issue above a century and a half ago down nearly to the Revolution Bills of a thousand pounds were intermixed with parchment pennies and worth no more than they And this then is old Peter Goldthwaite s treasure said John Brown Your namesake Peter was something like yourself and when the provincial currency had depreciated fifty or seventy five per cent he bought it up in expectation of a rise I have heard my grandfather say that old Peter gave his father a mortgage of this very house and land to raise cash for his silly project But the currency kept sinking till nobody would take it as a gift and there was old Peter Goldthwaite like Peter the second with thousands in his strong box and hardly a coat to his back He went mad upon the strength of it But never mind Peter it is just the sort of capital for building castles in the air The house will be down about our ears cried Tabitha as the wind shook it with increasing violence Let it fall said Peter folding his arms as he seated himself upon the chest No no my old friend Peter said John Brown I have house room for you and Tabby and a safe vault for the chest of treasure To morrow we will try to come to an agreement about the sale of this old house real estate is well up and I could afford you a pretty handsome price And I observed Peter Goldthwaite with reviving spirits have a plan for laying out the cash to great advantage Why as to that muttered John Brown to himself we must apply to the next court for a guardian to take care of the solid cash and if Peter insists upon speculating he may do it to his heart s content with old Peter Goldthwaite s treasure CHIPPINGS WITH A CHISEL Passing a summer several years since at Edgartown on the island of Martha s Vineyard I became acquainted with a certain carver of tombstones who had travelled and voyaged thither from the interior of Massachusetts in search of professional employment The speculation had turned out so successful that my friend expected to transmute slate and marble into silver and gold to the amount of at least a thousand dollars during the few months of his sojourn at Nantucket and the Vineyard The secluded life and the simple and primitive spirit which still characterizes the inhabitants of those islands especially of Martha s Vineyard insure their dead friends a longer and dearer remembrance than the daily novelty and revolving bustle of the world can elsewhere afford to beings of the past Yet while every family is anxious to erect a memorial to its departed members the untainted breath of Ocean bestows such health and length of days upon the people of the isles as would cause a melancholy dearth of business to a resident artist in that line His own monument recording his decease by starvation would probably be an early specimen of his skill Gravestones therefore have generally been an article of imported merchandise In my walks through the burial ground of Edgartown where the dead have lain so long that the soil once enriched by their decay has returned to its original barrenness in that ancient burial ground I noticed much variety of monumental sculpture The elder stones dated a century back or more have borders elaborately carved with flowers and are adorned with a multiplicity of death s heads crossbones scythes hour glasses and other lugubrious emblems of mortality with here and there a winged cherub to direct the mourner s spirit upward These productions of Gothic taste must have been quite beyond the colonial skill of the day and were probably carved in London and brought across the ocean to commemorate the defunct worthies of this lonely isle The more recent monuments are mere slabs of slate in the ordinary style without any superfluous flourishes to set off the bald inscriptions But others and those far the most impressive both to my taste and feelings were roughly hewn from the gray rocks of the island evidently by the unskilled hands of surviving friends and relatives On some there were merely the initials of a name some were inscribed with misspelt prose or rhyme in deep letters which the moss and wintry rain of many years had not been able to obliterate These these were graves where loved ones slept It is an old theme of satire the falsehood and vanity of monumental eulogies but when affection and sorrow grave the letters with their own painful labor then we may be sure that they copy from the record on their hearts My acquaintance the sculptor he may share that title with Greenough since the dauber of signs is a painter as well as Raphael had found a ready market for all his blank slabs of marble and full occupation in lettering and ornamenting them He was an elderly man a descendant of the old Puritan family of Wigglesworth with a certain simplicity and singleness both of heart and mind which methinks is more rarely found among us Yankees than in any other community of people In spite of his gray head and wrinkled brow he was quite like a child in all matters save what had some reference to his own business he seemed unless my fancy misled me to view mankind in no other relation than as people in want of tombstones and his literary attainments evidently comprehended very little either of prose of poetry which had not at one time or other been inscribed on slate or marble His sole task and office among the immortal pilgrims of the tomb the duty for which Providence had sent the old man into the world as it were with a chisel in his hand was to label the dead bodies lest their names should be forgotten at the resurrection Yet he had not failed within a narrow scope to gather a few sprigs of earthly and more than earthly wisdom the harvest of many a grave And lugubrious as his calling might appear he was as cheerful an old soul as health and integrity and lack of care could make him and used to set to work upon one sorrowful inscription or another with that sort of spirit which impels a man to sing at his labor On the whole I found mister Wigglesworth an entertaining and often instructive if not an interesting character and partly for the charm of his society and still more because his work has an invariable attraction for man that is born of woman I was accustomed to spend some hours a day at his workshop The quaintness of his remarks and their not infrequent truth a truth condensed and pointed by the limited sphere of his view gave a raciness to his talk which mere worldliness and general cultivation would at once have destroyed Sometimes we would discuss the respective merits of the various qualities of marble numerous slabs of which were resting against the walls of the shop or sometimes an hour or two would pass quietly without a word on either side while I watched how neatly his chisel struck out letter after letter of the names of the Nortons the Mayhews the Luces the Daggets and other immemorial families of the Vineyard Often with an artist s pride the good old sculptor would speak of favorite productions of his skill which were scattered throughout the village graveyards of New England But my chief and most instructive amusement was to witness his interviews with his customers who held interminable consultations about the form and fashion of the desired monuments the buried excellence to be commemorated the anguish to be expressed and finally the lowest price in dollars and cents for which a marble transcript of their feelings might be obtained Really my mind received many fresh ideas which perhaps may remain in it even longer than mister Wigglesworth s hardest marble will retain the deepest strokes of his chisel An elderly lady came to bespeak a monument for her first love who had been killed by a whale in the Pacific Ocean no less than forty years before It was singular that so strong an impression of early feeling should have survived through the changes of her subsequent life in the course of which she had been a wife and a mother and so far as I could judge a comfortable and happy woman Reflecting within myself it appeared to me that this lifelong sorrow as in all good faith she deemed it was one of the most fortunate circumstances of her history It had given an ideality to her mind it had kept her purer and less earthy than she would otherwise have been by drawing a portion of her sympathies apart from earth Amid the throng of enjoyments and the pressure of worldly care and all the warm materialism of this life she had communed with a vision and had been the better for such intercourse Faithful to the husband of her maturity and loving him with a far more real affection than she ever could have felt for this dream of her girlhood there had still been an imaginative faith to the ocean buried so that an ordinary character had thus been elevated and refined Her sighs had been the breath of Heaven to her soul The good lady earnestly desired that the proposed monument should be ornamented with a carved border of marine plants interwined with twisted sea shells such as were probably waving over her lover s skeleton or strewn around it in the far depths of the Pacific But mister Wigglesworth s chisel being inadequate to the task she was forced to content herself with a rose hanging its head from a broken stem After her departure I remarked that the symbol was none of the most apt And yet said my friend the sculptor embodying in this image the thoughts that had been passing through my own mind that broken rose has shed its sweet smell through forty years of the good woman s life It was seldom that I could find such pleasant food for contemplation as in the above instance None of the applicants I think affected me more disagreeably than an old man who came with his fourth wife hanging on his arm to bespeak gravestones for the three former occupants of his marriage bed I watched with some anxiety to see whether his remembrance of either were more affectionate than of the other two but could discover no symptom of the kind The three monuments were all to be of the same material and form and each decorated in bas relief with two weeping willows one of these sympathetic trees bending over its fellow which was to be broken in the midst and rest upon a sepulchral urn This indeed was mister Wigglesworth s standing emblem of conjugal bereavement I shuddered at the gray polygamist who had so utterly lost the holy sense of individuality in wedlock that methought he was fain to reckon upon his fingers how many women who had once slept by his side were now sleeping in their graves There was even if I wrong him it is no great matter a glance sidelong at his living spouse as if he were inclined to drive a thriftier bargain by bespeaking four gravestones in a lot I was better pleased with a rough old whaling captain who gave directions for a broad marble slab divided into two compartments one of which was to contain an epitaph on his deceased wife and the other to be left vacant till death should engrave his own name there As is frequently the case among the whalers of Martha s Vineyard so much of this storm beaten widower s life had been tossed away on distant seas that out of twenty years of matrimony he had spent scarce three and those at scattered intervals beneath his own roof Thus the wife of his youth though she died in his and her declining age retained the bridal dewdrops fresh around her memory My observations gave me the idea and mister Wigglesworth confirmed it that husbands were more faithful in setting up memorials to their dead wives than widows to their dead husbands I was not ill natured enough to fancy that women less than men feel so sure of their own constancy as to be willing to give a pledge of it in marble It is more probably the fact that while men are able to reflect upon their lost companions as remembrances apart from themselves women on the other hand are conscious that a portion of their being has gone with the departed whithersoever he has gone Soul clings to soul the living dust has a sympathy with the dust of the grave and by the very strength of that sympathy the wife of the dead shrinks the more sensitively from reminding the world of its existence The link is already strong enough it needs no visible symbol And though a shadow walks ever by her side and the touch of a chill hand is on her bosom yet life and perchance its natural yearnings may still be warm within her and inspire her with new hopes of happiness Then would she mark out the grave the scent of which would be perceptible on the pillow of the second bridal No but rather level its green mound with the surrounding earth as if when she dug up again her buried heart the spot had ceased to be a grave Yet in spite of these sentimentalities I was prodigiously amused by an incident of which I had not the good fortune to be a witness but which mister Wigglesworth related with considerable humor A gentlewoman of the town receiving news of her husband s loss at sea had bespoken a handsome slab of marble and came daily to watch the progress of my friend s chisel One afternoon when the good lady and the sculptor were in the very midst of the epitaph which the departed spirit might have been greatly comforted to read who should walk into the workshop but the deceased himself in substance as well as spirit He had been picked up at sea and stood in no present need of tombstone or epitaph And how inquired I did his wife bear the shock of joyful surprise Why said the old man deepening the grin of a death s head on which his chisel was just then employed I really felt for the poor woman it was one of my best pieces of marble and to be thrown away on a living man A comely woman with a pretty rosebud of a daughter came to select a gravestone for a twin daughter who had died a month before I was impressed with the different nature of their feelings for the dead The mother was calm and woefully resigned fully conscious of her loss as of a treasure which she had not always possessed and therefore had been aware that it might be taken from her but the daughter evidently had no real knowledge of what Death s doings were Her thoughts knew but not her heart It seemed to me that by the print and pressure which the dead sister had left upon the survivor s spirit her feelings were almost the same as if she still stood side by side and arm in arm with the departed looking at the slabs of marble and once or twice she glanced around with a sunny smile which as its sister smile had faded for ever soon grew confusedly overshadowed Perchance her consciousness was truer than her reflection perchance her dead sister was a closer companion than in life The mother and daughter talked a long while with mister Wigglesworth about a suitable epitaph and finally chose an ordinary verse of ill matched rhymes which had already been inscribed upon innumerable tombstones But when we ridicule the triteness of monumental verses we forget that Sorrow reads far deeper in them than we can and finds a profound and individual purport in what seems so vague and inexpressive unless interpreted by her She makes the epitaph anew though the selfsame words may have served for a thousand graves And yet said I afterward to mister Wigglesworth they might have made a better choice than this While you were discussing the subject I was struck by at least a dozen simple and natural expressions from the lips of both mother and daughter One of these would have formed an inscription equally original and appropriate No no replied the sculptor shaking his head there is a good deal of comfort to be gathered from these little old scraps of poetry and so I always recommend them in preference to any new fangled ones And somehow they seem to stretch to suit a great grief and shrink to fit a small one It was not seldom that ludicrous images were excited by what took place between mister Wigglesworth and his customers A shrewd gentlewoman who kept a tavern in the town was anxious to obtain two or three gravestones for the deceased members of her family and to pay for these solemn commodities by taking the sculptor to board Hereupon a fantasy arose in my mind of good mister Wigglesworth sitting down to dinner at a broad flat tombstone carving one of his own plump little marble cherubs gnawing a pair of crossbones and drinking out of a hollow death s head or perhaps a lachrymatory vase or sepulchral urn while his hostess s dead children waited on him at the ghastly banquet On communicating this nonsensical picture to the old man he laughed heartily and pronounced my humor to be of the right sort I have lived at such a table all my days said he and eaten no small quantity of slate and marble Hard fare rejoined I smiling but you seemed to have found it excellent of digestion too A man of fifty or thereabouts with a harsh unpleasant countenance ordered a stone for the grave of his bitter enemy with whom he had waged warfare half a lifetime to their mutual misery and ruin The secret of this phenomenon was that hatred had become the sustenance and enjoyment of the poor wretch s soul it had supplied the place of all kindly affections it had been really a bond of sympathy between himself and the man who shared the passion and when its object died the unappeasable foe was the only mourner for the dead He expressed a purpose of being buried side by side with his enemy I doubt whether their dust will mingle remarked the old sculptor to me for often there was an earthliness in his conceptions Oh yes replied I who had mused long upon the incident and when they rise again these bitter foes may find themselves dear friends Methinks what they mistook for hatred was but love under a mask A gentleman of antiquarian propensities provided a memorial for an Indian of Chabbiquidick one of the few of untainted blood remaining in that region and said to be a hereditary chieftain descended from the sachem who welcomed Governor Mayhew to the Vineyard mister Wiggles worth exerted his best skill to carve a broken bow and scattered sheaf of arrows in memory of the hunters and warriors whose race was ended here but he likewise sculptured a cherub to denote that the poor Indian had shared the Christian s hope of immortality Why observed I taking a perverse view of the winged boy and the bow and arrows it looks more like Cupid s tomb than an Indian chief s You talk nonsense said the sculptor with the offended pride of art He then added with his usual good nature How can Cupid die when there are such pretty maidens in the Vineyard Very true answered I and for the rest of the day I thought of other matters than tombstones At our next meeting I found him chiselling an open book upon a marble headstone and concluded that it was meant to express the erudition of some black letter clergyman of the Cotton Mather school It turned out however to be emblematical of the scriptural knowledge of an old woman who had never read anything but her Bible and the monument was a tribute to her piety and good works from the orthodox church of which she had been a member In strange contrast with this Christian woman s memorial was that of an infidel whose gravestone by his own direction bore an avowal of his belief that the spirit within him would be extinguished like a flame and that the nothingness whence he sprang would receive him again mister Wigglesworth consulted me as to the propriety of enabling a dead man s dust to utter this dreadful creed If I thought said he that a single mortal would read the inscription without a shudder my chisel should never cut a letter of it But when the grave speaks such falsehoods the soul of man will know the truth by its own horror So it will said I struck by the idea The poor infidel may strive to preach blasphemies from his grave but it will be only another method of impressing the soul with a consciousness of immortality There was an old man by the name of Norton noted throughout the island for his great wealth which he had accumulated by the exercise of strong and shrewd faculties combined with a most penurious disposition This wretched miser conscious that he had not a friend to be mindful of him in his grave had himself taken the needful precautions for posthumous remembrance by bespeaking an immense slab of white marble with a long epitaph in raised letters the whole to be as magnificent as mister Wigglesworth s skill could make it There was something very characteristic in this contrivance to have his money s worth even from his own tombstone which indeed afforded him more enjoyment in the few months that he lived thereafter than it probably will in a whole century now that it is laid over his bones This incident reminds me of a young girl a pale slender feeble creature most unlike the other rosy and healthful damsels of the Vineyard amid whose brightness she was fading away Day after day did the poor maiden come to the sculptor s shop and pass from one piece of marble to another till at last she pencilled her name upon a slender slab which I think was of a more spotless white than all the rest I saw her no more but soon afterward found mister Wigglesworth cutting her virgin name into the stone which she had chosen She is dead poor girl said he interrupting the tune which he was whistling and she chose a good piece of stuff for her headstone Now which of these slabs would you like best to see your own name upon Why to tell you the truth my good mister Wigglesworth replied I after a moment s pause for the abruptness of the question had somewhat startled me to be quite sincere with you I care little or nothing about a stone for my own grave and am somewhat inclined to scepticism as to the propriety of erecting monuments at all over the dust that once was human The weight of these heavy marbles though unfelt by the dead corpse or the enfranchised soul presses drearily upon the spirit of the survivor and causes him to connect the idea of death with the dungeon like imprisonment of the tomb instead of with the freedom of the skies Every gravestone that you ever made is the visible symbol of a mistaken system Our thoughts should soar upward with the butterfly not linger with the exuviae that confined him In truth and reason neither those whom we call the living and still less the departed have anything to do with the grave I never heard anything so heathenish said mister Wigglesworth perplexed and displeased at sentiments which controverted all his notions and feelings and implied the utter waste and worse of his whole life s labor Would you forget your dead friends the moment they are under the sod They are not under the sod I rejoined then why should I mark the spot where there is no treasure hidden Forget them No but to remember them aright I would forget what they have cast off And to gain the truer conception of death I would forget the grave But still the good old sculptor murmured and stumbled as it were over the gravestones amid which he had walked through life Whether he were right or wrong I had grown the wiser from our companionship and from my observations of nature and character as displayed by those who came with their old griefs or their new ones to get them recorded upon his slabs of marble And yet with my gain of wisdom I had likewise gained perplexity for there was a strange doubt in my mind whether the dark shadowing of this life the sorrows and regrets have not as much real comfort in them leaving religious influences out of the question as what we term life s joys THE SHAKER BRIDAL One day in the sick chamber of Father Ephraim who had been forty years the presiding elder over the Shaker settlement at Goshen there was an assemblage of several of the chief men of the sect Individuals had come from the rich establishment at Lebanon from Canterbury Harvard and Alfred and from all the other localities where this strange people have fertilized the rugged hills of New England by their systematic industry An elder was likewise there who had made a pilgrimage of a thousand miles from a village of the faithful in Kentucky to visit his spiritual kindred the children of the sainted Mother Ann He had partaken of the homely abundance of their tables had quaffed the far famed Shaker cider and had joined in the sacred dance every step of which is believed to alienate the enthusiast from earth and bear him onward to heavenly purity and bliss His brethren of the North had now courteously invited him to be present on an occasion when the concurrence of every eminent member of their community was peculiarly desirable The venerable Father Ephraim sat in his easy chair not only hoary headed and infirm with age but worn down by a lingering disease which it was evident would very soon transfer his patriarchal staff to other hands At his footstool stood a man and woman both clad in the Shaker garb My brethren said Father Ephraim to the surrounding elders feebly exerting himself to utter these few words here are the son and daughter to whom I would commit the trust of which Providence is about to lighten my weary shoulders Read their faces I pray you and say whether the inward movement of the spirit hath guided my choice aright Accordingly each elder looked at the two candidates with a most scrutinizing gaze The man whose name was Adam Colburn had a face sunburnt with labor in the fields yet intelligent thoughtful and traced with cares enough for a whole lifetime though he had barely reached middle age There was something severe in his aspect and a rigidity throughout his person characteristics that caused him generally to be taken for a schoolmaster which vocation in fact he had formerly exercised for several years The woman Martha Pierson was somewhat above thirty thin and pale as a Shaker sister almost invariably is and not entirely free from that corpse like appearance which the garb of the sisterhood is so well calculated to impart This pair are still in the summer of their years observed the elder from Harvard a shrewd old man I would like better to see the hoar frost of autumn on their heads Methinks also they will be exposed to peculiar temptations on account of the carnal desires which have heretofore subsisted between them Nay brother said the elder from Canterbury the hoar frost and the black frost hath done its work on Brother Adam and Sister Martha even as we sometimes discern its traces in our cornfields while they are yet green And why should we question the wisdom of our venerable Father s purpose although this pair in their early youth have loved one another as the world s people love Are there not many brethren and sisters among us who have lived long together in wedlock yet adopting our faith find their hearts purified from all but spiritual affection Whether or no the early loves of Adam and Martha had rendered it inexpedient that they should now preside together over a Shaker village it was certainly most singular that such should be the final result of many warm and tender hopes Children of neighboring families their affection was older even than their school days it seemed an innate principle interfused among all their sentiments and feelings and not so much a distinct remembrance as connected with their whole volume of remembrances But just as they reached a proper age for their union misfortunes had fallen heavily on both and made it necessary that they should resort to personal labor for a bare subsistence Even under these circumstances Martha Pierson would probably have consented to unite her fate with Adam Colburn s and secure of the bliss of mutual love would patiently have awaited the less important gifts of Fortune But Adam being of a calm and cautious character was loth to relinquish the advantages which a single man possesses for raising himself in the world Year after year therefore their marriage had been deferred Adam Colburn had followed many vocations had travelled far and seen much of the world and of life Martha had earned her bread sometimes as a sempstress sometimes as help to a farmer s wife sometimes as schoolmistress of the village children sometimes as a nurse or watcher of the sick thus acquiring a varied experience the ultimate use of which she little anticipated But nothing had gone prosperously with either of the lovers at no subsequent moment would matrimony have been so prudent a measure as when they had first parted in the opening bloom of life to seek a better fortune Still they had held fast their mutual faith Martha might have been the wife of a man who sat among the senators of his native State and Adam could have won the hand as he had unintentionally won the heart of a rich and comely widow But neither of them desired good fortune save to share it with the other At length that calm despair which occurs only in a strong and somewhat stubborn character and yields to no second spring of hope settled down on the spirit of Adam Colburn He sought an interview with Martha and proposed that they should join the Society of Shakers The converts of this sect are oftener driven within its hospitable gates by worldly misfortune than drawn thither by fanaticism and are received without inquisition as to their motives Martha faithful still had placed her hand in that of her lover and accompanied him to the Shaker village Here the natural capacity of each cultivated and strengthened by the difficulties of their previous lives had soon gained them an important rank in the society whose members are generally below the ordinary standard of intelligence Their faith and feelings had in some degree become assimilated to those of their fellow worshippers Adam Colburn gradually acquired reputation not only in the management of the temporal affairs of the society but as a clear and efficient preacher of their doctrines Martha was not less distinguished in the duties proper to her sex Finally when the infirmities of Father Ephraim had admonished him to seek a successor in his patriarchal office he thought of Adam and Martha and proposed to renew in their persons the primitive form of Shaker government as established by Mother Ann They were to be the father and mother of the village The simple ceremony which would constitute them such was now to be performed Son Adam and daughter Martha said the venerable Father Ephraim fixing his aged eyes piercingly upon them if ye can conscientiously undertake this charge speak that the brethren may not doubt of your fitness Father replied Adam speaking with the calmness of his character I came to your village a disappointed man weary of the world worn out with continual trouble seeking only a security against evil fortune as I had no hope of good Even my wishes of worldly success were almost dead within me I came hither as a man might come to a tomb willing to lie down in its gloom and coldness for the sake of its peace and quiet There was but one earthly affection in my breast and it had grown calmer since my youth so that I was satisfied to bring Martha to be my sister in our new abode We are brother and sister nor would I have it otherwise And in this peaceful village I have found all that I hope for all that I desire I will strive with my best strength for the spiritual and temporal good of our community My conscience is not doubtful in this matter I am ready to receive the trust Thou hast spoken well son Adam said the father God will bless thee in the office which I am about to resign But our sister observed the elder from Harvard Hath she not likewise a gift to declare her sentiments Martha started and moved her lips as if she would have made a formal reply to this appeal But had she attempted it perhaps the old recollections the long repressed feelings of childhood youth and womanhood might have gushed from her heart in words that it would have been profanation to utter there Adam has spoken said she hurriedly his sentiments are likewise mine But while speaking these few words Martha grew so pale that she looked fitter to be laid in her coffin than to stand in the presence of Father Ephraim and the elders she shuddered also as if there were something awful or horrible in her situation and destiny It required indeed a more than feminine strength of nerve to sustain the fixed observance of men so exalted and famous throughout the Beet as these were They had overcome their natural sympathy with human frailties and affections One when he joined the society had brought with him his wife and children but never from that hour had spoken a fond word to the former or taken his best loved child upon his knee Another whose family refused to follow him had been enabled such was his gift of holy fortitude to leave them to the mercy of the world The youngest of the elders a man of about fifty had been bred from infancy in a Shaker village and was said never to have clasped a woman s hand in his own and to have no conception of a closer tie than the cold fraternal one of the sect Old Father Ephraim was the most awful character of all In his youth he had been a dissolute libertine but was converted by Mother Ann herself and had partaken of the wild fanaticism of the early Shakers Tradition whispered at the firesides of the village that Mother Ann had been compelled to sear his heart of flesh with a red hot iron before it could be purified from earthly passions However that might be poor Martha had a woman s heart and a tender one and it quailed within her as she looked round at those strange old men and from them to the calm features of Adam Colburn But perceiving that the elders eyed her doubtfully she gasped for breath and again spoke With what strength is left me by my many troubles said she I am ready to undertake this charge and to do my best in it My children join your hands said Father Ephraim They did so The elders stood up around and the father feebly raised himself to a more erect position but continued sitting in his great chair I have bidden you to join your hands said he not in earthly affection for ye have cast off its chains for ever but as brother and sister in spiritual love and helpers of one another in your allotted task Teach unto others the faith which ye have received Open wide your gates I deliver you the keys thereof open them wide to all who will give up the iniquities of the world and come hither to lead lives of purity and peace Receive the weary ones who have known the vanity of earth receive the little children that they may never learn that miserable lesson And a blessing be upon your labors so that the time may hasten on when the mission of Mother Ann shall have wrought its full effect when children shall no more be born and die and the last survivor of mortal race some old and weary man like me shall see the sun go down nevermore to rise on a world of sin and sorrow The aged father sank back exhausted and the surrounding elders deemed with good reason that the hour was come when the new heads of the village must enter on their patriarchal duties In their attention to Father Ephraim their eyes were turned from Martha Pierson who grew paler and paler unnoticed even by Adam Colburn He indeed had withdrawn his hand from hers and folded his arms with a sense of satisfied ambition But paler and paler grew Martha by his side till like a corpse in its burial clothes she sank down at the feet of her early lover for after many trials firmly borne her heart could endure the weight of its desolate agony no longer NIGHT SKETCHES BENEATH AN UMBRELLA Pleasant is a rainy winter s day within doors The best study for such a day or the best amusement call it what you will is a book of travels describing scenes the most unlike that sombre one which is mistily presented through the windows I have experienced that Fancy is then most successful in imparting distinct shapes and vivid colors to the objects which the author has spread upon his page and that his words become magic spells to summon up a thousand varied pictures Strange landscapes glimmer through the familiar walls of the room and outlandish figures thrust themselves almost within the sacred precincts of the hearth Small as my chamber is it has space enough to contain the ocean like circumference of an Arabian desert its parched sands tracked by the long line of a caravan with the camels patiently journeying through the heavy sunshine Though my ceiling be not lofty yet I can pile up the mountains of Central Asia beneath it till their summits shine far above the clouds of the middle atmosphere And with my humble means a wealth that is not taxable I can transport hither the magnificent merchandise of an Oriental bazaar and call a crowd of purchasers from distant countries to pay a fair profit for the precious articles which are displayed on all sides True it is however that amid the bustle of traffic or whatever else may seem to be going on around me the raindrops will occasionally be heard to patter against my window panes which look forth upon one of the quietest streets in a New England town After a time too the visions vanish and will not appear again at my bidding Then it being nightfall a gloomy sense of unreality depresses my spirits and impels me to venture out before the clock shall strike bedtime to satisfy myself that the world is not entirely made up of such shadowy materials as have busied me throughout the day A dreamer may dwell so long among fantasies that the things without him will seem as unreal as those within When eve has fairly set in therefore I sally forth tightly buttoning my shaggy overcoat and hoisting my umbrella the silken dome of which immediately resounds with the heavy drumming of the invisible raindrops Pausing on the lowest doorstep I contrast the warmth and cheerfulness of my deserted fireside with the drear obscurity and chill discomfort into which I am about to plunge Now come fearful auguries innumerable as the drops of rain Did not my manhood cry shame upon me I should turn back within doors resume my elbow chair my slippers and my book pass such an evening of sluggish enjoyment as the day has been and go to bed inglorious The same shivering reluctance no doubt has quelled for a moment the adventurous spirit of many a traveller when his feet which were destined to measure the earth around were leaving their last tracks in the home paths In my own case poor human nature may be allowed a few misgivings I look upward and discern no sky not even an unfathomable void but only a black impenetrable nothingness as though heaven and all its lights were blotted from the system of the universe It is as if Nature were dead and the world had put on black and the clouds were weeping for her With their tears upon my cheek I turn my eyes earthward but find little consolation here below A lamp is burning dimly at the distant corner and throws just enough of light along the street to show and exaggerate by so faintly showing the perils and difficulties which beset my path Yonder dingily white remnant of a huge snowbank which will yet cumber the sidewalk till the latter days of March over or through that wintry waste must I stride onward Beyond lies a certain Slough of Despond a concoction of mud and liquid filth ankle deep leg deep neck deep in a word of unknown bottom on which the lamplight does not even glimmer but which I have occasionally watched in the gradual growth of its horrors from morn till nightfall Should I flounder into its depths farewell to upper earth And hark how roughly resounds the roaring of a stream the turbulent career of which is partially reddened by the gleam of the lamp but elsewhere brawls noisily through the densest gloom Oh should I be swept away in fording that impetuous and unclean torrent the coroner will have a job with an unfortunate gentleman who would fain end his troubles anywhere but in a mud puddle Pshaw I will linger not another instant at arm s length from these dim terrors which grow more obscurely formidable the longer I delay to grapple with them Now for the onset and lo with little damage save a dash of rain in the face and breast a splash of mud high up the pantaloons and the left boot full of ice cold water behold me at the corner of the street The lamp throws down a circle of red light around me and twinkling onward from corner to corner I discern other beacons marshalling my way to a brighter scene But this is a lonesome and dreary spot The tall edifices bid gloomy defiance to the storm with their blinds all closed even as a man winks when he faces a spattering gust How loudly tinkles the collected rain down the tin spouts The puffs of wind are boisterous and seem to assail me from various quarters at once I have often observed that this corner is a haunt and loitering place for those winds which have no work to do upon the deep dashing ships against our iron bound shores nor in the forest tearing up the sylvan giants with half a rood of soil at their vast roots Here they amuse themselves with lesser freaks of mischief See at this moment how they assail yonder poor woman who is passing just within the verge of the lamplight One blast struggles for her umbrella and turns it wrong side outward another whisks the cape of her cloak across her eyes while a third takes most unwarrantable liberties with the lower part of her attire Happily the good dame is no gossamer but a figure of rotundity and fleshly substance else would these aerial tormentors whirl her aloft like a witch upon a broomstick and set her down doubtless in the filthiest kennel hereabout From hence I tread upon firm pavements into the centre of the town Here there is almost as brilliant an illumination as when some great victory has been won either on the battlefield or at the polls Two rows of shops with windows down nearly to the ground cast a glow from side to side while the black night hangs overhead like a canopy and thus keeps the splendor from diffusing itself away The wet sidewalks gleam with a broad sheet of red light The raindrops glitter as if the sky were pouring down rubies The spouts gush with fire Methinks the scene is an emblem of the deceptive glare which mortals throw around their footsteps in the moral world thus bedazzling themselves till they forget the impenetrable obscurity that hems them in and that can be dispelled only by radiance from above And after all it is a cheerless scene and cheerless are the wanderers in it Here comes one who has so long been familiar with tempestuous weather that he takes the bluster of the storm for a friendly greeting as if it should say How fare ye brother He is a retired sea captain wrapped in some nameless garment of the pea jacket order and is now laying his course toward the marine insurance office there to spin yarns of gale and shipwreck with a crew of old seadogs like himself The blast will put in its word among their hoarse voices and be understood by all of them Next I meet an unhappy slipshod gentleman with a cloak flung hastily over his shoulders running a race with boisterous winds and striving to glide between the drops of rain Some domestic emergency or other has blown this miserable man from his warm fireside in quest of a doctor See that little vagabond How carelessly he has taken his stand right underneath a spout while staring at some object of curiosity in a shop window Surely the rain is his native element he must have fallen with it from the clouds as frogs are supposed to do Here is a picture and a pretty one a young man and a girl both enveloped in cloaks and huddled beneath the scanty protection of a cotton umbrella She wears rubber overshoes but he is in his dancing pumps and they are on their way no doubt to some cotillon party or subscription ball at a dollar a head refreshments included Thus they struggle against the gloomy tempest lured onward by a vision of festal splendor But ah a most lamentable disaster Bewildered by the red blue and yellow meteors in an apothecary s window they have stepped upon a slippery remnant of ice and are precipitated into a confluence of swollen floods at the corner of two streets Luckless lovers Were it my nature to be other than a looker on in life I would attempt your rescue Since that may not be I vow should you be drowned to weave such a pathetic story of your fate as shall call forth tears enough to drown you both anew Do ye touch bottom my young friends Yes they emerge like a water nymph and a river deity and paddle hand in hand out of the depths of the dark pool They hurry homeward dripping disconsolate abashed but with love too warm to be chilled by the cold water They have stood a test which proves too strong for many Faithful though over head and ears in trouble Onward I go deriving a sympathetic joy or sorrow from the varied aspect of mortal affairs even as my figure catches a gleam from the lighted windows or is blackened by an interval of darkness Not that mine is altogether a chameleon spirit with no hue of its own Now I pass into a more retired street where the dwellings of wealth and poverty are intermingled presenting a range of strongly contrasted pictures Here too may be found the golden mean Through yonder casement I discern a family circle the grandmother the parents and the children all flickering shadow like in the glow of a wood fire Bluster fierce blast and beat thou wintry rain against the window panes Ye cannot damp the enjoyment of that fireside Surely my fate is hard that I should be wandering homeless here taking to my bosom night and storm and solitude instead of wife and children Peace murmurer Doubt not that darker guests are sitting round the hearth though the warm blaze hides all but blissful images Well here is still a brighter scene a stately mansion illuminated for a ball with cut glass chandeliers and alabaster lamps in every room and sunny landscapes hanging round the walls See a coach has stopped whence emerges a slender beauty who canopied by two umbrellas glides within the portal and vanishes amid lightsome thrills of music Will she ever feel the night wind and the rain Perhaps perhaps And will Death and Sorrow ever enter that proud mansion As surely as the dancers will be gay within its halls to night Such thoughts sadden yet satisfy my heart for they teach me that the poor man in this mean weatherbeaten hovel without a fire to cheer him may call the rich his brother brethren by Sorrow who must be an inmate of both their households brethren by Death who will lead them both to other homes Onward still onward I plunge into the night Now have I reached the utmost limits of the town where the last lamp struggles feebly with the darkness like the farthest star that stands sentinel on the borders of uncreated space It is strange what sensations of sublimity may spring from a very humble source Such are suggested by this hollow roar of a subterranean cataract where the mighty stream of a kennel precipitates itself beneath an iron grate and is seen no more on earth Listen a while to its voice of mystery and Fancy will magnify it till you start and smile at the illusion And now another sound the rumbling of wheels as the mail coach outward bound rolls heavily off the pavements and splashes through the mud and water of the road All night long the poor passengers will be tossed to and fro between drowsy watch and troubled sleep and will dream of their own quiet beds and awake to find themselves still jolting onward Happier my lot who will straightway hie me to my familiar room and toast myself comfortably before the fire musing and fitfully dozing and fancying a strangeness in such sights as all may see But first let me gaze at this solitary figure who comes hitherward with a tin lantern which throws the circular pattern of its punched holes on the ground about him He passes fearlessly into the unknown gloom whither I will not follow him This figure shall supply me with a moral wherewith for lack of a more appropriate one I may wind up my sketch He fears not to tread the dreary path before him because his lantern which was kindled at the fireside of his home will light him back to that same fireside again And thus we night wanderers through a stormy and dismal world if we bear the lamp of Faith enkindled at a celestial fire it will surely lead us home to that heaven whence its radiance was borrowed ENDICOTT AND THE RED CROSS At noon of an autumnal day more than two centuries ago the English colors were displayed by the standard bearer of the Salem train band which had mustered for martial exercise under the orders of John Endicott It was a period when the religious exiles were accustomed often to buckle on their armor and practise the handling of their weapons of war Since the first settlement of New England its prospects had never been so dismal The dissensions between Charles I and his subjects were then and for several years afterward confined to the floor of Parliament The measures of the king and ministry were rendered more tyrannically violent by an opposition which had not yet acquired sufficient confidence in its own strength to resist royal injustice with the sword The bigoted and haughty primate Laud archbishop of Canterbury controlled the religious affairs of the realm and was consequently invested with powers which might have wrought the utter ruin of the two Puritan colonies Plymouth and Massachusetts There is evidence on record that our forefathers perceived their danger but were resolved that their infant country should not fall without a struggle even beneath the giant strength of the king s right arm Such was the aspect of the times when the folds of the English banner with the red cross in its field were flung out over a company of Puritans Their leader the famous Endicott was a man of stern and resolute countenance the effect of which was heightened by a grizzled beard that swept the upper portion of his breastplate This piece of armor was so highly polished that the whole surrounding scene had its image in the glittering steel The central object in the mirrored picture was an edifice of humble architecture with neither steeple nor bell to proclaim it what nevertheless it was the house of prayer A token of the perils of the wilderness was seen in the grim head of a wolf which had just been slain within the precincts of the town and according to the regular mode of claiming the bounty was nailed on the porch of the meeting house The blood was still plashing on the doorstep There happened to be visible at the same noontide hour so many other characteristics of the times and manners of the Puritans that we must endeavor to represent them in a sketch though far less vividly than they were reflected in the polished breastplate of John Endicott In close vicinity to the sacred edifice appeared that important engine of Puritanic authority the whipping post with the soil around it well trodden by the feet of evil doers who had there been disciplined At one corner of the meeting house was the pillory and at the other the stocks and by a singular good fortune for our sketch the head of an Episcopalian and suspected Catholic was grotesquely encased in the former machine while a fellow criminal who had boisterously quaffed a health to the king was confined by the legs in the latter Side by side on the meeting house steps stood a male and a female figure The man was a tall lean haggard personification of fanaticism bearing on his breast this label A WANTON GOSPELLER which betokened that he had dared to give interpretations of Holy Writ unsanctioned by the infallible judgment of the civil and religious rulers His aspect showed no lack of zeal to maintain his heterodoxies even at the stake The woman wore a cleft stick on her tongue in appropriate retribution for having wagged that unruly member against the elders of the church and her countenance and gestures gave much cause to apprehend that the moment the stick should be removed a repetition of the offence would demand new ingenuity in chastising it The above mentioned individuals had been sentenced to undergo their various modes of ignominy for the space of one hour at noonday But among the crowd were several whose punishment would be lifelong some whose ears had been cropped like those of puppy dogs others whose cheeks had been branded with the initials of their misdemeanors one with his nostrils slit and seared and another with a halter about his neck which he was forbidden ever to take off or to conceal beneath his garments Methinks he must have been grievously tempted to affix the other end of the rope to some convenient beam or bough There was likewise a young woman with no mean share of beauty whose doom it was to wear the letter A on the breast of her gown in the eyes of all the world and her own children And even her own children knew what that initial signified Sporting with her infamy the lost and desperate creature had embroidered the fatal token in scarlet cloth with golden thread and the nicest art of needlework so that the capital A might have been thought to mean Admirable or anything rather than Adulteress Let not the reader argue from any of these evidences of iniquity that the times of the Puritans were more vicious than our own when as we pass along the very street of this sketch we discern no badge of infamy on man or woman It was the policy of our ancestors to search out even the most secret sins and expose them to shame without fear or favor in the broadest light of the noonday sun Were such the custom now perchance we might find materials for a no less piquant sketch than the above Except the malefactors whom we have described and the diseased or infirm persons the whole male population of the town between sixteen years and sixty were seen in the ranks of the train band A few stately savages in all the pomp and dignity of the primeval Indian stood gazing at the spectacle Their flint headed arrows were but childish weapons compared with the matchlocks of the Puritans and would have rattled harmlessly against the steel caps and hammered iron breastplates which enclosed each soldier in an individual fortress The valiant John Endicott glanced with an eye of pride at his sturdy followers and prepared to renew the martial toils of the day Come my stout hearts quoth he drawing his sword Let us show these poor heathen that we can handle our weapons like men of might Well for them if they put us not to prove it in earnest The iron breasted company straightened their line and each man drew the heavy butt of his matchlock close to his left foot thus awaiting the orders of the captain But as Endicott glanced right and left along the front he discovered a personage at some little distance with whom it behoved him to hold a parley It was an elderly gentleman wearing a black cloak and band and a high crowned hat beneath which was a velvet skull cap the whole being the garb of a Puritan minister This reverend person bore a staff which seemed to have been recently cut in the forest and his shoes were bemired as if he had been travelling on foot through the swamps of the wilderness His aspect was perfectly that of a pilgrim heightened also by an apostolic dignity Just as Endicott perceived him he laid aside his staff and stooped to drink at a bubbling fountain which gushed into the sunshine about a score of yards from the corner of the meeting house But ere the good man drank he turned his face heavenward in thankfulness and then holding back his gray beard with one hand he scooped up his simple draught in the hollow of the other What ho good mister Williams shouted Endicott You are welcome back again to our town of peace How does our worthy Governor Winthrop And what news from Boston The governor hath his health worshipful sir answered Roger Williams now resuming his staff and drawing near And for the news here is a letter which knowing I was to travel hitherward to day His Excellency committed to my charge Belike it contains tidings of much import for a ship arrived yesterday from England mister Williams the minister of Salem and of course known to all the spectators had now reached the spot where Endicott was standing under the banner of his company and put the governor s epistle into his hand The broad seal was impressed with Winthrop s coat of arms Endicott hastily unclosed the letter and began to read while as his eye passed down the page a wrathful change came over his manly countenance The blood glowed through it till it seemed to be kindling with an internal heat nor was it unnatural to suppose that his breastplate would likewise become red hot with the angry fire of the bosom which it covered Arriving at the conclusion he shook the letter fiercely in his hand so that it rustled as loud as the flag above his head Black tidings these mister Williams said he blacker never came to New England Doubtless you know their purport Yea truly replied Roger Williams for the governor consulted respecting this matter with my brethren in the ministry at Boston and my opinion was likewise asked And His Excellency entreats you by me that the news be not suddenly noised abroad lest the people be stirred up unto some outbreak and thereby give the king and the archbishop a handle against us The governor is a wise man a wise man and a meek and moderate said Endicott setting his teeth grimly Nevertheless I must do according to my own best judgment There is neither man woman nor child in New England but has a concern as dear as life in these tidings and if John Endicott s voice be loud enough man woman and child shall hear them Soldiers wheel into a hollow square Ho good people Here are news for one and all of you The soldiers closed in around their captain and he and Roger Williams stood together under the banner of the red cross while the women and the aged men pressed forward and the mothers held up their children to look Endicott in the face A few taps of the drum gave signal for silence and attention Fellow soldiers fellow exiles began Endicott speaking under strong excitement yet powerfully restraining it wherefore did ye leave your native country Wherefore I say have we left the green and fertile fields the cottages or perchance the old gray halls where we were born and bred the churchyards where our forefathers lie buried Wherefore have we come hither to set up our own tombstones in a wilderness A howling wilderness it is The wolf and the bear meet us within halloo of our dwellings The savage lieth in wait for us in the dismal shadow of the woods The stubborn roots of the trees break our ploughshares when we would till the earth Our children cry for bread and we must dig in the sands of the seashore to satisfy them Wherefore I say again have we sought this country of a rugged soil and wintry sky Was it not for the enjoyment of our civil rights Was it not for liberty to worship God according to our conscience Call you this liberty of conscience interrupted a voice on the steps of the meeting house It was the wanton gospeller A sad and quiet smile flitted across the mild visage of Roger Williams but Endicott in the excitement of the moment shook his sword wrathfully at the culprit an ominous gesture from a man like him What hast thou to do with conscience thou knave cried he I said liberty to worship God not license to profane and ridicule him Break not in upon my speech or I will lay thee neck and heels till this time to morrow Hearken to me friends nor heed that accursed rhapsodist As I was saying we have sacrificed all things and have come to a land whereof the Old World hath scarcely heard that we might make a new world unto ourselves and painfully seek a path from hence to heaven But what think ye now This son of a Scotch tyrant this grandson of a papistical and adulterous Scotch woman whose death proved that a golden crown doth not always save an anointed head from the block Nay brother nay interposed mister Williams thy words are not meet for a secret chamber far less for a public street Hold thy peace Roger Williams answered Endicott imperiously My spirit is wiser than thine for the business now in hand I tell ye fellow exiles that Charles of England and Laud our bitterest persecutor arch priest of Canterbury are resolute to pursue us even hither They are taking counsel saith this letter to send over a governor general in whose breast shall be deposited all the law and equity of the land They are minded also to establish the idolatrous forms of English episcopacy so that when Laud shall kiss the pope s toe as cardinal of Rome he may deliver New England bound hand and foot into the power of his master A deep groan from the auditors a sound of wrath as well as fear and sorrow responded to this intelligence Look ye to it brethren resumed Endicott with increasing energy If this king and this arch prelate have their will we shall briefly behold a cross on the spire of this tabernacle which we have builded and a high altar within its walls with wax tapers burning round it at noon day We shall hear the sacring bell and the voices of the Romish priests saying the mass But think ye Christian men that these abominations may be suffered without a sword drawn without a shot fired without blood spilt yea on the very stairs of the pulpit No Be ye strong of hand and stout of heart Here we stand on our own soil which we have bought with our goods which we have won with our swords which we have cleared with our axes which we have tilled with the sweat of our brows which we have sanctified with our prayers to the God that brought us hither Who shall enslave us here What have we to do with this mitred prelate with this crowned king What have we to do with England Endicott gazed round at the excited countenances of the people now full of his own spirit and then turned suddenly to the standard bearer who stood close behind him Officer lower your banner said he The officer obeyed and brandishing his sword Endicott thrust it through the cloth and with his left hand rent the red cross completely out of the banner He then waved the tattered ensign above his head Sacrilegious wretch cried the high churchman in the pillory unable longer to restrain himself thou hast rejected the symbol of our holy religion Treason treason roared the royalist in the stocks He hath defaced the king s banner Before God and man I will avouch the deed answered Endicott Beat a flourish drummer shout soldiers and people in honor of the ensign of New England Neither pope nor tyrant hath part in it now With a cry of triumph the people gave their sanction to one of the boldest exploits which our history records And for ever honored be the name of Endicott We look back through the mist of ages and recognize in the rending of the red cross from New England s banner the first omen of that deliverance which our fathers consummated after the bones of the stern Puritan had lain more than a century in the dust THE LILY S QUEST AN APOLOGUE Two lovers once upon a time had planned a little summer house in the form of an antique temple which it was their purpose to consecrate to all manner of refined and innocent enjoyments There they would hold pleasant intercourse with one another and the circle of their familiar friends there they would give festivals of delicious fruit there they would hear lightsome music intermingled with the strains of pathos which make joy more sweet there they would read poetry and fiction and permit their own minds to flit away in day dreams and romance there in short for why should we shape out the vague sunshine of their hopes there all pure delights were to cluster like roses among the pillars of the edifice and blossom ever new and spontaneously So one breezy and cloudless afternoon Adam Forrester and Lilias Fay set out upon a ramble over the wide estate which they were to possess together seeking a proper site for their temple of happiness They were themselves a fair and happy spectacle fit priest and priestess for such a shrine although making poetry of the pretty name of Lilias Adam Forrester was wont to call her Lily because her form was as fragile and her cheek almost as pale As they passed hand in hand down the avenue of drooping elms that led from the portal of Lilias Fay s paternal mansion they seemed to glance like winged creatures through the strips of sunshine and to scatter brightness where the deep shadows fell But setting forth at the same time with this youthful pair there was a dismal figure wrapped in a black velvet cloak that might have been made of a coffin pall and with a sombre hat such as mourners wear drooping its broad brim over his heavy brows Glancing behind them the lovers well knew who it was that followed but wished from their hearts that he had been elsewhere as being a companion so strangely unsuited to their joyous errand It was a near relative of Lilias Fay an old man by the name of Walter Gascoigne who had long labored under the burden of a melancholy spirit which was sometimes maddened into absolute insanity and always had a tinge of it What a contrast between the young pilgrims of bliss and their unbidden associate They looked as if moulded of heaven s sunshine and he of earth s gloomiest shade they flitted along like Hope and Joy roaming hand in hand through life while his darksome figure stalked behind a type of all the woeful influences which life could fling upon them But the three had not gone far when they reached a spot that pleased the gentle Lily and she paused What sweeter place shall we find than this said she Why should we seek farther for the site of our temple It was indeed a delightful spot of earth though undistinguished by any very prominent beauties being merely a nook in the shelter of a hill with the prospect of a distant lake in one direction and of a church spire in another There were vistas and pathways leading onward and onward into the green woodlands and vanishing away in the glimmering shade The temple if erected here would look toward the west so that the lovers could shape all sorts of magnificent dreams out of the purple violet and gold of the sunset sky and few of their anticipated pleasures were dearer than this sport of fantasy Yes said Adam Forrester we might seek all day and find no lovelier spot We will build our temple here But their sad old companion who had taken his stand on the very site which they proposed to cover with a marble floor shook his head and frowned and the young man and the Lily deemed it almost enough to blight the spot and desecrate it for their airy temple that his dismal figure had thrown its shadow there He pointed to some scattered stones the remnants of a former structure and to flowers such as young girls delight to nurse in their gardens but which had now relapsed into the wild simplicity of nature Not here cried old Walter Gascoigne Here long ago other mortals built their temple of happiness seek another site for yours What exclaimed Lilias Fay Have any ever planned such a temple save ourselves Poor child said her gloomy kinsman In one shape or other every mortal has dreamed your dream Then he told the lovers how not indeed an antique temple but a dwelling had once stood there and that a dark clad guest had dwelt among its inmates sitting for ever at the fireside and poisoning all their household mirth Under this type Adam Forrester and Lilias saw that the old man spake of sorrow He told of nothing that might not be recorded in the history of almost every household and yet his hearers felt as if no sunshine ought to fall upon a spot where human grief had left so deep a stain or at least that no joyous temple should be built there This is very sad said the Lily sighing Well there are lovelier spots than this said Adam Forrester soothingly spots which sorrow has not blighted So they hastened away and the melancholy Gascoigne followed them looking as if he had gathered up all the gloom of the deserted spot and was bearing it as a burden of inestimable treasure But still they rambled on and soon found themselves in a rocky dell through the midst of which ran a streamlet with ripple and foam and a continual voice of inarticulate joy It was a wild retreat walled on either side with gray precipices which would have frowned somewhat too sternly had not a profusion of green shrubbery rooted itself into their crevices and wreathed gladsome foliage around their solemn brows But the chief joy of the dell was in the little stream which seemed like the presence of a blissful child with nothing earthly to do save to babble merrily and disport itself and make every living soul its playfellow and throw the sunny gleams of its spirit upon all Here here is the spot cried the two lovers with one voice as they reached a level space on the brink of a small cascade This glen was made on purpose for our temple And the glad song of the brook will be always in our ears said Lilias Fay And its long melody shall sing the bliss of our lifetime said Adam Forrester Ye must build no temple here murmured their dismal companion And there again was the old lunatic standing just on the spot where they meant to rear their lightsome dome and looking like the embodied symbol of some great woe that in forgotten days had happened there And alas there had been woe nor that alone A young man more than a hundred years before had lured hither a girl that loved him and on this spot had murdered her and washed his bloody hands in the stream which sang so merrily and ever since the victim s death shrieks were often heard to echo between the cliffs And see cried old Gascoigne is the stream yet pure from the stain of the murderer s hands Methinks it has a tinge of blood faintly answered the Lily and being as slight as the gossamer she trembled and clung to her lover s arm whispering Let us flee from this dreadful vale Come then said Adam Forrester as cheerily as he could we shall soon find a happier spot They set forth again young pilgrims on that quest which millions which every child of earth has tried in turn And were the Lily and her lover to be more fortunate than all those millions For a long time it seemed not so The dismal shape of the old lunatic still glided behind them and for every spot that looked lovely in their eyes he had some legend of human wrong or suffering so miserably sad that his auditors could never afterward connect the idea of joy with the place where it had happened Here a heartbroken woman kneeling to her child had been spurned from his feet here a desolate old creature had prayed to the evil one and had received a fiendish malignity of soul in answer to her prayer here a new born infant sweet blossom of life had been found dead with the impress of its mother s fingers round its throat and here under a shattered oak two lovers had been stricken by lightning and fell blackened corpses in each other s arms The dreary Gascoigne had a gift to know whatever evil and lamentable thing had stained the bosom of Mother Earth and when his funereal voice had told the tale it appeared like a prophecy of future woe as well as a tradition of the past And now by their sad demeanor you would have fancied that the pilgrim lovers were seeking not a temple of earthly joy but a tomb for themselves and their posterity Where in this world exclaimed Adam Forrester despondingly shall we build our temple of happiness Where in this world indeed repeated Lilias Fay and being faint and weary the more so by the heaviness of her heart the Lily drooped her head and sat down on the summit of a knoll repeating Where in this world shall we build our temple Ah have you already asked yourselves that question said their companion his shaded features growing even gloomier with the smile that dwelt on them Yet there is a place even in this world where ye may build it While the old man spoke Adam Forrester and Lilias had carelessly thrown their eyes around and perceived that the spot where they had chanced to pause possessed a quiet charm which was well enough adapted to their present mood of mind It was a small rise of ground with a certain regularity of shape that had perhaps been bestowed by art and a group of trees which almost surrounded it threw their pensive shadows across and far beyond although some softened glory of the sunshine found its way there The ancestral mansion wherein the lovers would dwell together appeared on one side and the ivied church where they were to worship on another Happening to cast their eyes on the ground they smiled yet with a sense of wonder to see that a pale lily was growing at their feet We will build our temple here said they simultaneously and with an indescribable conviction that they had at last found the very spot Yet while they uttered this exclamation the young man and the Lily turned an apprehensive glance at their dreary associate deeming it hardly possible that some tale of earthly affliction should not make those precincts loathsome as in every former case The old man stood just behind them so as to form the chief figure in the group with his sable cloak muffling the lower part of his visage and his sombre hat overshadowing his brows But he gave no word of dissent from their purpose and an inscrutable smile was accepted by the lovers as a token that here had been no footprint of guilt or sorrow to desecrate the site of their temple of happiness In a little time longer while summer was still in its prime the fairy structure of the temple arose on the summit of the knoll amid the solemn shadows of the trees yet often gladdened with bright sunshine It was built of white marble with slender and graceful pillars supporting a vaulted dome and beneath the centre of this dome upon a pedestal was a slab of dark veined marble on which books and music might be strewn But there was a fantasy among the people of the neighborhood that the edifice was planned after an ancient mausoleum and was intended for a tomb and that the central slab of dark veined marble was to be inscribed with the names of buried ones They doubted too whether the form of Lilias Fay could appertain to a creature of this earth being so very delicate and growing every day more fragile so that she looked as if the summer breeze should snatch her up and waft her heavenward But still she watched the daily growth of the temple and so did old Walter Gascoigne who now made that spot his continual haunt leaning whole hours together on his staff and giving as deep attention to the work as though it had been indeed a tomb In due time it was finished and a day appointed for a simple rite of dedication On the preceding evening after Adam Forrester had taken leave of his mistress he looked back toward the portal of her dwelling and felt a strange thrill of fear for he imagined that as the setting sunbeams faded from her figure she was exhaling away and that something of her ethereal substance was withdrawn with each lessening gleam of light With his farewell glance a shadow had fallen over the portal and Lilias was invisible His foreboding spirit deemed it an omen at the time and so it proved for the sweet earthly form by which the Lily had been manifested to the world was found lifeless the next morning in the temple with her head resting on her arms which were folded upon the slab of dark veined marble The chill winds of the earth had long since breathed a blight into this beautiful flower so that a loving hand had now transplanted it to blossom brightly in the garden of Paradise But alas for the temple of happiness In his unutterable grief Adam Forrester had no purpose more at heart than to convert this temple of many delightful hopes into a tomb and bury his dead mistress there And lo a wonder Digging a grave beneath the temple s marble floor the sexton found no virgin earth such as was meet to receive the maiden s dust but an ancient sepulchre in which were treasured up the bones of generations that had died long ago Among those forgotten ancestors was the Lily to be laid and when the funeral procession brought Lilias thither in her coffin they beheld old Walter Gascoigne standing beneath the dome of the temple with his cloak of pall and face of darkest gloom and wherever that figure might take its stand the spot would seem a sepulchre He watched the mourners as they lowered the coffin down And so said he to Adam Forrester with the strange smile in which his insanity was wont to gleam forth you have found no better foundation for your happiness than on a grave But as the shadow of Affliction spoke a vision of hope and joy had its birth in Adam s mind even from the old man s taunting words for then he knew what was betokened by the parable in which the Lily and himself had acted and the mystery of life and death was opened to him Joy joy he cried throwing his arms toward heaven On a grave be the site of our temple and now our happiness is for eternity With those words a ray of sunshine broke through the dismal sky and glimmered down into the sepulchre while at the same moment the shape of old Walter Gascoigne stalked drearily away because his gloom symbolic of all earthly sorrow might no longer abide there now that the darkest riddle of humanity was read FOOTPRINTS ON THE SEASHORE It must be a spirit much unlike my own which can keep itself in health and vigor without sometimes stealing from the sultry sunshine of the world to plunge into the cool bath of solitude At intervals and not infrequent ones the forest and the ocean summon me one with the roar of its waves the other with the murmur of its boughs forth from the haunts of men But I must wander many a mile ere I could stand beneath the shadow of even one primeval tree much less be lost among the multitude of hoary trunks and hidden from the earth and sky by the mystery of darksome foliage Nothing is within my daily reach more like a forest than the acre or two of woodland near some suburban farmhouse When therefore the yearning for seclusion becomes a necessity within me I am drawn to the seashore which extends its line of rude rocks and seldom trodden sands for leagues around our bay Setting forth at my last ramble on a September morning I bound myself with a hermit s vow to interchange no thoughts with man or woman to share no social pleasure but to derive all that day s enjoyment from shore and sea and sky from my soul s communion with these and from fantasies and recollections or anticipated realities Surely here is enough to feed a human spirit for a single day Farewell then busy world Till your evening lights shall shine along the street till they gleam upon my sea flushed face as I tread homeward free me from your ties and let me be a peaceful outlaw Highways and cross paths are hastily traversed and clambering down a crag I find myself at the extremity of a long beach How gladly does the spirit leap forth and suddenly enlarge its sense of being to the full extent of the broad blue sunny deep A greeting and a homage to the sea I descend over its margin and dip my hand into the wave that meets me and bathe my brow That far resounding roar is Ocean s voice of welcome His salt breath brings a blessing along with it Now let us pace together the reader s fancy arm in arm with mine this noble beach which extends a mile or more from that craggy promontory to yonder rampart of broken rocks In front the sea in the rear a precipitous bank the grassy verge of which is breaking away year after year and flings down its tufts of verdure upon the barrenness below The beach itself is a broad space of sand brown and sparkling with hardly any pebbles intermixed Near the water s edge there is a wet margin which glistens brightly in the sunshine and reflects objects like a mirror and as we tread along the glistening border a dry spot flashes around each footstep but grows moist again as we lift our feet In some spots the sand receives a complete impression of the sole square toe and all elsewhere it is of such marble firmness that we must stamp heavily to leave a print even of the iron shod heel Along the whole of this extensive beach gambols the surf wave Now it makes a feint of dashing onward in a fury yet dies away with a meek murmur and does but kiss the strand now after many such abortive efforts it rears itself up in an unbroken line heightening as it advances without a speck of foam on its green crest With how fierce a roar it flings itself forward and rushes far up the beach As I threw my eyes along the edge of the surf I remember that I was startled as Robinson Crusoe might have been by the sense that human life was within the magic circle of my solitude Afar off in the remote distance of the beach appearing like sea nymphs or some airier things such as might tread upon the feathery spray was a group of girls Hardly had I beheld them when they passed into the shadow of the rocks and vanished To comfort myself for truly I would fain have gazed a while longer I made acquaintance with a flock of beach birds These little citizens of the sea and air preceded me by about a stone s throw along the strand seeking I suppose for food upon its margin Yet with a philosophy which mankind would do well to imitate they drew a continual pleasure from their toil for a subsistence The sea was each little bird s great playmate They chased it downward as it swept back and again ran up swiftly before the impending wave which sometimes overtook them and bore them off their feet But they floated as lightly as one of their own feathers on the breaking crest In their airy flutterings they seemed to rest on the evanescent spray Their images long legged little figures with gray backs and snowy bosoms were seen as distinctly as the realities in the mirror of the glistening strand As I advanced they flew a score or two of yards and again alighting recommenced their dalliance with the surf wave and thus they bore me company along the beach the types of pleasant fantasies till at its extremity they took wing over the ocean and were gone After forming a friendship with these small surf spirits it is really worth a sigh to find no memorial of them save their multitudinous little tracks in the sand When we have paced the length of the beach it is pleasant and not unprofitable to retrace our steps and recall the whole mood and occupation of the mind during the former passage Our tracks being all discernible will guide us with an observing consciousness through every unconscious wandering of thought and fancy Here we followed the surf in its reflux to pick up a shell which the sea seemed loth to relinquish Here we found a seaweed with an immense brown leaf and trailed it behind us by its long snake like stalk Here we seized a live horseshoe by the tail and counted the many claws of that queer monster Here we dug into the sand for pebbles and skipped them upon the surface of the water Here we wet our feet while examining a jelly fish which the waves having just tossed it up now sought to snatch away again Here we trod along the brink of a fresh water brooklet which flows across the beach becoming shallower and more shallow till at last it sinks into the sand and perishes in the effort to bear its little tribute to the main Here some vagary appears to have bewildered us for our tracks go round and round and are confusedly intermingled as if we had found a labyrinth upon the level beach And here amid our idle pastime we sat down upon almost the only stone that breaks the surface of the sand and were lost in an unlooked for and overpowering conception of the majesty and awfulness of the great deep Thus by tracking our footprints in the sand we track our own nature in its wayward course and steal a glance upon it when it never dreams of being so observed Such glances always make us wiser This extensive beach affords room for another pleasant pastime With your staff you may write verses love verses if they please you best and consecrate them with a woman s name Here too may be inscribed thoughts feelings desires warm outgushings from the heart s secret places which you would not pour upon the sand without the certainty that almost ere the sky has looked upon them the sea will wash them out Stir not hence till the record be effaced Now for there is room enough on your canvas draw huge faces huge as that of the Sphynx on Egyptian sands and fit them with bodies of corresponding immensity and legs which might stride halfway to yonder island Child s play becomes magnificent on so grand a scale But after all the most fascinating employment is simply to write your name in the sand Draw the letters gigantic so that two strides may barely measure them and three for the long strokes cut deep that the record may be permanent Statesmen and warriors and poets have spent their strength in no better cause than this Is it accomplished Return then in an hour or two and seek for this mighty record of a name The sea will have swept over it even as time rolls its effacing waves over the names of statesmen and warriors and poets Hark the surf wave laughs at you Passing from the beach I begin to clamber over the crags making my difficult way among the ruins of a rampart shattered and broken by the assaults of a fierce enemy The rocks rise in every variety of attitude Some of them have their feet in the foam and are shagged halfway upward with seaweed some have been hollowed almost into caverns by the unwearied toil of the sea which can afford to spend centuries in wearing away a rock or even polishing a pebble One huge rock ascends in monumental shape with a face like a giant s tombstone on which the veins resemble inscriptions but in an unknown tongue We will fancy them the forgotten characters of an antediluvian race or else that Nature s own hand has here recorded a mystery which could I read her language would make mankind the wiser and the happier How many a thing has troubled me with that same idea Pass on and leave it unexplained Here is a narrow avenue which might seem to have been hewn through the very heart of an enormous crag affording passage for the rising sea to thunder back and forth filling it with tumultuous foam and then leaving its floor of black pebbles bare and glistening In this chasm there was once an intersecting vein of softer stone which the waves have gnawed away piecemeal while the granite walls remain entire on either side How sharply and with what harsh clamor does the sea rake back the pebbles as it momentarily withdraws into its own depths At intervals the floor of the chasm is left nearly dry but anon at the outlet two or three great waves are seen struggling to get in at once two hit the walls athwart while one rushes straight through and all three thunder as if with rage and triumph They heap the chasm with a snow drift of foam and spray While watching this scene I can never rid myself of the idea that a monster endowed with life and fierce energy is striving to burst his way through the narrow pass And what a contrast to look through the stormy chasm and catch a glimpse of the calm bright sea beyond Many interesting discoveries may be made among these broken cliffs Once for example I found a dead seal which a recent tempest had tossed into the nook of the rocks where his shaggy carcase lay rolled in a heap of eel grass as if the sea monster sought to hide himself from my eye Another time a shark seemed on the point of leaping from the surf to swallow me nor did I wholly without dread approach near enough to ascertain that the man eater had already met his own death from some fisherman in the bay In the same ramble I encountered a bird a large gray bird but whether a loon or a wild goose or the identical albatross of the Ancient Mariner was beyond my ornithology to decide It reposed so naturally on a bed of dry seaweed with its head beside its wing that I almost fancied it alive and trod softly lest it should suddenly spread its wings skyward But the sea bird would soar among the clouds no more nor ride upon its native waves so I drew near and pulled out one of its mottled tail feathers for a remembrance Another day I discovered an immense bone wedged into a chasm of the rocks it was at least ten feet long curved like a scymitar bejewelled with barnacles and small shellfish and partly covered with a growth of seaweed Some leviathan of former ages had used this ponderous mass as a jaw bone Curiosities of a minuter order may be observed in a deep reservoir which is replenished with water at every tide but becomes a lake among the crags save when the sea is at its height At the bottom of this rocky basin grow marine plants some of which tower high beneath the water and cast a shadow in the sunshine Small fishes dart to and fro and hide themselves among the seaweed there is also a solitary crab who appears to lead the life of a hermit communing with none of the other denizens of the place and likewise several five fingers for I know no other name than that which children give them If your imagination be at all accustomed to such freaks you may look down into the depths of this pool and fancy it the mysterious depth of ocean But where are the hulks and scattered timbers of sunken ships where the treasures that old Ocean hoards where the corroded cannon where the corpses and skeletons of seamen who went down in storm and battle On the day of my last ramble it was a September day yet as warm as summer what should I behold as I approached the above described basin but three girls sitting on its margin and yes it is veritably so laving their snowy feet in the sunny water These these are the warm realities of those three visionary shapes that flitted from me on the beach Hark their merry voices as they toss up the water with their feet They have not seen me I must shrink behind this rock and steal away again In honest truth vowed to solitude as I am there is something in this encounter that makes the heart flutter with a strangely pleasant sensation I know these girls to be realities of flesh and blood yet glancing at them so briefly they mingle like kindred creatures with the ideal beings of my mind It is pleasant likewise to gaze down from some high crag and watch a group of children gathering pebbles and pearly shells and playing with the surf as with old Ocean s hoary beard Nor does it infringe upon my seclusion to see yonder boat at anchor off the shore swinging dreamily to and fro and rising and sinking with the alternate swell while the crew four gentlemen in roundabout jackets are busy with their fishing lines But with an inward antipathy and a headlong flight do I eschew the presence of any meditative stroller like myself known by his pilgrim staff his sauntering step his shy demeanor his observant yet abstracted eye From such a man as if another self had scared me I scramble hastily over the rocks and take refuge in a nook which many a secret hour has given me a right to call my own I would do battle for it even with the churl that should produce the title deeds Have not my musings melted into its rocky walls and sandy floor and made them a portion of myself It is a recess in the line of cliffs walled round by a rough high precipice which almost encircles and shuts in a little space of sand In front the sea appears as between the pillars of a portal in the rear the precipice is broken and intermixed with earth which gives nourishment not only to clinging and twining shrubs but to trees that grip the rock with their naked roots and seem to struggle hard for footing and for soil enough to live upon These are fir trees but oaks hang their heavy branches from above and throw down acorns on the beach and shed their withering foliage upon the waves At this autumnal season the precipice is decked with variegated splendor Trailing wreaths of scarlet flaunt from the summit downward tufts of yellow flowering shrubs and rose bushes with their reddened leaves and glossy seed berries sprout from each crevice at every glance I detect some new light or shade of beauty all contrasting with the stern gray rock A rill of water trickles down the cliff and fills a little cistern near the base I drain it at a draught and find it fresh and pure This recess shall be my dining hall And what the feast A few biscuits made savory by soaking them in sea water a tuft of samphire gathered from the beach and an apple for the dessert By this time the little rill has filled its reservoir again and as I quaff it I thank God more heartily than for a civic banquet that he gives me the healthful appetite to make a feast of bread and water Dinner being over I throw myself at length upon the sand and basking in the sunshine let my mind disport itself at will The walls of this my hermitage have no tongue to tell my follies though I sometimes fancy that they have ears to hear them and a soul to sympathize There is a magic in this spot Dreams haunt its precincts and flit around me in broad sunlight nor require that sleep shall blindfold me to real objects ere these be visible Here can I frame a story of two lovers and make their shadows live before me and be mirrored in the tranquil water as they tread along the sand leaving no footprints Here should I will it I can summon up a single shade and be myself her lover Yes dreamer but your lonely heart will be the colder for such fancies Sometimes too the Past comes back and finds me here and in her train come faces which were gladsome when I knew them yet seem not gladsome now Would that my hiding place were lonelier so that the Past might not find me Get ye all gone old friends and let me listen to the murmur of the sea a melancholy voice but less sad than yours Of what mysteries is it telling Of sunken ships and whereabouts they lie Of islands afar and undiscovered whose tawny children are unconscious of other islands and of continents and deem the stars of heaven their nearest neighbors Nothing of all this What then Has it talked for so many ages and meant nothing all the while No for those ages find utterance in the sea s unchanging voice and warn the listener to withdraw his interest from mortal vicissitudes and let the infinite idea of eternity pervade his soul This is wisdom and therefore will I spend the next half hour in shaping little boats of driftwood and launching them on voyages across the cove with the feather of a sea gull for a sail If the voice of ages tell me true this is as wise an occupation as to build ships of five hundred tons and launch them forth upon the main bound to Far Cathay Yet how would the merchant sneer at me And after all can such philosophy be true Methinks I could find a thousand arguments against it Well then let yonder shaggy rock mid deep in the surf see he is somewhat wrathful he rages and roars and foams let that tall rock be my antagonist and let me exercise my oratory like him of Athens who bandied words with an angry sea and got the victory My maiden speech is a triumphant one for the gentleman in seaweed has nothing to offer in reply save an immitigable roaring His voice indeed will be heard a long while after mine is hushed Once more I shout and the cliffs reverberate the sound Oh what joy for a shy man to feel himself so solitary that he may lift his voice to its highest pitch without hazard of a listener But hush Be silent my good friend Whence comes that stifled laughter It was musical but how should there be such music in my solitude Looking upward I catch a glimpse of three faces peeping from the summit of the cliff like angels between me and their native sky Ah fair girls you may make yourself merry at my eloquence but it was my turn to smile when I saw your white feet in the pool Let us keep each other s secrets The sunshine has now passed from my hermitage except a gleam upon the sand just where it meets the sea A crowd of gloomy fantasies will come and haunt me if I tarry longer here in the darkening twilight of these gray rocks This is a dismal place in some moods of the mind Climb we therefore the precipice and pause a moment on the brink gazing down into that hollow chamber by the deep where we have been what few can be sufficient to our own pastime Yes say the word outright self sufficient to our own happiness How lonesome looks the recess now and dreary too like all other spots where happiness has been There lies my shadow in the departing sunshine with its head upon the sea I will pelt it with pebbles A hit a hit I clap my hands in triumph and see my shadow clapping its unreal hands and claiming the triumph for itself What a simpleton must I have been all day since my own shadow makes a mock of my fooleries Homeward homeward It is time to hasten home It is time it is time for as the sun sinks over the western wave the sea grows melancholy and the surf has a saddened tone The distant sails appear astray and not of earth in their remoteness amid the desolate waste My spirit wanders forth afar but finds no resting place and comes shivering back It is time that I were hence But grudge me not the day that has been spent in seclusion which yet was not solitude since the great sea has been my companion and the little sea birds my friends and the wind has told me his secrets and airy shapes have flitted around me in my hermitage Such companionship works an effect upon a man s character as if he had been admitted to the society of creatures that are not mortal And when at noontide I tread the crowded streets the influence of this day will still be felt so that I shall walk among men kindly and as a brother with affection and sympathy but yet shall not melt into the indistinguishable mass of humankind I shall think my own thoughts and feel my own emotions and possess my individuality unviolated But it is good at the eve of such a day to feel and know that there are men and women in the world That feeling and that knowledge are mine at this moment for on the shore far below me the fishing party have landed from their skiff and are cooking their scaly prey by a fire of driftwood kindled in the angle of two rude rocks The three visionary girls are likewise there In the deepening twilight while the surf is dashing near their hearth the ruddy gleam of the fire throws a strange air of comfort over the wild cove bestrewn as it is with pebbles and seaweed and exposed to the melancholy main Moreover as the smoke climbs up the precipice it brings with it a savory smell from a pan of fried fish and a black kettle of chowder and reminds me that my dinner was nothing but bread and water and a tuft of samphire and an apple Methinks the party might find room for another guest at that flat rock which serves them for a table and if spoons be scarce I could pick up a clam shell on the beach They see me now and the blessing of a hungry man upon him one of them sends up a hospitable shout Halloo Sir Solitary Come down and sup with us The ladies wave their handkerchiefs Can I decline No and be it owned after all my solitary joys that this is the sweetest moment of a day by the seashore EDWARD FANE S ROSEBUD There is hardly a more difficult exercise of fancy than while gazing at a figure of melancholy age to recreate its youth and without entirely obliterating the identity of form and features to restore those graces which Time has snatched away Some old people especially women so age worn and woeful are they seem never to have been young and gay It is easier to conceive that such gloomy phantoms were sent into the world as withered and decrepit as we behold them now with sympathies only for pain and grief to watch at death beds and weep at funerals Even the sable garments of their widowhood appear essential to their existence all their attributes combine to render them darksome shadows creeping strangely amid the sunshine of human life Yet it is no unprofitable task to take one of these doleful creatures and set Fancy resolutely at work to brighten the dim eye and darken the silvery locks and paint the ashen cheek with rose color and repair the shrunken and crazy form till a dewy maiden shall be seen in the old matron s elbow chair The miracle being wrought then let the years roll back again each sadder than the last and the whole weight of age and sorrow settle down upon the youthful figure Wrinkles and furrows the handwriting of Time may thus be deciphered and found to contain deep lessons of thought and feeling Such profit might be derived by a skilful observer from my much respected friend the Widow Toothaker a nurse of great repute who has breathed the atmosphere of sick chambers and dying breaths these forty years See she sits cowering over her lonesome hearth with her gown and upper petticoat drawn upward gathering thriftily into her person the whole warmth of the fire which now at nightfall begins to dissipate the autumnal chill of her chamber The blaze quivers capriciously in front alternately glimmering into the deepest chasms of her wrinkled visage and then permitting a ghostly dimness to mar the outlines of her venerable figure And Nurse Toothaker holds a teaspoon in her right hand with which to stir up the contents of a tumbler in her left whence steams a vapory fragrance abhorred of temperance societies Now she sips now stirs now sips again Her sad old heart has need to be revived by the rich infusion of Geneva which is mixed half and half with hot water in the tumbler All day long she has been sitting by a death pillow and quitted it for her home only when the spirit of her patient left the clay and went homeward too But now are her melancholy meditations cheered and her torpid blood warmed and her shoulders lightened of at least twenty ponderous years by a draught from the true fountain of youth in a case bottle It is strange that men should deem that fount a fable when its liquor fills more bottles than the Congress water Sip it again good nurse and see whether a second draught will not take off another score of years and perhaps ten more and show us in your high backed chair the blooming damsel who plighted troths with Edward Fane Get you gone Age and Widowhood Come back unwedded Youth But alas the charm will not work In spite of Fancy s most potent spell I can see only an old dame cowering over the fire a picture of decay and desolation while the November blast roars at her in the chimney and fitful showers rush suddenly against the window Yet there was a time when Rose Grafton such was the pretty maiden name of Nurse Toothaker possessed beauty that would have gladdened this dim and dismal chamber as with sunshine It won for her the heart of Edward Fane who has since made so great a figure in the world and is now a grand old gentleman with powdered hair and as gouty as a lord These early lovers thought to have walked hand in hand through life They had wept together for Edward s little sister Mary whom Rose tended in her sickness partly because she was the sweetest child that ever lived or died but more for love of him She was but three years old Being such an infant Death could not embody his terrors in her little corpse nor did Rose fear to touch the dead child s brow though chill as she curled the silken hair around it nor to take her tiny hand and clasp a flower within its fingers Afterward when she looked through the pane of glass in the coffin lid and beheld Mary s face it seemed not so much like death or life as like a wax work wrought into the perfect image of a child asleep and dreaming of its mother s smile Rose thought her too fair a thing to be hidden in the grave and wondered that an angel did not snatch up little Mary s coffin and bear the slumbering babe to heaven and bid her wake immortal But when the sods were laid on little Mary the heart of Rose was troubled She shuddered at the fantasy that in grasping the child s cold fingers her virgin hand had exchanged a first greeting with mortality and could never lose the earthy taint How many a greeting since But as yet she was a fair young girl with the dewdrops of fresh feeling in her bosom and instead of Rose which seemed too mature a name for her half opened beauty her lover called her Rosebud The rosebud was destined never to bloom for Edward Fane His mother was a rich and haughty dame with all the aristocratic prejudices of colonial times She scorned Rose Grafton s humble parentage and caused her son to break his faith though had she let him choose he would have prized his Rosebud above the richest diamond The lovers parted and have seldom met again Both may have visited the same mansions but not at the same time for one was bidden to the festal hall and the other to the sick chamber he was the guest of Pleasure and Prosperity and she of Anguish Rose after their separation was long secluded within the dwelling of mister Toothaker whom she married with the revengeful hope of breaking her false lover s heart She went to her bridegroom s arms with bitterer tears they say than young girls ought to shed at the threshold of the bridal chamber Yet though her husband s head was getting gray and his heart had been chilled with an autumnal frost Rose soon began to love him and wondered at her own conjugal affection He was all she had to love there were no children In a year or two poor mister Toothaker was visited with a wearisome infirmity which settled in his joints and made him weaker than a child He crept forth about his business and came home at dinner time and eventide not with the manly tread that gladdens a wife s heart but slowly feebly jotting down each dull footstep with a melancholy dub of his staff We must pardon his pretty wife if she sometimes blushed to own him Her visitors when they heard him coming looked for the appearance of some old old man but he dragged his nerveless limbs into the parlor and there was mister Toothaker The disease increasing he never went into the sunshine save with a staff in his right hand and his left on his wife s shoulder bearing heavily downward like a dead man s hand Thus a slender woman still looking maiden like she supported his tall broad chested frame along the pathway of their little garden and plucked the roses for her gray haired husband and spoke soothingly as to an infant His mind was palsied with his body its utmost energy was peevishness In a few months more she helped him up the staircase with a pause at every step and a longer one upon the landing place and a heavy glance behind as he crossed the threshold of his chamber He knew poor man that the precincts of those four walls would thenceforth be his world his world his home his tomb at once a dwelling and a burial place till he were borne to a darker and a narrower one But Rose was with him in the tomb He leaned upon her in his daily passage from the bed to the chair by the fireside and back again from the weary chair to the joyless bed his bed and hers their marriage bed till even this short journey ceased and his head lay all day upon the pillow and hers all night beside it How long poor mister Toothaker was kept in misery Death seemed to draw near the door and often to lift the latch and sometimes to thrust his ugly skull into the chamber nodding to Rose and pointing at her husband but still delayed to enter This bedridden wretch cannot escape me quoth Death I will go forth and run a race with the swift and fight a battle with the strong and come back for Toothaker at my leisure Oh when the deliverer came so near in the dull anguish of her worn out sympathies did she never long to cry Death come in But no we have no right to ascribe such a wish to our friend Rose She never failed in a wife s duty to her poor sick husband She murmured not though a glimpse of the sunny sky was as strange to her as him nor answered peevishly though his complaining accents roused her from sweetest dream only to share his wretchedness He knew her faith yet nourished a cankered jealousy and when the slow disease had chilled all his heart save one lukewarm spot which Death s frozen fingers were searching for his last words were What would my Rose have done for her first love if she has been so true and kind to a sick old man like me And then his poor soul crept away and left the body lifeless though hardly more so than for years before and Rose a widow though in truth it was the wedding night that widowed her She felt glad it must be owned when mister Toothaker was buried because his corpse had retained such a likeness to the man half alive that she hearkened for the sad murmur of his voice bidding her shift his pillow But all through the next winter though the grave had held him many a month she fancied him calling from that cold bed Rose Rose Come put a blanket on my feet So now the Rosebud was the widow Toothaker Her troubles had come early and tedious as they seemed had passed before all her bloom was fled She was still fair enough to captivate a bachelor or with a widow s cheerful gravity she might have won a widower stealing into his heart in the very guise of his dead wife But the widow Toothaker had no such projects By her watchings and continual cares her heart had become knit to her first husband with a constancy which changed its very nature and made her love him for his infirmities and infirmity for his sake When the palsied old man was gone even her early lover could not have supplied his place She had dwelt in a sick chamber and been the companion of a half dead wretch till she could scarcely breathe in a free air and felt ill at ease with the healthy and the happy She missed the fragrance of the doctor s stuff She walked the chamber with a noiseless footfall If visitors came in she spoke in soft and soothing accents and was startled and shocked by their loud voices Often in the lonesome evening she looked timorously from the fireside to the bed with almost a hope of recognizing a ghastly face upon the pillow Then went her thoughts sadly to her husband s grave If one impatient throb had wronged him in his lifetime if she had secretly repined because her buoyant youth was imprisoned with his torpid age if ever while slumbering beside him a treacherous dream had admitted another into her heart yet the sick man had been preparing a revenge which the dead now claimed On his painful pillow he had cast a spell around her his groans and misery had proved more captivating charms than gayety and youthful grace in his semblance Disease itself had won the Rosebud for a bride nor could his death dissolve the nuptials By that indissoluble bond she had gained a home in every sick chamber and nowhere else there were her brethren and sisters thither her husband summoned her with that voice which had seemed to issue from the grave of Toothaker At length she recognized her destiny We have beheld her as the maid the wife the widow now we see her in a separate and insulated character she was in all her attributes Nurse Toothaker And Nurse Toothaker alone with her own shrivelled lips could make known her experience in that capacity What a history might she record of the great sicknesses in which she has gone hand in hand with the exterminating angel She remembers when the small pox hoisted a red banner on almost every house along the street She has witnessed when the typhus fever swept off a whole household young and old all but a lonely mother who vainly shrieked to follow her last loved one Where would be Death s triumph if none lived to weep She can speak of strange maladies that have broken out as if spontaneously but were found to have been imported from foreign lands with rich silks and other merchandise the costliest portion of the cargo And once she recollects the people died of what was considered a new pestilence till the doctors traced it to the ancient grave of a young girl who thus caused many deaths a hundred years after her own burial Strange that such black mischief should lurk in a maiden s grave She loves to tell how strong men fight with fiery fevers utterly refusing to give up their breath and how consumptive virgins fade out of the world scarcely reluctant as if their lovers were wooing them to a far country Tell us thou fearful woman tell us the death secrets Fain would I search out the meaning of words faintly gasped with intermingled sobs and broken sentences half audibly spoken between earth and the judgment seat An awful woman She is the patron saint of young physicians and the bosom friend of old ones In the mansions where she enters the inmates provide themselves black garments the coffin maker follows her and the bell tolls as she comes away from the threshold Death himself has met her at so many a bedside that he puts forth his bony hand to greet Nurse Toothaker She is an awful woman And oh is it conceivable that this handmaid of human infirmity and affliction so darkly stained so thoroughly imbued with all that is saddest in the doom of mortals can ever again be bright and gladsome even though bathed in the sunshine of eternity By her long communion with woe has she not forfeited her inheritance of immortal joy Does any germ of bliss survive within her Hark an eager knocking saint Nurse Toothaker s door She starts from her drowsy reverie sets aside the empty tumbler and teaspoon and lights a lamp at the dim embers of the fire Rap rap rap again and she hurries adown the staircase wondering which of her friends can be at death s door now since there is such an earnest messenger at Nurse Toothaker s Again the peal resounds just as her hand is on the lock Be quick Nurse Toothaker cries a man on the doorstep Old General Fane is taken with the gout in his stomach and has sent for you to watch by his death bed Make haste for there is no time to lose Fane Edward Fane And has he sent for me at last I am ready I will get on my cloak and begone So adds the sable gowned ashen visaged funereal old figure Edward Fane remembers his Rosebud Our question is answered There is a germ of bliss within her Her long hoarded constancy her memory of the bliss that was remaining amid the gloom of her after life like a sweet smelling flower in a coffin is a symbol that all may be renewed In some happier clime the Rosebud may revive again with all the dewdrops in its bosom THE THREEFOLD DESTINY A FAERY LEGEND I have sometimes produced a singular and not unpleasing effect so far as my own mind was concerned by imagining a train of incidents in which the spirit and mechanism of the faery legend should be combined with the characters and manners of familiar life In the little tale which follows a subdued tinge of the wild and wonderful is thrown over a sketch of New England personages and scenery yet it is hoped without entirely obliterating the sober hues of nature Rather than a story of events claiming to be real it may be considered as an allegory such as the writers of the last century would have expressed in the shape of an Eastern tale but to which I have endeavored to give a more lifelike warmth than could be infused into those fanciful productions In the twilight of a summer eve a tall dark figure over which long and remote travel had thrown an outlandish aspect was entering a village not in faery londe but within our own familiar boundaries The staff on which this traveller leaned had been his companion from the spot where it grew in the jungles of Hindostan the hat that overshadowed his sombre brow had shielded him from the suns of Spain but his cheek had been blackened by the red hot wind of an Arabian desert and had felt the frozen breath of an Arctic region Long sojourning amid wild and dangerous men he still wore beneath his vest the ataghan which he had once struck into the throat of a Turkish robber In every foreign clime he had lost something of his New England characteristics and perhaps from every people he had unconsciously borrowed a new peculiarity so that when the world wanderer again trod the street of his native village it is no wonder that he passed unrecognized though exciting the gaze and curiosity of all Yet as his arm casually touched that of a young woman who was wending her way to an evening lecture she started and almost uttered a cry Ralph Cranfield was the name that she half articulated Can that be my old playmate Faith Egerton thought the traveller looking round at her figure but without pausing Ralph Cranfield from his youth upward had felt himself marked out for a high destiny He had imbibed the idea we say not whether it were revealed to him by witchcraft or in a dream of prophecy or that his brooding fancy had palmed its own dictates upon him as the oracles of a sybil but he had imbibed the idea and held it firmest among his articles of faith that three marvellous events of his life were to be confirmed to him by three signs The first of these three fatalities and perhaps the one on which his youthful imagination had dwelt most fondly was the discovery of the maid who alone of all the maids on earth could make him happy by her love He was to roam around the world till he should meet a beautiful woman wearing on her bosom a jewel in the shape of a heart whether of pearl or ruby or emerald or carbuncle or a changeful opal or perhaps a priceless diamond Ralph Cranfield little cared so long as it were a heart of one peculiar shape On encountering this lovely stranger he was bound to address her thus Maiden I have brought you a heavy heart May I rest its weight on you And if she were his fated bride if their kindred souls were destined to form a union here below which all eternity should only bind more closely she would reply with her finger on the heart shaped jewel This token which I have worn so long is the assurance that you may And secondly Ralph Cranfield had a firm belief that there was a mighty treasure hidden somewhere in the earth of which the burial place would be revealed to none but him When his feet should press upon the mysterious spot there would be a hand before him pointing downward whether carved of marble or hewn in gigantic dimensions on the side of a rocky precipice or perchance a hand of flame in empty air he could not tell but at least he would discern a hand the forefinger pointing downward and beneath it the Latin word Effode Dig And digging thereabouts the gold in coin or ingots the precious stones or of whatever else the treasure might consist would be certain to reward his toil The third and last of the miraculous events in the life of this high destined man was to be the attainment of extensive influence and sway over his fellow creatures Whether he were to be a king and founder of a hereditary throne or the victorious leader of a people contending for their freedom or the apostle of a purified and regenerated faith was left for futurity to show As messengers of the sign by which Ralph Cranfield might recognize the summons three venerable men were to claim audience of him The chief among them a dignified and majestic person arrayed it may be supposed in the flowing garments of an ancient sage would be the bearer of a wand or prophet s rod With this wand or rod or staff the venerable sage would trace a certain figure in the air and then proceed to make known his Heaven instructed message which if obeyed must lead to glorious results With this proud fate before him in the flush of his imaginative youth Ralph Cranfield had set forth to seek the maid the treasure and the venerable sage with his gift of extended empire And had he found them Alas it was not with the aspect of a triumphant man who had achieved a nobler destiny than all his fellows but rather with the gloom of one struggling against peculiar and continual adversity that he now passed homeward to his mother s cottage He had come back but only for a time to lay aside the pilgrim s staff trusting that his weary manhood would regain somewhat of the elasticity of youth in the spot where his threefold fate had been foreshown him There had been few changes in the village for it was not one of those thriving places where a year s prosperity makes more than the havoc of a century s decay but like a gray hair in a young man s head an antiquated little town full of old maids and aged elms and moss grown dwellings Few seemed to be the changes here The drooping elms indeed had a more majestic spread the weather blackened houses were adorned with a denser thatch of verdant moss and doubtless there were a few more gravestones in the burial ground inscribed with names that had once been familiar in the village street yet summing up all the mischief that ten years had wrought it seemed scarcely more than if Ralph Cranfield had gone forth that very morning and dreamed a day dream till the twilight and then turned back again But his heart grew cold because the village did not remember him as he remembered the village Here is the change sighed he striking his hand upon his breast Who is this man of thought and care weary with world wandering and heavy with disappointed hopes The youth returns not who went forth so joyously And now Ralph Cranfield was at his mother s gate in front of the small house where the old lady with slender but sufficient means had kept herself comfortable during her son s long absence Admitting himself within the enclosure he leaned against a great old tree trifling with his own impatience as people often do in those intervals when years are summed into a moment He took a minute survey of the dwelling its windows brightened with the sky gleam its doorway with the half of a millstone for a step and the faintly traced path waving thence to the gate He made friends again with his childhood s friend the old tree against which he leaned and glancing his eye down its trunk beheld something that excited a melancholy smile It was a half obliterated inscription the Latin word Effode which he remembered to have carved in the bark of the tree with a whole day s toil when he had first begun to muse about his exalted destiny It might be accounted a rather singular coincidence that the bark just above the inscription had put forth an excrescence shaped not unlike a hand with the forefinger pointing obliquely at the word of fate Such at least was its appearance in the dusky light Now a credulous man said Ralph Cranfield carelessly to himself might suppose that the treasure which I have sought round the world lies buried after all at the very door of my mother s dwelling That would be a jest indeed More he thought not about the matter for now the door was opened and an elderly woman appeared on the threshold peering into the dusk to discover who it might be that had intruded on her premises and was standing in the shadow of her tree It was Ralph Cranfield s mother Pass we over their greeting and leave the one to her joy and the other to his rest if quiet rest he found But when morning broke he arose with a troubled brow for his sleep and his wakefulness had alike been full of dreams All the fervor was rekindled with which he had burned of yore to unravel the threefold mystery of his fate The crowd of his early visions seemed to have awaited him beneath his mother s roof and thronged riotously around to welcome his return In the well remembered chamber on the pillow where his infancy had slumbered he had passed a wilder night than ever in an Arab tent or when he had reposed his head in the ghastly shades of a haunted forest A shadowy maid had stolen to his bedside and laid her finger on the scintillating heart a hand of flame had glowed amid the darkness pointing downward to a mystery within the earth a hoary sage had waved his prophetic wand and beckoned the dreamer onward to a chair of state The same phantoms though fainter in the daylight still flitted about the cottage and mingled among the crowd of familiar faces that were drawn thither by the news of Ralph Cranfield s return to bid him welcome for his mother s sake There they found him a tall dark stately man of foreign aspect courteous in demeanor and mild of speech yet with an abstracted eye which seemed often to snatch a glance at the invisible Meantime the widow Cranfield went bustling about the house full of joy that she again had somebody to love and be careful of and for whom she might vex and tease herself with the petty troubles of daily life It was nearly noon when she looked forth from the door and descried three personages of note coming along the street through the hot sunshine and the masses of elm tree shade At length they reached her gate and undid the latch See Ralph exclaimed she with maternal pride here is Squire Hawkwood and the two other selectmen coming on purpose to see you Now do tell them a good long story about what you have seen in foreign parts The foremost of the three visitors Squire Hawkwood was a very pompous but excellent old gentleman the head and prime mover in all the affairs of the village and universally acknowledged to be one of the sagest men on earth He wore according to a fashion even then becoming antiquated a three cornered hat and carried a silver headed cane the use of which seemed to be rather for flourishing in the air than for assisting the progress of his legs His two companions were elderly and respectable yeomen who retaining an ante Revolutionary reverence for rank and hereditary wealth kept a little in the squire s rear As they approached along the pathway Ralph Cranfield sat in an oaken elbow chair half unconsciously gazing at the three visitors and enveloping their homely figures in the misty romance that pervaded his mental world Here thought he smiling at the conceit here come three elderly personages and the first of the three is a venerable sage with a staff What if this embassy should bring me the message of my fate While Squire Hawkwood and his colleagues entered Ralph rose from his seat and advanced a few steps to receive them and his stately figure and dark countenance as he bent courteously toward his guests had a natural dignity contrasting well with the bustling importance of the squire The old gentleman according to invariable custom gave an elaborate preliminary flourish with his cane in the air then removed his three cornered hat in order to wipe his brow and finally proceeded to make known his errand My colleagues and myself began the squire are burdened with momentous duties being jointly selectmen of this village Our minds for the space of three days past have been laboriously bent on the selection of a suitable person to fill a most important office and take upon himself a charge and rule which wisely considered may be ranked no lower than those of kings and potentates And whereas you our native townsman are of good natural intellect and well cultivated by foreign travel and that certain vagaries and fantasies of your youth are doubtless long ago corrected taking all these matters I say into due consideration we are of opinion that Providence hath sent you hither at this juncture for our very purpose During this harangue Cranfield gazed fixedly at the speaker as if he beheld something mysterious and unearthly in his pompous little figure and as if the squire had worn the flowing robes of an ancient sage instead of a square skirted coat flapped waistcoat velvet breeches and silk stockings Nor was his wonder without sufficient cause for the flourish of the squire s staff marvellous to relate had described precisely the signal in the air which was to ratify the message of the prophetic sage whom Cranfield had sought around the world And what inquired Ralph Cranfield with a tremor in his voice what may this office be which is to equal me with kings and potentates No less than instructor of our village school answered Squire Hawkwood the office being now vacant by the death of the venerable Master Whitaker after a fifty years incumbency I will consider of your proposal replied Ralph Cranfield hurriedly and will make known my decision within three days After a few more words the village dignitary and his companions took their leave But to Cranfield s fancy their images were still present and became more and more invested with the dim awfulness of figures which had first appeared to him in a dream and afterward had shown themselves in his waking moments assuming homely aspects among familiar things His mind dwelt upon the features of the squire till they grew confused with those of the visionary sage and one appeared but the shadow of the other The same visage he now thought had looked forth upon him from the Pyramid of Cheops the same form had beckoned to him among the colonnades of the Alhambra the same figure had mistily revealed itself through the ascending steam of the Great Geyser At every effort of his memory he recognized some trait of the dreamy messenger of destiny in this pompous bustling self important little great man of the village Amid such musings Ralph Cranfield sat all day in the cottage scarcely hearing and vaguely answering his mother s thousand questions about his travels and adventures At sunset he roused himself to take a stroll and passing the aged elm tree his eye was again caught by the semblance of a hand pointing downward at the half obliterated inscription As Cranfield walked down the street of the village the level sunbeams threw his shadow far before him and he fancied that as his shadow walked among distant objects so had there been a presentiment stalking in advance of him throughout his life And when he drew near each object over which his tall shadow had preceded him still it proved to be one of the familiar recollections of his infancy and youth Every crook in the pathway was remembered Even the more transitory characteristics of the scene were the same as in by gone days A company of cows were grazing on the grassy roadside and refreshed him with their fragrant breath It is sweeter thought he than the perfume which was wafted to our ship from the Spice Islands The round little figure of a child rolled from a doorway and lay laughing almost beneath Cranfield s feet The dark and stately man stooped down and lifting the infant restored him to his mother s arms The children said he to himself and sighed and smiled the children are to be my charge And while a flow of natural feeling gushed like a well spring in his heart he came to a dwelling which he could nowise forbear to enter A sweet voice which seemed to come from a deep and tender soul was warbling a plaintive little air within He bent his head and passed through the lowly door As his foot sounded upon the threshold a young woman advanced from the dusky interior of the house at first hastily and then with a more uncertain step till they met face to face There was a singular contrast in their two figures he dark and picturesque one who had battled with the world whom all suns had shone upon and whom all winds had blown on a varied course she neat comely and quiet quiet even in her agitation as if all her emotions had been subdued to the peaceful tenor of her life Yet their faces all unlike as they were had an expression that seemed not so alien a glow of kindred feeling flashing upward anew from half extinguished embers You are welcome home said Faith Egerton But Cranfield did not immediately answer for his eye had been caught by an ornament in the shape of a heart which Faith wore as a brooch upon her bosom The material was the ordinary white quartz and he recollected having himself shaped it out of one of those Indian arrowheads which are so often found in the ancient haunts of the red men It was precisely on the pattern of that worn by the visionary maid When Cranfield departed on his shadowy search he had bestowed this brooch in a gold setting as a parting gift to Faith Egerton So Faith you have kept the heart said he at length Yes said she blushing deeply then more gayly And what else have you brought me from beyond the sea Faith replied Ralph Cranfield uttering the fated words by an uncontrollable impulse I have brought you nothing but a heavy heart May I rest its weight on you This token which I have worn so long said Faith laying her tremulous finger on the heart is the assurance that you may Faith Faith cried Cranfield clasping her in his arms you have interpreted my wild and weary dream Yes the wild dreamer was awake at last To find the mysterious treasure he was to till the earth around his mother s dwelling and reap its products instead of warlike command or regal or religious sway he was to rule over the village children and now the visionary maid had faded from his fancy and in her place he saw the playmate of his childhood Would all who cherish such wild wishes but look around them they would oftenest find their sphere of duty of prosperity and happiness within those precincts and in that station where Providence itself has cast their lot Happy they who read the riddle without a weary world search or a lifetime spent in
