SQUINTY AND THE MERRY MONKEY XII SQUINTY GETS HOME AGAIN ILLUSTRATIONS Squinty looked at the beautiful wagons and at the strange animals Squinty saw rushing toward him Don the big black and white dog Hop on he said to the toad I won t bother you Oh Father exclaimed the boy do let me have just one little pig Squinty gave a little spring and over the rope he went The next moment Squinty felt himself lifted off the ground Why I am Mappo the merry monkey was the answer SQUINTY THE COMICAL PIG CHAPTER I SQUINTY AND THE DOG Squinty was a little pig You could tell he was a pig just as soon as you looked at him because he had the cutest little curly tail as though it wanted to tie itself into a bow but was not quite sure whether that was the right thing to do And Squinty had a skin that was as pink under his white hairy bristles as a baby s toes Also Squinty had the oddest nose It was just like a rubber ball flattened out and when Squinty moved his nose up and down or sideways as he did when he smelled the nice sour milk the farmer was bringing for the pigs dinner why when Squinty did that with his nose it just made you want to laugh right out loud But the funniest part of Squinty was his eyes or rather one eye And that eye squinted just as well as any eye ever squinted Somehow or other I don t just know why exactly or I would tell you the lid of one of Squinty s eyes was heavier than the other That eye opened only half way and when Squinty looked up at you from the pen where he lived with his mother and father and little brothers and sisters why there was such a comical look on Squinty s face that you wanted to laugh right out loud again In fact lots of boys and girls when they came to look at Squinty in his pen could not help laughing when he peered up at them with one eye widely open and the other half shut Oh what a comical pig the boys and girls would cry What is his name Oh I guess we ll call him Squinty the farmer said and so Squinty was named Perhaps if his mother had had her way about it she would have given Squinty another name as she did his brothers and sisters In fact she did name all of them except Squinty One of the little pigs was named Wuff Wuff another Curly Tail another Squealer another Wee Wee and another Puff Ball There were seven pigs in all and Squinty was the last one so you see he came from quite a large family When his mother had named six of her little pigs she came to Squinty Let me see grunted missus Pig in her own way for you know animals have a language of their own which no one else can understand Let me see said missus Pig what shall I call you She was thinking of naming him Floppy because the lid of one of his eyes sort of flopped down But just then a lot of boys and girls came running out to the pig pen The boys and girls had come on a visit to the farmer who owned the pigs and when they looked in and saw big mister and missus Pig and the little ones one boy called out Oh what a queer little pig with one eye partly open And how funny he looks at you What is his name Well I guess we ll call him Squinty the farmer had said And so just as I have told you Squinty got his name Humph Squinty exclaimed missus Pig as she heard what the farmer said I don t know as I like that Oh it will do very well answered mister Pig It will save you thinking up a name for him And after all you know he does squint Not that it amounts to anything in fact it is rather stylish I think Let him be called Squinty All right answered missus Pig So Squinty it was Hello Squinty called the boys and girls giving the little pig his new name Hello Squinty Wuff Wuff grunted Squinty That meant in his language Hello you see For though Squinty and his mother and father and brothers and sisters could understand man talk and boy and girl talk they could not speak that language themselves but had to talk in their own way Nearly all animals understand our talk even though they can not speak to us Just look at a dog for instance When you call to him Come here doesn t he come Of course he does And when you say Lie down sir doesn t he lie down that is if he is a good dog and minds He understands anyhow And see how horses understand how to go when the driver says Gid dap and how they stop when he says Whoa So you need not think it strange that a little pig could understand our kind of talk though he could not speak it himself Well Squinty the comical pig lived with his mother and father and brothers and sisters in the farmer s pen for some time As the days went on Squinty grew fatter and fatter until his pink skin under his white bristles was swelled out like a balloon Hum exclaimed the farmer one day as he leaned over the top of the pen to look down on the pigs after he had poured their dinner into the trough Hum That little pig with the squinty eye is getting pretty big I thought he was going to be a little runt but he seems to be growing as fast as the others Squinty was glad when he heard that for he wanted to grow up to be a fine large pig The farmer took a corn cob from which all the yellow kernels of corn had been shelled and with it he scratched the back of Squinty Pigs like to have their backs scratched just as cats like to have you rub their smooth fur or tickle them under the ears Ugh Ugh grunted Squinty looking up at the farmer with his comical eyes one half shut and the other wide open Ugh Ugh And with his odd eyes and one ear cocked forward and the other flopping over backward Squinty looked so funny that the farmer had to laugh out loud What s the matter Rufus asked the farmer s wife who was gathering the eggs Oh it s this pig laughed the farmer He has such a queer look on his face Let me see exclaimed the farmer s wife She too looked down into the pen Oh isn t he comical she cried Then being a very kind lady and liking all the farm animals the farmer s wife went out in the potato patch and pulled up some pig weed This is a green weed that grows in the garden but it does no good there Instead it does harm and farmers like to pull it up to get rid of it But if pig weed is no good for the garden it is good for pigs and they like to chew the green leaves Here Squinty called the farmer s wife tossing some of the juicy green weed to the little pig Eat this Ugh Ugh grunted Squinty and he began to chew the green leaves I suppose that was his way of saying Thank you As soon as Squinty s brothers and sisters saw the green pig weed the farmer s wife had tossed into the pen up they rushed to the trough grunting and squealing to get some too They pushed and scrambled and even stepped into the trough so eager were they to get something to eat even though they had been fed only a little while before That is one strange thing about pigs They seem to be always hungry And Squinty s brothers and sisters were no different from other pigs But wait just a moment They were a bit different for they were much cleaner than many pigs I have seen The farmer who owned them knew that pigs do not like to live in mud and dirt any more than do cows and horses so this farmer had for his pigs a nice pen with a dry board floor and plenty of corn husks for their bed They had clean water to drink and a shady place in which to lie down and sleep Of course there was a mud bath in the pig pen for no matter how clean pigs are once in a while they like to roll in the mud And I ll tell you the reason for that You see flies and mosquitoes and other pests like to bite pigs The pigs know this and they also know that if they roll in the mud and get covered with it the mud will make a coating over them to keep the biting flies away So that is why pigs like to roll in the mud once in awhile just as you sometimes see a circus elephant scatter dust over his back to drive away the flies And even such a thick skinned animal as a rhinoceros likes to plaster himself with mud to keep away the insects But after Squinty and his brothers and sisters had rolled in the mud they were always glad when the farmer came with the garden hose and washed them clean again so their pink skins showed beneath their white hairy bristles Squinty and the other pigs grew until they were a nice size They had nothing to do but eat and sleep and of course that will make anyone grow Now Squinty though he was not the largest of the family of pig children was by far the smartest He learned more quickly than did his brothers and sisters how to run to the trough to eat when his mother called him and he learned how to stand up against one side of the pen and rub himself back and forth to scratch his side when a mosquito had bitten him in a place he could not reach with his foot In fact Squinty was a little too smart He wanted to do many things his brothers and sisters never thought of One day when Squinty and the others had eaten their dinner Squinty told his brother Wuff Wuff that he thought it would be a nice thing to have some fun Wuff Wuff said he thought so too but he didn t just know what to do In fact there was not much one could do in a pig pen If we could only get out of here grunted Squinty as he looked out through a crack in the boards and saw the green garden where pig weed was growing thickly Yes but we can t said Wuff Wuff Squinty was not so sure about this In fact he was a very inquisitive little pig that is he always wanted to find out about things and why this and that was so and what made the wheels go around and all like that I think I can get out through that place said Squinty to himself a little later He had found another crack between two boards of the pen a large crack and one edge of the board was loose Squinty began to push with his rubbery nose A pig s nose is pretty strong you know for it is made for digging or rooting in the earth to turn up acorns and other good things to eat Squinty pushed and pushed on the board until he had made it very loose The crack was getting wider Oh I can surely get out he thought He looked around his mother and father and all the little pigs were asleep in the shady part of the pen I m going said Squinty to himself He gave one extra hard push and there he was through the big crack and outside the pen It was the first time he had ever been out in his life At first he was a little frightened but when he looked over into the potato patch and saw pig weed growing there he was happy Oh what a good meal I shall have grunted Squinty He ran toward a large bunch of the juicy green pig weed but before he reached it he heard a dreadful noise Bow wow Bow wow Bow wow went some animal and then came some growls and the next moment Squinty saw rushing toward him Don the big black and white dog of the farmer Bow wow Bow wow Bow wow barked Don and that meant in his language Get back in your pen Squinty What do you mean by coming out Get back Bow wow Illustration Squinty saw rushing toward him Don the big black and white dog Oh dear Oh dear squealed Squinty I shall be bitten sure That dog will bite me Oh dear Why didn t I stay in the pen Squinty turned on his little short legs as quickly as he could and started back for the pen But it was not easy to run in a potato field and Squinty not having lived in the woods and fields as do some pigs was not a very good runner Bow wow Bow wow barked Don running after Squinty I do not believe Don really meant to hurt the comical little pig In fact I know he did not for Don was very kind hearted But Don knew that the pigs were supposed to stay in their pen and not come out to root up the garden So Don barked Bow wow Bow wow Get back where you belong Squinty Squinty ran as fast as he could but Don ran faster Squinty caught his foot in a melon vine and down he went Before he could get up Don was close to him and the next moment Squinty felt his ear being taken between Don s strong white teeth Oh dear Oh dear Oh dear squealed Squinty in his own queer pig language What is going to happen to me CHAPTER II SQUINTY RUNS AWAY Between the barking of Don the dog and the squealing of Squinty the comical pig who was being led along by his ear there was so much noise in the farmer s potato patch for a few moments that if you had been there I think you would have wondered what was happening Bow wow Bow wow Bow wow barked Don still keeping hold of Squinty s ear though he did not pinch very hard Bow wow Get back to your pen where you belong Squee Squee Squee yelled Squinty Oh please let me go I ll be good And so it went on the dog talking in his barking language and Squinty squealing in his pig talk but they could easily understand one another even if no one else could Back in the pen missus Pig suddenly awakened from a nap So did mister Pig and all the little pigs Don t you hear something making a noise asked missus Pig of her husband Why yes I think I do he answered slowly as he looked in the feed trough to see if the farmer had left any more sour milk there for the pig family to eat But there was none I hear someone squealing said Wuff Wuff the largest boy pig of them all So do I said Squeaker a little girl pig missus Pig sat up and looked all over the pen She was counting her children to see if they were all there She did not see Squinty and at once she became frightened Squinty is gone cried missus Pig Oh where can he be The squealing noise became louder So did the barking of the dog Look there is a board off the side of the pen said mister Pig Yes Squinty wanted me to come outside with him said Wuff Wuff But I wouldn t go Oh maybe my little boy pig is outside there making all that noise cried missus Pig to her husband Well he isn t making all that noise by himself said the father pig Someone is helping him make it I m sure They all listened and heard the barking of Don as well as the squealing of Squinty Oh some animal has caught him cried missus Pig Then she pushed as hard as she could with her nose against the loose board near the hole in the pen through which Squinty had run a little while before missus Pig soon knocked off the board and then she ran out into the garden mister Pig and all the little pigs ran after her The first thing missus Pig saw was her little boy pig down on the ground in the middle of a row of melon vines with Don holding Squinty s ear Bow wow barked Don Squee Squee cried Squinty Oh you poor little pig grunted missus Pig What has happened to you Oh mamma squealed Squinty I I ran out of the pen to see what it was like outside and I was just eating some pig weed when this big dog chased after me Yes I did said Don growling in his deep voice The place for pigs little or big is in their pen The farmer does not want you to come out and spoil his garden He tells me to watch you and to drive you back if you come in it This is the first time I have seen any of you pigs in the garden went on Don still keeping hold of Squinty s ear and I want you please to go back in your pen Oh I ll go I ll go cried Squinty Only let loose of my ear mister Dog if you please What Have you hold of Squinty s ear asked Wuff Wuff Oh do please let him go Yes I will now that you are here said Don and he took his strong white teeth from the piggy boy s ear I did not bite him hard enough to hurt him said Don But I had to catch hold of him somewhere and taking him by the ear was better than taking him by the tail I think Oh yes indeed agreed mister Pig Once when I was a little pig a dog bit me on the tail and I never got over it In fact I have the marks yet and he tried to look around at his tail which had a kink in it But mister Pig was too fat to see his own tail So that s why I took hold of Squinty by the ear went on Don Did I hurt you very much he asked the little pig who had run out of the pen Oh no not much Squinty said as he rubbed his ear with his paw Then as he saw a bunch of pig weed close to him he began nibbling that And his brothers and sisters seeing him do this began to eat the pig weed also Come This will never do barked Don the dog I am sorry but all you pigs must go back in your own pen The farmer would not like you to be out in his garden Yes I suppose we must said missus Pig with a sigh Yet it is very nice out in the garden But we must stay in our pen Come children said mister Pig We must stay in our own place for if we rooted up the farmer s garden much as we would like to do it he would have no vegetables to eat this winter Then he might be angry at us and would give us no more sour milk So we will go back to our pen Bow wow Bow wow barked Don running here and there I will show you the way back to your pen he said kindly And he capered about here and there driving the pigs back to the place where Squinty had run from and where all the others had come from to see what had happened to him The farmer who was hoeing corn heard the barking of his dog He dropped the hoe and ran Something must have happened he cried Maybe the big bull has gotten loose from his field and is chasing someone with a red dress Into the garden he ran and then he saw Don driving Squinty and his brothers and sisters and mother and father back to the pen Ha So the pigs got loose the farmer cried Good dog Chase em back Bow wow barked Don I will But the pigs did not need much driving for they were very good and did not want to cause Don or the farmer any trouble if they could help it Soon Squinty and the others were safely in the pen again The farmer looked at them carefully So you thought you d like to get out and have a run did you he asked speaking to pigs just as if they could understand him And they did just as your dog understands and minds you when you call to him to come to you So you wanted a run in the garden eh went on the farmer Well I don t blame you for it isn t much fun to stay cooped up in a pen all the while But still I can t have you out But I ll give you a nice lot of pig weed just the same for you must be hungry Then the farmer pulled up some more of the green stuff and tossed it into the pen He also gave them plenty of sour milk which pigs like better than sweet milk Besides it is cheaper Well I guess you won t run away again the farmer went on as he nailed back on the pen the board which Squinty had pushed off Perhaps the farmer thought one of the big pigs the papa or mamma one had made the hole for the others to get out I am sure he never thought little Squinty with his comical eye did it But we know Squinty did don t we For some time after this Squinty was a very good pig indeed Not that I mean to say he was bad when he ran out of the pen for he did not know any better But after the board was nailed on tightly again he did not try to push it off Perhaps he knew he could not do it Squinty and his brothers and sisters had lots of fun in the pen even if they could not go out They played games in the straw hiding away from one another and squealing and grunting when they were found They raced around the pen playing a game much like our game of tag and if they could have had someone to tie a hand kerchief over their eyes they might have played blind man s buff But of course they did not really do this However they raced about and jumped over each other s backs and climbed upon the fat sides of their father and mother while the big pigs lay asleep in the shade Squinty was a pig very fond of playing tricks Sometimes he would take a choice tender piece of pig weed which the farmer had tossed into the pen and hide it in the soft dirt in one corner Now see who can find it Squinty would call to his brothers and sisters and they would hunt all over for it rooting up the earth with their strong rubbery noses Digging in the dirt was good practice for them and their mother and father would watch them saying Ah when they grow up they will be very good rooting pigs indeed Yes very good Then Squinty or his brothers or sisters would root up the hidden pig weed and the old pigs would go to sleep again for they did not need to practice digging having done so when they were young About all they did was to eat and sleep and tell the little pigs how to behave Squinty how is your ear that Don the dog bit asked missus Pig of her little boy pig one day Oh it doesn t hurt me answered Squinty Don did not bite very hard He only wanted to catch me Yes Don is a good dog said missus Pig But you must be careful of other dogs Squinty Why are not all dogs alike the little pig boy asked Oh no indeed answered missus Pig Some of them are very bad and savage They would bite you very hard if they got the chance So whenever you see any dog except Don running toward you run away as fast as you can I will promised Squinty And he did not know how soon he would be glad to remember his mother s good advice For some days nothing much happened in the pig pen Once or twice Squinty pushed his nose against the board the farmer had nailed on but it was very tight he found and he could not push it off Are you trying to get out again asked Wuff Wuff Oh I don t know Squinty would answer I think it would be fun if we all could don t you No indeed cried Wuff Wuff Some big dog might chase us I want to stay in the pen But Squinty was a brave bold mischievous little pig He was not content to stay in the pen He wanted to have some adventures He wanted to get out in the garden which looked so nice and green Squinty looked all around the other sides of the pen He wanted to see if there was another loose board If there was he made up his little pig mind that he would go out again But he said nothing of this to his brothers or sisters or to his father or mother He felt that they would not like him to go away again But there is not much fun staying in the pen all the while thought Squinty I wish I could get out Squinty you see had made up his mind to run away Often horses run away so I don t see why pigs can t also Anyhow that was what Squinty intended to do But for nearly a week after his first adventure in the garden Squinty had no chance to slip out of the pen All the boards seemed very tight Then one day it was very hot The sun shone brightly Dig holes for yourselves in the cool ground and lie down in them said missus Pig That will cool you off Each little pig dug a hole for himself just as a hen does when she wants to take a dust bath Squinty dug his hole near the lower edge of the boards on one side of the pen I ll make a big hole he thought to himself And as Squinty dug down he noticed that he could see under the bottom of the boards He could look right out into the garden That is very queer thought the little pig boy I believe I can get out of the pen by crawling under a board as well as by pushing one loose from the side I ll try it Squinty was learning things you see So he dug the hole deeper and deeper and soon it was large enough for him to slip under the bottom board Now I can run away he grunted softly to himself He looked all around the pen His father mother sisters and brothers were fast asleep in their cool holes of earth I m going said Squinty and the next moment he had slipped under the side of the pen through the hole he had dug and once more he was out in the garden Now for some adventures said Squinty in a jolly whisper a pig s whisper you know CHAPTER III SQUINTY IS LOST This was the second time Squinty had run out of the pen and into the farmer s garden The first time he had been caught and brought back by Don the dog This time Squinty did not intend to get caught if he could help it So after crawling out through the hole under the pen the little pig came to a stop and looked carefully on all sides of him His one little squinty eye was opened as wide as it would open and the other eye was opened still wider Squinty wanted to see all there was to be seen He cocked one ear up in front of him to listen to any sounds that might come from that direction and the other ear he drooped over toward his back to hear any noises that might come from behind him What Squinty was especially listening for was the barking of Don the dog For thought Squinty I don t want Don to catch me again and make me go back before I have had any fun It will be time enough to go back to the pen when it is dark Yes that will be time enough for of course Squinty did not think of staying out after the sun had gone down Or at least he did not imagine he would But you just wait and see what happens Squinty looked carefully about him Even if one eye did droop a little he could still see out of it very well and he saw no signs of Don the big dog Nor could Squinty hear him Don must be far away the little pig thought far away perhaps taking a swim in the brook where the dog often went to cool off in hot weather I think I ll go and have a swim myself thought Squinty He knew there was a brook somewhere on the farm for he could hear the tinkle and fall of the water even in the pig pen But where the brook was he did not know exactly But it will be an adventure to hunt for it Squinty thought I guess I can easily find it Here I go and with that he started to walk between the rows of potatoes Squinty made up his little mind that he was going to be very careful Now that he was safely out of the pen again he did not want to be caught the second time He did not want Don or the farmer to see him so he crawled along keeping as much out of sight as he could I wish my brothers Wuff Wuff or Squealer were with me said Squinty softly to himself in pig language But if I had awakened them and asked them to run away with me mamma or papa might have heard and stopped us Squinty did not feel at all sorry about running away and leaving his father and mother and brothers and sisters You see he thought he would be back with them again in a few hours for he did not intend to stay away from the pen longer than that But many things can happen in a few hours as you shall see I won t eat any pig weed just yet thought Squinty as he went softly on between the rows of potato vines To pull up any of it and eat it now would make it wiggle Then Don or the farmer might see it wiggling and run over to find out what it was all about Then I d be caught I ll wait a bit So though he was very hungry he would not eat a bit of the pig weed that grew near the pen And he never so much as dreamed of taking any of the farmer s potatoes He did not yet know the taste of them But let me tell you pigs who have eaten potatoes even the little ones the farmer cannot sell are very fond of them But so far Squinty had never eaten even a little potato On and on went the little pig looking back now and then toward the pen to see if any of the other pigs were coming after him But none were And there was no sign of Don the barking dog nor the farmer either There was nothing to stop Squinty from running away Soon he was some distance from the pen and then he thought it would be safe to nibble at a bit of pig weed He took a large mouthful from a tall green plant Oh how good that tastes thought Squinty It is much better and fresher than the kind the farmer throws into the pen to us Perhaps this was true but I imagine the reason the pig weed tasted so much better was because Squinty was running away Perhaps you know how it is yourself Did you ever go out the back way when mamma was washing the dishes and run over to your aunt s or your grandma s house and get a piece of bread and jam If you ever did you probably thought that bread and jam was much nicer than the kind you could get at home though really there isn t any better bread and jam than mother makes But somehow or other the kind you get away from home tastes differently doesn t it It was that way with Squinty the comical pig He ate and ate the pig weed until he had eaten about as much as was good for him And then as he saw one little potato on the ground where it had rolled out of the hill in which it grew with the others Squinty ate that He did not think the farmer would care Oh how good it is he thought I wish I had not eaten so much pig weed then I could eat more of those funny round things the farmer calls potatoes Now I will have to wait until I am hungry again Squinty knew that would not be very long for pigs get hungry many times a day That is what makes them grow fat so fast they eat so often But eating often is not good for boys and girls Squinty had now come some distance away from the pen where he lived with his mother father sisters and brothers He wondered if they had awakened yet or had seen the hole out of which he had crawled and if they were puzzled as to where he had gone But they can t find me said Squinty with something that sounded like a laugh I suppose pigs can laugh in their own way at any rate No they can t find me thought Squinty looking all around All he saw were the rows of potato vines and farther off a field of tall green corn Well I have the whole day to myself thought Squinty I can do as I please and not go back until night Let me see what shall I do first I guess I will go to sleep in the shade So he stretched out in the shade of a big potato vine and curling up in a little pink ball he closed his eyes the squinty one as well as the good one But first Squinty looked all around to make sure Don the dog was not in sight He saw nothing of him When Squinty awakened he felt hungry as he always did after a sleep Now for some more of those nice potatoes he said to himself He liked them right after his first taste He did not look around for the little ones that might have fallen out of the hills themselves No instead Squinty began rooting them out of the earth with his strong rubbery nose made just for digging I am not saying Squinty did right in this In fact he did wrong but then he was a little pig and he knew no better In fact it was the first time he had really run away so far and he was quite hungry And potatoes were better than pig weed Squinty ate as many potatoes as he wanted and then he said to himself in a way pigs have Well I guess I ll go on to the brook and cool off in the water That will do me good After that I ll look around and see what will happen next Squinty had a good nose for smelling as most animals have and tilting it up in the air Squinty sniffed and snuffed He wanted to smell the water so as to take the shortest path to the brook Ha It s right over there exclaimed Squinty to himself I can easily find the water to take a bath Across the potato field he went taking care to keep well down between the rows of green vines for he did not want to be seen by the dog or the farmer Once as Squinty was walking along he saw what he thought was another potato on the ground in front of him He put his nose out toward it intending to eat it but the thing gave a big jump and hopped out of the way Ha That must be one of the hop toads I heard my mother tell about thought Squinty I must not hurt them for they are good to catch the flies that tickle me when I try to sleep Hop on he said to the toad I won t bother you Illustration Hop on he said to the toad I won t bother you The toad did not stop to say anything She just hopped on and hid under a big stone Maybe she was afraid of Squinty but he would not have hurt her Soon the little pig came to the brook of cool water and after looking about to see that there was no danger near Squinty waded in and took a long drink Then he rolled over and over again in it washing off all the mud and dirt and coming out as clean and as pink as a little baby Squinty was a real nice pig even if he had run away Let me see he said to himself after his bath What shall I do now Which way shall I go Well he happened to be hungry after his swim In fact Squinty was very often hungry so he thought he would see if he could find anything more to eat I have had potatoes and pig weed he thought and now I would like some apples I wonder if there are any apple trees around here He looked and across the field of corn he thought he saw an apple tree He made up his mind to go there And that is where Squinty made another mistake He made one when he ran away from the pen and another one when he started to go through the corn field Corn you know grows quite high and pigs even the largest of them are not very tall At least not until they stand on their hind legs That was a trick Squinty had not yet learned So he had to go along on four legs and this made him low down Now he had been able to look over the tops of the potato vines as they were not very high but Squinty could not look over the top of the corn stalks No sooner had he gotten into the field and started to walk along the corn rows than he could not see where he was going He could not even see the apple tree in the middle of the field Well this is queer thought Squinty I guess I had better go back No I will keep on I may come to the apple tree soon He hurried on between the corn rows But though he went a long distance he did not come to the apple tree I guess I will go back to the brook where I had my bath and start over again from there thought Squinty I will not try to get any apples to day I will eat only potatoes and pig weed Yes I will go back But that was not so easy to do as he had thought Squinty went this way and that through the rows of corn but he could not find the brook He could not find his way back nor could he find the apple tree On all sides of him was the tall corn That was all poor Squinty could see Finally all tired out and dusty the little pig stopped and sighed Oh dear I guess I am lost CHAPTER IV SQUINTY GETS HOME The rows of corn in the field where Squinty the comical pig was lost were like the streets of a city They were very straight and even just like the street where your house is and if you liked you could pretend that each hill of corn was a house Perhaps Squinty pretended this if pigs ever do pretend At any rate the little lost pig wandered up and down in the rows of corn peering this way and that to see which way to go so he could get home again He began to think that running away was not so much fun as he had at first thought Oh dear Squinty grunted in his funny squealing voice I wonder if I ll ever see my mamma and papa again Squinty ran this way and that up and down the rows of corn and you can easily imagine what happened He soon became very tired I think I will take a rest thought Squinty talking to himself because there was no one else to whom he could speak I think the little pig would have been very glad just then to speak even to Don the dog But Don was not there Squinty wondering what happened to little pigs when they were lost and if they ever got home again stretched out on the dirt between two rows of corn It was shady there but over head the hot sun was shining Squinty s breath came very fast just as when a dog runs far on a warm day But the earth was rather cool and Squinty liked it He would much rather have been down by the cool brook but he knew he could not have a swim in it until he found it And just now he seemed a good way off from it Poor Squinty It was bad enough to be tired and warm but to be lost was worse and to be hungry was worse than all especially to a little pig And more than this there was nothing to eat Squinty had tried to nibble at some of the green corn stalks but he did not like the taste of them Perhaps he had not yet learned to like them for I have seen older pigs eat corn stalks And pigs are very fond of the yellow corn itself They love to gnaw it off the cob and chew it just as you chew popcorn But the corn was not yet ripe and Squinty was too little to have eaten it if it had been ripe Later on he would learn to do this Just now he cared more about finding his way home and also finding something that he could eat For some time the little lost pig rested on the cool earth in the shade of the rows of corn Then he got up with a grunt and a squeal and began rooting in the ground Perhaps I may find some potatoes or some pig weed here thought Squinty Who knows But all he could root up with his queer rubbery nose was some round stones Some of these were brown and looked so much like the little potatoes that Squinty tried to chew one But when he felt the hard stone on his little white teeth he cried out in pain Ouch squealed Squinty That hurt Those are funny potatoes I never knew they could be so hard Later on he learned that what he supposed were potatoes were only stones You see it takes a little pig some time to learn all the things he needs to know Squinty let the stone roll out of his mouth and he looked at it with such an odd look on his face peering at it with his squinty eye and with one ear cocked up sort of sideways that if you had seen him you could not have helped laughing No one could if they had seen Squinty then but there was no one in the field to watch him Well thought Squinty after a bit this will never do I can t stay here I must try to find my way back home Let me see what had I better do I guess the first thing is to find that field of real potatoes and not the make believe ones like this and he pushed the stone away with his nose When I find the potato field he went on still talking to himself I am sure I can find the brook where I had a swim And when I find the brook I will know my way home for there is a straight path from there to our pen So Squinty started off once more to walk through the rows of corn As he walked along on his little short legs he grunted and rooted in the earth with his nose Sometimes he stumbled over a big stone or a clod of dirt and fell down Oh dear exclaimed poor Squinty when he got up after falling down about six times Oh dear This is no fun I wish I had stayed in the pen with my brothers and sisters I wonder what they are doing now Just then Squinty felt more hungry than ever and he thought it must be feeding time back in the pen Oh they must be having some nice sour milk just now thought Squinty How I wish I were back with them And then as he fancied he could smell the nice sour milk which the farmer or his wife was pouring into the eating trough of the pen Squinty just howled and squealed with hunger Oh what a noise he made Then this gave him an idea Ha he exclaimed to himself in a way pigs have why didn t I think of that before I must squeal for help My mamma or papa may hear me and come for me Then Squinty happened to think that the hole by which he had gotten out of the pen was not large enough for his fat papa or mamma to crawl through No they can t get out to come for me Squinty thought They ll have to send Wuff Wuff or Squealer And maybe they ll get lost the same as I did Oh dear I guess I won t squeal any more It s bad enough for me to be lost without any of my brothers or sisters getting lost too So Squinty stopped squealing and walked on and on between the rows of corn trying to find his way home to the pen all by himself Squinty was really quite a brave pig wasn t he By this time as you can well believe mister and missus Pig in the pen had awakened from their afternoon sleep And all the little pigs had awakened too for they were beginning to feel hungry again Isn t it about time the farmer came with some sour milk for us asked mister Pig of missus Pig I think it is she said looking up at the sun for the sun is the only clock that pigs and other animals have When they see the sun in the east low down they know it is morning When it shines directly over their heads high in the sky they know it is noon And when the sun sinks down in the west the pigs know it is getting toward night and supper time The sun was low down in the west now and mister and missus Pig knew it must be nearly time for their evening meal Come Wuff Wuff Come Squealer Come Squinty and all the rest of you called missus Pig in her grunting voice Come get ready for supper I think I hear the farmer coming with the nice sour milk Squee Squee Squee squealed all the little pigs for they were very hungry indeed Squee Squee Squee They all made a rush to see who would get to the eating trough first Some of them even put their feet in they were so anxious Pigs are always that way They know no better so we must excuse them If they had been taught not to do that and then did it we would not excuse them Here comes the farmer with the sour milk grunted mister Pig Oh how good it smells Just then Squealer cried Why where s Squinty His brothers and sisters looked around Squinty the comical pig was not to be seen But we know where he was even if his mamma and papa and brothers and sisters did not Squinty was in the cornfield trying to find his way back to the pen Why where can Squinty be asked missus Pig Squinty Squinty she called grunting and squealing as she always did Come to the trough she went on Supper is ready But Squinty did not come The farmer poured the sour milk down the slide where it ran into the trough and the little pigs began to eat But mister and missus Pig began looking for Squinty They turned up the straw thinking he might be asleep under it No Squinty was to be seen Then mister Pig saw the hole under the side boards of the pen Ha exclaimed mister Pig speaking to missus Pig I think perhaps Squinty went out there Oh so he did said missus Pig What shall we do Just then the farmer looked over in the pen to see how fat the pigs were getting He counted the little pigs Then a queer look came over his face Hello he exclaimed Only six here One of those pigs has gotten out I must look into this Quickly he glanced all about the pen He saw the hole out of which Squinty had run away I thought so exclaimed the farmer One of the pigs has rooted his way out I ll have to go after him Here Don he called to his dog A pig is loose We must catch him and he whistled for the big black and white dog who ran up barking and leaping about At first Squinty s brothers and sisters were paying so much attention to drinking their sour milk that they did not notice what the farmer said even though they missed Squinty at the trough But when they heard the dog barking they wondered what had happened Then they saw their mamma and papa looking anxious and talking together in their grunting language and Wuff Wuff asked Has anything happened Squinty is lost said missus Pig rubbing her nose up against that of Curly Tail the littlest girl pig of them all He must have run out of the pen when we were asleep Oh dear cried all the little pigs and they felt very badly Never mind said mister Pig I heard the farmer call Don the dog to go off and find Squinty I think he ll bring him back Oh but maybe Don will bite Squinty said Wuff Wuff I guess not answered mister Pig Don is a gentle dog But anyhow we want Squinty back and the only way we can get him is to have the farmer and his dog go after him The other little pigs finished their supper of sour milk with some small potatoes which the farmer s wife threw in to them mister and missus Pig ate a little and then the farmer after stopping up the hole where Squinty got out so no more of the pigs could run away started off over the fields calling to his dog Bow wow Bow wow Bow wow barked Don That meant in dog language I ll find Squinty and bring him back Meanwhile Squinty had tried his best to find a way out of the cornfield But all he did was to walk up one row and down another If he had been tall enough to stand up and look over the tops of the corn stalks he might have seen which way to go but he was not yet large enough for that Pretty soon Squinty looked up and he saw that the sun was not as bright as it had been Squinty knew what this meant The sun was going down and it would soon be night Oh dear I wonder if I shall have to stay out all alone in the dark night thought poor Squinty Oh I ll never run away again never Just then he heard off through the rows of corn a dog barking Bow wow Bow wow Bow wow went the dog Oh what shall I do Where shall I hide thought Squinty A bad dog is after me He ran this way and that stumbling and falling down The barking of the dog sounded nearer Then Squinty heard a man s voice saying Get after him Don Find him Find that pig Bow wow was the barking answer Ha thought Squinty Don That s the name of the good dog on our farm I wonder if he is coming after me Just then the farmer who had been following the tracks left in the soft ground by Squinty s feet came to the cornfield The farmer saw where the pig had been walking between the green rows of corn He s here somewhere Don the farmer said Find him Bow wow barked Don I will Just then Squinty stumbled over a big stone and he could not help grunting He also gave a little squeal Here he is Don called the farmer Take him by the ear and lead him back to the pen Easy now Squinty stood still He did not want to run away from Don Squinty was only too anxious to be found and taken home The next minute through the rows of corn came bounding Don the dog He was followed by the farmer Ah there he is The little runaway cried the farmer man as he saw the pig After him Don But don t hurt him Don raced up beside Squinty and took him gently by the ear Bow wow barked the dog and that meant Come along with me if you please You have been away from your pen quite long enough Squinty gave a loud squeal when Don took him by the ear but when the little pig found that the dog did not mean to hurt him he grew quiet and went along willingly enough I must make that pig pen a great deal tighter if they are going to get out and run away every day said the farmer to himself as he walked along behind Don and Squinty Soon they were at the pig pen and Oh how glad Squinty was to see it again The farmer picked the little pink fellow now all tired out and covered with dirt up in his arms and dropped him down inside the pen with the other pigs There cried the farmer I guess you ll stay in after this Bow wow barked Don jumping about for he thought it was fun to chase runaway pigs And so Squinty got safely back home But very soon he was to have some more adventures CHAPTER V 
4936-28619-0000	train-other-500	SQUINTY AND THE BOY Did you ever have a little brother or sister who ran away from home and was very glad to run back or be brought back again by a policeman perhaps
4936-28619-0001	train-other-500	Of course your little brother or sister may not have intended to run away
none	none	 it may have been that they only wandered off 
4936-28619-0002	train-other-500	around the corner toward the candy store and could not find their way back again But when he or she did get home how glad you were to see them Weren t you It was just like that at the pen where Squinty the comical pig lived
4936-28619-0003	train-other-500	When the farmer picked him up and dropped him down among his brothers and sisters in the clean straw Wuff Wuff Squealer and Curly Tail and the others were so glad to see Squinty
4936-28619-0004	train-other-500	that they grunted and squealed and walked all over one another to be the first to get close to him
none	none	 Oh Squinty where were you 
4936-28619-0005	train-other-500	Where did you go What did you do
none	none	 Weren t you awfully scared Where did the dog find you 
4936-28619-0006	train-other-500	Did he bite you very hard These were some of the questions Squinty s brothers and sisters asked of the little runaway pig
4936-28619-0007	train-other-500	They pressed close up to him rubbing their funny wiggling rubber like noses against him and snuggling up against him for they liked Squinty very much indeed
4936-28619-0008	train-other-500	Then after the young pigs had had their turn mister Pig and missus Pig began asking questions What made you run away asked Squinty s papa Oh I wanted to have an adventure said Squinty
4936-28619-0009	train-other-500	Well did you have one asked his mamma Oh yes lots of them answered the little pig But I didn t find very much to eat Squinty was very hungry now Oh dear exclaimed missus Pig
none	none	 You are just too late for supper It is all eaten up We did not see that you were not here until too late It s too bad 
4936-28619-0010	train-other-500	Squinty thought so himself for the smell of the sour milk that had been in the feeding trough made him more hungry than ever Squinty walked over and tried to find a few drops in the bottom of the wooden trough These he licked up with his red tongue
4936-28619-0011	train-other-500	But there was not nearly enough Ha I guess that little pig must be hungry said the farmer looking down in the pen after he had put some more stones and a board over the hole where Squinty had gotten out I guess I ll have to feed him
4936-28619-0012	train-other-500	for the others have had their supper And how glad Squinty was when the farmer went over to the barrel where the pigs feed was kept
none	none	 and mixed a nice pailful of sour milk with some corn meal and poured it into the trough Squee Squee cried Squinty as he made a rush over to get his supper Squee Squee cried all the other little pigs as they too made a rush to get more to eat 
4936-28619-0013	train-other-500	Here Hold on Come back cried mister Pig That is Squinty s supper You must not touch it You have had yours and he and missus Pig would not let Squinty s brothers and sisters shove him away from the trough
4936-28619-0014	train-other-500	For sometimes pigs are so hungry that they do this you know Being pigs they know no better So Squinty had his supper after all though he did run away
4936-28619-0015	train-other-500	Perhaps he should have been punished by being sent to bed without having had anything to eat but you see the farmer wanted his pigs to be fat and healthy so he fed them well Squinty was very glad of that Now
4936-28619-0016	train-other-500	all of you go to sleep said missus Pig when it grew darker and darker in the pen So she made them all cuddle down in the straw pulling it over them with her nose and paws like a blanket to keep them warm
4936-28619-0017	train-other-500	For only part of the pen had a roof over it and though it was summer still it was cool at night But Squinty s brothers and sisters had no notion of going to sleep so soon They wanted to hear all about what had happened to him when he had run away
4936-28619-0018	train-other-500	and they wanted him to tell them of his adventures So they grunted and whispered among themselves What happened to you Squinty asked Wuff Wuff Oh I had a fine swim in a brook said Squinty
none	none	 I wish that had happened to me said Wuff Wuff 
4936-28619-0019	train-other-500	What else I found a nice field of corn went on Squinty
none	none	 but I did not like the taste of it I got lost in the cornfield 
4936-28619-0020	train-other-500	That s too bad said Wuff Wuff Did anything else happen Yes I found some pig weed and ate that and some little potatoes Oh how nice exclaimed Twisty Tail I wish that had happened to me
4936-28619-0021	train-other-500	Did you do anything else Squinty Yes said the comical little pig I saw something I thought was a potato and it jumped away from me It was a hoptoad
none	none	 That was funny said Squealer I wish I had seen it Did anything else happen Yes 
4936-28619-0022	train-other-500	said Squinty I thought I saw another potato but when I bit on it
none	none	 I found it was only a stone and it hurt my teeth 
4936-28619-0023	train-other-500	That s too bad said Wuff Wuff I am glad that did not happen to me Tell us what else you saw But just then missus Pig grunted out
4936-28619-0024	train-other-500	Come now All you little pigs must keep quiet and go to sleep Go to sleep at once So Squinty and the others cuddled closer together snuggled down in the soft straw and soon were fast asleep
4936-28619-0025	train-other-500	Now and then they stirred or grunted during the night but they did not wake up until morning They were running around the pen before breakfast squealing as loudly as they could for the farmer to come and feed them
4936-28619-0026	train-other-500	But the farmer had his cows and horses and chickens to feed as well as the pigs and he did not get to the pen until last And when he did all the pigs were so hungry even mister and missus Pig that they were squealing as hard as they could
4936-28619-0027	train-other-500	Yes yes cried the farmer as though he were talking to the pigs I m coming as fast as I can Soon the farmer poured some sour milk and corn meal down into the trough and how eagerly Squinty and the others did eat it
none	none	 Some of the smaller pigs even put two feet in the trough 
4936-28619-0028	train-other-500	they were so anxious to get their share Squinty had an especially good appetite from having run away so perhaps he got a little more than the others But finally the breakfast was all gone
4936-28619-0029	train-other-500	and the pigs had nothing more to do until dinner time that is all they had to do was to lie down and rest or get up now and then to scratch a mosquito or a fly bite Well I guess none of you will get out again said the farmer after a while
4936-28619-0030	train-other-500	as he nailed a bigger board over the hole by which Squinty had gotten out Don watch these pigs the farmer went on If they get out grab them by the ear and bring them back
none	none	 Bow wow barked Don and that meant he would do as his master had told him 
4936-28619-0031	train-other-500	For several days after this nothing happened in the pigs pen except that they were washed off with the hose now and then to clean them of mud and make them cool Once in a while the farmer would take a corn cob
4936-28619-0032	train-other-500	and scratch the back of mister or missus Pig and they liked this very much The other pigs were almost too little for the farmer to reach over the top of the pen One day the pigs heard merry shouts and laughter up at the farmhouse
4936-28619-0033	train-other-500	There were the sounds of boys and girls voices Then came the patter of many feet Oh look at the pigs someone cried and Squinty and his brothers and sisters looking up saw over the edge of the pen some boys and girls looking down on them
4936-28619-0034	train-other-500	Oh aren t they cute exclaimed a girl Just lovely said another girl Pigs are so nice I wonder if any of them can do any tricks asked a boy who stood looking down into the pen
4936-28619-0035	train-other-500	These aren t trained circus pigs spoke one of the girls They can t do tricks The boy and the girls stayed for a little while watching the pigs Then the boy said Let s pull some weeds and feed them
4936-28619-0036	train-other-500	Oh yes let s cried the girls
none	none	 The pigs were glad when they heard this and they were more glad when the boy and the girls threw pig weed and other green things from the garden into the pen 
4936-28619-0037	train-other-500	The pigs ate them all up and wanted more After that for several days
none	none	 Squinty and his brothers and sisters could hear the boy and the girls running about the garden 
4936-28619-0038	train-other-500	but they could not see them because the boards around the pig pen were too high The boy and the girls seemed to be having a fine time
4936-28619-0039	train-other-500	Squinty could hear them talking about hunting the hens eggs and feeding the little calves and sheep and riding on the backs of horses Then one day Squinty looked up out of the pen and leaning over the top board he saw the farmer the boy
none	none	 and another man Oh Father exclaimed the boy do let me have just one little pig They are so nice Illustration Oh Father exclaimed the boy do let me have just one little pig A pig cried Father What would you do with a pig in our town We are not in the country Where would you keep a pig Oh I could build a little pen for him in our yard 
4936-28619-0040	train-other-500	Look let me have that one he is so pink and pretty and clean Ha So you want that pig do you asked the farmer The boy and his father and sisters were paying a visit to the farm
4936-28619-0041	train-other-500	Yes I want a pig very much the boy said And I think I d like that one and he pointed straight at Squinty Poor Squinty ran and tried to hide under the straw for he knew the boy was talking about him
4936-28619-0042	train-other-500	Oh see him run cried the boy Yes I think he is the nicest pig in the lot I want him Has he any name Well we call him Squinty the farmer said He has a funny squinting eye
4936-28619-0043	train-other-500	Then I ll call him Squinty too the boy went on Please Father may I have that little pig Well I don t know said his father slowly scratching his head A pig is a queer pet
4936-28619-0044	train-other-500	I suppose you might have him though You could keep him in the back yard Yes I guess you could have him if mister Jones will sell him and if the pig will behave Do you think that little pig will be good mister Jones asked the father of the farmer man
4936-28619-0045	train-other-500	Well yes I guess so answered the farmer He has run away out of the pen a couple of times but if you board up a place good and tight I guess he won t get out
4936-28619-0046	train-other-500	Oh I do hope he ll be good exclaimed the boy I do so want a little pet pig and I ll be so kind to him
none	none	 When Squinty heard that he made up his mind if the boy took him that he would be as good as he knew how When can I have my little pig asked the boy of his father Oh as soon as mister Jones can put him in a box so we can carry him was the answer We can t very well take him in our arms he would slip out and run away I guess so too laughed the boy CHAPTER VI SQUINTY ON A JOURNEY Mamma did you hear what they were saying about Squinty asked Wuff Wuff as the boy and the two men walked away from the pig pen Oh yes I heard said missus Pig I shall be sorry to lose Squinty but then we pigs have to go out and take our places in this world We cannot always stay at home in the pen Yes that is so spoke mister Pig But Squinty is rather young and small to start out However it may all be for the best Now Squinty you had better keep yourself nice and clean so as to be ready to go on a journey What s a journey asked the comical little pig squinting his eye up at the papa pig A journey is going away from home answered mister Pig And does it mean having adventures asked Squinty flopping his ears backward and forward Yes you may have some adventures replied his mother Oh dear Squinty I wish you didn t have to go and leave us But still it may be all for your good We might hide him under the straw suggested Wuff Wuff Then that boy could not find him when he comes to put him in a box and take him away No that would never do said mister Pig The farmer is stronger and smarter than we are He would find Squinty no matter where we hid him It is better to let him do as he pleases and take Squinty away though we shall all miss him Oh dear cried Curly Tail for she liked her little brother very much and she loved to see him look at her with his funny squinting eye Do you want to go Squinty Well I don t want to leave you all answered the comical little pig but I shall be glad to go on a journey and have adventures I hope I don t get lost again though I guess the boy won t let you get lost spoke mister Pig He looks as though he would be kind and good to you The pig family did not know when Squinty would be taken away from them and all they could do was to wait While they were doing this they ate and slept as they always did Squinty several times looked at the hole under the pen by which he had once gotten out He felt sure he could again push his way through and run away But he did not do it No I will wait and let the boy take me away thought Squinty Several times after this the boy and his sisters came to look down into the pig pen The pigs could tell by the talk of the children that they were brother and sisters And they had come to the farm to spend their summer vacation when there was no school That s the pig I am going to take home with me the boy would say to his sisters pointing to Squinty How can you tell which one is yours asked one of the little girls I can tell by his funny squint the boy would answer He always makes me want to laugh Well I am glad I am of some use in this world thought Squinty who could understand nearly all that the boy and his sisters said It is something just to be jolly I wouldn t want a pig said the other girl They grunt and squeal and are not clean I d rather have a rabbit Pigs are so clean cried the boy Squinty is as clean as a rabbit Only that day Squinty had rolled over and over in the mud but he had had a bath from the hose so he was clean now And he made up his mind that if the boy took him he would never again get in the mud and become covered with dirt I will keep myself clean and jolly thought Squinty A few days after this Squinty heard the noise of hammering and sawing wood outside the pig pen The farmer must be building another barn said mister Pig for he and his family could not see outside the pen Yes he must be building another barn for once before we heard the sounds of hammering and sawing and then a new barn was built But that was not what it was this time Soon the sounds stopped and the farmer and the boy came and looked down into the pig pen Now you are sure you want that squinty one the farmer asked the boy Some of the others are bigger and better No I want the squinty one the boy said He is so comical he makes me laugh All right answered the farmer I ll get him for you now that you have the crate all made to carry him home in on the cars Over into the pig pen jumped the farmer He made a grab for Squinty and caught him Squee Squee Squee squealed Squinty for he had never been squeezed so tightly before Oh I m not going to hurt you said the farmer kindly Squinty be quiet ordered his papa in the pig language Behave yourself You are going on a journey and will be all right Then Squinty stopped squealing as the farmer climbed out of the pen with him At last I am going on a journey and I may have many adventures thought the little pig Good by he called to his papa and mamma and brothers and sisters left behind in the pen Good by Good by they all grunted and squealed Be a good pig said his mamma Be a brave pig said his papa And and come back and see us sometime sniffled little Curly Tail for she loved Squinty very much indeed I ll come back said the comical little pig But he did not know how much was to happen before he saw his pen again There you go into the box with you cried the farmer as he dropped Squinty into a wooden box the boy had made for his pet with a hammer saw and nails Squinty found himself dropped down on a bed of clean straw In front of him behind him and on either side of him were wooden slats the sides of the box Squinty could look out but the slats were as close together as those in a chicken coop and the little pig could not get out He did not want to however for he had made up his mind that he was going to be a good pig and go with the boy who had bought him for a pet from the farmer Over the top of the box was nailed a cover with a handle to it and by this handle the pig in the little cage could be easily carried There you are exclaimed the farmer Now he ll be all right until you get him home And when I do I ll put him in a nice big pen and feed him well said the boy Squinty smacked his lips at that for he was hungry even now Oh have you caged him up Isn t he cute exclaimed one of the boy s sisters I ll give him the core of my apple and she thrust it in through the slats of the box Squinty was very glad indeed to get the apple core and he soon ate it up Come on cried the boy s father Is the pig nailed up We must go for the train I wonder what the train is thought Squinty He was soon to know The boy lifted him up cage and all and put him into the wagon that was to go to the depot Squinty knew what a wagon was and horses for he had seen them many times Then away they started Squinty gave a loud squeal which was his last good by to the other pigs in the pen and then the wagon rattled away along the road Squinty had started on his journey CHAPTER VII SQUINTY LEARNS A TRICK Squinty the comical pig tried to look out through the slats of the box in which he was being taken away to see in which direction he was going He also wanted to watch the different sights along the road But the sides of the farm wagon were so high that the little pig could see nothing He stretched his fat neck as far as it would go but that did no good either Squinty wished he were as big as his papa or his mamma Then I could see what is going on he thought But just wishing never made anyone larger or taller not even a pig and Squinty stayed the same size He could hear the farmer and the children talking Now and then the boy who had bought Squinty and who was taking him home would look around at his pet in the slatted box Is he all right one of the girls would ask He seems to be the boy would say I am glad I got him Well he acts real cute said another girl who was called Sallie but I never heard of having a pig for a pet before You just wait until I teach him some tricks said the boy whose name was Bob Then you ll think he s fine Ha So I am to learn tricks thought Squinty in his box I wonder what tricks are anyhow Does it mean I am to have good things to eat I hope so You see Squinty like most little pigs thought more of something to eat than of anything else But we must not blame him for that since he could not help it Pretty soon the wagon rattled over some stones and then came to a stop Here we are called the children s father Bring along your little pig Bob Here comes the train Ha It seems I am to go on a train thought Squinty I wonder what a train is Squinty had many things to learn didn t he The little pig in the box felt himself being lifted out of the wagon Then he could look about him He saw a large building in front of which were long slender strips of shining steel These were the railroad tracks but Squinty did not know that Then all at once Squinty heard a loud noise which went like this Whee Whee Whee whee Oh my what a loud squeal that pig has exclaimed Squinty He can squeal much louder than I can I think Let me try So Squinty went Squee Squee Squee And then the big noise sounded again louder than before Whee Whee Toot Toot Oh my said Squinty to himself snuggling down in the straw of his box I never can squeal as loud as that Never He looked out and saw a big black thing rushing toward him with smoke coming out of the top and then the big black thing cried out again Whee Whee Toot Toot Oh what a terrible big black pig thought Squinty And he was a bit frightened But it was not a big black pig at all It was only the engine drawing the train of cars up to the station to take the passengers away And it was going to take Squinty also Squinty thought the engine whistle was a pig s squeal but it wasn t of course Pretty soon the train stopped The passengers made a rush to get in the cars Bob the boy caught up the handle of Squinty s box and after some bumping and tilting sideways the little pig found himself set down in a rather dark place for the boy had put the box on the floor of the car by his seat near his feet And there Squinty rode seeing nothing but hearing many strange noises until after many stops he was lifted up again Here we are the little pig heard the children s papa say Have you everything Don t forget your pig Bob I won t answered the boy with a jolly laugh Well I wonder what will happen next thought Squinty as he felt himself being carried along again He could see nothing but a crowd of persons all about the boy who carried the box I don t know whether I am going to like this or not this coming to live in town thought the little pig Still I cannot help myself I suppose But I do wish I had something to eat I guess the boy must have known Squinty was hungry for when he next set down the box this time in a carriage the boy gave the little pig a whole apple to eat And how good it did taste to Squinty Are you going to make a pen for him asked one of the boy s sisters as the carriage drove off Yes as soon as we get to the house said the boy By this time Squinty was thirsty There was no water in his cage but a little later when he saw through the slats that he was being carried toward a large white house he was given a tin of water to drink I ll just leave him in that box until I can fix a larger one for him the boy said and then for a while Squinty was left all to himself But he was still in the box though the box was set in a shady place on the back porch All this while mister Pig and missus Pig as well as the brother and sister pigs in the pen at home were wondering what had happened to Squinty Where do you think he is now Mamma Wuff Wuff would ask Oh I don t know missus Pig answered And will he ever come back to us asked Twisty Tail Perhaps some day I hope so said missus Pig sort of sighing Oh yes I think he will said mister Pig When he gets quite large the boy will get tired of having him for a pet and perhaps bring him back Were you ever carried off that way Papa asked Grunter as he rubbed his back where a mosquito had bitten him against the side of the pen Oh yes once answered mister Pig I was taken away from my pen when I was pretty large and given to a little girl for a pet But she did not keep me long I guess she would rather have had her dolls so I was soon brought back to my pen And I was glad of it Well I hope they will soon bring Squinty back Wuff Wuff said It is lonesome without him But after a while the other pigs found so many things to do and they were kept so busy eating sour milk and getting fat that they nearly forgot about Squinty But all this time something was happening to the comical little pig Toward evening of the first day that Squinty had been put in the new little cage the boy who had not been near him in some time came back to look at his pet Now I have a larger place for you the boy said speaking just as though Squinty could understand him And in fact Squinty did know much of what was said to him though he could not talk back in boy language being able to speak only his own pig talk And I guess you are hungry too and want something to eat the boy went on I will feed you Squee Squee Squee squealed Squinty If there was one word in man talk that he understood very well it was feed He had often heard the farmer say Well now I must feed the pigs And right after that some nice sour milk would come splashing down into the trough of the pen So when Squinty heard the word feed again he guessed what was going to happen And he guessed right too The boy picked Squinty up box and all and carried him to the back yard Now I ll give you more room to run about and then I ll have a nice supper for you the boy said talking to his little pig just as you would to your dog or kittie With a hammer the boy knocked off some of the slats of the small box in which Squinty had made his journey Then the boy lifted out the comical little pig and Squinty found himself inside a large box very much like the pen at home It had clean straw in it and a little trough just like the one at his home where he could eat But there was nothing in the trough to eat as yet and the box seemed quite lonesome for Squinty was all alone Here you are now Some nice sour milk and boiled potatoes cried the boy and then Squinty smelled the most delicious smell to him at least Down into the trough came the sour milk and potatoes Squee Squee yelled Squinty in delight And how fast he ate That was because he was hungry you see but pigs nearly always eat fast as though they were continually in a hurry Oh isn t it cute exclaimed a voice over Squinty s head He looked up half shutting his one funny eye and cocking one ear up and letting the other droop down But he did not stop eating Oh isn t he funny cried another voice And Squinty saw the boy and his sisters looking at him Yes he surely is a nice pig the boy said In a few days when he gets over being strange I m going to teach him some tricks Ha There s that word tricks again thought Squinty I wonder what tricks are But I shall very soon find out For a few days Squinty was rather lonesome in his new pen all by himself He missed his papa and mamma and brothers and sisters But the boy came to see Squinty every day bringing him nice things to eat and after a bit Squinty came to look for his new friend I guess you are getting to know me aren t you old fellow the boy said one day after feeding Squinty and he scratched the little pig on the back with a stick Uff Uff grunted Squinty That I suppose was his way of saying Of course I know you and I like you boy One day about a week after he had come to his new home Squinty heard the boy say Now I think you are tame enough to be let out I don t believe you will run away will you But anyhow I ll tie a string to your leg and then you can t Squinty wished he could speak boy language and tell his friend that he would not run away as long as he was kindly treated but of course Squinty could not do this Instead he could only grunt and squeal The boy tied a string to Squinty s leg and let him out of the pen The comical little pig was glad to have more room in which to move about He walked first to one side and then the other rooting in the dirt with his funny rubbery nose The boy laughed to see him I guess you are looking for something to eat the boy said Well let s see if you can find these acorns The boy hid them under a pile of dirt and watched Squinty smelled about and sniffed He could easily tell where the acorns had been hidden and a moment later he had rooted them up and was eating them Oh you funny little pig cried the boy You are real smart You know how to find acorns That is one trick Ha If that is a trick it is a very easy one just rooting up acorns thought Squinty to himself Squinty walked around as far as the rope tied to his leg would let him The other end of the rope was held by the boy Once the rope got tangled around Squinty s foot and he jumped over it to get free The boy saw him and cried Oh I wonder if I could teach you to jump the rope That would be a fine trick Let me see The boy thought a moment and then lifted Squinty up and set him down on one side of the rope which he raised a little way from the ground just as girls do when they are playing a skipping game On the other side of the rope the boy put an apple Now Squinty said Bob if you want that apple you must jump the rope to get it Come on At first Squinty did not understand what was wanted of him He saw nothing but the apple and thought how much he wanted it He started for it but before he could get it the boy pulled up the rope in front of him The rope stopped Squinty Jump over the rope if you want the apple said the boy Of course Squinty could not exactly understand this talk He tried once more to get the apple but every time he did he found the rope in front of him in the way Well exclaimed Squinty to himself I am going to get that apple rope or no rope I guess I ll have to get over the rope somehow So the next time he started for the juicy apple and the rope was pulled up in front of him Squinty gave a little spring and over the rope he went jumping with all four legs coming down on the other side like a circus man jumping over the elephant s back Illustration Squinty gave a little spring and over the rope he went Oh fine Good cried the boy clapping his hands Squinty has learned to do another trick Uff Uff grunted Squinty as he chewed the apple So that s another trick is it CHAPTER VIII SQUINTY IN THE WOODS Bob the boy who had bought Squinty the comical pig laughed and clapped his hands His two sisters who were playing with their dolls in the shade of an evergreen tree heard their brother and one of them called out What is it Bob What is it Oh come and see my pig do a trick answered the boy He is too funny for anything Can he really do a trick asked the smaller sister whose name was Mollie Indeed he can the boy said He can do two tricks find hidden acorns and jump a rope Oh no not really jump a rope cried Sallie You just come and see the boy called All this while Squinty was chewing on the apple which he had picked up from the ground after he had jumped over the rope He heard what the boy said and Squinty made up his mind Well said the little pig to himself if it is any fun for that boy and his sisters to watch me jump over a rope and dig up acorns I don t mind doing it for them They call them tricks but I call it getting something to eat And they were both right you see Sallie and Mollie the two sisters laid down their dolls in the shade and ran over toward their brother who still held one end of the rope that was fast to Squinty s leg Make him do some tricks for us begged Mollie Show us how he jumps the rope said Sallie First I ll have him dig up the acorns as that s easier spoke Bob Here Squinty he called Find the acorns Find em While Squinty had been munching on the apple the boy had dug a hole put some sweet acorn nuts into it and covered them up with dirt Squinty had not seen him do this but Squinty thought he could find the nuts just the same There were two ways of doing this Squinty had a very sharp smelling nose He could smell things afar off that neither you nor I could smell even close by And Squinty could also tell by digging in the ground with his queer rubbery nose just where the ground was soft and where it was hard And he knew it would be soft at the place where the boy had dug a hole in which to hide the acorns So when Bob called for Squinty to come and find the acorn nuts even though the little pig had not seen just where they were hidden Squinty felt sure he could dig them up He ll never find them said Sallie Just you watch exclaimed the boy He pulled on the rope around Squinty s leg At first the little pig was not quite sure what was wanted of him He thought perhaps he was to jump over the rope after another apple But he saw no fruit waiting for him Then he looked carefully about and smelled the air The boy was very gentle with him and waited patiently And I might say right here that if you ever try to teach your pets any tricks you must be both kind and gentle with them for you know they are not as smart as you are and cannot think as quickly Ha I smell acorns thought Squinty to himself I guess the boy must want me to do the first trick as he calls it and dig up the acorns I ll do it Carefully Squinty sniffed the air When he turned one way he could smell the acorns quite plainly When he turned the other way he could not smell them quite so well So he started off in the direction where he could most plainly smell the nuts he loved so well Next he began rooting in the ground At first it was very hard for his nose but soon it became soft Then he could smell the acorns more plainly than before See he is going right toward them cried the boy There he has them exclaimed Sallie Oh so he has spoke Mollie I wouldn t have thought he could And by that time Squinty had found the hole where the boy had covered the acorns with dirt and Squinty was chewing the sweet nuts Now make him jump the rope said Mollie I will as soon as he eats the acorns replied the boy Ha I am going to have another apple just for jumping a rope thought Squinty in delight You see the little pig imagined the trick was done just to get him to eat the apple He did not count the rope jumping part of it at all though that really was what the boy wanted Once more Bob placed the apple on the ground on the far side of the rope One end of the rope the boy held in his hand and the other was around Squinty s leg but a loop of it was made fast to a stick stuck in the ground so the boy could pull on the rope and raise or lower it just as you girls do when you play Come on now Squinty Jump over it called the boy The little pig saw the apple and smelled it He wanted very much to get it But when he ran toward it he found the rope raised up in front of him He forgot for a moment his second trick and stood still Oh I thought you said he would jump the rope said Mollie rather disappointed He will just wait a minute spoke the boy Come on Squinty he called Once more Squinty started for the apple This time he remembered that before he had to jump the rope to get it So he did it again Over the rope he went with a little jump coming down on the side where the apple was and in a second he was chewing the juicy fruit There cried the boy Didn t he jump the rope Oh well but he didn t jump it fast back and forth like we girls do said Mollie But it was pretty good for a little pig said Sallie I think so too spoke the boy And I am going to teach him to jump real fast and without going for an apple each time I m going to teach him other tricks too Oh dear thought Squinty when he heard this So I am to learn more tricks it seems Well I hope they will all be eating ones Make him do it again suggested Mollie after a bit No I haven t any more apples the boy answered And at first I ll have to make him jump for an apple each time After a bit I ll not give him an apple until he has done all his tricks Come on now Squinty back to your pen The boy lifted up his pet and put him back in the pen that had been especially built for the little pig As soon as he was in it Squinty ran over to the trough hoping there would be some sour milk in it But there was none You ve had enough to eat for a while said the boy with a laugh Later on I ll give you your milk Uff Uff grunted Squinty and I suppose he meant he would be glad to have the milk now But he got none so he curled himself up in the clean straw and went to sleep When he awakened he thought at first he was back in the pen at home and he cried out Oh Wuff Wuff Oh Twisty Tail I had the queerest dream I thought a boy had me and that I could jump a rope and hunt acorns and do lots of tricks But I And then Squinty stopped He looked around and found himself all alone in the new pen None of his brothers or sisters was near him and he could not hear his mamma or papa grunting near the feed trough Ha It wasn t a dream after all thought Squinty a bit sorrowfully It s all real I can do tricks and a boy has me Every few days after that the boy took Squinty out of his pen and let him do the rope jumping and the acorn hunting tricks And it did not take Squinty long to learn to jump the rope when there was no apple on the other side The boy would say Jump over the rope Squinty And over it the little pig would go But if he did not get the apple as soon as he jumped he did get it afterward which was just as good It was sort of a reward for his tricks you see Now you must learn a new trick said the boy one day I want you to learn how to walk on your hind legs Squinty It is not going to be easy either But I guess you can do it And I am going to take the rope off your leg for I do not believe you will run away from me now So the rope was taken off Squinty s leg And he liked the boy so much and liked his new home and the nuts and apples he got to eat were so good that Squinty did not try to run away Up on your hind legs cried the boy and by taking hold of Squinty s front feet Bob raised his pet up on the hind legs Now stand there the boy cried but when he took away his hands of course Squinty came down on all four legs He did not know what the boy meant to have him do I guess I ll have to stand you in a corner to start with the boy said That will brace you up Then kindly and gently the boy took Squinty over to the place where the corn crib was built on to the barn This made a corner and the little pig was stood up on his hind legs in that Then with something to lean his back against he did not feel like falling over and he remained standing up on two legs with his front feet stuck out in front of him That s the way to do it cried Bob Soon you will be able to stand up without anything to lean against And a little later you will be able to walk on your hind legs Now here s an apple for you Squinty So you see Squinty received his reward for starting to learn a new trick In a few days just as the boy had said the little pig found that he could sit up on his hind legs all alone without anything to lean back against But learning to walk on his hind legs was a little harder The boy however was patient and kind to him At first Bob held Squinty s front feet and walked along with him so the little pig would get used to the new trick Then one day Bob said Now Squinty I want you to walk to me all by yourself Stand up Squinty stood up on his hind legs The boy backed away from him and stood a little distance off holding out a nice juicy potato this time Come and get the potato called the boy Squee Squee grunted Squinty I can t I suppose he meant to say Come on cried the boy Don t be afraid You can do it Squinty wanted that potato very much And the only way to get it was to walk to it on his hind legs If he let himself down on all four legs he knew the boy would not give him the potato So Squinty made up his little pig mind that he would do this new trick Off he started walking by himself on his hind legs just like a trained bear Fine That s the way to do it I knew you could the boy cried when Squinty reached him and took the potato out of his hand Good little pig and he scratched Squinty s back with a stick Uff Uff squealed Squinty very much pleased And from then on the comical little pig learned many tricks He could stand up a long time on his hind legs with an apple on his nose And he would not eat it until the boy called Now Squinty Then Squinty would toss the apple up in the air off his nose and catch it as it came down Oh how good it tasted Squinty also learned to march around with a stick for a gun and play soldier He liked this trick best of all for he always had two apples to eat after that Many of Bob s boy friends came to see his trained pig They all thought he was very funny and cute and they laughed very hard when Squinty looked at them with his queer drooping eye They would feed him apples potatoes and sometimes bits of cake that Bob s mother gave them Squinty grew very fond of cake Then one day something happened Bob always used to lock the door of the new pig pen every night for though he knew his pet was quite tame now he thought if the door were left open Squinty might wander away And that is exactly what Squinty did He did not mean to do wrong but he knew no better One evening after he had done many tricks that day when Squinty found the door of his pen part way open he just pushed it the rest of the way with his strong nose and out he walked No one saw him Uff Uff grunted Squinty looking about I guess I ll go take a walk by myself I may find something good to eat Out of the pen he went There was no garden here such as the farmer had at Squinty s first home But not far from the pig pen was the big green wood I ll go over in there and see what happens thought Squinty Perhaps I may find some acorns And so Squinty ran away to the woods CHAPTER IX SQUINTY S BALLOON RIDE This was the third time Squinty had run away But not once did he intend to do any wrong you see he knew no better He just found his pen door open and walked out that was all there was to it I wonder what will happen to me this time thought the comical little pig as he hurried along over the ground toward the woods I don t believe Don the dog will find me here for he must be back on the farm But some other dog might I had better be careful I guess When Squinty thought this he stopped and looked carefully around for any signs of a barking dog But he saw none It was very still and quiet for it was nearly supper time in the big house where Bob lived and he and his sisters were waiting for the bell to ring to call them to the table But Squinty had had his supper and for the time he was not hungry And if I do get hungry again I may find something in the woods he said to himself Acorn nuts grow in the woods and they are very good I ll root up some of them Once or twice Squinty looked back toward the pen he had run away from to see if Bob his master were coming after him But Bob had no idea his little pet had run away In fact just then Bob was wondering what new trick he could teach Squinty the next day On and on ran the comical pig Once he found something round and yellow on the ground Ha That looks like a yellow apple thought Squinty and he bit it hard with his white teeth Then his mouth all puckered up he felt a sour taste and he cried out Wow I don t like that Oh that isn t an apple at all And it wasn t it was a lemon the grocery boy had dropped Oh How sour grunted Squinty I d like a drink of water to take the taste of that out of my mouth Squinty lifted his nose up in the air and sniffed and snuffed He wanted to try to smell a spring of water and he did just on the edge of the big wood Over to the spring he ran on his little short legs and soon he was having a fine drink Now I feel better Squinty said What will happen next Nothing did for some time and when it did it was so strange that Squinty never forgot it as long as he lived I ll tell you all about it He walked on through the woods Squinty did and before very long he found some acorns He ate as many as he wanted and then as he always felt sleepy after he had eaten he thought he would lie down and have a nap He found a place near a big stump where there was a soft bed of dried leaves nearly as nice as his straw bed in the pen at home On this he stretched out and soon he was fast asleep When Squinty awoke it was real dark He jumped up with a little grunt and said to himself Well I did not mean to stay away from my pen so long I guess I had better go back Squinty started to go back the way he had come but I guess you can imagine what happened It was so dark he could not find the path He walked about stumbling over sticks and stones and stumps sometimes falling down on soft moss and again on the hard ground Finally Squinty thought Well it is of no use I can t get back tonight that is sure I shall have to stay here Oh dear I hope there are no dogs to bite me Squinty listened carefully He could hear no barks He hunted around in the dark until he found another soft bed of leaves and on that he cuddled himself up to go to sleep for the night He was a little afraid but after all he was used to sleeping alone and even though he was outside of his pen now he did not worry much In the morning I shall go back to the boy who taught me tricks thought Squinty But something else happened in the morning Squinty was awake when the sun first peeped up from behind the clouds The little pig scratched his ear where a mosquito had bitten him during the night Then he stretched first one leg and then the others and said Ha Ho Hum Uff Uff I guess I ll have some acorns for my breakfast It was a very easy matter for Squinty to get his breakfast He did not have to wash or comb his hair or even dress Just as he was he got up out of his leaf bed and began rooting around in the ground for acorns He soon found all he wanted and ate them Then he felt thirsty so he looked around until he had found another spring of cool water where he drank as much as he needed And now to go back home to the boy who taught me tricks said Squinty to himself I guess he is wondering where I am And indeed that boy Bob and his sisters Mollie and Sallie were wondering where Squinty was They saw the open door of the pen and the boy recalled that he had forgotten to lock it Oh Squinty is gone he cried and he felt very badly indeed But I have no time to tell you more of that boy now I must relate for you the wonderful adventures of Squinty Squinty went this way and that through the woods but he could not find the path that led to his pen He tried and tried again but it was of no use Well said Squinty at last sitting down beside a hollow log I guess I am lost That is all there is to it I am lost in the big woods Oh dear I almost wish Don the dog or the farmer would come and find me now He waited but no one came He listened but he heard nothing Well I might as well eat and go to sleep again said Squinty Maybe something will happen then Soon he was asleep again But he was suddenly awakened He heard a great crashing in the trees over his head Gracious I hope that isn t a dog after me cried the little pig He looked up Squinty did He saw coming down from the sky through the branches of the trees a big round thing like more than ten thousand rubber balls made into one Below the round thing hung a square basket with many ropes and other things fast to it And in the basket were two men They looked over the edge of the basket One of them pulled on a rope and the big thing which was a balloon though Squinty did not know it came to the ground with a bang Well at last we have made a landing said one of the men Yes said the other And we shall have to throw out some bags of sand to go up again Squinty did not know what this meant But I ll explain to you that a landing is when a balloon comes down to the ground And when the men in it want to go up again they have to toss out some of the bags of sand or ballast they carry to make the balloon so light that the gas in it will take it up again The men began tossing out the bags of sand Squinty saw them but he was not afraid Why should he be for no men or boys had ever been cruel to him Uff Uff grunted Squinty getting up and going over to one of the bags of sand Maybe that is good to eat he thought If it is I will take a bite I am hungry Oh look at that pig suddenly called one of the men in the balloon basket Sure enough it is a pig exclaimed the other And what a comical little chap he is he went on See the funny way he looks at you At that moment Squinty looked up as he often did with one eye partly closed the other open and with one ear cocked frontwards and the other backwards Say he s a cute one all right said the first man Let s take him along What for asked his friend We d only have to toss out as much sand as he weighs so we could go up Oh let s take him along anyhow insisted the other Maybe he ll be a mascot for us Well if he s a mascot all right Then we ll take him We need some good luck on this trip Squinty did not know what a mascot was Perhaps he thought it was something good to eat But I might say that a mascot is something which some persons think brings them good luck Often baseball nines or football elevens will have a small boy or a goat or a dog whom they call their mascot They take him along whenever they play games thinking the mascot helps them to win Of course it really does not but there is no harm in a mascot anyhow Yes we ll take him along in the balloon with us said the taller of the two men See he doesn t seem to be a bit afraid No and look He must be a trick pig Maybe he got away from some circus cried the other man For at that moment Squinty stood up on his hind legs as the boy had taught him and walked over toward the big balloon basket What he really wanted was something to eat but the men did not know that He surely is a cute little pig cried the tall man I ll lift him in You toss out another bag of sand and we ll go up Illustration The next moment Squinty felt himself lifted off the ground The next moment before he could get out of the man s grasp if he had wanted to Squinty felt himself lifted off the ground He was put down in the bottom of the basket which held many things and a second later Squinty the comical pig felt himself flying upward through the air Squinty was off on a trip in a balloon CHAPTER X SQUINTY AND THE SQUIRREL Up up and up some more went Squinty the comical pig At first the fast motion in the balloon made him a little dizzy just as it might make you feel queer the first time you went on a merry go round Uff Uff grunted Squinty He was so surprised at this sudden adventure that really he did not know what to say I wonder if he s afraid said one of the men He acts so the other answered But he ll get used to it How high up are you going Oh about a mile I guess Squinty cuddled down in the basket of the balloon between two bags full of something and shivered My goodness me thought poor Squinty A mile up in the air That s awfully high He knew about how far a mile was on land for it was about the distance from the farmhouse near where his pen used to be to the village church He had often heard the farmer man say so And if it was a mile from my pen to the church and that mile of road was stood straight up in the air thought Squinty it would be a terrible long way to fall I hope I don t fall And it did not seem as if he would at least not right away The basket in which he was riding looked good and strong Squinty had shut his eyes when he heard the men speak about going a mile up in the air but now as the balloon seemed to have stopped rising the little pig opened his eyes again and peered all about him Look exclaimed one of the men with a laugh Hasn t that pig the most comical face you ever saw That s what he has answered the other He makes me want to laugh every time I look at him with that funny half shut eye of his Well thought Squinty I m glad somebody is happy and jolly and wants to laugh for I m sure I don t I wish I hadn t run away from the nice boy who taught me the tricks Then as Squinty remembered how he had been taught to stand up on his hind legs he thought he would do that trick now He was hungry and he imagined perhaps if he did that trick the men would give him something to eat Look at the little chap cried one of the men He s showing off all right Yes he s a smart pig said the other He must be a trick pig and I guess whoever owns him will be sorry he is lost Hu I m sorry myself thought Squinty to himself as he walked around on his hind legs I wonder if these men are ever going to give me anything to eat he went on He looked at them from his queer squinting eye but the men did not seem to know that the little pig was hungry On and on sailed the balloon being blown by the wind like a sailboat Squinty dropped down on his four legs since he found that walking on his hind ones brought him no food Then as he made his way about the basket he saw some more of those queer bags filled with something There were a great many of them in the balloon and Squinty thought they must have something good in them Squinty squatted down beside one and with his strong teeth he soon had bitten a hole in the cloth Then he took a big bite but oh dear All at once he found his mouth filled with coarse sand that gritted on his teeth and made the cold shivers run down his back Oh wow thought poor Squinty That s no good Sand I wonder if those men eat sand Of course they didn t The sand in the bags was ballast The balloon men carried it with them and when they found the balloon coming down because some of the gas had leaked out of the round ball above the basket they would let some of the sand run out of the bags to the ground below This would make the balloon lighter and it would rise again Squee Squee Uff Uff grunted Squinty as he wiped the sand off his tongue on one of his legs I don t like that I m hungry Why what s the matter with the little pig asked one of the men turning around and looking at Squinty He must be hungry said the other See he has bitten a hole in one of our sand bags Let s feed him All right Give him something to eat but we didn t bring any pig food along with us I ll give him some bread and milk the other man said We won t want much more ourselves for we are nearly at our last landing place Squee Squee squealed Squinty when he heard this He watched the man put some bread and milk in a tin pan and set it down on the floor of the basket Then Squinty put his nose in the dish and began to eat And Oh how good it tasted Of course the milk was sweet instead of sour for men do not usually like sour milk Squinty had a good meal and then he went to sleep What happened while Squinty slept the little pig did not know But when he woke up it was all dark and he knew it must be night so he went to sleep again And the next time he awakened the sun was shining so he felt sure it was morning And then all of a sudden something happened One of the men called out There is a good place to land Yes we ll go down there agreed the other Then he pulled a string Squinty did not know what it was for but I ll tell you It was to open a hole in the balloon so the gas would rush out Then the balloon would begin to fall And that is what happened Down down went the balloon It went very fast and Squinty felt dizzy Faster and faster fell the balloon until at last it gave such a bump down on the ground that Squinty was bounced right over the side of the basket Right out of the basket the comical little pig was bounced but he came down in a soft bed of leaves so he was not hurt in the least He landed on his feet just like a cat and gave a loud squeal he was so surprised And then Squinty ran away Almost anybody would have run too I guess after falling down in a balloon and being bounced out that way Squinty had had enough of balloon riding I don t know where I m going nor what will happen to me now thought Squinty but I am going to run and hide And run he did He found himself in the woods just the same kind of woods as where he had first met the two balloon men only of course it was much farther off for he had traveled a long way through the air On and on ran Squinty All at once in a tree over his head he heard a funny chattering noise Chipper chipper chipper Chat Chat Whir r r r r went the noise Squinty looked up in the tree and there he saw a lovely little girl squirrel frisking about on the branches Then Squinty was no longer afraid Out of the leaves he jumped giving a squeal and a grunt which meant Oh how do you do I am glad to see you My name is Squinty What is your name My name is Slicko answered the lively little girl squirrel as she jumped about Come on and play Squinty felt very happy then CHAPTER XI SQUINTY AND THE MERRY MONKEY Where do you live Squinty asked Slicko the jumping squirrel as she skipped from one tree branch to another and so reached the ground near the comical little pig Oh I live in a pen answered Squinty but I m not there now No I see you are not spoke Slicko with a laugh which showed her sharp white teeth But what are you doing so far away from your pen Or perhaps it is close by though I never saw you in these woods before she went on looking around as if she might see the pig pen under one of the trees No I have never been here before Squinty answered My pen is far from here My master is a boy who taught me to do tricks such as jumping rope but I ran away and had a balloon ride What s a balloon asked Slicko as she combed out her tail with a chestnut burr Squirrels always use chestnut burrs for combs A balloon is something that goes up in the air answered Squinty and it has bags of sand in it Well I can go up in the air when I climb a tree went on Slicko with a jolly laugh Am I a balloon No you are not said Squinty A balloon is very different Well I know where there is some sand spoke Slicko I could get some of that and put it in leaf bags Would that make me a balloon Oh no of course not Squinty answered You could never be a balloon But if you know where there is some sand perhaps you know where there is some sour milk I am very hungry I never heard of sour milk replied the girl squirrel But I know where to find some nuts Do you like hickory nuts I I guess so answered Squinty thinking perhaps they were like acorns Please show me where there are some Come on chattered Slicko She led the way through the woods leaping from one tree branch to another over Squinty s head The little pig ran along on the ground through the dry leaves Sometimes he went on four feet and sometimes he stood up straight on his hind feet Can you do that he asked the squirrel It is a trick the boy taught me Oh yes I can sit up on my hind legs and eat a nut the squirrel girl said But nobody taught me I could always do it I don t call that a trick Well it is a trick for me said Squinty But where are the hickory nuts you spoke of Right here answered Slicko the jumping squirrel hopping about as lively as a cricket and she pointed to a pile of nuts in a hollow stump Squinty tried to chew some but as soon as he took them in his mouth he cried out Oh my How hard the shells are This is worse than the sand I can t chew hickory nuts Have you no other kind Oh yes I know where there are some acorns answered Slicko but I do not care for them as well as for hickory nuts Oh please show me the acorns begged Squinty Here they are spoke Slicko jumping a little farther and she pointed to a pile of acorns in another hollow stump Oh these are fine Thank you grunted Squinty and he began to eat them All at once there sounded through the woods a noise like Chat Chat Chatter Whir r r r r r My what s that cried Squinty turning quickly around That is my mamma calling me said Slicko the jumping squirrel I shall have to go home to my nest now Good by Squinty I like you very much and I hope I shall soon see you again I hope so too spoke Squinty and while he went on eating the acorns Slicko ran along the tree branches to her nest And in another book I shall tell you some more stories about Slicko the Jumping Squirrel but in this book I have room to write only about Squinty The little comical pig was rather lonesome after Slicko had left him but he was no longer hungry thanks to the acorns So he walked on and on and pretty soon he came to a road And down the road he saw coming the strangest sight There were a lot of big wagons all painted red and green and gold Many horses drew each wagon the big wheels of which rattled like thunder and beside the wagons there were many strange animals walking along animals which Squinty had never seen before Oh my cried Squinty This is worse than the balloon I must run away But just as he turned to run he saw a little animal jump out of one of the big wagons and come toward him This animal was something like a little boy only instead of clothes he was covered with hairy fur And the animal had a long tail which Squinty knew no boy ever had Squinty was so surprised at seeing the strange animal that the little pig stood still The hairy animal with the long tail came straight for the bush behind which Squinty was hiding and crawled through Then the two stood looking at one another while the big wagons rumbled past on the road Hello Squinty finally exclaimed Who are you Why I am Mappo the merry monkey was the answer as he curled his long tail around a stick of wood But I don t need to ask who you are You are a pig I can see that for we have one in our circus and the clown rides him around the ring and it is too funny for anything Illustration Why I am Mappo the merry monkey was the answer Ha so you are a monkey asked Squinty But what do you mean by a circus That s a circus answered Mappo pointing with one paw through a hole in the bush at the queer animals and the red gold and green wagons That is it will be a circus when they put up the big tent and all the people come Didn t you ever see a circus Never answered Squinty Did you ever ride in a balloon Never answered Mappo Well then we are even said Squinty Now you tell me about a circus and I ll tell you about the balloon Well said the monkey a circus is a big show in a tent to make people laugh There are clowns and animals to look at I am one of the animals but I ran out of my cage when the door flew open Why did you run away asked Squinty Oh I got tired of staying in a cage And I was afraid the big tiger might bite me I ll run back again pretty soon before they miss me Now you tell me about your balloon ride So Squinty told the merry monkey all about running away and learning tricks and having a ride in the queer basket I can do tricks too said Mappo But just now I am hungry I wonder if any cocoanut trees are in these woods I don t know what a cocoanut is answered Squinty but I ll give you some of my acorns The comical little pig and the merry monkey hid under the bush and ate acorns as they watched the circus procession go past It was not a regular parade as the show was going only from one town to another Squinty looked at the beautiful wagons and at the strange animals some with big humps on their backs At last he saw some very big creatures and he cried out Oh Mappo What are those animals They have a tail at each end Those are elephants said Mappo and they do not have two tails One is a tail and the other is their trunk or long nose by which they pick up peanuts and other things to eat and they can drink water through it too Oh elephants eh exclaimed Squinty But who is that big fierce looking one with two long teeth sticking out I would be afraid of him Ha Ha You wouldn t need to be said Mappo with a merry laugh That is Tum Tum the jolliest elephant in the whole circus Why he is so kind he wouldn t hurt a fly and he is so happy that every one loves him He is always playing jokes Well I m glad he is so jolly spoke Squinty as he watched Tum Tum and the other elephants march slowly along the road on their big feet like wash tubs swinging their long trunks Then Mappo the monkey and Squinty the comical pig started off through the woods CHAPTER XII SQUINTY GETS HOME AGAIN Squinty I don t believe we re going to find any cocoanut trees in this woods said Mappo the monkey after he and the little pig had wandered on for some time It doesn t seem so does it spoke Squinty looking all around first with his wide open eye and then with his queer droopy one The monkey ran along now on the ground and now and then swinging himself up in the branches of trees by his long legs each one of which had a sort of hand on the end Sometimes he hung by his tail for monkeys are made to do that My I wish I could get up in the trees the way you do said Squinty Do you think I could hang by my tail Mappo I don t know answered the monkey scratching his head Your tail has a nice little curl in it almost like mine Did you ever try to hang by your tail No I never did Well you don t know what you can do until you try said Mappo The two animal friends soon came to where some of the acorn nuts had fallen off a tree and they ate as many as they wanted Mappo said they were not as good as cocoanuts but he liked them pretty well because he was hungry And Squinty thought acorns were just the best things he had ever tasted except apples and potatoes or perhaps sour milk By this time it was getting dark and Squinty said Oh dear I wonder where we can sleep tonight Oh do not let that worry you said Mappo I am used to living in the woods When I was little before I was caught and put in the circus I lived in the woods all the while See here is a nice hollow stump filled with leaves for you to sleep in and I will climb a tree and sleep in that Couldn t you sleep down in the stump with me asked Squinty It s sort of lonesome all by yourself in the dark Yes I ll sleep with you said Mappo Now we ll make up a nice bed But just as they were piling some more leaves in the hollow stump they heard many voices of men shouting in the woods Here he is Here is that runaway monkey I see him Come and catch him cried the men Oh they re from the circus They re after me cried Mappo I must run and hide Good by Squinty I ll see you again sometime maybe You had better run also or the circus men may catch you Squinty looked through the trees and saw a number of men coming toward him and the monkey Then Mappo climbed up in a tall tree and Squinty ran away as fast as his little short legs would take him Never mind the pig Get the monkey Squinty heard one man cry and then the comical little pig dodged under a bush and kept on running When Squinty stopped running it was quite dark He could hardly see and he had run into several trees and bumped his nose a number of times It hurt him very much Well I guess I m lost again thought Squinty And I am all alone Oh what a lot of things has happened to me since I was in the pen with my mamma and papa and sisters and brothers I wish I were back with them again Squinty felt very sad and lonesome He wondered if the circus men had caught Mappo Then he felt that he had better find a place where he could cover himself up with the dry leaves and go to sleep He walked about in the dark until all of a sudden he stumbled into a hole that was filled with dried grass I guess I had better stay here thought Squinty So he pulled some of the grass over him and went to sleep When he awoke the sun was shining I must get my breakfast thought Squinty He hunted about until he had found some acorns and then coming to a little brook of water he took a long drink Something about the brook made Squinty look at it carefully Why why he exclaimed to himself It seems to me I have been here before Yes I am sure I have This is the place where I first came to get a drink when first I ran away It is near the pen where I used to live Oh I wonder if I can find that The heart of Squinty was beating fast as he looked around at the scenes he had seen when he was a very little pig some weeks before Yes it was the same brook He was sure of it And there was the garden of potatoes and the cornfield where he had first lost his way Hark What was that Off in the rows of corn he heard a dog barking Somehow he knew that dog s bark If that could be Don thought Squinty hopefully The barking sounded nearer Squinty turned around standing on the edge of the little brook and waited his heart beating faster and faster All at once there came running through the potato field a black and white dog Squinty knew him at once It was Don Bow wow Bow wow barked Don Well if there isn t that comical little pig Squinty Where in the world did you come from You ve been running away I ll be bound Now I m going to take you back to the pen Oh Don I am so glad to see you squealed Squinty I I did run away but I never will any more I am lost Oh Don don t take me by the ear I ll go with you All right barked Don kindly Come along Your pen isn t far off and he ran along beside the little pig who after many adventures had wandered back home Squinty and Don came to the edge of the potato field Well I never exclaimed the farmer man who was there hoeing the potatoes If there isn t that comical little pig I sold to that boy Bob I wonder where he came from Bow wow Bow wow I found him barked Don but of course the farmer did not understand Well I ll put you back in the pen again until that boy sends for you said the farmer as he lifted Squinty over into the pen where his mamma and papa and brothers and sisters were Why why it s Squinty cried missus Pig He s come back grunted mister Pig Oh I m so glad said Wuff Wuff And so am I added Twisty Tail as she rubbed her nose against Squinty s Where have you been and what happened to you she asked her brother Oh many things he said I have learned some tricks I have been up in a balloon I met Slicko the jumping squirrel Mappo the merry monkey and I saw Tum Tum the jolly circus elephant Now I am home again And which did you like best of all asked missus Pig when they had finished asking him questions Getting back home answered Squinty as he took a big drink of sour milk And that is the story of Squinty the comical pig The farmer sent word to the boy that his pet was back in the pen but the boy said he thought he did not want a pet pig any more

with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project
