XLV SAVED AND LOST CHAPTER I MONKSHAVEN On the north eastern shores of England there is a town called Monkshaven containing at the present day about fifteen thousand inhabitants There were however but half the number at the end of the last century and it was at that period that the events narrated in the following pages occurred Monkshaven was a name not unknown in the history of England and traditions of its having been the landing place of a throneless queen were current in the town At that time there had been a fortified castle on the heights above it the site of which was now occupied by a deserted manor house and at an even earlier date than the arrival of the queen and coeval with the most ancient remains of the castle a great monastery had stood on those cliffs overlooking the vast ocean that blended with the distant sky Monkshaven itself was built by the side of the Dee just where the river falls into the German Ocean The principal street of the town ran parallel to the stream and smaller lanes branched out of this and straggled up the sides of the steep hill between which and the river the houses were pent in There was a bridge across the Dee and consequently a Bridge Street running at right angles to the High Street and on the south side of the stream there were a few houses of more pretension around which lay gardens and fields It was on this side of the town that the local aristocracy lived And who were the great people of this small town Not the younger branches of the county families that held hereditary state in their manor houses on the wild bleak moors that shut in Monkshaven almost as effectually on the land side as ever the waters did on the sea board No these old families kept aloof from the unsavoury yet adventurous trade which brought wealth to generation after generation of certain families in Monkshaven The magnates of Monkshaven were those who had the largest number of ships engaged in the whaling trade Something like the following was the course of life with a Monkshaven lad of this class He was apprenticed as a sailor to one of the great ship owners to his own father possibly along with twenty other boys or it might be even more During the summer months he and his fellow apprentices made voyages to the Greenland seas returning with their cargoes in the early autumn and employing the winter months in watching the preparation of the oil from the blubber in the melting sheds and learning navigation from some quaint but experienced teacher half schoolmaster half sailor who seasoned his instructions by stirring narrations of the wild adventures of his youth The house of the ship owner to whom he was apprenticed was his home and that of his companions during the idle season between October and March The domestic position of these boys varied according to the premium paid some took rank with the sons of the family others were considered as little better than servants Yet once on board an equality prevailed in which if any claimed superiority it was the bravest and brightest After a certain number of voyages the Monkshaven lad would rise by degrees to be captain and as such would have a share in the venture all these profits as

none	none	as all his savings would go towards building a whaling vessel of his own if he was not so fortunate as to be the child of a ship owner At the time of which I write there was but little division of labour in the Monkshaven whale fishery The same man might be the owner of six or seven ships any one of which he himself was fitted by education and experience to command the master of a score of apprentices each of whom paid a pretty sufficient premium and the proprietor of the melting sheds into which his cargoes of blubber and whalebone were conveyed to be fitted for sale It was no wonder that large fortunes were acquired by these ship owners nor that their houses on the south side of the river Dee were stately mansions full of handsome and substantial furniture It was also not surprising that the whole town had an amphibious appearance to a degree unusual even in a seaport Every one depended on the whale fishery and almost every male inhabitant had been or hoped to be a sailor Down by the river the smell was almost intolerable to any but Monkshaven people during certain seasons of the year but on these unsavoury staithes the old men and children lounged for hours almost as if they revelled in the odours of train oil This is perhaps enough of a description of the town itself I have said that the country for miles all around was moorland high above the level of the sea towered the purple crags whose summits were crowned with greensward that stole down the sides of the scaur a little way in grassy veins Here and there a brook forced its way from the heights down to the sea making its channel into a valley more or less broad in long process of time And in the moorland hollows as in these valleys trees and underwood grew and flourished so that while on the bare swells of the high land you shivered at the waste desolation of the scenery when you dropped into these wooded bottoms you were charmed with the nestling shelter which they gave But above and around these rare and fertile vales there were moors for many a mile here and there bleak enough with the red freestone cropping out above the scanty herbage then perhaps there was a brown tract of peat and bog uncertain footing for the pedestrian who tried to make a short cut to his destination then on the higher sandy soil there was the purple ling or commonest species of heather growing in beautiful wild luxuriance Tufts of fine elastic grass were occasionally to be found on which the little black faced sheep browsed but either the scanty food or their goat like agility kept them in a lean condition that did not promise much for the butcher nor yet was their wool of a quality fine enough to make them profitable in that way to their owners In such districts there is little population at the present day there was much less in the last century before agriculture was sufficiently scientific to have a chance of contending with such natural disqualifications as the moors presented and when there were no facilities of railroads to bring sportsmen from a distance to enjoy the shooting season and make an annual demand for accommodation There were old stone halls in the valleys there were bare farmhouses to be seen on the moors at long distances apart with small stacks of coarse poor hay and almost larger stacks of turf for winter fuel in their farmyards The cattle in the pasture fields belonging to these farms looked half starved but somehow there was an odd intelligent expression in their faces as well as in those of the black visaged sheep which is seldom seen in the placidly stupid countenances of well fed animals All the fences were turf banks with loose stones piled into walls on the top of these There was comparative fertility and luxuriance down below in the rare green dales The narrow meadows stretching along the brookside seemed as though the cows could really satisfy their hunger in the deep rich grass whereas on the higher lands the scanty herbage was hardly worth the fatigue of moving about in search of it Even in these bottoms the piping sea winds following the current of the stream stunted and cut low any trees but still there was rich thick underwood tangled and tied together with brambles and brier rose sic and honeysuckle and if the farmer in these comparatively happy valleys had had wife or daughter who cared for gardening many a flower would have grown on the western or southern side of the rough stone house But at that time gardening was not a popular art in any part of England in the north it is not yet Noblemen and gentlemen may have beautiful gardens but farmers and day labourers care little for them north of the Trent which is all I can answer for A few berry bushes a black currant tree or two the leaves to be used in heightening the flavour of tea the fruit as medicinal for colds and sore throats a potato ground and this was not so common at the close of the last century as it is now a cabbage bed a bush of sage and balm and thyme and marjoram with possibly a rose tree and old man growing in the midst a little plot of small strong coarse onions and perhaps some marigolds the petals of which flavoured the salt beef broth such plants made up a well furnished garden to a farmhouse at the time and place to which my story belongs But for twenty miles inland there was no forgetting the sea nor the sea trade refuse shell fish seaweed the offal of the melting houses were the staple manure of the district great ghastly whale jaws bleached bare and white were the arches over the gate posts to many a field or moorland stretch Out of every family of several sons however agricultural their position might be one had gone to sea and the mother looked wistfully seaward at the changes of the keen piping moorland winds The holiday rambles were to the coast no one cared to go inland to see aught unless indeed it might be to the great annual horse fairs held where the dreary land broke into habitation and cultivation Somehow in this country sea thoughts followed the thinker far inland whereas in most other parts of the island at five miles from the ocean he has all but forgotten the existence of such an element as salt water The great Greenland trade of the coasting towns was the main and primary cause of this no doubt But there was also a dread and an irritation in every one s mind at the time of which I write in connection with the neighbouring sea Since the termination of the American war there had been nothing to call for any unusual energy in manning the navy and the grants required by Government for this purpose diminished with every year of peace In seventeen ninety two this grant touched its minimum for many years In seventeen ninety three the proceedings of the French had set Europe on fire and the English were raging with anti Gallican excitement fomented into action by every expedient of the Crown and its Ministers We had our ships but where were our men The Admiralty had however a ready remedy at hand with ample precedent for its use and with common if not statute law to sanction its application They issued press warrants calling upon the civil power throughout the country to support their officers in the discharge of their duty The sea coast was divided into districts under the charge of a captain in the navy who again delegated sub districts to lieutenants and in this manner all homeward bound vessels were watched and waited for all ports were under supervision and in a day if need were a large number of men could be added to the forces of his Majesty s navy But if the Admiralty became urgent in their demands they were also willing to be unscrupulous Landsmen if able bodied might soon be trained into good sailors and once in the hold of the tender which always awaited the success of the operations of the press gang it was difficult for such prisoners to bring evidence of the nature of their former occupations especially when none had leisure to listen to such evidence or were willing to believe it if they did listen or would act upon it for the release of the captive if they had by possibility both listened and believed Men were kidnapped literally disappeared and nothing was ever heard of them again The street of a busy town was not safe from such press gang captures as Lord Thurlow could have told after a certain walk he took about this time on Tower Hill when he the attorney general of England was impressed when the Admiralty had its own peculiar ways of getting rid of tiresome besiegers and petitioners Nor yet were lonely inland dwellers more secure many a rustic went to a statute fair or mop and never came home to tell of his hiring many a stout young farmer vanished from his place by the hearth of his father and was no more heard of by mother or lover so great was the press for men to serve in the navy during the early years of the war with France and after every great naval victory of that war The servants of the Admiralty lay in wait for all merchantmen and traders there were many instances of vessels returning home after long absence and laden with rich cargo being boarded within a day s distance of land and so many men pressed and carried off that the ship with her cargo became unmanageable from the loss of her crew drifted out again into the wild wide ocean and was sometimes found in the helpless guidance of one or two infirm or ignorant sailors sometimes such vessels were never heard of more The men thus pressed were taken from the near grasp of parents or wives and were often deprived of the hard earnings of years which remained in the hands of the masters of the merchantman in which they had served subject to all the chances of honesty or dishonesty life or death Now all this tyranny for I can use no other word is marvellous to us we cannot imagine how it is that a nation submitted to it for so long even under any warlike enthusiasm any panic of invasion any amount of loyal subservience to the governing powers When we read of the military being called in to assist the civil power in backing up the press gang of parties of soldiers patrolling the streets and sentries with screwed bayonets placed at every door while the press gang entered and searched each hole and corner of the dwelling when we hear of churches being surrounded during divine service by troops while the press gang stood ready at the door to seize men as they came out from attending public worship and take these instances as merely types of what was constantly going on in different forms we do not wonder at Lord Mayors and other civic authorities in large towns complaining that a stop was put to business by the danger which the tradesmen and their servants incurred in leaving their houses and going into the streets infested by press gangs Whether it was that living in closer neighbourhood to the metropolis the centre of politics and news inspired the inhabitants of the southern counties with a strong feeling of that kind of patriotism which consists in hating all other nations or whether it was that the chances of capture were so much greater at all the southern ports that the merchant sailors became inured to the danger or whether it was that serving in the navy to those familiar with such towns as Portsmouth and Plymouth had an attraction to most men from the dash and brilliancy of the adventurous employment it is certain that the southerners took the oppression of press warrants more submissively than the wild north eastern people For with them the chances of profit beyond their wages in the whaling or Greenland trade extended to the lowest description of sailor He might rise by daring and saving to be a ship owner himself Numbers around him had done so and this very fact made the distinction between class and class less apparent and the common ventures and dangers the universal interest felt in one pursuit bound the inhabitants of that line of coast together with a strong tie the severance of which by any violent extraneous measure gave rise to passionate anger and thirst for vengeance A Yorkshireman once said to me My county folk are all alike Their first thought is how to resist Why I myself if I hear a man say it is a fine day catch myself trying to find out that it is no such thing It is so in thought it is so in word it is so in deed So you may imagine the press gang had no easy time of it on the Yorkshire coast In other places they inspired fear but here rage and hatred The Lord Mayor of York was warned on twentieth January seventeen seventy seven by an anonymous letter that if those men were not sent from the city on or before the following Tuesday his lordship s own dwelling and the Mansion house also should be burned to the ground Perhaps something of the ill feeling that prevailed on the subject was owing to the fact which I have noticed in other places similarly situated Where the landed possessions of gentlemen of ancient family but limited income surround a centre of any kind of profitable trade or manufacture there is a sort of latent ill will on the part of the squires to the tradesman be he manufacturer merchant or ship owner in whose hands is held a power of money making which no hereditary pride or gentlemanly love of doing nothing prevents him from using This ill will to be sure is mostly of a negative kind its most common form of manifestation is in absence of speech or action a sort of torpid and genteel ignoring all unpleasant neighbours but really the whale fisheries of Monkshaven had become so impertinently and obtrusively prosperous of late years at the time of which I write the Monkshaven ship owners were growing so wealthy and consequential that the squires who lived at home at ease in the old stone manor houses scattered up and down the surrounding moorland felt that the check upon the Monkshaven trade likely to be inflicted by the press gang was wisely ordained by the higher powers how high they placed these powers I will not venture to say to prevent overhaste in getting rich which was a scriptural fault and they also thought that they were only doing their duty in backing up the Admiralty warrants by all the civil power at their disposal whenever they were called upon and whenever they could do so without taking too much trouble in affairs which did not after all much concern themselves There was just another motive in the minds of some provident parents of many daughters The captains and lieutenants employed on this service were mostly agreeable bachelors brought up to a genteel profession at the least they were very pleasant visitors when they had a day to spare who knew what might come of it Indeed these brave officers were not unpopular in Monkshaven itself except at the time when they were brought into actual collision with the people They had the frank manners of their profession they were known to have served in those engagements the very narrative of which at this day will warm the heart of a Quaker and they themselves did not come prominently forward in the dirty work which nevertheless was permitted and quietly sanctioned by them So while few Monkshaven people passed the low public house over which the navy blue flag streamed as a sign that it was the rendezvous of the press gang without spitting towards it in sign of abhorrence yet perhaps the very same persons would give some rough token of respect to Lieutenant Atkinson if they met him in High Street Touching their hats was an unknown gesture in those parts but they would move their heads in a droll familiar kind of way neither a wag nor a nod but meant all the same to imply friendly regard The ship owners too invited him to an occasional dinner or supper all the time looking forward to the chances of his turning out an active enemy and not by any means inclined to give him the run of the house however many unmarried daughters might grace their table Still as he could tell a rattling story drink hard and was seldom too busy to come at a short notice he got on better than any one could have expected with the Monkshaven folk And the principal share of the odium of his business fell on his subordinates who were one and all regarded in the light of mean kidnappers and spies varmint as the common people esteemed them and as such they were ready at the first provocation to hunt and to worry them and little cared the press gang for this Whatever else they were they were brave and daring They had law to back them therefore their business was lawful They were serving their king and country They were using all their faculties and that is always pleasant There was plenty of scope for the glory and triumph of outwitting plenty of adventure in their life It was a lawful and loyal employment requiring sense readiness courage and besides it called out that strange love of the chase inherent in every man Fourteen or fifteen miles at sea lay the Aurora good man of war and to her were conveyed the living cargoes of several tenders which were stationed at likely places along the sea coast One the Lively Lady might be seen from the cliffs above Monkshaven not so far away but hidden by the angle of the high lands from the constant sight of the townspeople and there was always the Randyvow house as the public house with the navy blue flag was called thereabouts for the crew of the Lively Lady to lounge about and there to offer drink to unwary passers by At present this was all that the press gang had done at Monkshaven CHAPTER II HOME FROM GREENLAND One hot day early in October of the year seventeen ninety six two girls set off from their country homes to Monkshaven to sell their butter and eggs for they were both farmers daughters though rather in different circumstances for Molly Corney was one of a large family of children and had to rough it accordingly Sylvia Robson was an only child and was much made of in more people s estimation than Mary s by her elderly parents They had each purchases to make after their sales were effected as sales of butter and eggs were effected in those days by the market women sitting on the steps of the great old mutilated cross till a certain hour in the afternoon after which if all their goods were not disposed of they took them unwillingly to the shops and sold them at a lower price But good housewives did not despise coming themselves to the Butter Cross and smelling and depreciating the articles they wanted kept up a perpetual struggle of words trying often in vain to beat down prices A housekeeper of the last century would have thought that she did not know her business if she had not gone through this preliminary process and the farmers wives and daughters treated it all as a matter of course replying with a good deal of independent humour to the customer who once having discovered where good butter and fresh eggs were to be sold came time after time to depreciate the articles she always ended in taking There was leisure for all this kind of work in those days Molly had tied a knot on her pink spotted handkerchief for each of the various purchases she had to make dull but important articles needed for the week s consumption at home if she forgot any one of them she knew she was sure of a good rating from her mother The number of them made her pocket handkerchief look like one of the nine tails of a cat but not a single thing was for herself nor indeed for any one individual of her numerous family There was neither much thought nor much money to spend for any but collective wants in the Corney family It was different with Sylvia She was going to choose her first cloak not to have an old one of her mother s that had gone down through two sisters dyed for the fourth time and Molly would have been glad had even this chance been hers but to buy a bran new duffle cloak all for herself with not even an elder authority to curb her as to price only Molly to give her admiring counsel and as much sympathy as was consistent with a little patient envy of Sylvia s happier circumstances Every now and then they wandered off from the one grand subject of thought but Sylvia with unconscious art soon brought the conversation round to the fresh consideration of the respective merits of gray and scarlet These girls were walking bare foot and carrying their shoes and stockings in their hands during the first part of their way but as they were drawing near Monkshaven they stopped and turned aside along a foot path that led from the main road down to the banks of the Dee There were great stones in the river about here round which the waters gathered and eddied and formed deep pools Molly sate down on the grassy bank to wash her feet but Sylvia more active or perhaps lighter hearted with the notion of the cloak in the distance placed her basket on a gravelly bit of shore and giving a long spring seated herself on a stone almost in the middle of the stream Then she began dipping her little rosy toes in the cool rushing water and whisking them out with childish glee Be quiet wi the Sylvia Thou saint splashing me all ower and my feyther ll noane be so keen o giving me a new cloak as thine is seemingly Sylvia was quiet not to say penitent in a moment She drew up her feet instantly and as if to take herself out of temptation she turned away from Molly to that side of her stony seat on which the current ran shallow and broken by pebbles But once disturbed in her play her thoughts reverted to the great subject of the cloak She was now as still as a minute before she had been full of frolic and gambolling life She had tucked herself up on the stone as if it had been a cushion and she a little sultana Molly was deliberately washing her feet and drawing on her stockings when she heard a sudden sigh and her companion turned round so as to face her and said I wish mother hadn t spoken up for t gray Why Sylvia thou wert saying as we topped t brow as she did nought but bid thee think twice afore settling on scarlet Ay but mother s words are scarce and weigh heavy Feyther s liker me and we talk a deal o rubble but mother s words are liker to hewn stone She puts a deal o meaning in em And then said Sylvia as if she was put out by the suggestion she bid me ask cousin Philip for his opinion I hate a man as has getten an opinion on such like things Well we shall niver get to Monkshaven this day either for to sell our eggs and stuff or to buy thy cloak if we re sittin here much longer T sun s for slanting low so come along lass and let s be going But if I put on my stockings and shoon here and jump back into yon wet gravel I se not be fit to be seen said Sylvia in a pathetic tone of bewilderment that was funnily childlike She stood up her bare feet curved round the curving surface of the stone her slight figure balancing as if in act to spring Thou knows thou ll have just to jump back barefoot and wash thy feet afresh without making all that ado thou shouldst ha done it at first like me and all other sensible folk But thou saint getten no gumption Molly s mouth was stopped by Sylvia s hand She was already on the river bank by her friend s side Now dunnot lecture me I m none for a sermon hung on every peg o words I m going to have a new cloak lass and I cannot heed thee if thou dost lecture Thou shall have all the gumption and I ll have my cloak It may be doubted whether Molly thought this an equal division Each girl wore tightly fitting stockings knit by her own hands of the blue worsted common in that country they had on neat high heeled black leather shoes coming well over the instep and fastened as well as ornamented with bright steel buckles They did not walk so lightly and freely now as they did before they were shod but their steps were still springy with the buoyancy of early youth for neither of them was twenty indeed I believe Sylvia was not more than seventeen at this time They clambered up the steep grassy path with brambles catching at their kilted petticoats through the copse wood till they regained the high road and then they settled themselves as they called it that is to say they took off their black felt hats and tied up their clustering hair afresh they shook off every speck of wayside dust straightened the little shawls or large neck kerchiefs call them which you will that were spread over their shoulders pinned below the throat and confined at the waist by their apron strings and then putting on their hats again and picking up their baskets they prepared to walk decorously into the town of Monkshaven The next turn of the road showed them the red peaked roofs of the closely packed houses lying almost directly below the hill on which they were The full autumn sun brought out the ruddy colour of the tiled gables and deepened the shadows in the narrow streets The narrow harbour at the mouth of the river was crowded with small vessels of all descriptions making an intricate forest of masts Beyond lay the sea like a flat pavement of sapphire scarcely a ripple varying its sunny surface that stretched out leagues away till it blended with the softened azure of the sky On this blue trackless water floated scores of white sailed fishing boats apparently motionless unless you measured their progress by some land mark but still and silent and distant as they seemed the consciousness that there were men on board each going forth into the great deep added unspeakably to the interest felt in watching them Close to the bar of the river Dee a larger vessel lay to Sylvia who had only recently come into the neighbourhood looked at this with the same quiet interest as she did at all the others but Molly as soon as her eye caught the build of it cried out aloud She s a whaler she s a whaler home from t Greenland seas T first this season God bless her and she turned round and shook both Sylvia s hands in the fulness of her excitement Sylvia s colour rose and her eyes sparkled out of sympathy Is ta sure she asked breathless in her turn for though she did not know by the aspect of the different ships on what trade they were bound yet she was well aware of the paramount interest attached to whaling vessels Three o clock and it s not high water till five said Molly If we re sharp we can sell our eggs and be down to the staithes before she comes into port Be sharp lass And down the steep long hill they went at a pace that was almost a run A run they dared not make it and as it was the rate at which they walked would have caused destruction among eggs less carefully packed When the descent was ended there was yet the long narrow street before them bending and swerving from the straight line as it followed the course of the river The girls felt as if they should never come to the market place which was situated at the crossing of Bridge Street and High Street There the old stone cross was raised by the monks long ago now worn and mutilated no one esteemed it as a holy symbol but only as the Butter Cross where market women clustered on Wednesday and whence the town crier made all his proclamations of household sales things lost or found beginning with Oh yes oh yes oh yes and ending with God bless the king and the lord of this manor and a very brisk Amen before he went on his way and took off the livery coat the colours of which marked him as a servant of the Burnabys the family who held manorial rights over Monkshaven Of course the much frequented space surrounding the Butter Cross was the favourite centre for shops and on this day a fine market day just when good housewives begin to look over their winter store of blankets and flannels and discover their needs betimes these shops ought to have had plenty of customers But they were empty and of even quieter aspect than their every day wont The three legged creepie stools that were hired out at a penny an hour to such market women as came too late to find room on the steps were unoccupied knocked over here and there as if people had passed by in haste Molly took in all at a glance and interpreted the signs though she had no time to explain their meaning and her consequent course of action to Sylvia but darted into a corner shop T whalers is coming home There s one lying outside t bar This was put in the form of an assertion but the tone was that of eager cross questioning Ay said a lame man mending fishing nets behind a rough deal counter She s come back airly and she s brought good news o t others as I ve heered say Time was I should ha been on th staithes throwing up my cap wit t best on em but now it pleases t Lord to keep me at home and set me to mind other folks gear See thee wench there s a vast o folk ha left their skeps o things wi me while they re away down to t quay side Leave me your eggs and be off wi ye for t see t fun for mebbe ye ll live to be palsied yet and then ye ll be fretting ower spilt milk and that ye didn t tak all chances when ye was young Ay well they re out o hearin o my moralities I d better find a lamiter like mysen to preach to for it s not iverybody has t luck t clargy has of saying their say out whether folks likes it or not He put the baskets carefully away with much of such talk as this addressed to himself while he did so Then he sighed once or twice and then he took the better course and began to sing over his tarry work Molly and Sylvia were far along the staithes by the time he got to this point of cheerfulness They ran on regardless of stitches and pains in the side on along the river bank to where the concourse of people was gathered There was no great length of way between the Butter Cross and the harbour in five minutes the breathless girls were close together in the best place they could get for seeing on the outside of the crowd and in as short a time longer they were pressed inwards by fresh arrivals into the very midst of the throng All eyes were directed to the ship beating her anchor just outside the bar not a quarter of a mile away The custom house officer was just gone aboard of her to receive the captain s report of his cargo and make due examination The men who had taken him out in his boat were rowing back to the shore and brought small fragments of news when they landed a little distance from the crowd which moved as one man to hear what was to be told Sylvia took a hard grasp of the hand of the older and more experienced Molly and listened open mouthed to the answers she was extracting from a gruff old sailor she happened to find near her What ship is she T Resolution of Monkshaven said he indignantly as if any goose might have known that An a good Resolution and a blessed ship she s been to me piped out an old woman close at Mary s elbow She s brought me home my ae lad for he shouted to yon boatman to bid him tell me he was well Tell Peggy Christison says he my name is Margaret Christison tell Peggy Christison as her son Hezekiah is come back safe and sound The Lord s name be praised An me a widow as never thought to see my lad again It seemed as if everybody relied on every one else s sympathy in that hour of great joy I ax pardon but if you d gie me just a bit of elbow room for a minute like I d hold my babby up so that he might see daddy s ship and happen my master might see him He s four months old last Tuesday se nnight and his feyther s never clapt eyne on him yet and he wi a tooth through an another just breaking bless him One or two of the better end of the Monkshaven inhabitants stood a little before Molly and Sylvia and as they moved in compliance with the young mother s request they overheard some of the information these ship owners had received from the boatman Haynes says they ll send the manifest of the cargo ashore in twenty minutes as soon as Fishburn has looked over the casks Only eight whales according to what he says No one can tell said the other till the manifest comes to hand I m afraid he s right But he brings a good report of the Good Fortune She s off saint Abb s Head with something like fifteen whales to her share We shall see how much is true when she comes in That ll be by the afternoon tide to morrow That s my cousin s ship said Molly to Sylvia He s specksioneer on board the Good Fortune An old man touched her as she spoke I humbly make my manners missus but I m stone blind my lad s aboard yon vessel outside t bar and my old woman is bed fast Will she be long think ye in making t harbour Because if so be as she were I d just make my way back and speak a word or two to my missus who ll be boiling o er into some mak o mischief now she knows he s so near May I be so bold as to ax if t Crooked Negro is covered yet Molly stood on tip toe to try and see the black stone thus named but Sylvia stooping and peeping through the glimpses afforded between the arms of the moving people saw it first and told the blind old man it was still above water A watched pot said he ne er boils I reckon It s ta en a vast o watter t cover that stone to day Anyhow I ll have time to go home and rate my missus for worritin hersen as I ll be bound she s done for all as I bade her not but to keep easy and content We d better be off too said Molly as an opening was made through the press to let out the groping old man Eggs and butter is yet to sell and tha cloak to be bought Well I suppose we had said Sylvia rather regretfully for though all the way into Monkshaven her head had been full of the purchase of this cloak yet she was of that impressible nature that takes the tone of feeling from those surrounding and though she knew no one on board the Resolution she was just as anxious for the moment to see her come into harbour as any one in the crowd who had a dear relation on board So she turned reluctantly to follow the more prudent Molly along the quay back to the Butter Cross It was a pretty scene though it was too familiar to the eyes of all who then saw it for them to notice its beauty The sun was low enough in the west to turn the mist that filled the distant valley of the river into golden haze Above on either bank of the Dee there lay the moorland heights swelling one behind the other the nearer russet brown with the tints of the fading bracken the more distant gray and dim against the rich autumnal sky The red and fluted tiles of the gabled houses rose in crowded irregularity on one side of the river while the newer suburb was built in more orderly and less picturesque fashion on the opposite cliff The river itself was swelling and chafing with the incoming tide till its vexed waters rushed over the very feet of the watching crowd on the staithes as the great sea waves encroached more and more every minute The quay side was unsavourily ornamented with glittering fish scales for the hauls of fish were cleansed in the open air and no sanitary arrangements existed for sweeping away any of the relics of this operation The fresh salt breeze was bringing up the lashing leaping tide from the blue sea beyond the bar Behind the returning girls there rocked the white sailed ship as if she were all alive with eagerness for her anchors to be heaved How impatient her crew of beating hearts were for that moment how those on land sickened at the suspense may be imagined when you remember that for six long summer months those sailors had been as if dead from all news of those they loved shut up in terrible dreary Arctic seas from the hungry sight of sweethearts and friends wives and mothers No one knew what might have happened The crowd on shore grew silent and solemn before the dread of the possible news of death that might toll in upon their hearts with this uprushing tide The whalers went out into the Greenland seas full of strong hopeful men but the whalers never returned as they sailed forth On land there are deaths among two or three hundred men to be mourned over in every half year s space of time Whose bones had been left to blacken on the gray and terrible icebergs Who lay still until the sea should give up its dead Who were those who should come back to Monkshaven never no never more Many a heart swelled with passionate unspoken fear as the first whaler lay off the bar on her return voyage Molly and Sylvia had left the crowd in this hushed suspense But fifty yards along the staithe they passed five or six girls with flushed faces and careless attire who had mounted a pile of timber placed there to season for ship building from which as from the steps of a ladder or staircase they could command the harbour They were wild and free in their gestures and held each other by the hand and swayed from side to side stamping their feet in time as they sang Weel may the keel row the keel row the keel row Weel may the keel row that my laddie s in What for are ye going off now they called out to our two girls She ll be in in ten minutes and without waiting for the answer which never came they resumed their song Old sailors stood about in little groups too proud to show their interest in the adventures they could no longer share but quite unable to keep up any semblance of talk on indifferent subjects The town seemed very quiet and deserted as Molly and Sylvia entered the dark irregular Bridge Street and the market place was as empty of people as before But the skeps and baskets and three legged stools were all cleared away Market s over for to day said Molly Corney in disappointed surprise We mun make the best on t and sell to t huxters and a hard bargain they ll be for driving I doubt mother ll be vexed She and Sylvia went to the corner shop to reclaim their baskets The man had his joke at them for their delay Ay ay lasses as has sweethearts a coming home don t care much what price they get for butter and eggs I dare say now there s some un in yon ship that ud give as much as a shilling a pound for this butter if he only knowed who churned it This was to Sylvia as he handed her back her property The fancy free Sylvia reddened pouted tossed back her head and hardly deigned a farewell word of thanks or civility to the lame man she was at an age to be affronted by any jokes on such a subject Molly took the joke without disclaimer and without offence She rather liked the unfounded idea of her having a sweetheart and was rather surprised to think how devoid of foundation the notion was If she could have a new cloak as Sylvia was going to have then indeed there might be a chance Until some such good luck it was as well to laugh and blush as if the surmise of her having a lover was not very far from the truth and so she replied in something of the same strain as the lame net maker to his joke about the butter He ll need it all and more too to grease his tongue if iver he reckons to win me for his wife When they were out of the shop Sylvia said in a coaxing tone Molly who is it Whose tongue ll need greasing Just tell me and I ll never tell She was so much in earnest that Molly was perplexed She did not quite like saying that she had alluded to no one in particular only to a possible sweetheart so she began to think what young man had made the most civil speeches to her in her life the list was not a long one to go over for her father was not so well off as to make her sought after for her money and her face was rather of the homeliest But she suddenly remembered her cousin the specksioneer who had given her two large shells and taken a kiss from her half willing lips before he went to sea the last time So she smiled a little and then said Well I dunno It s ill talking o these things afore one has made up one s mind And perhaps if Charley Kinraid behaves hissen I might be brought to listen Charley Kinraid who s he Yon specksioneer cousin o mine as I was talking on And do yo think he cares for yo asked Sylvia in a low tender tone as if touching on a great mystery Molly only said Be quiet wi yo and Sylvia could not make out whether she cut the conversation so short because she was offended or because they had come to the shop where they had to sell their butter and eggs Now Sylvia if thou ll leave me thy basket I ll make as good a bargain as iver I can on em and thou can be off to choose this grand new cloak as is to be afore it gets any darker Where is ta going to Mother said I d better go to Foster s answered Sylvia with a shade of annoyance in her face Feyther said just anywhere Foster s is t best place thou canst try anywhere afterwards I ll be at Foster s in five minutes for I reckon we mun hasten a bit now It ll be near five o clock Sylvia hung her head and looked very demure as she walked off by herself to Foster s shop in the market place CHAPTER III BUYING A NEW CLOAK Foster s shop was the shop of Monkshaven It was kept by two Quaker brothers who were now old men and their father had kept it before them probably his father before that People remembered it as an old fashioned dwelling house with a sort of supplementary shop with unglazed windows projecting from the lower story These openings had long been filled with panes of glass that at the present day would be accounted very small but which seventy years ago were much admired for their size I can best make you understand the appearance of the place by bidding you think of the long openings in a butcher s shop and then to fill them up in your imagination with panes about eight inches by six in a heavy wooden frame There was one of these windows on each side the door place which was kept partially closed through the day by a low gate about a yard high Half the shop was appropriated to grocery the other half to drapery and a little mercery The good old brothers gave all their known customers a kindly welcome shaking hands with many of them and asking all after their families and domestic circumstances before proceeding to business They would not for the world have had any sign of festivity at Christmas and scrupulously kept their shop open at that holy festival ready themselves to serve sooner than tax the consciences of any of their assistants only nobody ever came But on New Year s Day they had a great cake and wine ready in the parlour behind the shop of which all who came in to buy anything were asked to partake Yet though scrupulous in most things it did not go against the consciences of these good brothers to purchase smuggled articles There was a back way from the river side up a covered entry to the yard door of the Fosters and a peculiar kind of knock at this door always brought out either John or Jeremiah or if not them their shopman Philip Hepburn and the same cake and wine that the excise officer s wife might just have been tasting was brought out in the back parlour to treat the smuggler There was a little locking of doors and drawing of the green silk curtain that was supposed to shut out the shop but really all this was done very much for form s sake Everybody in Monkshaven smuggled who could and every one wore smuggled goods who could and great reliance was placed on the excise officer s neighbourly feelings The story went that John and Jeremiah Foster were so rich that they could buy up all the new town across the bridge They had certainly begun to have a kind of primitive bank in connection with their shop receiving and taking care of such money as people did not wish to retain in their houses for fear of burglars No one asked them for interest on the money thus deposited nor did they give any but on the other hand if any of their customers on whose character they could depend wanted a little advance the Fosters after due inquiries made and in some cases due security given were not unwilling to lend a moderate sum without charging a penny for the use of their money All the articles they sold were as good as they knew how to choose and for them they expected and obtained ready money It was said that they only kept on the shop for their amusement Others averred that there was some plan of a marriage running in the brothers heads a marriage between William Coulson mister Jeremiah s wife s nephew mister Jeremiah was a widower and Hester Rose whose mother was some kind of distant relation and who served in the shop along with William Coulson and Philip Hepburn Again this was denied by those who averred that Coulson was no blood relation and that if the Fosters had intended to do anything considerable for Hester they would never have allowed her and her mother to live in such a sparing way ekeing out their small income by having Coulson and Hepburn for lodgers No John and Jeremiah would leave all their money to some hospital or to some charitable institution But of course there was a reply to this when are there not many sides to an argument about a possibility concerning which no facts are known Part of the reply turned on this the old gentlemen had probably some deep plan in their heads in permitting their cousin to take Coulson and Hepburn as lodgers the one a kind of nephew the other though so young the head man in the shop if either of them took a fancy to Hester how agreeably matters could be arranged All this time Hester is patiently waiting to serve Sylvia who is standing before her a little shy a little perplexed and distracted by the sight of so many pretty things Hester was a tall young woman sparely yet largely formed of a grave aspect which made her look older than she really was Her thick brown hair was smoothly taken off her broad forehead and put in a very orderly fashion under her linen cap her face was a little square and her complexion sallow though the texture of her skin was fine Her gray eyes were very pleasant because they looked at you so honestly and kindly her mouth was slightly compressed as most have it who are in the habit of restraining their feelings but when she spoke you did not perceive this and her rare smile slowly breaking forth showed her white even teeth and when accompanied as it generally was by a sudden uplifting of her soft eyes it made her countenance very winning She was dressed in stuff of sober colours both in accordance with her own taste and in unasked compliance with the religious customs of the Fosters but Hester herself was not a Friend Sylvia standing opposite not looking at Hester but gazing at the ribbons in the shop window as if hardly conscious that any one awaited the expression of her wishes was a great contrast ready to smile or to pout or to show her feelings in any way with a character as undeveloped as a child s affectionate wilful naughty tiresome charming anything in fact at present that the chances of an hour called out Hester thought her customer the prettiest creature ever seen in the moment she had for admiration before Sylvia turned round and recalled to herself began Oh I beg your pardon miss I was thinking what may the price of yon crimson ribbon be

none	none	but went to examine the shop mark Oh I did not mean that I wanted any I only want some stuff for a cloak Thank you miss but I am very sorry some duffle please Hester silently replaced the ribbon and went in search of the duffle While she was gone Sylvia was addressed by the very person she most wished to avoid and whose absence she had rejoiced over on first entering the shop her cousin Philip Hepburn He was a serious looking young man tall but with a slight stoop in his shoulders brought on by his occupation He had thick hair standing off from his forehead in a peculiar but not unpleasing manner a long face with a slightly aquiline nose dark eyes and a long upper lip which gave a disagreeable aspect to a face that might otherwise have been good looking Good day
5339_14134_000092_000000	train-clean-100	 Sylvie 
5339_14134_000092_000004	train-clean-100	 Sylvie 
none	none	he said what are you wanting How are all at home Let me help you Sylvia pursed up her red lips and did not look at him as she replied I m very well and so is mother feyther s got a touch of rheumatiz and there s a young woman getting what I want She turned a little away from him when she had ended this sentence as if it had comprised all she could possibly have to say to him But he exclaimed You won t know how to choose and seating himself on the counter he swung himself over after the fashion of shop men Sylvia took no notice of him but pretended to be counting over her money What do you want Sylvie asked he at last annoyed at her silence I don t like to be called Sylvie my name is Sylvia and I m wanting duffle for a cloak if you must know Hester now returned with a shop boy helping her to drag along the great rolls of scarlet and gray cloth Not that said Philip kicking the red duffle with his foot and speaking to the lad It s the gray you want is it not Sylvie He used the name he had had the cousin s right to call her by since her childhood without remembering her words on the subject not five minutes before but she did and was vexed Please miss it is the scarlet duffle I want don t let him take it away Hester looked up at both their countenances a little wondering what was their position with regard to each other for this then was the beautiful little cousin about whom Philip had talked to her mother as sadly spoilt and shamefully ignorant a lovely little dunce and so forth Hester had pictured Sylvia Robson somehow as very different from what she was younger more stupid not half so bright and charming for though she was now both pouting and cross it was evident that this was not her accustomed mood Sylvia devoted her attention to the red cloth pushing aside the gray Philip Hepburn was vexed at his advice being slighted and yet he urged it afresh This is a respectable quiet looking article that will go well with any colour you niver will be so foolish as to take what will mark with every drop of rain I m sorry you sell such good for nothing things replied Sylvia conscious of her advantage and relaxing a little as little as she possibly could of her gravity Hester came in now He means to say that this cloth will lose its first brightness in wet or damp but it will always be a good article and the colour will stand a deal of wear mister Foster would not have had it in his shop else Philip did not like that even a reasonable peace making interpreter should come between him and Sylvia so he held his tongue in indignant silence Hester went on To be sure this gray is the closer make and would wear the longest I don t care said Sylvia still rejecting the dull gray I like this best Eight yards if you please miss A cloak takes nine yards at least said Philip decisively Mother told me eight said Sylvia secretly conscious that her mother would have preferred the more sober colour and feeling that as she had had her own way in that respect she was bound to keep to the directions she had received as to the quantity But indeed she would not have yielded to Philip in anything that she could help There was a sound of children s feet running up the street from the river side shouting with excitement At the noise Sylvia forgot her cloak and her little spirit of vexation and ran to the half door of the shop Philip followed because she went Hester looked on with passive kindly interest as soon as she had completed her duty of measuring One of those girls whom Sylvia had seen as she and Molly left the crowd on the quay came quickly up the street Her face which was handsome enough as to feature was whitened with excess of passionate emotion her dress untidy and flying her movements heavy and free She belonged to the lowest class of seaport inhabitants As she came near Sylvia saw that the tears were streaming down her cheeks quite unconsciously to herself She recognized Sylvia s face full of interest as it was and stopped her clumsy run to speak to the pretty sympathetic creature She s o er t bar She s o er t bar I m boun to tell mother She caught at Sylvia s hand and shook it and went on breathless and gasping Sylvia how came you to know that girl asked Philip sternly She s not one for you to be shaking hands with She s known all down t quay side as Newcastle Bess I can t help it said Sylvia half inclined to cry at his manner even more than his words When folk are glad I can t help being glad too and I just put out my hand and she put out hers To think o yon ship come in at last And if yo d been down seeing all t folk looking and looking their eyes out as if they feared they should die afore she came in and brought home the lads they loved yo d ha shaken hands wi that lass too and no great harm done I never set eyne upon her till half an hour ago on th staithes and maybe I ll niver see her again Hester was still behind the counter but had moved so as to be near the window so she heard what they were saying and now put in her word She can t be altogether bad for she thought o telling her mother first thing according to what she said Sylvia gave Hester a quick grateful look But Hester had resumed her gaze out of the window and did not see the glance And now Molly Corney joined them hastily bursting into the shop Hech said she Hearken how they re crying and shouting down on t quay T gang s among em like t day of judgment Hark No one spoke no one breathed I had almost said no heart beat for listening Not long in an instant there rose the sharp simultaneous cry of many people in rage and despair Inarticulate at that distance it was yet an intelligible curse and the roll and the roar and the irregular tramp came nearer and nearer They re taking em to t Randyvowse said Molly Eh I wish I d King George here just to tell him my mind The girl clenched her hands and set her teeth It s terrible hard said Hester there s mothers and wives looking out for em as if they were stars dropt out o t lift But can we do nothing for em cried Sylvia Let us go into t thick of it and do a bit of help I can t stand quiet and see t Half crying she pushed forwards to the door but Philip held her back Sylvie you must not Don t be silly it s the law and no one can do aught against it least of all women and lasses By this time the vanguard of the crowd came pressing up Bridge Street past the windows of Foster s shop It consisted of wild half amphibious boys slowly moving backwards as they were compelled by the pressure of the coming multitude to go on and yet anxious to defy and annoy the gang by insults and curses half choked with their indignant passion doubling their fists in the very faces of the gang who came on with measured movement armed to the teeth their faces showing white with repressed and determined energy against the bronzed countenances of the half dozen sailors who were all they had thought it wise to pick out of the whaler s crew this being the first time an Admiralty warrant had been used in Monkshaven for many years not since the close of the American war in fact One of the men was addressing to his townspeople in a high pitched voice an exhortation which few could hear for pressing around this nucleus of cruel wrong were women crying aloud throwing up their arms in imprecation showering down abuse as hearty and rapid as if they had been a Greek chorus Their wild famished eyes were strained on faces they might not kiss their cheeks were flushed to purple with anger or else livid with impotent craving for revenge Some of them looked scarce human and yet an hour ago these lips now tightly drawn back so as to show the teeth with the unconscious action of an enraged wild animal had been soft and gracious with the smile of hope eyes that were fiery and bloodshot now had been loving and bright hearts never to recover from the sense of injustice and cruelty had been trustful and glad only one short hour ago There were men there too sullen and silent brooding on remedial revenge but not many the greater proportion of this class being away in the absent whalers The stormy multitude swelled into the market place and formed a solid crowd there while the press gang steadily forced their way on into High Street and on to the rendezvous A low deep growl went up from the dense mass as some had to wait for space to follow the others now and then going up as a lion s growl goes up into a shriek of rage A woman forced her way up from the bridge She lived some little way in the country and had been late in hearing of the return of the whaler after her six months absence and on rushing down to the quay side she had been told by a score of busy sympathizing voices that her husband was kidnapped for the service of the Government She had need pause in the market place the outlet of which was crammed up Then she gave tongue for the first time in such a fearful shriek you could hardly catch the words she said Jamie Jamie will they not let you to me Those were the last words Sylvia heard before her own hysterical burst of tears called every one s attention to her She had been very busy about household work in the morning and much agitated by all she had seen and heard since coming into Monkshaven and so it ended in this Molly and Hester took her through the shop into the parlour beyond John Foster s parlour for Jeremiah the elder brother lived in a house of his own on the other side of the water It was a low comfortable room with great beams running across the ceiling and papered with the same paper as the walls a piece of elegant luxury which took Molly s fancy mightily This parlour looked out on the dark courtyard in which there grew two or three poplars straining upwards to the light and through an open door between the backs of two houses could be seen a glimpse of the dancing heaving river with such ships or fishing cobles as happened to be moored in the waters above the bridge They placed Sylvia on the broad old fashioned sofa and gave her water to drink and tried to still her sobbing and choking They loosed her hat and copiously splashed her face and clustering chestnut hair till at length she came to herself restored but dripping wet She sate up and looked at them smoothing back her tangled curls off her brow as if to clear both her eyes and her intellect Where am I oh I know Thank you It was very silly but somehow it seemed so sad And here she was nearly going off again but Hester said Ay it were sad my poor lass if I may call you so for I don t rightly know your name but it s best not think on it for we can do no mak o good and it ll mebbe set you off again Yo re Philip Hepburn s cousin I reckon and yo bide at Haytersbank Farm Yes she s Sylvia Robson put in Molly not seeing that Hester s purpose was to make Sylvia speak and so to divert her attention from the subject which had set her off into hysterics And we came in for market continued Molly and for t buy t new cloak as her feyther s going to give her and for sure I thought we was i luck s way when we saw t first whaler and niver dreaming as t press gang ud be so marred She too began to cry but her little whimper was stopped by the sound of the opening door behind her It was Philip asking Hester by a silent gesture if he might come in Sylvia turned her face round from the light and shut her eyes Her cousin came close up to her on tip toe and looked anxiously at what he could see of her averted face then he passed his hand so slightly over her hair that he could scarcely be said to touch it and murmured Poor lassie it s a pity she came to day for it s a long walk in this heat But Sylvia started to her feet almost pushing him along Her quickened senses heard an approaching step through the courtyard before any of the others were aware of the sound In a minute afterwards the glass door at one corner of the parlour was opened from the outside and mister John stood looking in with some surprise at the group collected in his usually empty parlour It s my cousin said Philip reddening a little she came wi her friend in to market and to make purchases and she s got a turn wi seeing the press gang go past carrying some of the crew of the whaler to the Randyvowse Ay ay said mister John quickly passing on into the shop on tip toe as if he were afraid he were intruding in his own premises and beckoning Philip to follow him there Out of strife cometh strife I guessed something of the sort was up from what I heard on t bridge as I came across fra brother Jeremiah s Here he softly shut the door between the parlour and the shop It beareth hard on th expectant women and childer nor is it to be wondered at that they being unconverted rage together poor creatures like the very heathen Philip he said coming nearer to his head young man keep Nicholas and Henry at work in the ware room upstairs until this riot be over for it would grieve me if they were misled into violence Philip hesitated Speak out man Always ease an uneasy heart and never let it get hidebound I had thought to convoy my cousin and the other young woman home for the town is like to be rough and it s getting dark And thou shalt my lad said the good old man and I myself will try and restrain the natural inclinations of Nicholas and Henry But when he went to find the shop boys with a gentle homily on his lips those to whom it should have been addressed were absent In consequence of the riotous state of things all the other shops in the market place had put their shutters up and Nicholas and Henry in the absence of their superiors had followed the example of their neighbours and as business was over they had hardly waited to put the goods away but had hurried off to help their townsmen in any struggle that might ensue There was no remedy for it but mister John looked rather discomfited The state of the counters and of the disarranged goods was such also as would have irritated any man as orderly but less sweet tempered All he said on the subject was The old Adam the old Adam but he shook his head long after he had finished speaking Where is William Coulson he next asked Oh I remember He was not to come back from York till the night closed in Philip and his master arranged the shop in the exact order the old man loved Then he recollected the wish of his subordinate and turned round and said Now go with thy cousin and her friend Hester is here and old Hannah I myself will take Hester home if need be But for the present I think she had best tarry here as it isn t many steps to her mother s house and we may need her help if any of those poor creatures fall into suffering wi their violence With this mister John knocked at the door of the parlour and waited for permission to enter With old fashioned courtesy he told the two strangers how glad he was that his room had been of service to them that he would never have made so bold as to pass through it if he had been aware how it was occupied And then going to a corner cupboard high up in the wall he pulled a key out of his pocket and unlocked his little store of wine and cake and spirits and insisted that they should eat and drink while waiting for Philip who was taking some last measures for the security of the shop during the night Sylvia declined everything with less courtesy than she ought to have shown to the offers of the hospitable old man Molly took wine and cake leaving a good half of both according to the code of manners in that part of the country and also because Sylvia was continually urging her to make haste For the latter disliked the idea of her cousin s esteeming it necessary to accompany them home and wanted to escape from him by setting off before he returned But any such plans were frustrated by Philip s coming back into the parlour full of grave content which brimmed over from his eyes with the parcel of Sylvia s obnoxious red duffle under his arm anticipating so keenly the pleasure awaiting him in the walk that he was almost surprised by the gravity of his companions as they prepared for it Sylvia was a little penitent for her rejection of mister John s hospitality now she found out how unavailing for its purpose such rejection had been and tried to make up by a modest sweetness of farewell which quite won his heart and made him praise her up to Hester in a way to which she observant of all could not bring herself fully to respond What business had the pretty little creature to reject kindly meant hospitality in the pettish way she did thought Hester And oh what business had she to be so ungrateful and to try and thwart Philip in his thoughtful wish of escorting them through the streets of the rough riotous town What did it all mean CHAPTER IV PHILIP HEPBURN The coast on that part of the island to which this story refers is bordered by rocks and cliffs The inland country immediately adjacent to the coast is level flat and bleak it is only where the long stretch of dyke enclosed fields terminates abruptly in a sheer descent and the stranger sees the ocean creeping up the sands far below him that he is aware on how great an elevation he has been Here and there as I have said a cleft in the level land thus running out into the sea in steep promontories occurs what they would call a chine in the Isle of Wight but instead of the soft south wind stealing up the woody ravine as it does there the eastern breeze comes piping shrill and clear along these northern chasms keeping the trees that venture to grow on the sides down to the mere height of scrubby brushwood The descent to the shore through these bottoms is in most cases very abrupt too much so for a cartway or even a bridle path but people can pass up and down without difficulty by the help of a few rude steps hewn here and there out of the rock Sixty or seventy years ago not to speak of much later times the farmers who owned or hired the land which lay directly on the summit of these cliffs were smugglers to the extent of their power only partially checked by the coast guard distributed at pretty nearly equal interspaces of eight miles all along the north eastern seaboard Still sea wrack was a good manure and there was no law against carrying it up in great osier baskets for the purpose of tillage and many a secret thing was lodged in hidden crevices in the rocks till the farmer sent trusty people down to the shore for a good supply of sand and seaweed for his land One of the farms on the cliff had lately been taken by Sylvia s father He was a man who had roamed about a good deal been sailor smuggler horse dealer and farmer in turns a sort of fellow possessed by a spirit of adventure and love of change which did him and his own family more harm than anybody else He was just the kind of man that all his neighbours found fault with and all his neighbours liked Late in life for such an imprudent man as he was one of a class who generally wed trusting to chance and luck for the provision for a family farmer Robson married a woman whose only want of practical wisdom consisted in taking him for a husband She was Philip Hepburn s aunt and had had the charge of him until she married from her widowed brother s house He it was who had let her know when Haytersbank Farm had been to let esteeming it a likely piece of land for his uncle to settle down upon after a somewhat unprosperous career of horse dealing The farmhouse lay in the shelter of a very slight green hollow scarcely scooped out of the pasture field by which it was surrounded the short crisp turf came creeping up to the very door and windows without any attempt at a yard or garden or any nearer enclosure of the buildings than the stone dyke that formed the boundary of the field itself The buildings were long and low in order to avoid the rough violence of the winds that swept over that wild bleak spot both in winter and summer It was well for the inhabitants of that house that coal was extremely cheap otherwise a southerner might have imagined that they could never have survived the cutting of the bitter gales that piped all round and seemed to seek out every crevice for admission into the house But the interior was warm enough when once you had mounted the long bleak lane full of round rough stones enough to lame any horse unaccustomed to such roads and had crossed the field by the little dry hard footpath which tacked about so as to keep from directly facing the prevailing wind missus Robson was a Cumberland woman and as such was a cleaner housewife than the farmers wives of that north eastern coast and was often shocked at their ways showing it more by her looks than by her words for she was not a great talker This fastidiousness in such matters made her own house extremely comfortable but did not tend to render her popular among her neighbours Indeed Bell Robson piqued herself on her housekeeping generally and once in doors in the gray bare stone house there were plenty of comforts to be had besides cleanliness and warmth The great rack of clap bread hung overhead and Bell Robson s preference of this kind of oat cake over the leavened and partly sour kind used in Yorkshire was another source of her unpopularity Flitches of bacon and hands i e shoulders of cured pork the legs or hams being sold as fetching a better price abounded and for any visitor who could stay neither cream nor finest wheaten flour was wanting for turf cakes and singing hinnies with which it is the delight of the northern housewives to regale the honoured guest as he sips their high priced tea sweetened with dainty sugar This night farmer Robson was fidgeting in and out of his house door climbing the little eminence in the field and coming down disappointed in a state of fretful impatience His quiet taciturn wife was a little put out by Sylvia s non appearance too but she showed her anxiety by being shorter than usual in her replies to his perpetual wonders as to where the lass could have been tarrying and by knitting away with extra diligence I ve a vast o mind to go down to Monkshaven mysen and see after t child It s well on for seven No Dannel said his wife thou d best not Thy leg has been paining thee this week past and thou rt not up to such a walk I ll rouse Kester and send him off if thou think saint there s need on it A ll noan ha Kester roused Who s to go afield betimes after t sheep in t morn if he s ca ed up to neet He d miss t lass and find a public house a reckon said Daniel

an eye to th milk and see as it does na boil o er for she canna stomach it if it s bishopped e er so little Before missus Robson however had put away her knitting voices were heard at a good distance down the lane but coming nearer every moment and once more Daniel climbed the little brow to look and to listen It s a reet said he hobbling quickly down Niver fidget theesel wi gettin ready to go search for her I ll tak thee a bet it s Philip Hepburn s voice convoying her home just as I said he would an hour sin Bell did not answer as she might have done that this probability of Philip s bringing Sylvia home had been her own suggestion set aside by her husband as utterly unlikely Another minute and the countenances of both parents imperceptibly and unconsciously relaxed into pleasure as Sylvia came in She looked very rosy from the walk and the October air which began to be frosty in the evenings there was a little cloud over her face at first but it was quickly dispersed as she met the loving eyes of home Philip who followed her had an excited but not altogether pleased look about him He received a hearty greeting from Daniel and a quiet one from his aunt Tak off thy pan o milk missus and set on t kettle Milk may do for wenches but Philip and me is for a drop o good Hollands and watter this cold night I m a most chilled to t marrow wi looking out for thee lass for t mother was in a peck o troubles about thy none coining home i t dayleet and I d to keep hearkening out on t browhead This was entirely untrue and Bell knew it to be so but her husband did not He had persuaded himself now as he had done often before that what he had in reality done for his own pleasure or satisfaction he had done in order to gratify some one else The town was rough with a riot between the press gang and the whaling folk and I thought I d best see Sylvia home Ay ay lad always welcome if it s only as an excuse for t liquor But t whalers say saint ta Why is t whalers in There was none i sight yesterday when I were down on t shore It s early days for em as yet And t cursed old press gang s agate again doing its devil s work His face changed as he ended his speech and showed a steady passion of old hatred Ay missus yo may look I wunnot pick and choose my words noather for yo nor for nobody when I speak o that daumed gang I m none ashamed o my words They re true and I m ready to prove em Where s my forefinger Ay and as good a top joint of a thumb as iver a man had I wish I d kept em i sperits as they done things at t potticary s just to show t lass what flesh and bone I made away wi to get free I ups wi a hatchet when I saw as I were fast a board a man o war standing out for sea it were in t time o the war wi Amerikay an I could na stomach the thought o being murdered i my own language so I ups wi a hatchet and I says to Bill Watson says I Now my lad if thou ll do me a kindness I ll pay thee back niver fear and they ll be glad enough to get shut on us and send us to old England again Just come down with a will Now missus why can t ye sit still and listen to me stead o pottering after pans and what not said he speaking crossly to his wife who had heard the story scores of times and it must be confessed was making some noise in preparing bread and milk for Sylvia s supper Bell did not say a word in reply but Sylvia tapped his shoulder with a pretty little authoritative air It s for me feyther I m just keen set for my supper Once let me get quickly set down to it and Philip there to his glass o grog and you ll never have such listeners in your life and mother s mind will be at ease too Eh thou s a wilfu wench said the proud father giving her a great slap on her back Well set thee down to thy victual and be quiet wi thee for I want to finish my tale to Philip But perhaps I ve telled it yo afore said he turning round to question Hepburn Hepburn could not say that he had not heard it for he piqued himself on his truthfulness But instead of frankly and directly owning this he tried to frame a formal little speech which would soothe Daniel s mortified vanity and of course it had the directly opposite effect Daniel resented being treated like a child and yet turned his back on Philip with all the wilfulness of one Sylvia did not care for her cousin but hated the discomfort of having her father displeased so she took up her tale of adventure and told her father and mother of her afternoon s proceedings Daniel pretended not to listen at first and made ostentatious noises with his spoon and glass but by and by he got quite warm and excited about the doings of the press gang and scolded both Philip and Sylvia for not having learnt more particulars as to what was the termination of the riot I ve been whaling mysel said he and I ve heerd tell as whalers wear knives and I d ha gi en t gang a taste o my whittle if I d been cotched up just as I d set my foot a shore I don t know said Philip we re at war wi the French and we shouldn t like to be beaten and yet if our numbers are not equal to theirs we stand a strong chance of it Not a bit on t so be d d said Daniel Robson bringing down his fist with such violence on the round deal table that the glasses and earthenware shook again Yo d not strike a child or a woman for sure yet it ud be like it if we did na give the Frenchies some vantages if we took em wi equal numbers It s not fair play and that s one place where t shoe pinches It s not fair play two ways It s not fair play to cotch up men as has no call for fightin at another man s biddin though they ve no objection to fight a bit on their own account and who are just landed all keen after bread i stead o biscuit and flesh meat i stead o junk and beds i stead o hammocks I make naught o t sentiment side for I were niver gi en up to such carnal mindedness and poesies It s noane fair to cotch em up and put em in a stifling hole all lined with metal for fear they should whittle their way out and send em off to sea for years an years to come And again it s no fair play to t French Four o them is rightly matched wi one o us and if we go an fight em four to four it s like as if yo fell to beatin Sylvie there or little Billy Croxton as isn t breeched And that s my mind Missus where s t pipe Philip did not smoke so took his turn at talking a chance he seldom had with Daniel unless the latter had his pipe between his lips So after Daniel had filled it and used Sylvia s little finger as a stopper to ram down the tobacco a habit of his to which she was so accustomed that she laid her hand on the table by him as naturally as she would have fetched him his spittoon when he began to smoke Philip arranged his arguments and began I m for fair play wi the French as much as any man as long as we can be sure o beating them but I say make sure o that and then give them ivery advantage Now I reckon Government is not sure as yet for i the papers it said as half th ships i th Channel hadn t got their proper complement o men and all as I say is let Government judge a bit for us and if they say they re hampered for want o men why we must make it up somehow John and Jeremiah Foster pay in taxes and Militiaman pays in person and if sailors cannot pay in taxes and will not pay in person why they must be made to pay and that s what th press gang is for I reckon For my part when I read o the way those French chaps are going on I m thankful to be governed by King George and a British Constitution Daniel took his pipe out of his mouth at this And when did I say a word again King George and the Constitution I only ax em to govern me as I judge best and that s what I call representation When I gived my vote to Measter Cholmley to go up to t Parliament House I as good as said Now yo go up theer sir and tell em what I Dannel Robson think right and what I Dannel Robson wish to have done Else I d be darned if I d ha gi en my vote to him or any other man And div yo think I want Seth Robson as is my own brother s son and mate to a collier to be cotched up by a press gang and ten to one his wages all unpaid Div yo think I d send up Measter Cholmley to speak up for that piece o work Not I He took up his pipe again shook out the ashes puffed it into a spark and shut his eyes preparatory to listening But asking pardon laws is made for the good of the nation not for your good or mine Daniel could not stand this He laid down his pipe opened his eyes stared straight at Philip before speaking in order to enforce his words and then said slowly Nation here nation theere I m a man and yo re another but nation s nowheere If Measter Cholmley talked to me i that fashion he d look long for another vote frae me I can make out King George and Measter Pitt and yo and me but nation nation go hang Philip who sometimes pursued an argument longer than was politic for himself especially when he felt sure of being on the conquering side did not see that Daniel Robson was passing out of the indifference of conscious wisdom into that state of anger which ensues when a question becomes personal in some unspoken way Robson had contested this subject once or twice before and had the remembrance of former disputes to add to his present vehemence So it was well for the harmony of the evening that Bell and Sylvia returned from the kitchen to sit in the house place They had been to wash up the pans and basins used for supper Sylvia had privately shown off her cloak and got over her mother s shake of the head at its colour with a coaxing kiss at the end of which her mother had adjusted her cap with a There there ha done wi thee but had no more heart to show her disapprobation and now they came back to their usual occupations until it should please their visitor to go then they would rake the fire and be off to bed for neither Sylvia s spinning nor Bell s knitting was worth candle light and morning hours are precious in a dairy People speak of the way in which harp playing sets off a graceful figure spinning is almost as becoming an employment A woman stands at the great wool wheel one arm extended the other holding the thread her head thrown back to take in all the scope of her occupation or if it is the lesser spinning wheel for flax and it was this that Sylvia moved forwards to night the pretty sound of the buzzing whirring motion the attitude of the spinner foot and hand alike engaged in the business the bunch of gay coloured ribbon that ties the bundle of flax on the rock all make it into a picturesque piece of domestic business that may rival harp playing any day for the amount of softness and grace which it calls out Sylvia s cheeks were rather flushed by the warmth of the room after the frosty air The blue ribbon with which she had thought it necessary to tie back her hair before putting on her hat to go to market had got rather loose and allowed her disarranged curls to stray in a manner which would have annoyed her extremely if she had been upstairs to look at herself in the glass but although they were not set in the exact fashion which Sylvia esteemed as correct they looked very pretty and luxuriant Her little foot placed on the traddle was still encased in its smartly buckled shoe not slightly to her discomfort as she was unaccustomed to be shod in walking far only as Philip had accompanied them home neither she nor Molly had liked to go barefoot Her round mottled arm and ruddy taper hand drew out the flax with nimble agile motion keeping time to the movement of the wheel All this Philip could see the greater part of her face was lost to him as she half averted it with a shy dislike to the way in which she knew from past experience that cousin Philip always stared at her And avert it as she would she heard with silent petulance the harsh screech of Philip s chair as he heavily dragged it on the stone floor sitting on it all the while and felt that he was moving round so as to look at her as much as was in his power without absolutely turning his back on either her father or mother She got herself ready for the first opportunity of contradiction or opposition Well wench and has ta bought this grand new cloak Yes feyther It s a scarlet one Ay ay and what does mother say Oh mother s content said Sylvia a little doubting in her heart but determined to defy Philip at all hazards Mother ll put up with it if it does na spot would be nearer fact I m thinking said Bell quietly I wanted Sylvia to take the gray said Philip And I chose the red it s so much gayer and folk can see me the farther off Feyther likes to see me at first turn o t lane don t yo feyther and I ll niver turn out when it s boun for to rain so it shall niver get a spot near it mammy I reckoned it were to wear i bad weather said Bell Leastways that were the pretext for coaxing feyther out o it She said it in a kindly tone though the words became a prudent rather than a fond mother But Sylvia understood her better than Daniel did as it appeared Hou d thy tongue mother She niver spoke a pretext at all He did not rightly know what a pretext was Bell was a touch better educated than her husband but he did not acknowledge this and made a particular point of differing from her whenever she used a word beyond his comprehension She s a good lass at times and if she liked to wear a yellow orange cloak she should have it Here s Philip here as stands up for laws and press gangs I ll set him to find us a law again pleasing our lass and she our only one Thou dostn t think on that mother Bell did think of that often oftener than her husband perhaps for she remembered every day and many times a day the little one that had been born and had died while its father was away on some long voyage But it was not her way to make replies Sylvia who had more insight into her mother s heart than Daniel broke in with a new subject Oh as for Philip he s been preaching up laws all t way home I said naught but let Molly hold her own or else I could ha told a tale about silks an lace an things Philip s face flushed Not because of the smuggling every one did that only it was considered polite to ignore it but he was annoyed to perceive how quickly his little cousin had discovered that his practice did not agree with his preaching and vexed too to see how delighted she was to bring out the fact He had some little idea too that his uncle might make use of his practice as an argument against the preaching he had lately been indulging in in opposition to Daniel but Daniel was too far gone in his Hollands and water to do more than enunciate his own opinions which he did with hesitating and laboured distinctness in the following sentence What I think and say is this Laws is made for to keep some folks fra harming others Press gangs and coast guards harm me i my business and keep me fra getting what I want Theerefore what I think and say is this Measter Cholmley should put down press gangs and coast guards If that theere isn t reason I ax yo to tell me what is an if Measter Cholmley don t do what I ax him he may go whistle for my vote he may At this period in his conversation Bell Robson interfered not in the least from any feeling of disgust or annoyance or dread of what he might say or do if he went on drinking but simply as a matter of health Sylvia too was in no way annoyed not only with her father but with every man whom she knew excepting her cousin Philip was it a matter of course to drink till their ideas became confused So she simply put her wheel aside as preparatory to going to bed when her mother said in a more decided tone than that which she had used on any other occasion but this and similar ones Come measter you ve had as much as is good for you Let a be Let a be said he clutching at the bottle of spirits but perhaps rather more good humoured with what he had drunk than he was before he jerked a little more into his glass before his wife carried it off and locked it up in the cupboard putting the key in her pocket and

none	none	winking at Philip Eh my man Niver gie a woman t whip hand o er yo Yo seen what it brings a man to but for a that I ll vote for Cholmley an d t press gang He had to shout out the last after Philip for Hepburn really anxious to please his aunt and disliking drinking habits himself by constitution was already at the door and setting out on his return home thinking it must be confessed far more of the character of Sylvia s shake of the hand than of the parting words of either his uncle or aunt CHAPTER V STORY OF THE PRESS GANG For a few days after the evening mentioned in the last chapter the weather was dull Not in quick sudden showers did the rain come down but in constant drizzle blotting out all colour from the surrounding landscape and filling the air with fine gray mist until people breathed more water than air At such times the consciousness of the nearness of the vast unseen sea acted as a dreary depression to the spirits but besides acting on the nerves of the excitable such weather affected the sensitive or ailing in material ways Daniel Robson s fit of rheumatism incapacitated him from stirring abroad and to a man of his active habits and somewhat inactive mind this was a great hardship He was not ill tempered naturally but this state of confinement made him more ill tempered than he had ever been before in his life He sat in the chimney corner abusing the weather and doubting the wisdom or desirableness of all his wife saw fit to do in the usual daily household matters The chimney corner was really a corner at Haytersbank There were two projecting walls on each side of the fire place running about six feet into the room and a stout wooden settle was placed against one of these while opposite was the circular backed master s chair the seat of which was composed of a square piece of wood judiciously hollowed out and placed with one corner to the front Here in full view of all the operations going on over the fire sat Daniel Robson for four live long days advising and directing his wife in all such minor matters as the boiling of potatoes the making of porridge all the work on which she specially piqued herself and on which she would have taken advice no not from the most skilled housewife in all the three Ridings But somehow she managed to keep her tongue quiet from telling him as she would have done any woman and any other man to mind his own business or she would pin a dish clout to his tail She even checked Sylvia when the latter proposed as much for fun as for anything else that his ignorant directions should be followed and the consequences brought before his eyes and his nose Na na said Bell th feyther s feyther and we mun respect him But it s dree work havin a man i th house nursing th fire an such weather too and not a soul coming near us not even to fall out wi him for thee and me must na do that for th Bible s sake dear and a good stand up wordy quarrel would do him a power of good stir his blood like I wish Philip would turn up Bell sighed for in these four days she had experienced somewhat of Madame de Maintenon s difficulty and with fewer resources to meet it of trying to amuse a man who was not amusable For Bell good and sensible as she was was not a woman of resources Sylvia s plan undutiful as it was in her mother s eyes would have done Daniel more good even though it might have made him angry than his wife s quiet careful monotony of action which however it might conduce to her husband s comfort when he was absent did not amuse him when present Sylvia scouted the notion of cousin Philip coming into their household in the character of an amusing or entertaining person till she nearly made her mother angry at her ridicule of the good steady young fellow to whom Bell looked up as the pattern of all that early manhood should be But the moment Sylvia saw she had been giving her mother pain she left off her wilful little jokes and kissed her and told her she would manage all famously and ran out of the back kitchen in which mother and daughter had been scrubbing the churn and all the wooden implements of butter making Bell looked at the pretty figure of her little daughter as running past with her apron thrown over her head she darkened the window beneath which her mother was doing her work She paused just for a moment and then said almost unawares to herself Bless thee lass before resuming her scouring of what already looked almost snow white Sylvia scampered across the rough farmyard in the wetting drizzling rain to the place where she expected to find Kester but he was not there so she had to retrace her steps to the cow house and making her way up a rough kind of ladder staircase fixed straight against the wall she surprised Kester as he sat in the wool loft looking over the fleeces reserved for the home spinning by popping her bright face swathed round with her blue woollen apron up through the trap door and thus her head the only visible part she addressed the farm servant who was almost like one of the family Kester feyther s just tiring hissel wi weariness an vexation sitting by t fireside wi his hands afore him an nought to do An mother and me can t think on aught as ll rouse him up to a bit of a laugh or aught more cheerful than a scolding Now Kester thou mun just be off and find Harry Donkin th tailor and bring him here it s gettin on for Martinmas an he ll be coming his rounds and he may as well come here first as last and feyther s clothes want a deal o mending up and Harry s always full of his news and anyhow he ll do for feyther to scold an be a new person too and that s somewhat for all on us Now go like a good old Kester as yo are Kester looked at her with loving faithful admiration He had set himself his day s work in his master s absence and was very desirous of finishing it but somehow he never dreamed of resisting Sylvia so he only stated the case T ool s a vast o muck in t an a thowt as a d fettle it an do it up but a reckon a mun do yo r biddin There s a good old Kester said she smiling and nodding her muffled head at him then she dipped down out of his sight then rose up again he had never taken his slow mooney eyes from the spot where she had disappeared to say Now Kester be wary and deep thou mun tell Harry Donkin not to let on as we ve sent for him but just to come in as if he were on his round and took us first and he mun ask feyther if there is any work for him to do and I ll answer for t he ll have a welcome and a half Now be deep and fause mind thee A se deep an fause enow wi simple folk but what can a do i Donkin be as fause as me as happen he may be Ga way wi thee I Donkin be Solomon thou mun be t Queen o Sheba and I se bound for to say she outwitted him at last Kester laughed so long at the idea of his being the Queen of Sheba that Sylvia was back by her mother s side before the cachinnation ended That night just as Sylvia was preparing to go to bed in her little closet of a room she heard some shot rattling at her window She opened the little casement and saw Kester standing below He recommenced where he left off with a laugh He he he A s been t queen A se ta en Donkin on t reet side an he ll coom in to morrow just permiskus an ax for work like as if t were a favour t oud felley were a bit cross grained at startin for he were workin at farmer Crosskey s up at t other side o t town wheer they puts a strike an a half of maut intil t beer when most folk put nobbut a strike an t made him ill to convince but he ll coom niver fear The honest fellow never said a word of the shilling he had paid out of his own pocket to forward Sylvia s wishes and to persuade the tailor to leave the good beer All his anxiety now was to know if he had been missed and if it was likely that a scolding awaited him in the morning T oud measter didn t set up his back cause a didn t coom in t supper He questioned a bit as to what thou were about but mother didn t know an I held my peace Mother carried thy supper in t loft for thee A ll gang after t then for a m like a pair o bellowses wi t wind out just two flat sides wi nowt betwixt The next morning Sylvia s face was a little redder than usual when Harry Donkin s bow legs were seen circling down the path to the house door Here s Donkin for sure exclaimed Bell when she caught sight of him a minute after her daughter Well I just call that lucky for he ll be company for thee while Sylvia and me has to turn th cheeses This was too original a remark for a wife to make in Daniel s opinion on this especial morning when his rheumatism was twinging him more than usual so he replied with severity That s all t women know about it Wi them it s coompany coompany coompany an they think a man s no better than theirsels A d have yo to know a ve a vast o thoughts in myself as I m noane willing to lay out for t benefit o every man A ve niver gotten time for meditation sin a were married leastways sin a left t sea Aboard ship wi niver a woman wi n leagues o hail and upo t masthead in special a could Then I d better tell Donkin as we ve no work for him said Sylvia instinctively managing her father by agreeing with him instead of reasoning with or contradicting him Now theere you go wrenching himself round for fear Sylvia should carry her meekly made threat into execution Ugh ugh as his limb hurt him Come in Harry come in and talk a bit o sense to me for a ve been shut up wi women these four days and a m a most a nateral by this time A se bound for t they ll find yo some wark if t s nought but for to save their own fingers So Harry took off his coat and seated himself professional wise on the hastily cleared dresser so that he might have all the light afforded by the long low casement window Then he blew in his thimble sucked his finger so that they might adhere tightly together and looked about for a subject for opening conversation while Sylvia and her mother might be heard opening and shutting drawers and box lids before they could find the articles that needed repair or that were required to mend each other Women s well enough i their way said Daniel in a philosophizing tone but a man may have too much on em Now there s me leg fast these four days and a ll make free to say to yo a d rather a deal ha been loading dung i t wettest weather an a reckon it s th being wi nought but women as tires me so they talk so foolish it gets int t bones like Now thou know saint thou rt not called much of a man oather but bless yo t ninth part s summut to be thankful for after nought but women An yet yo seen they were for sending yo away i their foolishness Well missus and who s to pay for t fettling of all them clothes as Bell came down with her arms full She was going to answer her husband meekly and literally according to her wont but Sylvia already detecting the increased cheerfulness of his tone called out from behind her mother I am feyther I m going for to sell my new cloak as I bought Thursday for the mending on your old coats and waistcoats Hearken till her said Daniel chuckling She s a true wench Three days sin noane so full as she o t new cloak that now she s fain t sell Ay Harry If feyther won t pay yo for making all these old clothes as good as new I ll sell my new red cloak sooner than yo shall go unpaid A reckon it s a bargain said Harry casting sharp professional eyes on the heap before him and singling out the best article as to texture for examination and comment They re all again these metal buttons said he Silk weavers has been petitioning Ministers t make a law to favour silk buttons and I did hear tell as there were informers goin about spyin after metal buttons and as how they could haul yo before a justice for wearing on em A were wed in em and a ll wear em to my dyin day or a ll wear noane at a They re for making such a pack o laws they ll be for meddling wi my fashion o sleeping next and taxing me for ivery snore a give They ve been after t winders and after t vittle and after t very saut to t it s dearer by hauf an more nor it were when a were a boy they re a meddlesome set o folks law makers is an a ll niver believe King George has ought t do wi t But mark my words I were wed wi brass buttons and brass buttons a ll wear to my death an if they moither me about it a ll wear brass buttons i my coffin By this time Harry had arranged a certain course of action with missus Robson conducting the consultation and agreement by signs His thread was flying fast already and the mother and daughter felt more free to pursue their own business than they had done for several days for it was a good sign that Daniel had taken his pipe out of the square hollow in the fireside wall where he usually kept it and was preparing to diversify his remarks with satisfying interludes of puffing Why look ye this very baccy had a run for t It came ashore sewed up neatly enough i a woman s stays as was wife to a fishing smack down at t bay yonder She were a lean thing as iver you saw when she went for t see her husband aboard t vessel but she coom back lustier by a deal an wi many a thing on her here and theere beside baccy An that were i t face o coast guard and yon tender an a But she made as though she were tipsy an so they did nought but curse her an get out on her way Speaking of t tender there s been a piece o wark i Monkshaven this week wi t press gang said Harry Ay ay our lass was telling about t but Lord bless ye there s no gettin t rights on a story out on a woman though a will say this for our Sylvie she s as bright a lass as iver a man looked at Now the truth was that Daniel had not liked to demean himself at the time when Sylvia came back so full of what she had seen at Monkshaven by evincing any curiosity on the subject He had then thought that the next day he would find some business that should take him down to the town when he could learn all that was to be learnt without flattering his womankind by asking questions as if anything they might say could interest him He had a strong notion of being a kind of domestic Jupiter It s made a deal o wark i Monkshaven Folk had gotten to think nought o t tender she lay so still an t leftenant paid such a good price for all he wanted for t ship But o Thursday t Resolution first whaler back this season came in port and t press gang showed their teeth and carried off four as good able bodied seamen as iver I made trousers for and t place were all up like a nest o wasps when yo ve set your foot in t midst They were so mad they were ready for t fight t very pavin stones A wish a d been theere A just wish a had A ve a score for t reckon up wi t press gang And the old man lifted up his right hand his hand on which the forefinger and thumb were maimed and useless partly in denunciation and partly as a witness of what he had endured to escape from the service abhorred because it was forced His face became a totally different countenance with the expression of settled and unrelenting indignation which his words called out G on man g on said Daniel impatient with Donkin for the little delay occasioned by the necessity of arranging his work more fully Ay ay all in good time for a ve a long tale to tell yet an a mun have some un to iron me out my seams and look me out my bits for there s none here fit for my purpose Dang thy bits Here Sylvie Sylvie come and be tailor s man and let t chap get settled sharp for a m fain t hear his story Sylvia took her directions and placed her irons in the fire and ran upstairs for the bundle which had been put aside by her careful mother for occasions like the present It consisted of small pieces of various coloured cloth cut out of old coats and waistcoats and similar garments when the whole had become too much worn for use yet when part had been good enough to be treasured by a thrifty housewife Daniel grew angry before Donkin had selected his patterns and settled the work to his own mind Well said he at last a mought be a young man a goin a wooin by t pains thou saint taken for t match my oud clothes I don t care if they re patched wi scarlet a tell thee so as thou lieutenant work away at thy tale wi thy tongue same time as thou works at thy needle wi thy fingers Then as a were saying all Monkshaven were like a nest o wasps flyin hither and thither and makin sich a buzzin and a talkin as niver were and each wi his sting out ready for t vent his venom o rage and revenge And women cryin and sobbin i t streets when Lord help us o Saturday came a worse time than iver for all Friday there had been a kind o expectation an dismay about t Good Fortune as t mariners had said was off saint Abb s Head o Thursday when t Resolution came in and there was wives and maids wi husbands an sweethearts aboard t Good Fortune ready to throw their eyes out on their heads wi gazin gazin nor ards over t sea as were all one haze o blankness wi t rain and when t afternoon tide comed in an niver a line on her to be seen folk were oncertain as t whether she were holding off for fear o t tender as were out o sight too or what were her mak o goin on An t poor wet draggled women folk came up t town some slowly cryin as if their hearts was sick an others just bent their heads to t wind and went straight to their homes nother looking nor speaking to ony one but barred their doors and stiffened theirsels up for a night o waiting Saturday morn yo ll mind Saturday morn it were stormy and gusty downreet dirty weather theere stood t folk again by daylight a watching an a straining and by that tide t Good Fortune came o er t bar But t excisemen had sent back her news by t boat as took em there They d a deal of oil and a vast o blubber But for all that her flag was drooping i t rain half mast high for mourning and sorrow an they d a dead man aboard a dead man as was living and strong last sunrise An there was another as lay between life an death and there was seven more as should ha been theere as wasn t but was carried off by t gang T frigate as we n a heard tell on as lying off Hartlepool got tidings fra t tender as captured t seamen o Thursday and t Aurora as they ca ed her made off for t nor ard and nine leagues off saint Abb s Head t Resolution thinks she were she see d t frigate and knowed by her build she were a man o war and guessed she were bound on king s kidnapping I seen t wounded man mysen wi my own eyes and he ll live he ll live Niver a man died yet wi such a strong purpose o vengeance in him He could barely speak for he were badly shot but his colour coome and went as t master s mate an t captain telled me and some others how t Aurora fired at em and how t innocent whaler hoisted her colours but afore they were fairly run up another shot coome close in t shrouds and then t Greenland ship being t windward bore down on t frigate but as they knew she were an oud fox and bent on mischief Kinraid that s he who lies a dying only he ll noane die a se bound the specksioneer bade t men go down between decks and fasten t hatches well an he d stand guard he an captain and t oud master s mate being left upo deck for t give a welcome just skin deep to t boat s crew fra t Aurora as they could see coming t wards them o er t watter wi their reg lar man o war s rowing Damn em said Daniel in soliloquy and under his breath Sylvia stood poising her iron and listening eagerly afraid to give Donkin the hot iron for fear of interrupting the narrative unwilling to put it into the fire again because that action would perchance remind him of his work which now the tailor had forgotten so eager was he in telling his story Well they coome on over t watters wi great bounds and up t sides they coome like locusts all armed men an t captain says he saw Kinraid hide away his whaling knife under some tarpaulin and he knew he meant mischief an he would no more ha stopped him wi a word nor he would ha stopped him fra killing a whale And when t Aurora s men were aboard one on em runs to t helm and at that t captain says he felt as if his wife were kissed afore his face but says he I bethought me on t men as were shut up below hatches an I remembered t folk at Monkshaven as were looking out for us even then an I said to mysel I would speak fair as long as I could more by token o the whaling knife as I could see glinting bright under t black tarpaulin So he spoke quite fair and civil though he see d they was nearing t Aurora and t Aurora was nearing them Then t navy captain hailed him thro t trumpet wi a great rough blast and says he Order your men to come on deck And t captain of t whaler says his men cried up from under t hatches as they d niver be gi en up wi out bloodshed and he sees Kinraid take out his pistol and look well to t priming so he says to t navy captain We re protected Greenland men and you have no right t meddle wi us But t navy captain only bellows t more Order your men t come on deck If they won t obey you and you have lost the command of your vessel I reckon you re in a state of mutiny and you may come aboard t Aurora and such men as are willing t follow you and I ll fire int the rest Yo see that were t depth o the man he were for pretending and pretexting as t captain could na manage his own ship and as he d help him But our Greenland captain were noane so poor spirited and says he She s full of oil and I ware you of consequences if you fire into her Anyhow pirate or no pirate for t word pirate stuck in his gizzard I m a honest Monkshaven man an I come fra a land where there s great icebergs and many a deadly danger but niver a press gang thank God and that s what you are I reckon Them s the words he told me but whether he spoke em out so bold at t time I se not so sure they were in his mind for t speak only maybe prudence got t better on him for he said he prayed i his heart to bring his cargo safe to t owners come what might Well t Aurora s men aboard t Good Fortune cried out might they fire down t hatches and bring t men out that a way and then t specksioneer he speaks an he says he stands ower t hatches and he has two good pistols and summut besides and he don t care for his life bein a bachelor but all below are married men yo see and he ll put an end to t first two chaps as come near t hatches An they say he picked two off as made for t come near and then just as he were stooping for t whaling knife an it s as big as a sickle Teach folk as don t know a whaling knife cried Daniel I were a Greenland man mysel They shot him through t side and dizzied him and kicked him aside for dead and fired down t hatches and killed one man and disabled two and then t rest cried for quarter for life is sweet e en aboard a king s ship and t Aurora carried em off wounded men an able men an all leaving Kinraid for dead as wasn t dead and Darley for dead as was dead an t captain and master s mate as were too old for work and t captain as loves Kinraid like a brother poured rum down his throat and bandaged him up and has sent for t first doctor in Monkshaven for to get t slugs out for they say there s niver such a harpooner in a t Greenland seas an I can speak fra my own seeing he s a fine young fellow where he lies theere all stark and wan for weakness and loss o blood But Darley s dead as a door nail and there s to be such a burying of him as niver was seen afore i Monkshaven come Sunday And now gi us t iron wench and let s lose no more time a talking It s noane loss o time said Daniel moving himself heavily in his chair to feel how helpless he was once more If a were as young as once a were nay lad if a had na these sore rheumatics now a reckon as t press gang ud find out as t shouldn t do such things for nothing Bless thee man it s waur nor i my youth i th Ameriky war and then t were bad enough And Kinraid said Sylvia drawing a long breath after the effort of realizing it all her cheeks had flushed up and her eyes had glittered during the progress of the tale Oh he ll do He ll not die Life s stuff is in him yet He ll be Molly Corney s cousin I reckon said Sylvia bethinking her with a blush of Molly Corney s implication that he was more than a cousin to her and immediately longing to go off and see Molly and hear all the little details which women do not think it beneath them to give to women From that time Sylvia s little heart was bent on this purpose But it was not one to be openly avowed even to herself She only wanted sadly to see Molly and she almost believed herself that it was to consult her about the fashion of her cloak which Donkin was to cut out and which she was to make under his directions at any rate this was the reason she gave to her mother when the day s work was done and a fine gleam came out upon the pale and watery sky towards evening CHAPTER VI THE SAILOR S FUNERAL Moss Brow the Corney s house was but a disorderly comfortless place You had to cross a dirty farmyard all puddles and dungheaps on stepping stones to get to the door of the house place That great room itself was sure to have clothes hanging to dry at the fire whatever day of the week it was some one of the large irregular family having had what is called in the district a dab wash of a few articles forgotten on the regular day And sometimes these articles lay in their dirty state in the untidy kitchen out of which a room half parlour half bedroom opened on one side and a dairy the only clean place in the house at the opposite In face of you as you entered the door was the entrance to the working kitchen or scullery Still in spite of disorder like this there was a well to do aspect about the place the Corneys were rich in their way in flocks and herds as well as in children and to them neither dirt nor the perpetual bustle arising from ill ordered work detracted from comfort They were all of an easy good tempered nature missus Corney and her daughters gave every one a welcome at whatever time of the day they came and would just as soon sit down for a gossip at ten o clock in the morning as at five in the evening though at the former time the house place was full of work of various kinds which ought to be got out of hand and done with while the latter hour was towards the end of the day when farmers wives and daughters were usually cleaned was the word then dressed is that in vogue now Of course in such a household as this Sylvia was sure to be gladly received She was young and pretty and bright and brought a fresh breeze of pleasant air about her as her appropriate atmosphere And besides Bell Robson held her head so high that visits from her daughter were rather esteemed as a favour for it was not everywhere that Sylvia was allowed to go Sit yo down sit yo down cried Dame Corney dusting a chair with her apron a reckon Molly ll be in i no time She s nobbut gone int t orchard to see if she can find wind falls enough for t make a pie or two for t lads They like nowt so weel for supper as apple pies sweetened wi treacle crust stout and leathery as stands chewing and we hannot getten in our apples yet If Molly is in t orchard I ll go find her said Sylvia Well yo lasses will have your conks private talks a know secrets bout sweethearts and such like said missus Corney with a knowing look which made Sylvia hate her for the moment A ve not forgotten as a were young mysen Tak care there s a pool o mucky watter just outside t back door But Sylvia was half way across the back yard worse if possible than the front as to the condition in which it was kept and had passed through the little gate into the orchard It was full of old gnarled apple trees their trunks covered with gray lichen in which the cunning chaffinch built her nest in spring time The cankered branches remained on the trees and added to the knotted interweaving overhead if they did not to the productiveness the grass grew in long tufts and was wet and tangled under foot There was a tolerable crop of rosy apples still hanging on the gray old trees and here and there they showed ruddy in the green bosses of untrimmed grass Why the fruit was not gathered as it was evidently ripe would have puzzled any one not acquainted with the Corney family to say but to them it was always a maxim in practice if not in precept Do nothing to day that you can put off till to morrow and accordingly the apples dropped from the trees at any little gust of wind and lay rotting on the ground until the lads wanted a supply of pies for supper Molly saw Sylvia and came quickly across the orchard to meet her catching her feet in knots of grass as she hurried along Well lass said she who d ha thought o seeing yo such a day as it has been But it s cleared up now beautiful said Sylvia looking up at the soft evening sky to be seen through the apple boughs It was of a tender delicate gray with the faint warmth of a promising sunset tinging it with a pink atmosphere Rain is over and gone and I wanted to know how my cloak is to be made for Donkin s working at our house and I wanted to know all about the news yo know What news asked Molly for she had heard of the affair between the Good Fortune and the Aurora some days before and to tell the truth it had rather passed out of her head just at this moment Hannot yo heard all about t press gang and t whaler and t great fight and Kinraid as is your cousin acting so brave and grand and lying on his death bed now Oh said Molly enlightened as to Sylvia s news and half surprised at the vehemence with which the little creature spoke yes a heerd that days ago But Charley s noane on his death bed he s a deal better an mother says as he s to be moved up here next week for nursin and better air nor he gets i t town yonder Oh I am so glad said Sylvia with all her heart I thought he d maybe die and I should niver see him A ll promise yo shall see him that s t say if a goes on well for he s getten an ugly hurt Mother says as there s four blue marks on his side as ll last him his life an t doctor fears bleeding i his inside and then he ll drop down dead when no one looks for t But you said he was better said Sylvia blanching a little at this account Ay he s better but life s uncertain special after gun shot wounds He acted very fine said Sylvia meditating A allays knowed he would Many s the time a ve heerd him say honour bright and now he s shown how bright his is Molly did not speak sentimentally but with a kind of proprietorship in Kinraid s honour which confirmed Sylvia in her previous idea of a mutual attachment between her and her cousin Considering this notion she was a little surprised at Molly s next speech An about yer cloak are you for a hood or a cape a reckon that s the question Oh I don t care tell me more about Kinraid Do yo really think he ll get better Dear how t lass takes on about him A ll tell him what a deal of interest a young woman taks i him From that time Sylvia never asked another question about him In a somewhat dry and altered tone she said after a little pause I think on a hood What do you say to it Well hoods is a bit old fashioned to my mind If t were mine I d have a cape cut i three points one to tie on each shoulder and one to dip down handsome behind But let yo an me go to Monkshaven church o Sunday and see Measter Fishburn s daughters as has their things made i York and notice a bit how they re made We needn t do it i church but just scan em o er i t churchyard and there ll be no harm done Besides there s to be this grand burryin o t man t press gang shot and t will be like killing two birds at once I should like to go said Sylvia I feel so sorry like for the poor sailors shot down and kidnapped just as they was coming home as we see d em o Thursday last I ll ask mother if she ll let me go Ay do I know my mother ll let me if she doesn t go hersen for it ll be a sight to see and to speak on for many a long year after what I ve heerd And Miss Fishburns is sure to be theere so I d just get Donkin to cut out cloak itsel and keep back yer mind fra fixing o either cape or hood till Sunday s turn d Will yo set me part o t way home said Sylvia seeing the dying daylight become more and more crimson through the blackening trees No I can t A should like it well enough but somehow there s a deal o work to be done yet for t hours slip through one s fingers so as there s no knowing Mind yo then o Sunday A ll be at t stile one o clock punctual and we ll go slowly into t town and look about us as we go and see folk s dresses and go to t church and say wer prayers and come out and have a look at t funeral And with this programme of proceedings settled for the following Sunday the girls whom neighbourhood and parity of age had forced into some measure of friendship parted for the time Sylvia hastened home feeling as if she had been absent long her mother stood on the little knoll at the side of the house watching for her with her hand shading her eyes from the low rays of the setting sun but as soon as she saw her daughter in the distance she returned to her work whatever that might be She was not a woman of many words or of much demonstration few observers would have guessed how much she loved her child but Sylvia without any reasoning or observation instinctively knew that her mother s heart was bound up in her Her father and Donkin were going on much as when she had left them talking and disputing the one compelled to be idle the other stitching away as fast as he talked They seemed as if they had never missed Sylvia no more did her mother for that matter for she was busy and absorbed in her afternoon dairy work to all appearance But Sylvia had noted the watching not three minutes before and many a time in her after life when no one cared much for her out goings and in comings the straight upright figure of her mother fronting the setting sun but searching through its blinding rays for a sight of her child rose up like a sudden seen picture the remembrance of which smote Sylvia to the heart with a sense of a lost blessing not duly valued while possessed Well feyther and how s a wi you asked Sylvia going to the side of his chair and laying her hand on his shoulder Eh harkee till this lass o mine She thinks as because she s gone galraverging I maun ha missed her and be ailing Why lass Donkin and me has had t most sensible talk a ve had this many a day A ve gi en him a vast o knowledge and he s done me a power o good Please God to morrow a ll tak a start at walking if t weather holds up Ay said Donkin with a touch of sarcasm in his voice feyther and me has settled many puzzles it s been a loss to Government as they hannot been here for profiting by our wisdom We ve done away wi taxes and press gangs and many a plague and beaten t French i our own minds that s to say It s a wonder t me as those Lunnon folks can t see things clear said Daniel all in good faith Sylvia did not quite understand the state of things as regarded politics and taxes and politics and taxes were all one in her mind it must be confessed but she saw that her innocent little scheme of giving her father the change of society afforded by Donkin s coming had answered and in the gladness of her heart she went out and ran round the corner of the house to find Kester and obtain from him that sympathy in her success which she dared not ask from her mother Kester Kester lad said she in a loud whisper but Kester was suppering the horses and in the clamp of their feet on the round stable pavement he did not hear her at first She went a little farther into the stable Kester he s a vast better he ll go out to morrow it s all Donkin s doing I m beholden to thee for fetching him and I ll try and spare thee waistcoat fronts out o t stuff for my new red cloak Thou ll like that Kester won t ta Kester took the notion in slowly and weighed it Na lass said he deliberately after a pause A could na bear to see thee wi thy cloak scrimpit A like t see a wench look bonny and smart an a tak a kind o pride in thee an should be a most as much hurt i my mind to see thee i a pinched cloak as if old Moll s tail here were docked too short Na lass a se niver got a mirroring glass for t see mysen in so what s waistcoats to me Keep thy stuff to thysen theere s a good wench but a se main and glad about t measter Place isn t like itsen when he s shut up and cranky He took up a wisp of straw and began rubbing down the old mare and hissing over his work as if he wished to consider the conversation as ended And Sylvia who had strung herself up in a momentary fervour of gratitude to make the generous offer was not sorry to have it refused and went back planning what kindness she could show to Kester without its involving so much sacrifice to herself For giving waistcoat fronts to him would deprive her of the pleasant power of selecting a fashionable pattern in Monkshaven churchyard next Sunday That wished for day seemed long a coming as wished for days most frequently do Her father got better by slow degrees and her mother was pleased by the tailor s good pieces of work showing the neatly placed patches with as much pride as many matrons take in new clothes now a days And the weather cleared up into a dim kind of autumnal fineness into anything but an Indian summer as far as regarded gorgeousness of colouring for on that coast the mists and sea fogs early spoil the brilliancy of the foliage Yet perhaps the more did the silvery grays and browns of the inland scenery conduce to the tranquillity of the time the time of peace and rest before the fierce and stormy winter comes on It seems a time for gathering up human forces to encounter the coming severity as well as of storing up the produce of harvest for the needs of winter Old people turn out and sun themselves in that calm saint Martin s summer without fear of the heat o th sun or the coming winter s rages and we may read in their pensive dreamy eyes that they are weaning themselves away from the earth which probably many may never see dressed in her summer glory again Many such old people set out betimes on the Sunday afternoon to which Sylvia had been so looking forward to scale the long flights of stone steps worn by the feet of many generations which led up to the parish church placed on a height above the town on a great green area at the summit of the cliff which was the angle where the river and the sea met and so overlooking both the busy crowded little town the port the shipping and the bar on the one hand and the wide illimitable tranquil sea on the other types of life and eternity It was a good situation for that church Homeward bound sailors caught sight of the tower of saint Nicholas the first land object of all They who went forth upon the great deep might carry solemn thoughts with them of the words they had heard there not conscious thoughts perhaps rather a distinct if dim conviction that buying and selling eating and marrying even life and death were not all the realities in existence Nor were the words that came up to their remembrance words of sermons preached there however impressive The sailors mostly slept through the sermons unless indeed there were incidents such as were involved in what were called funeral discourses to be narrated They did not recognize their daily faults or temptations under the grand aliases befitting their appearance from a preacher s mouth But they knew the old oft repeated words praying for deliverance from the familiar dangers of lightning and tempest from battle murder and sudden death and nearly every man was aware that he left behind him some one who would watch for the prayer for the preservation of those who travel by land or by water and think of him as God protected the more for the earnestness of the response then given There too lay the dead of many generations for saint Nicholas had been the parish church ever since Monkshaven was a town and the large churchyard was rich in the dead Masters mariners ship owners seamen it seemed strange how few other trades were represented in that great plain so full of upright gravestones Here and there was a memorial stone placed by some survivor of a large family most of whom perished at sea Supposed to have perished in the Greenland seas Shipwrecked in the Baltic Drowned off the coast of Iceland There was a strange sensation as if the cold sea winds must bring with them the dim phantoms of those lost sailors who had died far from their homes and from the hallowed ground where their fathers lay Each flight of steps up to this churchyard ended in a small flat space on which a wooden seat was placed On this particular Sunday all these seats were filled by aged people breathless with the unusual exertion of climbing You could see the church stair as it was called from nearly every part of the town and the figures of the numerous climbers diminished by distance looked like a busy ant hill long before the bell began to ring for afternoon service All who could manage it had put on a bit of black in token of mourning it might be very little an old ribbon a rusty piece of crape but some sign of mourning was shown by every one down to the little child in its mother s arms that innocently clutched the piece of rosemary to be thrown into the grave for remembrance Darley the seaman shot by the press gang nine leagues off saint Abb s Head was to be buried to day at the accustomed time for the funerals of the poorer classes directly after evening service and there were only the sick and their nurse tenders who did not come forth to show their feeling for the man whom they looked upon as murdered The crowd of vessels in harbour bore their flags half mast high and the crews were making their way through the High Street The gentlefolk of Monkshaven full of indignation at this interference with their ships full of sympathy with the family who had lost their son and brother almost within sight of his home came in unusual numbers no lack of patterns for Sylvia but her thoughts were far otherwise and more suitably occupied The unwonted sternness and solemnity visible on the countenances of all whom she met awed and affected her She did not speak in reply to Molly s remarks on the dress or appearance of those who struck her She felt as if these speeches jarred on her and annoyed her almost to irritation yet Molly had come all the way to Monkshaven Church in her service and deserved forbearance accordingly The two mounted the steps alongside of many people few words were exchanged even at the breathing places so often the little centres of gossip Looking over the sea there was not a sail to be seen it seemed bared of life as if to be in serious harmony with what was going on inland The church was of old Norman architecture low and massive outside inside of vast space only a quarter of which was filled on ordinary Sundays The walls were disfigured by numerous tablets of black and white marble intermixed and the usual ornamentation of that style of memorial as erected in the last century of weeping willows urns and drooping figures with here and there a ship in full sail or an anchor where the seafaring idea prevalent through the place had launched out into a little originality There was no wood work the church had been stripped of that most probably when the neighbouring monastery had been destroyed There were large square pews lined with green baize with the names of the families of the most flourishing ship owners painted white on the doors there were pews not so large and not lined at all for the farmers and shopkeepers of the parish and numerous heavy oaken benches which by the united efforts of several men might be brought within earshot of the pulpit These were being removed into the most convenient situations when Molly and Sylvia entered the church and after two or three whispered sentences they took their seats on one of these The vicar of Monkshaven was a kindly peaceable old man hating strife and troubled waters above everything He was a vehement Tory in theory as became his cloth in those days He had two bugbears to fear the French and the Dissenters It was difficult to say of which he had the worst opinion and the most intense dread Perhaps he hated the Dissenters most because they came nearer in contact with him than the French besides the French had the excuse of being Papists while the Dissenters might have belonged to the Church of England if they had not been utterly depraved Yet in practice doctor Wilson did not object to dine with mister Fishburn who was a personal friend and follower of Wesley but then as the doctor would say Wesley was an Oxford man and that makes him a gentleman and he was an ordained minister of the Church of England so that grace can never depart from him But I do not know what excuse he would have alleged for sending broth and vegetables to old Ralph Thompson a rabid Independent who had been given to abusing the Church and the vicar from a Dissenting pulpit as long as ever he could mount the stairs However that inconsistency between doctor Wilson s theories and practice was not generally known in Monkshaven so we have nothing to do with it doctor Wilson had had a very difficult part to play and a still more difficult sermon to write during this last week The Darley who had been killed was the son of the vicar s gardener and doctor Wilson s sympathies as a man had been all on the bereaved father s side But then he had received as the oldest magistrate in the neighbourhood a letter from the captain of the Aurora explanatory and exculpatory Darley had been resisting the orders of an officer in his Majesty s service What would become of due subordination and loyalty and the interests of the service and the chances of beating those confounded French if such conduct as Darley s was to be encouraged Poor Darley he was past all evil effects of human encouragement now So the vicar mumbled hastily over a sermon on the text In the midst of life we are in death which might have done as well for a baby cut off in a convulsion fit as for the strong man shot down with all his eager blood hot within him by men as hot blooded as himself But once when the old doctor s eye caught the up turned straining gaze of the father Darley seeking with all his soul to find a grain of holy comfort in the chaff of words his conscience smote him Had he nothing to say that should calm anger and revenge with spiritual power no breath of the comforter to soothe repining into resignation But again the discord between the laws of man and the laws of Christ stood before him and he gave up the attempt to do more than he was doing as beyond his power Though the hearers went away as full of anger as they had entered the church and some with a dull feeling of disappointment as to what they had got there yet no one felt anything but kindly towards the old vicar His simple happy life led amongst them for forty years and open to all men in its daily course his sweet tempered cordial ways his practical kindness made him beloved by all and neither he nor they thought much or cared much for admiration of his talents Respect for his office was all the respect he thought of and that was conceded to him from old traditional and hereditary association In looking back to the last century it appears curious to see how little our ancestors had the power of putting two things together and perceiving either the discord or harmony thus produced Is it because we are farther off from those times and have consequently a greater range of vision Will our descendants have a wonder about us such as we have about the inconsistency of our forefathers or a surprise at our blindness that we do not perceive that holding such and such opinions our course of action must be so and so or that the logical consequence of particular opinions must be convictions which at present we hold in abhorrence It seems puzzling to look back on men such as our vicar who almost held the doctrine that the King could do no wrong yet were ever ready to talk of the glorious Revolution and to abuse the Stuarts for having entertained the same doctrine and tried to put it in practice But such discrepancies ran through good men s lives in those days It is well for us that we live at the present time when everybody is logical and consistent This little discussion must be taken in place of doctor Wilson s sermon of which no one could remember more than the text half an hour after it was delivered Even the doctor himself had the recollection of the words he had uttered swept out of his mind as having doffed his gown and donned his surplice he came out of the dusk of his vestry and went to the church door looking into the broad light which came upon the plain of the church yard on the cliffs for the sun had not yet set and the pale moon was slowly rising through the silvery mist that obscured the distant moors There was a thick dense crowd all still and silent looking away from the church and the vicar who awaited the bringing of the dead They were watching the slow black line winding up the long steps resting their heavy burden here and there standing in silent groups at each landing place now lost to sight as a piece of broken overhanging ground intervened now emerging suddenly nearer and overhead the great church bell with its mediaeval inscription familiar to the vicar if to no one else who heard it I to the grave do summon all kept on its heavy booming monotone with which no other sound from land or sea near or distant intermingled except the cackle of the geese on some far away farm on the moors as they were coming home to roost and that one noise from so great a distance seemed only to deepen the stillness Then there was a little movement in the crowd a little pushing from side to side to make a path for the corpse and its bearers an aggregate of the fragments of room With bent heads and spent strength those who carried the coffin moved on behind came the poor old gardener a brown black funeral cloak thrown over his homely dress and supporting his wife with steps scarcely less feeble than her own He had come to church that afternoon with a promise to her that he would return to lead her to the funeral of her firstborn for he felt in his sore perplexed heart full of indignation and dumb anger as if he must go and hear something which should exorcize the unwonted longing for revenge that disturbed his grief and made him conscious of that great blank of consolation which faithfulness produces And for the time he was faithless How came God to permit such cruel injustice of man Permitting it He could not be good Then what was life and what was death but woe and despair The beautiful solemn words of the ritual had done him good and restored much of his faith Though he could not understand why such sorrow had befallen him any more than before he had come back to something of his childlike trust he kept saying to himself in a whisper as he mounted the weary steps It is the Lord s doing and the repetition soothed him unspeakably Behind this old couple followed their children grown men and women come from distant place or farmhouse service the servants at the vicarage and many a neighbour anxious to show their sympathy and most of the sailors from the crews of the vessels in port joined in procession and followed the dead body into the church There was too great a crowd immediately within the door for Sylvia and Molly to go in again and they accordingly betook themselves to the place where the deep grave was waiting wide and hungry to receive its dead There leaning against the headstones all around were many standing looking over the broad and placid sea and turned to the soft salt air which blew on their hot eyes and rigid faces for no one spoke of all that number They were thinking of the violent death of him over whom the solemn words were now being said in the gray old church scarcely out of their hearing had not the sound been broken by the measured lapping of the tide far beneath Suddenly every one looked round towards the path from the churchyard steps Two sailors were supporting a ghastly figure that with feeble motions was drawing near the open grave It s t specksioneer as tried to save him It s him as was left for dead the people murmured round It s Charley Kinraid as I m a sinner said Molly starting forward to greet her cousin But as he came on she saw that all his strength was needed for the mere action of walking The sailors in their strong sympathy had yielded to his earnest entreaty and carried him up the steps in order that he might see the last of his messmate They placed him near the grave resting against a stone and he was hardly there before the vicar came forth and the great crowd poured out of the church following the body to the grave Sylvia was so much wrapt up in the solemnity of the occasion that she had no thought to spare at the first moment for the pale and haggard figure opposite much less was she aware of her cousin Philip who now singling her out for the first time from among the crowd pressed to her side with an intention of companionship and protection As the service went on ill checked sobs rose from behind the two girls who were among the foremost in the crowd and by and by the cry and the wail became general Sylvia s tears rained down her face and her distress became so evident that it attracted the attention of many in that inner circle Among others who noticed it the specksioneer s hollow eyes were caught by the sight of the innocent blooming childlike face opposite to him and he wondered if she were a relation yet seeing that she bore no badge of mourning he rather concluded that she must have been a sweetheart of the dead man And now all was over the rattle of the gravel on the coffin the last long lingering look of friends and lovers the rosemary sprigs had been cast down by all who were fortunate enough to have brought them and oh how much Sylvia wished she had remembered this last act of respect and slowly the outer rim of the crowd began to slacken and disappear Now Philip spoke to Sylvia I never dreamt of seeing you here I thought my aunt always went to Kirk Moorside I came with Molly Corney said Sylvia Mother is staying at home with feyther How s his rheumatics asked Philip But at the same moment Molly took hold of Sylvia s hand and said A want t get round and speak to Charley Mother ll be main and glad to hear as he s getten out though for sure he looks as though he d ha been better in s bed Come Sylvia And Philip fain to keep with Sylvia had to follow the two girls close up to the specksioneer who was preparing for his slow laborious walk back to his lodgings He stopped on seeing his cousin Well Molly said he faintly putting out his hand but his eye passing her face to look at Sylvia in the background her tear stained face full of shy admiration of the nearest approach to a hero she had ever seen Well Charley a niver was so taken aback as when a saw yo theere like a ghost a standin agin a gravestone How white and wan yo do look Ay said he wearily wan and weak enough But I hope you re getting better sir said Sylvia in a low voice longing to speak to him and yet wondering at her own temerity Thank you my lass I m o er th worst He sighed heavily Philip now spoke We re doing him no kindness a keeping him standing here i t night fall and him so tired And he made as though he would turn away Kinraid s two sailor friends backed up Philip s words with such urgency that somehow Sylvia thought they had been to blame in speaking to him and blushed excessively with the idea Yo ll come and be nursed at Moss Brow Charley said Molly and Sylvia dropped her little maidenly curtsey and said Good by and went away wondering how Molly could talk so freely to such a hero but then to be sure he was a cousin and probably a sweetheart and that would make a great deal of difference of course Meanwhile her own cousin kept close by her side CHAPTER VII TETE A TETE THE WILL And now tell me all about th folk at home said Philip evidently preparing to walk back with the girls He generally came to Haytersbank every Sunday afternoon so Sylvia knew what she had to expect the moment she became aware of his neighbourhood in the churchyard My feyther s been sadly troubled with his rheumatics this week past but he s a vast better now thank you kindly Then addressing herself to Molly she asked Has your cousin a doctor to look after him Ay for sure said Molly quickly for though she knew nothing about the matter she was determined to suppose that her cousin had everything becoming an invalid as well as a hero He s well to do and can afford everything as he needs continued she His feyther s left him money and he were a farmer out up in Northumberland and he s reckoned such a specksioneer as never never was and gets what wage he asks for and a share on every whale he harpoons beside I reckon he ll have to make himself scarce on this coast for awhile at any rate said Philip An what for should he asked Molly who never liked Philip at the best of times and now if he was going to disparage her cousin in any way was ready to take up arms and do battle Why they do say as he fired the shot as has killed some o the men o war s men and of course if he has he ll have to stand his trial if he s caught What lies people do say exclaimed Molly He niver killed nought but whales a ll be bound or if he did it were all right and proper as he should when they were for stealing him an all t others and did kill poor Darley as we come fra seeming buried A suppose now yo re such a Quaker that if some one was to break through fra t other side o this dyke and offer for to murder Sylvia and me yo d look on wi yo r hands hanging by yo r side But t press gang had law on their side and were doing nought but what they d warrant for Th tender s gone away as if she were ashamed o what she d done said Sylvia and t flag s down fra o er the Randyvowse There ll be no more press ganging here awhile No feyther says continued Molly as they ve made t place too hot t hold em coming so strong afore people had getten used to their ways o catchin up poor lads just come fra t Greenland seas T folks ha their blood so up they d think no harm o fighting em i t streets ay and o killing em too if they were for using fire arms as t Aurora s men did Women is so fond o bloodshed said Philip for t hear you talk who d ha thought you d just come fra crying ower the grave of a man who was killed by violence I should ha thought you d seen enough of what sorrow comes o fighting Why them lads o t Aurora as they say Kinraid shot down had fathers and mothers maybe a looking out for them to come home I don t think he could ha killed them said Sylvia he looked so gentle But Molly did not like this half and half view of the case A dare say he did kill em dead he s not one to do things by halves And a think he served em reet that s what a do Is na this Hester as serves in Foster s shop asked Sylvia in a low voice as a young woman came through a stile in the stone wall by the roadside and suddenly appeared before them Yes said Philip Why Hester where have you been he asked as they drew near Hester reddened a little and then replied in her slow quiet way I ve been sitting with Betsy Darley her that is bed ridden It were lonesome for her when the others were away at the burying And she made as though she would have passed but Sylvia all her sympathies alive for the relations of the murdered man wanted to ask more questions and put her hand on Hester s arm to detain her a moment Hester suddenly drew back a little reddened still more and then replied fully and quietly to all Sylvia asked In the agricultural counties and among the class to which these four persons belonged there is little analysis of motive or comparison of characters and actions even at this present day of enlightenment Sixty or seventy years ago there was still less I do not mean that amongst thoughtful and serious people there was not much reading of such books as Mason on Self Knowledge and Law s Serious Call or that there were not the experiences of the Wesleyans that were related at class meeting for the edification of the hearers But taken as a general ride it may be said that few knew what manner of men they were compared to the numbers now who are fully conscious of their virtues qualities failings and weaknesses and who go about comparing others with themselves not in a spirit of Pharisaism and arrogance but with a vivid self consciousness that more than anything else deprives characters of freshness and originality To return to the party we left standing on the high raised footway that ran alongside of the bridle road to Haytersbank Sylvia had leisure in her heart to think how good Hester is for sitting with the poor bed ridden sister of Darley without having a pang of self depreciation in the comparison of her own conduct with that she was capable of so fully appreciating She had gone to church for the ends of vanity and remained to the funeral for curiosity and the pleasure of the excitement In this way a modern young lady would have condemned herself and therefore lost the simple purifying pleasure of admiration of another Hester passed onwards going down the hill towards the town The other three walked slowly on All were silent for a few moments then Sylvia said How good she is And Philip replied with ready warmth Yes she is no one knows how good but us who live in the same house wi her Her mother is an old Quakeress bean t she Molly inquired Alice Rose is a Friend if that is what you mean said Philip Well well some folk s so particular Is William Coulson a Quaker by which a mean a Friend Yes they re all on em right down good folk Deary me What a wonder yo can speak to such sinners as Sylvia and me after keepin company with so much goodness said Molly who had not yet forgiven Philip for doubting Kinraid s power of killing men Is na it Sylvia But Sylvia was too highly strung for banter If she had not been one of those who went to mock but remained to pray she had gone to church with the thought of the cloak that was to be uppermost in her mind and she had come down the long church stair with life and death suddenly become real to her mind the enduring sea and hills forming a contrasting background to the vanishing away of man She was full of a solemn wonder as to the abiding place of the souls of the dead and a childlike dread lest the number of the elect should be accomplished before she was included therein How people could ever be merry again after they had been at a funeral she could not imagine so she answered gravely and slightly beside the question I wonder if I was a Friend if I should be good Gi me your red cloak that s all when yo turn Quaker they ll none let thee wear scarlet so it ll be of no use t thee I think thou rt good enough as thou art said Philip tenderly at least as tenderly as he durst for he knew by experience that it did not do to alarm her girlish coyness Either one speech or the other made Sylvia silent neither was accordant to her mood of mind so perhaps both contributed to her quietness Folk say William Coulson looks sweet on Hester Rose said Molly always up in Monkshaven gossip It was in the form of an assertion but was said in the tone of a question and as such Philip replied to it Yes I think he likes her a good deal but he s so quiet I never feel sure John and Jeremiah would like the match I ve a notion And now they came to the stile which had filled Philip s eye for some minutes past though neither of the others had perceived they were so near it the stile which led to Moss Brow from the road into the fields that sloped down to Haystersbank Here they would leave Molly and now would begin the delicious tete a tete walk which Philip always tried to make as lingering as possible To day he was anxious to show his sympathy with Sylvia as far as he could read what was passing in her mind but how was he to guess the multitude of tangled thoughts in that unseen receptacle A resolution to be good if she could and always to be thinking on death so that what seemed to her now as simply impossible might come true that she might dread the grave as little as her bed a wish that Philip were not coming home with her a wonder if the specksioneer really had killed a man an idea which made her shudder yet from the awful fascination about it her imagination was compelled to dwell on the tall gaunt figure and try to recall the wan countenance a hatred and desire of revenge on the press gang so vehement that it sadly militated against her intention of trying to be good all these notions and wonders and fancies were whirling about in Sylvia s brain and at one of their promptings she spoke How many miles away is t Greenland seas I mean how long do they take to reach I don t know ten days or a fortnight or more maybe I ll ask Oh feyther ll tell me all about it He s been there many a time I say Sylvie My aunt said I were to give you lessons this winter i writing and ciphering I can begin to come up now two evenings maybe a week T shop closes early after November comes in Sylvia did not like learning and did not want him for her teacher so she answered in a dry little tone It ll use a deal o candle light mother ll not like that I can t see to spell wi out a candle close at my elbow Niver mind about candles I can bring up a candle wi me for I should be burning one at Alice Rose s So that excuse would not do Sylvia beat her brains for another Writing cramps my hand so I can t do any sewing for a day after and feyther wants his shirts very bad But Sylvia I ll teach you geography and ever such a vast o fine things about t countries on t map Is t Arctic seas down on t map she asked in a tone of greater interest Yes Arctics and tropics and equator and equinoctial line we ll take em turn and turn about we ll do writing and ciphering one night and geography t other Philip spoke with pleasure at the prospect but Sylvia relaxed into indifference I m no scholard it s like throwing away labour to teach me I m such a dunce at my book Now there s Betsy Corney third girl her as is younger than Molly she d be a credit to you There niver was such a lass for pottering ower books If Philip had had his wits about him he would have pretended to listen to this proposition of a change of pupils and then possibly Sylvia might have repented making it But he was too much mortified to be diplomatic My aunt asked me to teach you a bit not any neighbour s lass Well if I mun be taught I mun but I d rayther be whipped and ha done with it was Sylvia s ungracious reply A moment afterwards she repented of her little spirit of unkindness and thought that she should not like to die that night without making friends Sudden death was very present in her thoughts since the funeral So she instinctively chose the best method of making friends again and slipped her hand into his as he walked a little sullenly at her side She was half afraid however when she found it firmly held and that she could not draw it away again without making what she called in her own mind a fuss So hand in hand they slowly and silently came up to the door of Haytersbank Farm not unseen by Bell Robson who sate in the window seat with her Bible open upon her knee She had read her chapter aloud to herself and now she could see no longer even if she had wished to read more but she gazed out into the darkening air and a dim look of contentment came like moonshine over her face when she saw the cousins approach That s my prayer day and night said she to herself But there was no unusual aspect of gladness on her face as she lighted the candle to give them a more cheerful welcome Wheere s feyther said Sylvia looking round the room for Daniel He s been to Kirk Moorside Church for t see a bit o th world as he ca s it And sin then he s gone out to th cattle for Kester s ta en his turn of playing hissel now that father s better I ve been talking to Sylvia said Philip his head still full of his pleasant plan his hand still tingling from the touch of hers about turning schoolmaster and coming up here two nights a week for t teach her a bit o writing and ciphering And geography put in Sylvia for thought she if I m to learn them things I don t care a pin about anyhow I ll learn what I do care to know if it ll tell me about t Greenland seas and how far they re off That same evening a trio alike in many outward circumstances sate in a small neat room in a house opening out of a confined court on the hilly side of the High Street of Monkshaven a mother her only child and the young man who silently loved that daughter and was favoured by Alice Rose though not by Hester When the latter returned from her afternoon s absence she stood for a minute or two on the little flight of steep steps whitened to a snowy whiteness the aspect of the whole house partook of the same character of irreproachable cleanliness It was wedged up into a space which necessitated all sorts of odd projections and irregularities in order to obtain sufficient light for the interior and if ever the being situated in a dusky confined corner might have been made an excuse for dirt Alice Rose s house had that apology Yet the small diamond panes of glass in the casement window were kept so bright and clear that a great sweet scented leaved geranium grew and flourished though it did not flower profusely The leaves seemed to fill the air with fragrance as soon as Hester summoned up energy enough to open the door Perhaps that was because the young Quaker William Coulson was crushing one between his finger and thumb while waiting to set down Alice s next words For the old woman who looked as if many years of life remained in her yet was solemnly dictating her last will and testament It had been on her mind for many months for she had something to leave beyond the mere furniture of the house Something a few pounds in the hands of John and Jeremiah Foster her cousins and it was they who had suggested the duty on which she was engaged She had asked William Coulson to write down her wishes and he had consented though with some fear and trepidation for he had an idea that he was infringing on a lawyer s prerogative and that for aught he knew he might be prosecuted for making a will without a licence just as a man might be punished for selling wine and spirits without going through the preliminary legal forms that give permission for such a sale But to his suggestion that Alice should employ a lawyer she had replied That would cost me five pounds sterling and thee canst do it as well if thee ll but attend to my words So he had bought at her desire a black edged sheet of fine wove paper and a couple of good pens on the previous Saturday and while waiting for her to begin her dictation and full serious thought himself he had almost unconsciously made the grand flourish at the top of the paper which he had learnt at school and which was there called a spread eagle What art thee doing there asked Alice suddenly alive to his proceedings Without a word he showed her his handiwork It s a vanity said she and t may make t will not stand Folk may think I were na in my right mind if they see such fly legs and cob webs a top Write This is my doing William Coulson and none of Alice Rose s she being in her sound mind I don t think it s needed said William Nevertheless he wrote down the words Hast thee put that I m in my sound mind and seven senses Then make the sign of the Trinity and write In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost Is that the right way o beginning a will said Coulson a little startled My father and my father s father and my husband had it a top of theirs and I m noane going for to cease fra following after them for they were godly men though my husband were o t episcopal persuasion It s done said William Hast thee dated it asked Alice Nay Then date it third day ninth month Now art ready Coulson nodded I Alice Rose do leave my furniture that is my bed and chest o drawers for thy bed and things is thine and not mine and settle and saucepans and dresser and table and kettle and all the rest of my furniture to my lawful and only daughter Hester Rose I think that s safe for her to have all is t not William I think so too said he writing on all the time And thee shalt have t roller and paste board because thee s so fond o puddings and cakes It ll serve thy wife after I m gone and I trust she ll boil her paste long enough for that s been t secret o mine and thee ll noane be so easy t please I din t reckon on marriage said William Thee ll marry said Alice Thee likes to have thy victuals hot and comfortable and there s noane many but a wife as ll look after that for t please thee I know who could please me sighed forth William but I can t please her Alice looked sharply at him from over her spectacles which she had put on the better to think about the disposal of her property Thee art thinking on our Hester said she plainly out He started a little but looked up at her and met her eyes Hester cares noane for me said he dejectedly Bide a while my lad said Alice kindly Young women don t always know their own minds Thee and her would make a marriage after my own heart and the Lord has been very good to me hitherto and I think He ll bring it t pass But don t thee let on as thee cares for her so much I sometimes think she wearies o thy looks and thy ways Show up thy manly heart and make as though thee had much else to think on and no leisure for to dawdle after her and she ll think a deal more on thee And now mend thy pen for a fresh start I give and bequeath did thee put give and bequeath at th beginning Nay said William looking back Thee didst not tell me give and bequeath Then it won t be legal and my bit o furniture ll be taken to London and put into chancery and Hester will have noane on it I can write it over said William Well write it clear then and put a line under it to show those are my special words Hast thee done it Then now start afresh I give and bequeath my book o sermons as is bound in good calfskin and lies on the third shelf o corner cupboard at the right hand o t fire place to Philip Hepburn for I reckon he s as fond o reading sermons as thee art o light well boiled paste and I d be glad for each on ye to have somewhat ye like for to remember me by Is that down There now for my cousins John and Jeremiah They are rich i world s gear but they ll prize what I leave em if I could only onbethink me what they would like Hearken Is na that our Hester s step Put it away quick I m noane for grieving her wi telling her what I ve been about We ll take a turn at t will next First Day it will serve us for several Sabbaths to come and maybe I can think on something as will suit cousin John and cousin Jeremiah afore then Hester as was mentioned paused a minute or two before lifting the latch of the door When she entered there was no unusual sign of writing about only Will Coulson looking very red and crushing and smelling at the geranium leaf Hester came in briskly with the little stock of enforced cheerfulness she had stopped at the door to acquire But it faded away along with the faint flush of colour in her cheeks and the mother s quick eye immediately noted the wan heavy look of care I have kept t pot in t oven it ll have a most got a t goodness out of t tea by now for it ll be an hour since I made it Poor lass thou look saint as if thou needed a good cup o tea It were dree work sitting wi Betsy Darley were it And how does she look on her affliction She takes it sore to heart said Hester taking off her hat and folding and smoothing away her cloak before putting them in the great oak chest or ark as it was called in which they were laid from Sunday to Sunday As she opened the lid a sweet scent of dried lavender and rose leaves came out William stepped hastily forwards to hold up the heavy lid for her She lifted up her head looked at him full with her serene eyes and thanked him for his little service Then she took a creepie stool and sate down on the side of the fire place having her back to the window The hearth was of the same spotless whiteness as the steps all that was black about the grate was polished to the utmost extent all that was of brass like the handle of the oven was burnished bright Her mother placed the little black earthenware teapot in which the tea had been stewing on the table where cups and saucers were already set for four and a large plate of bread and butter cut Then they sate round the table bowed their heads and kept silence for a minute or two When this grace was ended and they were about to begin Alice said as if without premeditation but in reality with a keen shrinking of heart out of sympathy with her child Philip would have been in to his tea by now I reckon if he d been coming William looked up suddenly at Hester her mother carefully turned her head another way But she answered quite quietly He ll be gone to his aunt s at Haytersbank I met him at t top o t Brow with his cousin and Molly Corney He s a deal there said William Yes said Hester It s likely him and his aunt come from Carlisle way and must needs cling together in these strange parts I saw him at the burying of yon Darley said William It were a vast o people went past th entry end said Alice It were a most like election time I were just come back fra meeting when they were all going up th church steps I met yon sailor as they say used violence and did murder he looked like a ghost though whether it were his bodily wounds or the sense of his sins stirring within him it s not for me to say And by t time I was back here and settled to my Bible t folk were returning and it were tramp tramp past th entry end for better nor a quarter of an hour They say Kinraid has getten slugs and gun shot in his side said Hester He s niver one Charley Kinraid for sure as I knowed at Newcastle said William Coulson roused to sudden and energetic curiosity I don t know replied Hester they call him just Kinraid and Betsy Darley says he s t most daring specksioneer of all that go off this coast to t Greenland seas But he s been in Newcastle for I mind me she said her poor brother met with him there How didst thee come to know him inquired Alice I cannot abide him if it is Charley said William He kept company with my poor sister as is dead for better nor two year and then he left off coming to see her and went wi another girl and it just broke her heart He don t look now as if he iver could play at that game again said Alice he has had a warning fra the Lord Whether it be a call no one can tell But to my eyne he looks as if he had been called and was going Then he ll meet my sister said William solemnly and I hope the Lord will make it clear to him then how he killed her as sure as he shot down yon sailors an if there s a gnashing o teeth for murder i that other place I reckon he ll have his share on t He s a bad man yon Betsy said he were such a friend to her brother as niver was and he s sent her word and promised to go and see her first place he goes out to But William only shook his head and repeated his last words He s a bad man he is When Philip came home that Sunday night he found only Alice up to receive him The usual bedtime in the household was nine o clock and it was but ten minutes past the hour but Alice looked displeased and stern Thee art late lad said she shortly I m sorry it s a long way from my uncle s and I think clocks are different said he taking out his watch to compare it with the round moon s face that told the time to Alice I know nought about thy uncle s but thee art late Take thy candle and begone If Alice made any reply to Philip s good night he did not hear it CHAPTER VIII ATTRACTION AND REPULSION A fortnight had passed over and winter was advancing with rapid strides In bleak northern farmsteads there was much to be done before November weather should make the roads too heavy for half fed horses to pull carts through There was the turf pared up on the distant moors and left out to dry to be carried home and stacked the brown fern was to be stored up for winter bedding for the cattle for straw was scarce and dear in those parts even for thatching heather or rather ling was used Then there was meat to salt while it could be had for in default of turnips and mangold wurzel there was a great slaughtering of barren cows as soon as the summer herbage failed and good housewives stored up their Christmas piece of beef in pickle before Martinmas was over Corn was to be ground while yet it could be carried to the distant mill the great racks for oat cake that swung at the top of the kitchen had to be filled 
4910-14124-0000	train-other-500	And last of all came the pig killing
none	none	 when the second frost set in 
4910-14124-0001	train-other-500	For up in the north there is an idea that the ice stored in the first frost will melt and the meat cured then taint the first frost is good for nothing but to be thrown away as they express it There came a breathing time after this last event
none	none	 The house had had its last autumn cleaning and was neat and bright from top to bottom 
4910-14124-0002	train-other-500	from one end to another The turf was led the coal carted up from Monkshaven the wood stored the corn ground the pig killed
none	none	 and the hams and head and hands lying in salt 
4910-14124-0003	train-other-500	The butcher had been glad to take the best parts of a pig of Dame Robson s careful feeding but there was unusual plenty in the Haytersbank pantry and as Bell surveyed it one morning she said to her husband
4910-14124-0004	train-other-500	I wonder if yon poor sick chap at Moss Brow would fancy some o my sausages They re something to crack on
none	none	 for they are made fra an old Cumberland receipt as is not known i Yorkshire yet Thou s allays so set upo Cumberland ways said her husband not displeased with the suggestion however 
4910-14124-0005	train-other-500	Still when folk s sick they han their fancies and maybe Kinraid ll be glad o thy sausages
none	none	 I ha known sick folk tak t eating snails 
4910-14124-0006	train-other-500	This was not complimentary perhaps But Daniel went on to say that he did not mind if he stepped over with the sausages himself when it was too late to do anything else
none	none	 Sylvia longed to offer to accompany her father 
4910-14124-0007	train-other-500	but somehow she did not like to propose it Towards dusk she came to her mother to ask for the key of the great bureau that stood in the house place as a state piece of furniture although its use was to contain the family s best wearing apparel and stores of linen
none	none	 such as might be supposed to be more needed upstairs What for do yo want my keys asked Bell 
4910-14124-0008	train-other-500	Only just to get out one of t damask napkins The best napkins as my mother span Yes said Sylvia her colour heightening
none	none	 I thought as how it would set off t sausages A 
4910-14124-0009	train-other-500	good clean homespun cloth will serve them better said Bell wondering in her own mind what was come over the girl
none	none	 to be thinking of setting off sausages that were to be eaten not to be looked at like a picture book She might have wondered still more if she had seen Sylvia steal round to the little flower border she had persuaded Kester to make under the wall at the sunny side of the house 
4910-14124-0010	train-other-500	and gather the two or three Michaelmas daisies and the one bud of the China rose that growing against the kitchen chimney had escaped the frost and then when her mother was not looking
none	none	 softly open the cloth inside of the little basket that contained the sausages and a fresh egg or two 
4910-14124-0011	train-other-500	and lay her autumn blossoms in one of the folds of the towel After Daniel now pretty clear of his rheumatism had had his afternoon meal tea was a Sunday treat he prepared to set out on his walk to Moss Brow but as he was taking his stick
4910-14124-0012	train-other-500	he caught the look on Sylvia s face and unconsciously interpreted its dumb wistfulness Missus said he
none	none	 t wench has nought more t do has she 
4910-14124-0013	train-other-500	She may as well put on her cloak and step down wi me and see Molly a bit
none	none	 she ll be company like Bell considered There s t yarn for thy stockings as is yet to spin but she can go for I ll do a bit at t mysel and there s nought else agate 
4910-14124-0014	train-other-500	Put on thy things in a jiffy then and let s be off said Daniel And Sylvia did not need another word Down she came in a twinkling dressed in her new red cloak and hood her face peeping out of the folds of the latter bright and blushing
none	none	 Thou should saint na ha put on thy new cloak for a night walk to Moss Brow said Bell shaking her head 
4910-14124-0015	train-other-500	Shall I go take it off and put on my shawl asked Sylvia a little dolefully Na na come along
none	none	 a m noane goin for t wait o women s chops and changes Come along 
4910-14124-0016	train-other-500	come Lassie this last to his dog So Sylvia set off with a dancing heart and a dancing step
none	none	 that had to be restrained to the sober gait her father chose 
4910-14124-0017	train-other-500	The sky above was bright and clear with the light of a thousand stars
none	none	 the grass was crisping under their feet with the coming hoar frost and as they mounted to the higher ground they could see the dark sea stretching away far below them 
4910-14124-0018	train-other-500	The night was very still though now and then crisp sounds in the distant air sounded very near in the silence Sylvia carried the basket and looked like little Red Riding Hood
none	none	 Her father had nothing to say and did not care to make himself agreeable 
4910-14124-0019	train-other-500	but Sylvia enjoyed her own thoughts and any conversation would have been a disturbance to her The long monotonous roll of the distant waves as the tide bore them in the multitudinous rush at last and then the retreating rattle and trickle
none	none	 as the baffled waters fell back over the shingle that skirted the sands and divided them from the cliffs 
4910-14124-0020	train-other-500	her father s measured tread and slow even movement Lassie s pattering all lulled Sylvia into a reverie of which she could not have given herself any definite account
none	none	 But at length they arrived at Moss Brow and with a sudden sigh she quitted the subjects of her dreamy meditations 
4910-14124-0021	train-other-500	and followed her father into the great house place It had a more comfortable aspect by night than by day The fire was always kept up to a wasteful size and the dancing blaze and the partial light of candles left much in shadow
4910-14124-0022	train-other-500	that was best ignored in such a disorderly family But there was always a warm welcome to friends however roughly given
none	none	 and after the words of this were spoken 
4910-14124-0023	train-other-500	the next rose up equally naturally in the mind of missus Corney And what will ye tak
none	none	 Eh but t measter ll be fine and vexed at your comin when he s away He s off to Horncastle t sell some colts and he ll not be back till to morrow s neet 
4910-14124-0024	train-other-500	But here s Charley Kinraid as we ve getten to nurse up a bit
none	none	 and t lads ll be back fra Monkshaven in a crack o no time 
4910-14124-0025	train-other-500	All this was addressed to Daniel to whom she knew that none but masculine company would be acceptable Amongst uneducated people
none	none	 whose range of subjects and interest do not extend beyond their daily life it is natural that when the first blush and hurry of youth is over 
4910-14124-0026	train-other-500	there should be no great pleasure in the conversation of the other sex Men have plenty to say to men which in their estimation
none	none	 gained from tradition and experience women cannot understand and farmers of a much later date than the one of which I am writing would have contemptuously considered it as a loss of time to talk to women 
4910-14124-0027	train-other-500	indeed they were often more communicative to the sheep dog that accompanied them through all the day s work and frequently became a sort of dumb confidant
none	none	 Farmer Robson s Lassie now lay down at her master s feet 
4910-14124-0028	train-other-500	placed her nose between her paws and watched with attentive eyes the preparations going on for refreshments preparations which to the disappointment of her canine heart consisted entirely of tumblers and sugar Where s t wench said Robson
none	none	 after he had shaken hands with Kinraid and spoken a few words to him and to missus Corney 
4910-14124-0029	train-other-500	She s getten a basket wi sausages in em as my missus has made and she s a rare hand at sausages
none	none	 there s noane like her in a t three Ridings I ll be bound 
4910-14124-0030	train-other-500	For Daniel could praise his wife s powers in her absence though he did not often express himself in an appreciative manner when she was by to hear
none	none	 But Sylvia s quick sense caught up the manner in which missus Corney would apply the way in which her mother s housewifery had been exalted and stepping forwards out of the shadow she said Mother thought maybe you hadn t killed a pig yet and sausages is always a bit savoury for any one who is na well and 
4910-14124-0031	train-other-500	She might have gone on but that she caught Kinraid s eyes looking at her with kindly admiration
none	none	 She stopped speaking and missus Corney took up the word As for sausages I ha niver had a chance this year 
4910-14124-0032	train-other-500	else I stand again any one for t making of em
none	none	 Yorkshire hams s a vast thought on and I ll niver let another county woman say as she can make better sausages nor me But as I m saying I d niver a chance for our pig 
4910-14124-0033	train-other-500	as I were sa fond on and fed mysel and as would ha been fourteen stone by now if he were an ounce and as knew me as well as any Christian and a pig as I may say that I just idolized went and took a fit a week after Michaelmas Day and died as if it had been to spite me
none	none	 and t next is na ready for killing nor wunnot be this six week So I m much beholden to your missus and so s Charley I m sure though he s ta en a turn to betterin sin he came out here to be nursed I m a deal better said Kinraid a most ready for t press gang to give chase to again 
4910-14124-0034	train-other-500	But folk say they re gone off this coast for one while added Daniel
none	none	 They re gone down towards Hull as I ve been told said Kinraid 
4910-14124-0035	train-other-500	But they re a deep set they ll be here before we know where we are some of these days
none	none	 See thee here said Daniel exhibiting his maimed hand a reckon a served em out time o t Ameriky war 
4910-14124-0036	train-other-500	And he began the story Sylvia knew so well for her father never made a new acquaintance but what he told him of his self mutilation to escape the press gang It had been done as he would himself have owned to spite himself as well as them
none	none	 for it had obliged him to leave a sea life 
4910-14124-0037	train-other-500	to which in comparison all life spent on shore was worse than nothing for dulness
none	none	 For Robson had never reached that rank aboard ship which made his being unable to run up the rigging or to throw a harpoon or to fire off a gun of no great consequence so he had to be thankful that an opportune legacy enabled him to turn farmer 
4910-14124-0038	train-other-500	a great degradation in his opinion But his blood warmed as he told the specksioneer
none	none	 towards a sailor and he pressed Kinraid to beguile the time when he was compelled to be ashore by coming over to see him at Haytersbank whenever he felt inclined 
4910-14124-0039	train-other-500	Sylvia appearing to listen to Molly s confidences was hearkening in reality to all this conversation between her father and the specksioneer and at this invitation she became especially attentive Kinraid replied I m much obliged to ye I m sure
none	none	 maybe I can come and spend an ev ning wi you but as soon as I m got round a bit I must go see my own people as live at Cullercoats near Newcastle upo Tyne 
4910-14124-0040	train-other-500	Well well said Daniel rising to take leave with unusual prudence as to the amount of his drink
none	none	 Thou lieutenant see thou lieutenant see 
4910-14124-0041	train-other-500	I shall be main glad to see thee if thou lieutenant come But I ve na lads to keep thee company only one sprig of a wench Sylvia come here an let s show thee to this young fellow Sylvia came forwards ruddy as any rose
4910-14124-0042	train-other-500	and in a moment Kinraid recognized her as the pretty little girl he had seen crying so bitterly over Darley s grave He rose up out of true sailor s gallantry as she shyly approached and stood by her father s side scarcely daring to lift her great soft eyes to have one fair gaze at his face
none	none	 He had to support himself by one hand rested on the dresser but she saw he was looking far better younger less haggard than he had seemed to her before His face was short and expressive 
4910-14124-0043	train-other-500	his complexion had been weatherbeaten and bronzed though now he looked so pale his eyes and hair were dark
none	none	 the former quick deep set and penetrating the latter curly and almost in ringlets His teeth gleamed white as he smiled at her a pleasant friendly smile of recognition but she only blushed the deeper and hung her head I ll come sir and be thankful I daresay a turn ll do me good if the weather holds up an th frost keeps on That s right my lad said Robson shaking him by the hand and then Kinraid s hand was held out to Sylvia and she could not avoid the same friendly action Molly Corney followed her to the door and when they were fairly outside she held Sylvia back for an instant to say Is na he a fine likely man I m so glad as yo ve seen him for he s to be off next week to Newcastle and that neighbourhood But he said he d come to us some night asked Sylvia half in a fright Ay I ll see as he does never fear For I should like yo for to know him a bit He s a rare talker I ll mind him o coming to yo Somehow Sylvia felt as if this repeated promise of reminding Kinraid of his promise to come and see her father took away part of the pleasure she had anticipated from his visit Yet what could be more natural than that Molly Corney should wish her friend to be acquainted with the man whom Sylvia believed to be all but Molly s engaged lover Pondering these thoughts the walk home was as silent as that going to Moss Brow had been The only change seemed to be that now they faced the brilliant northern lights flashing up the sky and that either this appearance or some of the whaling narrations of Kinraid had stirred up Daniel Robson s recollections of a sea ditty which he kept singing to himself in a low unmusical voice the burden of which was for I loves the tossin say Bell met them at the door Well and here ye are at home again and Philip has been Sylvie to give thee thy ciphering lesson and he stayed awhile thinking thou d be coming back I m very sorry said Sylvia more out of deference to her mother s tone of annoyance than because she herself cared either for her lesson or her cousin s disappointment He ll come again to morrow night he says But thou must take care and mind the nights he says he ll come for it s a long way to come for nought Sylvia might have repeated her I m very sorry at this announcement of Philip s intentions but she restrained herself inwardly and fervently hoping that Molly would not urge the fulfilment of the specksioneer s promise for to morrow night for Philip s being there would spoil all and besides if she sate at the dresser at her lesson and Kinraid at the table with her father he might hear all and find out what a dunce she was She need not have been afraid With the next night Hepburn came and Kinraid did not After a few words to her mother Philip produced the candles he had promised and some books and a quill or two What for hast thou brought candles asked Bell in a half affronted tone Hepburn smiled Sylvia thought it would take a deal of candlelight and was for making it into a reason not to learn I should ha used t candles if I d stayed at home so I just brought them wi me Then thou may saint just take them back again said Bell shortly blowing out that which he had lighted and placing one of her own on the dresser instead Sylvia caught her mother s look of displeasure and it made her docile for the evening although she owed her cousin a grudge for her enforced good behaviour Now Sylvia here s a copy book wi t Tower o London on it and we ll fill it wi as pretty writing as any in t North Riding Sylvia sate quite still unenlivened by this prospect Here s a pen as ll nearly write of itsel continued Philip still trying to coax her out her sullenness of manner Then he arranged her in the right position Don t lay your head down on your left arm you ll ne er see to write straight The attitude was changed but not a word was spoken Philip began to grow angry at such determined dumbness Are you tired asked he with a strange mixture of crossness and tenderness Yes very was her reply But thou ought saint not to be tired said Bell who had not yet got over the offence to her hospitality who moreover liked her nephew and had to boot a great respect for the learning she had never acquired Mother said Sylvia bursting out what s the use on my writing Abednego Abednego Abednego all down a page If I could see t use on t I d ha axed father to send me t school but I m none wanting to have learning It s a fine thing tho is learning My mother and my grandmother had it but th family came down i the world and Philip s mother and me we had none of it but I ha set my heart on thy having it child My fingers is stiff pleaded Sylvia holding up her little hand and shaking it Let us take a turn at spelling then said Philip What s t use on t asked captious Sylvia Why it helps one i reading an writing And what does reading and writing do for one Her mother gave her another of the severe looks that quiet woman as she was she could occasionally bestow upon the refractory and Sylvia took her book and glanced down the column Philip pointed out to her but as she justly considered one man might point out the task but twenty could not make her learn it if she did not choose and she sat herself down on the edge of the dresser and idly gazed into the fire But her mother came round to look for something in the drawers of the dresser and as she passed her daughter she said in a low voice Sylvie be a good lass I set a deal o store by learning and father ud never send thee to school as has stuck by me sore If Philip sitting with his back to them heard these words he was discreet enough not to show that he heard And he had his reward for in a very short time Sylvia stood before him with her book in her hand prepared to say her spelling At which he also stood up by instinct and listened to her slow succeeding letters helping her out when she looked up at him with a sweet childlike perplexity in her face for a dunce as to book learning poor Sylvia was and was likely to remain and in spite of his assumed office of schoolmaster Philip Hepburn could almost have echoed the words of the lover of Jess MacFarlane I sent my love a letter But alas she canna read And I lo e her a the better Still he knew his aunt s strong wish on the subject and it was very delightful to stand in the relation of teacher to so dear and pretty if so wilful a pupil Perhaps it was not very flattering to notice Sylvia s great joy when her lessons were over sadly shortened as they were by Philip s desire not to be too hard upon her Sylvia danced round to her mother bent her head back and kissed her face and then said defyingly to Philip If iver I write thee a letter it shall just be full of nothing but Abednego Abednego Abednego But at this moment her father came in from a distant expedition on the moors with Kester to look after the sheep he had pasturing there before the winter set fairly in He was tired and so was Lassie and so too was Kester who lifting his heavy legs one after the other and smoothing down his hair followed his master into the house place and seating himself on a bench at the farther end of the dresser patiently awaited the supper of porridge and milk which he shared with his master Sylvia meanwhile coaxed Lassie poor footsore dog to her side and gave her some food which the creature was almost too tired to eat Philip made as though he would be going but Daniel motioned to him to be quiet Sit thee down lad As soon as I ve had my victual I want t hear a bit o news Sylvia took her sewing and sat at the little round table by her mother sharing the light of the scanty dip candle No one spoke Every one was absorbed in what they were doing What Philip was doing was gazing at Sylvia learning her face off by heart When every scrap of porridge was cleared out of the mighty bowl Kester yawned and wishing good night withdrew to his loft over the cow house Then Philip pulled out the weekly York paper and began to read the latest accounts of the war then raging This was giving Daniel one of his greatest pleasures for though he could read pretty well yet the double effort of reading and understanding what he read was almost too much for him He could read or he could understand what was read aloud to him reading was no pleasure but listening was Besides he had a true John Bullish interest in the war without very well knowing what the English were fighting for But in those days so long as they fought the French for any cause or for no cause at all every true patriot was satisfied Sylvia and her mother did not care for any such far extended interest a little bit of York news the stealing of a few apples out of a Scarborough garden that they knew was of far more interest to them than all the battles of Nelson and the North Philip read in a high pitched and unnatural tone of voice which deprived the words of their reality for even familiar expressions can become unfamiliar and convey no ideas if the utterance is forced or affected Philip was somewhat of a pedant yet there was a simplicity in his pedantry not always to be met with in those who are self taught and which might have interested any one who cared to know with what labour and difficulty he had acquired the knowledge which now he prized so highly reading out Latin quotations as easily as if they were English and taking a pleasure in rolling polysyllables until all at once looking askance at Sylvia he saw that her head had fallen back her pretty rosy lips open her eyes fast shut in short she was asleep Ay said Farmer Robson and t reading has a most sent me off Mother d look angry now if I was to tell yo yo had a right to a kiss but when I was a young man I d ha kissed a pretty girl as I saw asleep afore yo d said Jack Robson Philip trembled at these words and looked at his aunt She gave him no encouragement standing up and making as though she had never heard her husband s speech by extending her hand and wishing him good night At the noise of the chairs moving over the flag floor Sylvia started up confused and annoyed at her father s laughter Ay lass it s iver a good time t fall asleep when a young fellow is by Here s Philip here as thou rt bound t give a pair o gloves to Sylvia went like fire she turned to her mother to read her face It s only father s joke lass said she Philip knows manners too well He d better said Sylvia flaming round at him If he d a touched me I d niver ha spoken to him no more And she looked even as it was as if she was far from forgiving him Hoots lass wenches are brought up sa mim now a days i my time they d ha thought na such great harm of a kiss Good night Philip said Bell Robson thinking the conversation unseemly Good night aunt good night Sylvie But Sylvia turned her back on him and he could hardly say good night to Daniel who had caused such an unpleasant end to an evening that had at one time been going on so well CHAPTER IX THE SPECKSIONEER A few days after Farmer Robson left Haytersbank betimes on a longish day s journey to purchase a horse Sylvia and her mother were busied with a hundred household things and the early winter s evening closed in upon them almost before they were aware The consequences of darkness in the country even now are to gather the members of a family together into one room and to make them settle to some sedentary employment and it was much more the case at the period of my story when candles were far dearer than they are at present and when one was often made to suffice for a large family The mother and daughter hardly spoke at all when they sat down at last 
4910-14125-0000	train-other-500	The cheerful click of the knitting needles made a pleasant home sound and in the occasional snatches of slumber that overcame her mother Sylvia could hear the long rushing boom of the waves down below the rocks for the Haytersbank gulley allowed the sullen roar to come up so far inland
4910-14125-0001	train-other-500	It might have been about eight o clock though from the monotonous course of the evening it seemed much later
none	none	 when Sylvia heard her father s heavy step cranching down the pebbly path 
4910-14125-0002	train-other-500	More unusual she heard his voice talking to some companion Curious to see who it could be with a lively instinctive advance towards any event which might break the monotony she had begun to find somewhat dull she sprang up to open the door
4910-14125-0003	train-other-500	Half a glance into the gray darkness outside made her suddenly timid and she drew back behind the door as she opened it wide to admit her father and Kinraid Daniel Robson came in bright and boisterous He was pleased with his purchase and had had some drink to celebrate his bargain
none	none	 He had ridden the new mare into Monkshaven and left her at the smithy there until morning to have her feet looked at and to be new shod On his way from the town he had met Kinraid wandering about in search of Haytersbank Farm itself so he had just brought him along with him 
4910-14125-0004	train-other-500	and here they were ready for bread and cheese and aught else the mistress would set before them
none	none	 To Sylvia the sudden change into brightness and bustle occasioned by the entrance of her father and the specksioneer was like that which you may effect any winter s night when you come into a room where a great lump of coal lies hot and slumbering on the fire 
4910-14125-0005	train-other-500	just break it up with a judicious blow from the poker and the room late so dark and dusk and lone is full of life and light and warmth She moved about with pretty household briskness attending to all her father s wants
none	none	 Kinraid s eye watched her as she went backwards and forwards to and fro into the pantry the back kitchen out of light into shade out of the shadow into the broad firelight where he could see and note her appearance 
4910-14125-0006	train-other-500	She wore the high crowned linen cap of that day surmounting her lovely masses of golden brown hair rather than concealing them and tied firm to her head by a broad blue ribbon A
none	none	 long curl hung down on each side of her neck her throat rather for her neck was concealed by a little spotted handkerchief 
4910-14125-0007	train-other-500	carefully pinned across at the waist of her brown stuff gown How well it was thought the young girl that she had doffed her bed gown and linsey woolsey petticoat her working dress and made herself smart in her stuff gown when she sate down to work with her mother
4910-14125-0008	train-other-500	By the time she could sit down again her father and Kinraid had their glasses filled and were talking of the relative merits of various kinds of spirits that led on to tales of smuggling and the different contrivances by which they or their friends had eluded the preventive service
4910-14125-0009	train-other-500	the nightly relays of men to carry the goods inland
none	none	 the kegs of brandy found by certain farmers whose horses had gone so far in the night that they could do no work the next day 
4910-14125-0010	train-other-500	the clever way in which certain women managed to bring in prohibited goods
none	none	 in fact that when a woman did give her mind to smuggling she was more full of resources and tricks and impudence and energy than any man 
4910-14125-0011	train-other-500	There was no question of the morality of the affair one of the greatest signs of the real progress we have made since those times seems to be that our daily concerns of buying and selling eating and drinking whatsoever we do are more tested by the real practical standard of our religion than they were in the days of our grandfathers
none	none	 Neither Sylvia nor her mother was in advance of their age Both listened with admiration to the ingenious devices and acted as well as spoken lies that were talked about as fine and spirited things Yet if Sylvia had attempted one tithe of this deceit in her every day life it would have half broken her mother s heart But when the duty on salt was strictly and cruelly enforced making it penal to pick up rough dirty lumps containing small quantities that might be thrown out with the ashes of the brine houses on the high roads when the price of this necessary was so increased by the tax upon it 
4910-14125-0012	train-other-500	as to make it an expensive sometimes an unattainable luxury to the working man Government did more to demoralise the popular sense of rectitude and uprightness than heaps of sermons could undo
none	none	 And the same though in smaller measure was the consequence of many other taxes It may seem curious to trace up the popular standard of truth to taxation but I do not think the idea would be so very far fetched From smuggling adventures it was easy to pass on to stories of what had happened to Robson in his youth a sailor in the Greenland seas and to Kinraid now one of the best harpooners in any whaler that sailed off the coast There s three things to be afeared on said Robson authoritatively 
4910-14125-0013	train-other-500	there s t ice that s bad there s dirty weather that s worse
none	none	 and there s whales theirselves as is t worst of all leastways they was i my days t darned brutes may ha larnt better manners sin When I were young they could niver be got to let theirsels be harpooned wi out flounderin and makin play wi their tales and their fins till t say were all in a foam and t boats crews was all o er wi spray which i them latitudes is a kind o shower bath not needed Th whales hasn t mended their manners as you call it said Kinraid but th ice is not to be spoken lightly on I were once in th ship 
4910-14125-0014	train-other-500	John of Hull and we were in good green water and were keen after whales and ne er thought harm of a great gray iceberg as were on our lee bow a mile or so off it looked as if it had been there from the days of Adam
none	none	 and were likely to see th last man out and it ne er a bit bigger nor smaller in all them thousands and thousands o years 
4910-14125-0015	train-other-500	Well the fast boats were out after a fish
none	none	 and I were specksioneer in one and we were so keen after capturing our whale that none on us ever saw that we were drifting away from them right into deep shadow o th iceberg But we were set upon our whale and I harpooned it and as soon as it were dead we lashed its fins together and fastened its tail to our boat and then we took breath and looked about us and away from us a little space were th other boats wi two other fish making play and as likely as not to break loose for I may say as I were th best harpooner on board the John 
4910-14125-0016	train-other-500	wi out saying great things o mysel So I says
none	none	 My lads one o you stay i th boat by this fish the fins o which as I said I d reeved a rope through mysel 
4910-14125-0017	train-other-500	and which was as dead as Noah s grandfather
none	none	 and th rest on us shall go off and help th other boats wi their fish For you see we had another boat close by in order to sweep th fish I suppose they swept fish i your time master Ay ay said Robson 
4910-14125-0018	train-other-500	one boat lies still holding t end o t line
none	none	 t other makes a circuit round t fish 
4910-14125-0019	train-other-500	Well luckily for us we had our second boat
none	none	 for we all got into it ne er a man on us was left i th fast boat 
4910-14125-0020	train-other-500	And says I But who s to stay by t dead fish And no man answered
none	none	 for they were all as keen as me for to go and help our mates and we thought as we could come back to our dead fish as had a boat for a buoy once we had helped our mates So off we rowed every man Jack on us out o the black shadow o th iceberg as looked as steady as th pole star Well we had na been a dozen fathoms away fra th boat as we had left when crash down wi a roaring noise and then a gulp of the deep waters and then a shower o blinding spray 
4910-14125-0021	train-other-500	and when we had wiped our eyes clear and getten our hearts down agen fra our mouths there were never a boat nor a glittering belly o e er a great whale to be seen
none	none	 but th iceberg were there still and grim as if a hundred ton or more had fallen off all in a mass and crushed down boat and fish and all into th deep water as goes half through the earth in them latitudes Th coal miners round about Newcastle way may come upon our good boat if they mine deep enough 
4910-14125-0022	train-other-500	else ne er another man will see her And I left as good a clasp knife in her as ever I clapt eyes on But what a mercy no man stayed in her said Bell Why mistress I reckon we a must die some way
none	none	 and I d as soon go down into the deep waters as be choked up wi moulds 
4910-14125-0023	train-other-500	But it must be so cold said Sylvia
none	none	 shuddering and giving a little poke to the fire to warm her fancy 
4910-14125-0024	train-other-500	Cold said her father what do ye stay at homes know about cold a should like to know
none	none	 If yo d been where a were once north latitude eighty one in such a frost as ye ha niver known no not i deep winter and it were June i them seas and a whale i sight and a were off in a boat after her an t ill mannered brute as soon as she were harpooned ups wi her big awkward tail and struck t boat i her stern and chucks me out into t watter 
4910-14125-0026	train-other-500	That were cold a can tell the First I smarted all ower me as if my skin were suddenly stript off me and next
none	none	 ivery bone i my body had getten t toothache and there were a great roar i my ears an a great dizziness i my eyes 
4910-14125-0027	train-other-500	an t boat s crew kept throwin out their oars an a kept clutchin at em but a could na make out where they was
none	none	 my eyes dazzled so wi t cold 
4910-14125-0028	train-other-500	an I thought I were bound for kingdom come
none	none	 an a tried to remember t Creed as a might die a Christian But all a could think on was What is your name M or N an 
4910-14125-0029	train-other-500	just as a were giving up both words and life they heaved me aboard
none	none	 But bless ye they had but one oar for they d thrown a t others after me so yo may reckon it were some time afore we could reach t ship an a ve heerd tell 
4910-14125-0030	train-other-500	a were a precious sight to look on for my clothes was just hard frozen to me an my hair a most as big a lump o ice as yon iceberg he was a telling us on they rubbed me as missus theere were rubbing t hams yesterday and gav me brandy an a ve niver getten t frost out o my bones for a their rubbin
none	none	 and a deal o brandy as I ave ta en sin Talk o cold it s little yo women known o cold But there s heat too i some places said Kinraid I was once a voyage i an American They goes for th most part south to where you come round to t cold again 
4910-14125-0032	train-other-500	and they ll stay there for three year at a time if need be
none	none	 going into winter harbour i some o th Pacific Islands Well we were i th southern seas a seeking for good whaling ground 
4910-14125-0033	train-other-500	and close on our larboard beam
none	none	 there were a great wall o ice as much as sixty feet high 
4910-14125-0034	train-other-500	And says our captain as were a dare devil if ever a man were
none	none	 There ll be an opening in yon dark gray wall and into that opening I ll sail if I coast along it till th day o judgment But for all our sailing we never seemed to come nearer to th opening The waters were rocking beneath us and the sky were steady above us and th ice rose out o the waters and seemed to reach up into the sky 
4910-14125-0035	train-other-500	We sailed on and we sailed on for more days nor I could count
none	none	 Our captain were a strange wild man but once he looked a little pale when he came upo deck after his turn in and saw the green gray ice going straight up on our beam Many on us thought as the ship were bewitched for th captain s words and we got to speak low and to say our prayers o nights and a kind o dull silence came into th very air 
4910-14125-0036	train-other-500	our voices did na rightly seem our own And we sailed on and we sailed on
none	none	 All at once th man as were on watch gave a cry he saw a break in the ice as we d begun to think were everlasting and we all gathered towards the bows and the captain called to th man at the helm to keep her course and cocked his head and began to walk the quarter deck jaunty again And we came to a great cleft in th long weary rock of ice and the sides o th cleft were not jagged but went straight sharp down into th foaming waters But we took but one look at what lay inside for our captain with a loud cry to God bade the helmsman steer nor ards away fra th mouth o Hell We all saw wi our own eyes inside that fearsome wall o ice 
4910-14125-0037	train-other-500	seventy miles long as we could swear to inside that gray cold ice came leaping flames all red and yellow wi heat o some unearthly kind
none	none	 out o th very waters o the sea making our eyes dazzle wi their scarlet blaze that shot up as high nay higher than th ice around 
4910-14125-0038	train-other-500	yet never so much as a shred on t was melted They did say that some beside our captain saw the black devils dart hither and thither quicker than the very flames themselves anyhow he saw them
none	none	 And as he knew it were his own daring as had led him to have that peep at terrors forbidden to any on us afore our time 
4910-14125-0039	train-other-500	he just dwined away and we hadn t taken but one whale afore our captain died
none	none	 and first mate took th command 
4910-14125-0040	train-other-500	It were a prosperous voyage but for all that I ll never sail those seas again
none	none	 nor ever take wage aboard an American again Eh dear but it s awful t think o sitting wi a man that has seen th doorway into hell said Bell aghast 
4910-14125-0041	train-other-500	Sylvia had dropped her work and sat gazing at Kinraid with fascinated wonder
none	none	 Daniel was just a little annoyed at the admiration which his own wife and daughter were bestowing on the specksioneer s wonderful stories and he said Ay ay If a d been a talker ye d ha thought a deal more on me nor ye ve iver done yet A ve seen such things and done such things Tell us father said Sylvia 
4910-14125-0042	train-other-500	greedy and breathless Some on em is past telling he replied an some is not to be had for t asking seeing as how they might bring a man into trouble But as a said
none	none	 if a had a fancy to reveal all as is on my mind 
4910-14125-0043	train-other-500	a could make t hair on your heads lift up your caps
none	none	 well we ll say an inch at least Thy mother lass has heerd one or two on em Thou minds the story o my ride on a whale s back Bell That ll maybe be within this young fellow s comprehension o t danger 
4910-14125-0044	train-other-500	thou s heerd me tell it hastn t ta Yes said Bell but it s a long time ago when we was courting An that s afore this young lass were born as is a most up to woman s estate But sin those days a ha been o er busy to tell stories to my wife

4910-14125-0058	train-other-500	But not for long for Bell suddenly starting up did all but turn him out of the house It was late she said
none	none	 and her master was tired and they had a hard day before them next day and it was keeping Ellen Corney up and they had had enough to drink more than was good for them she was sure for they had both been taking her in with their stories 
4910-14125-0059	train-other-500	which she had been foolish enough to believe No one saw the real motive of all this almost inhospitable haste to dismiss her guest how the sudden fear had taken possession of her that he and Sylvia were fancying each other

none	none	 All night long Sylvia dreamed of burning volcanoes springing out of icy southern seas But as in the specksioneer s tale the flames were peopled with demons there was no human interest for her in the wondrous scene in which she was no actor

4910-14125-0065	train-other-500	When she had argued herself into certainty on one side she suddenly wheeled about and was just of the opposite opinion At length she settled that it could not be settled until she saw Molly again so by a strong gulping effort she resolutely determined to think no more about him
4910-14125-0066	train-other-500	only about the marvels he had told She might think a little about them when she sat at night spinning in silence by the household fire

4910-14125-0067	train-other-500	when as in the past she took her knitting out for the sake of the freshness of the faint sea breeze and dropping down from ledge to ledge of the rocks that faced the blue ocean established herself in a perilous nook that had been her haunt ever since her parents had come to Haytersbank Farm
4910-14125-0068	train-other-500	From thence she had often seen the distant ships pass to and fro with a certain sort of lazy pleasure in watching their swift tranquillity of motion
none	none	 but no thought as to where they were bound to or what strange places they would penetrate to before they turned again homeward bound CHAPTER X A REFRACTORY PUPIL Sylvia was still full of the specksioneer and his stories when Hepburn came up to give her the next lesson But the prospect of a little sensible commendation for writing a whole page full of flourishing Abednegos had lost all the slight charm it had ever possessed She was much more inclined to try and elicit some sympathy in her interest in the perils and adventures of the northern seas than to bend and control her mind to the right formation of letters Unwisely enough she endeavoured to repeat one of the narratives that she had heard from Kinraid and when she found that Hepburn if indeed he did not look upon the whole as a silly invention considered it only as an interruption to the real business in hand to which he would try to listen as patiently as he could in the hope of Sylvia s applying herself diligently to her copy book when she had cleared her mind she contracted her pretty lips as if to check them from making any further appeals for sympathy and set about her writing lesson in a very rebellious frame of mind only restrained by her mother s presence from spoken mutiny After all said she throwing down her pen and opening and shutting her weary cramped hand I see no good in tiring myself wi learning for t write letters when I se never got one in a my life What for should I write answers when there s niver a one writes to me and if I had one I couldn t read it it s bad enough wi a book o print as I ve niver seen afore for there s sure to be new fangled words in t I m sure I wish the man were farred who plagues his brains wi striking out new words Why can t folks just ha a set on em for good and a Why you ll be after using two or three hundred yoursel every day as you live Sylvie and yet I must use a great many as you never think on about t shop and t folks in t fields want their set let alone the high English that parsons and lawyers speak Well it s weary work is reading and writing Cannot you learn me something else if we mun do lessons There s sums and geography said Hepburn slowly and gravely Geography said Sylvia brightening and perhaps not pronouncing the word quite correctly I d like yo to learn me geography There s a deal o places I want to hear all about Well I ll bring up a book and a map next time But I can tell you something now There s four quarters in the globe What s that asked Sylvia The globe is the earth the place we live on Go on Which quarter is Greenland Greenland is no quarter It is only a part of one Maybe it s a half quarter No not so much as that Half again No he replied smiling a little She thought he was making it into a very small place in order to tease her so she pouted a little and then said Greenland is all t geography I want to know Except perhaps York I d like to learn about York because of t races and London because King George lives there But if you learn geography at all you must learn bout all places which of them is hot and which is cold and how many inhabitants is in each and what s the rivers and which is the principal towns I m sure Sylvie if Philip will learn thee all that thou lieutenant be such a sight o knowledge as ne er a one o th Prestons has been sin my great grandfather lost his property I should be main proud o thee twould seem as if we was Prestons o Slaideburn once more I d do a deal to pleasure yo mammy but weary befa riches and land if folks that has em is to write Abednegos by t score and to get hard words int their brains till they work like barm and end wi cracking em This seemed to be Sylvia s last protest against learning for the night for after this she turned docile and really took pains to understand all that Philip could teach her by means of the not unskilful though rude map which he drew for her with a piece of charred wood on his aunt s dresser He had asked his aunt s leave before beginning what Sylvia called his dirty work but by and by even she became a little interested in starting from a great black spot called Monkshaven and in the shaping of land and sea around that one centre Sylvia held her round chin in the palms of her hands supporting her elbows on the dresser looking down at the progress of the rough drawing in general but now and then glancing up at him with sudden inquiry All along he was not so much absorbed in his teaching as to be unconscious of her sweet proximity She was in her best mood towards him neither mutinous nor saucy and he was striving with all his might to retain her interest speaking better than ever he had done before such brightness did love call forth understanding what she would care to hear and to know when in the middle of an attempt at explaining the cause of the long polar days of which she had heard from her childhood he felt that her attention was no longer his that a discord had come in between their minds that she had passed out of his power This certainty of intuition lasted but for an instant he had no time to wonder or to speculate as to what had affected her so adversely to his wishes before the door opened and Kinraid came in Then Hepburn knew that she must have heard his coming footsteps and recognized them He angrily stiffened himself up into coldness of demeanour Almost to his surprise Sylvia s greeting to the new comer was as cold as his own She stood rather behind him so perhaps she did not see the hand which Kinraid stretched out towards her for she did not place her own little palm in it as she had done to Philip an hour ago And she hardly spoke but began to pore over the rough black map as if seized with strong geographical curiosity or determined to impress Philip s lesson deep on her memory Still Philip was dismayed by seeing the warm welcome which Kinraid received from the master of the house who came in from the back premises almost at the same time as the specksioneer entered at the front Hepburn was uneasy too at finding Kinraid take his seat by the fireside like one accustomed to the ways of the house Pipes were soon produced Philip disliked smoking Possibly Kinraid did so too but he took a pipe at any rate and lighted it though he hardly used it at all but kept talking to farmer Robson on sea affairs He had the conversation pretty much to himself Philip sat gloomily by Sylvia and his aunt were silent and old Robson smoked his long clay pipe from time to time taking it out of his mouth to spit into the bright copper spittoon and to shake the white ashes out of the bowl Before he replaced it he would give a short laugh of relishing interest in Kinraid s conversation and now and then he put in a remark Sylvia perched herself sideways on the end of the dresser and made pretence to sew but Philip could see how often she paused in her work to listen By and by his aunt spoke to him and they kept up a little side conversation more because Bell Robson felt that her nephew her own flesh and blood was put out than for any special interest they either of them felt in what they were saying Perhaps also they neither of them disliked showing that they had no great faith in the stories Kinraid was telling missus Robson at any rate knew so little as to be afraid of believing too much Philip was sitting on that side of the fire which was nearest to the window and to Sylvia and opposite to the specksioneer At length he turned to his cousin and said in a low voice I suppose we can t go on with our spell at geography till that fellow s gone The colour came into Sylvia s cheek at the words that fellow but she only replied with a careless air Well I m one as thinks enough is as good as a feast and I ve had enough of geography this one night thank you kindly all the same Philip took refuge in offended silence He was maliciously pleased when his aunt made so much noise with her preparation for supper as quite to prevent the sound of the sailor s words from reaching Sylvia s ears She saw that he was glad to perceive that her efforts to reach the remainder of the story were baulked this nettled her and determined not to let him have his malicious triumph and still more to put a stop to any attempt at private conversation she began to sing to herself as she sat at her work till suddenly seized with a desire to help her mother she dexterously slipped down from her seat passed Hepburn and was on her knees toasting cakes right in front of the fire and just close to her father and Kinraid And now the noise that Hepburn had so rejoiced in proved his foe He could not hear the little merry speeches that darted backwards and forwards as the specksioneer tried to take the toasting fork out of Sylvia s hand How comes that sailor chap here asked Hepburn of his aunt He s none fit to be where Sylvia is Nay I dunnot know said she the Corneys made us acquaint first and my master is quite fain of his company And do you like him too aunt asked Hepburn almost wistfully he had followed missus Robson into the dairy on pretence of helping her I m none fond on him I think he tells us traveller s tales by way o seeing how much we can swallow But the master and Sylvia think that there never was such a one I could show them a score as good as he down on the quayside Well laddie keep a calm sough Some folk like some folk and others don t Wherever I am there ll allays be a welcome for thee For the good woman thought that he had been hurt by the evident absorption of her husband and daughter with their new friend and wished to make all easy and straight But do what she would he did not recover his temper all evening he was uncomfortable put out not enjoying himself and yet he would not go He was determined to assert his greater intimacy in that house by outstaying Kinraid At length the latter got up to go but before he went he must needs bend over Sylvia and say something to her in so low a tone that Philip could not hear it and she seized with a sudden fit of diligence never looked up from her sewing only nodded her head by way of reply At last he took his departure after many a little delay and many a quick return which to the suspicious Philip seemed only pretences for taking stolen glances at Sylvia As soon as he was decidedly gone she folded up her work and declared that she was so much tired that she must go to bed there and then Her mother too had been dozing for the last half hour and was only too glad to see signs that she might betake herself to her natural place of slumber Take another glass Philip said farmer Robson But Hepburn refused the offer rather abruptly He drew near to Sylvia instead He wanted to make her speak to him and he saw that she wished to avoid it He took up the readiest pretext It was an unwise one as it proved for it deprived him of his chances of occasionally obtaining her undivided attention I don t think you care much for learning geography Sylvie Not much to night said she making a pretence to yawn yet looking timidly up at his countenance of displeasure Nor at any time said he with growing anger nor for any kind of learning I did bring some books last time I came meaning to teach you many a thing but now I ll just trouble you for my books I put them on yon shelf by the Bible He had a mind that she should bring them to him that at any rate he should have the pleasure of receiving them out of her hands Sylvia did not reply but went and took down the books with a languid indifferent air And so you won t learn any more geography said Hepburn Something in his tone struck her and she looked up in his face There were marks of stern offence upon his countenance and yet in it there was also an air of wistful regret and sadness that touched her Yo re niver angry with me Philip Sooner than vex yo I ll try and learn Only I m just stupid and it mun be such a trouble to you Hepburn would fain have snatched at this half proposal that the lessons should be continued but he was too stubborn and proud to say anything He turned away from the sweet pleading face without a word to wrap up his books in a piece of paper He knew that she was standing quite still by his side though he made as if he did not perceive her When he had done he abruptly wished them all good night and took his leave There were tears in Sylvia s eyes although the feeling in her heart was rather one of relief She had made a fair offer and it had been treated with silent contempt A few days afterwards her father came in from Monkshaven market and dropped out among other pieces of news that he had met Kinraid who was bound for his own home at Cullercoats He had desired his respects to missus Robson and her daughter and had bid Robson say that he would have come up to Haytersbank to wish them good by but that as he was pressed for time he hoped they would excuse him But Robson did not think it worth while to give this long message of mere politeness Indeed as it did not relate to business and was only sent to women Robson forgot all about it pretty nearly as soon as it was uttered So Sylvia went about fretting herself for one or two days at her hero s apparent carelessness of those who had at any rate treated him more like a friend than an acquaintance of only a few weeks standing and then her anger quenching her incipient regard she went about her daily business pretty much as though he had never been He had gone away out of her sight into the thick mist of unseen life from which he had emerged gone away without a word and she might never see him again But still there was a chance of her seeing him when he came to marry Molly Corney Perhaps she should be bridesmaid and then what a pleasant merry time the wedding day would be The Corneys were all such kind people and in their family there never seemed to be the checks and restraints by which her own mother hedged her round Then there came an overwhelming self reproaching burst of love for that own mother a humiliation before her slightest wish as penance for the moment s unspoken treason and thus Sylvia was led to request her cousin Philip to resume his lessons in so meek a manner that he slowly and graciously acceded to a request which he was yearning to fulfil all the time During the ensuing winter all went on in monotonous regularity at Haytersbank Farm for many weeks Hepburn came and went and thought Sylvia wonderfully improved in docility and sobriety and perhaps also he noticed the improvement in her appearance For she was at that age when a girl changes rapidly and generally for the better Sylvia shot up into a tall young woman her eyes deepened in colour her face increased in expression and a sort of consciousness of unusual good looks gave her a slight tinge of coquettish shyness with the few strangers whom she ever saw Philip hailed her interest in geography as another sign of improvement He had brought back his book of maps to the farm and there he sat on many an evening teaching his cousin who had strange fancies respecting the places about which she wished to learn and was coolly indifferent to the very existence of other towns and countries and seas far more famous in story She was occasionally wilful and at times very contemptuous as to the superior knowledge of her instructor but in spite of it all Philip went regularly on the appointed evenings to Haytersbank through keen black east wind or driving snow or slushing thaw for he liked dearly to sit a little behind her with his arm on the back of her chair she stooping over the outspread map with her eyes could he have seen them a good deal fixed on one spot in the map not Northumberland where Kinraid was spending the winter but those wild northern seas about which he had told them such wonders One day towards spring she saw Molly Corney coming towards the farm The companions had not met for many weeks for Molly had been from home visiting her relations in the north Sylvia opened the door and stood smiling and shivering on the threshold glad to see her friend again Molly called out when a few paces off Why Sylvia is that thee Why how thou rt growed to be sure What a bonny lass thou is Dunnot talk nonsense to my lass said Bell Robson hospitably leaving her ironing and coming to the door but though the mother tried to look as if she thought it nonsense she could hardly keep down the smile that shone out of her eyes as she put her hand on Sylvia s shoulder with a fond sense of proprietorship in what was being praised Oh but she is persisted Molly She s grown quite a beauty sin I saw her And if I don t tell her so the men will Be quiet wi thee said Sylvia more than half offended and turning away in a huff at the open barefaced admiration Ay but they will persevered Molly Yo ll not keep her long Mistress Robson And as mother says yo d feel it a deal more to have yer daughters left on hand Thy mother has many I have but this one said missus Robson with severe sadness for now Molly was getting to talk as she disliked But Molly s purpose was to bring the conversation round to her own affairs of which she was very full Yes I tell mother that wi so many as she has she ought to be thankful to t one as gets off quickest Who which is it asked Sylvia a little eagerly seeing that there was news of a wedding behind the talk Why who should it be but me said Molly laughing a good deal and reddening a little I ve not gone fra home for nought I se picked up a measter on my travels leastways one as is to be Charley Kinraid said Sylvia smiling as she found that now she might reveal Molly s secret which hitherto she had kept sacred Charley Kinraid be hung said Molly with a toss of her head Whatten good s a husband who s at sea half t year Ha ha my measter is a canny Newcassel shopkeeper on t Side A reckon a ve done pretty well for mysel and a ll wish yo as good luck Sylvia For yo see turning to Bell Robson who perhaps she thought would more appreciate the substantial advantages of her engagement than Sylvia though Measter Brunton is near upon forty if he s a day yet he turns over a matter of two hundred pound every year an he s a good looking man of his years too an a kind good tempered feller int t bargain He s been married once to be sure but his childer are dead a cept one an I don t mislike childer either an a ll feed em well an get em to bed early out o t road missus Robson gave her her grave good wishes but Sylvia was silent She was disappointed it was a coming down from the romance with the specksioneer for its hero Molly laughed awkwardly understanding Sylvia s thoughts better than the latter imagined Sylvia s noane so well pleased Why lass it s a t better for thee There s Charley to t fore now which if a d married him he d not ha been and he s said more nor once what a pretty lass yo d grow into by and by Molly s prosperity was giving her an independence and fearlessness of talk such as had seldom appeared hitherto and certainly never before missus Robson Sylvia was annoyed at Molly s whole tone and manner which were loud laughing and boisterous but to her mother they were positively repugnant She said shortly and gravely Sylvia s none so set upo matrimony she s content to bide wi me and her father Let a be such talking it s not i my way Molly was a little subdued but still her elation at the prospect of being so well married kept cropping out of all the other subjects which were introduced and when she went away missus Robson broke out in an unwonted strain of depreciation That s the way wi some lasses They re like a cock on a dunghill when they ve teased a silly chap into wedding em It s cock a doodle do I ve cotched a husband cock a doodle doo wi em I ve no patience wi such like I beg Sylvie thou lieutenant not get too thick wi Molly She s not pretty behaved making such an ado about men kind as if they were two headed calves to be run after But Molly s a good hearted lass mother Only I never dreamt but what she was troth plighted wi Charley Kinraid said Sylvia meditatively That wench ll be troth plight to th first man as ll wed her and keep her i plenty that s a she thinks about replied Bell scornfully CHAPTER XI VISIONS OF THE FUTURE Before May was out Molly Corney was married and had left the neighbourhood for Newcastle Although Charley Kinraid was not the bridegroom Sylvia s promise to be bridesmaid was claimed But the friendship brought on by the circumstances of neighbourhood and parity of age had become very much weakened in the time that elapsed between Molly s engagement and wedding In the first place she herself was so absorbed in her preparations so elated by her good fortune in getting married and married too before her elder sister that all her faults blossomed out full and strong Sylvia felt her to be selfish missus Robson thought her not maidenly A year before she would have been far more missed and regretted by Sylvia now it was almost a relief to the latter to be freed from the perpetual calls upon her sympathy from the constant demands upon her congratulations made by one who had no thought or feeling to bestow on others at least not in these weeks of cock a doodle dooing as missus Robson persisted in calling it It was seldom that Bell was taken with a humorous idea but this once having hatched a solitary joke she was always clucking it into notice to go on with her own poultry simile Every time during that summer that Philip saw his cousin he thought her prettier than she had ever been before some new touch of colour some fresh sweet charm seemed to have been added just as every summer day calls out new beauty in the flowers And this was not the addition of Philip s fancy Hester Rose who met Sylvia on rare occasions came back each time with a candid sad acknowledgement in her heart that it was no wonder that Sylvia was so much admired and loved One day Hester had seen her sitting near her mother in the market place there was a basket by her and over the clean cloth that covered the yellow pounds of butter she had laid the hedge roses and honeysuckles she had gathered on the way into Monkshaven her straw hat was on her knee and she was busy placing some of the flowers in the ribbon that went round it Then she held it on her hand and turned it round about putting her head on one side the better to view the effect and all this time Hester peeping at her through the folds of the stuffs displayed in Foster s windows saw her with admiring wistful eyes wondering too if Philip at the other counter were aware of his cousin s being there so near to him Then Sylvia put on her hat and looking up at Foster s windows caught Hester s face of interest and smiled and blushed at the consciousness of having been watched over her little vanities and Hester smiled back but rather sadly Then a customer came in and she had to attend to her business which on this as on all market days was great In the midst she was aware of Philip rushing bare headed out of the shop eager and delighted at something he saw outside There was a little looking glass hung against the wall on Hester s side placed in that retired corner in order that the good women who came to purchase head gear of any kind might see the effect thereof before they concluded their bargain In a pause of custom Hester half ashamed stole into this corner and looked at herself in the glass What did she see a colourless face dark soft hair with no light gleams in it eyes that were melancholy instead of smiling a mouth compressed with a sense of dissatisfaction This was what she had to compare with the bright bonny face in the sunlight outside She gave a gulp to check the sigh that was rising and came back even more patient than she had been before this disheartening peep to serve all the whims and fancies of purchasers Sylvia herself had been rather put out by Philip s way of coming to her It made her look so silly she thought and what for must he make a sight of himself coming among the market folk in that a way and when he took to admiring her hat she pulled out the flowers in a pet and threw them down and trampled them under foot What for art thou doing that Sylvie said her mother The flowers is well enough though may be thy hat might ha been stained I don t like Philip to speak to me so said Sylvia pouting How asked her mother But Sylvia could not repeat his words She hung her head and looked red and pre occupied anything but pleased Philip had addressed his first expression of personal admiration at an unfortunate tune It just shows what different views different men and women take of their fellow creatures when I say that Hester looked upon Philip as the best and most agreeable man she had ever known He was not one to speak of himself without being questioned on the subject so his Haytersbank relations only come into the neighborhood in the last year or two knew nothing of the trials he had surmounted or the difficult duties he had performed His aunt indeed had strong faith in him both from partial knowledge of his character and because he was of her own tribe and kin but she had never learnt the small details of his past life Sylvia respected him as her mother s friend and treated him tolerably well as long as he preserved his usual self restraint of demeanour but hardly ever thought of him when he was absent Now Hester who had watched him daily for all the years since he had first come as an errand boy into Foster s shop watching with quiet modest yet observant eyes had seen how devoted he was to his master s interests had known of his careful and punctual ministration to his absent mother s comforts as long as she was living to benefit by his silent frugal self denial His methodical appropriation of the few hours he could call his own was not without its charms to the equally methodical Hester the way in which he reproduced any lately acquired piece of knowledge knowledge so wearisome to Sylvia was delightfully instructive to Hester although as she was habitually silent it would have required an observer more interested in discovering her feelings than Philip was to have perceived the little flush on the pale cheek and the brightness in the half veiled eyes whenever he was talking She had not thought of love on either side Love was a vanity a worldliness not to be spoken about or even thought about Once or twice before the Robsons came into the neighbourhood an idea had crossed her mind that possibly the quiet habitual way in which she and Philip lived together might drift them into matrimony at some distant period and she could not bear the humble advances which Coulson Philip s fellow lodger sometimes made They seemed to disgust her with him But after the Robsons settled at Haytersbank Philip s evenings were so often spent there that any unconscious hopes Hester might unawares have entertained died away At first she had felt a pang akin to jealousy when she heard of Sylvia the little cousin who was passing out of childhood into womanhood Once early in those days she had ventured to ask Philip what Sylvia was like Philip had not warmed up at the question and had given rather a dry catalogue of her features hair and height but Hester almost to her own surprise persevered and jerked out the final question Is she pretty Philip s sallow cheek grew deeper by two or three shades but he answered with a tone of indifference I believe some folks think her so But do you persevered Hester in spite of her being aware that he somehow disliked the question There s no need for talking o such things he answered with abrupt displeasure Hester silenced her curiosity from that time But her heart was not quite at ease and she kept on wondering whether Philip thought his little cousin pretty until she saw her and him together on that occasion of which we have spoken when Sylvia came to the shop to buy her new cloak and after that Hester never wondered whether Philip thought his cousin pretty or no for she knew quite well Bell Robson had her own anxieties on the subject of her daughter s increasing attractions She apprehended the dangers consequent upon certain facts by a mental process more akin to intuition than reason She was uncomfortable even while her motherly vanity was flattered at the admiration Sylvia received from the other sex This admiration was made evident to her mother in many ways When Sylvia was with her at market it might have been thought that the doctors had prescribed a diet of butter and eggs to all the men under forty in Monkshaven At first it seemed to missus Robson but a natural tribute to the superior merit of her farm produce but by degrees she perceived that if Sylvia remained at home she stood no better chance than her neighbours of an early sale There were more customers than formerly for the fleeces stored in the wool loft comely young butchers came after the calf almost before it had been decided to sell it in short excuses were seldom wanting to those who wished to see the beauty of Haytersbank Farm All this made Bell uncomfortable though she could hardly have told what she dreaded Sylvia herself seemed unspoilt by it as far as her home relations were concerned A little thoughtless she had always been and thoughtless she was still but as her mother had often said Yo canna put old heads on young shoulders and if blamed for her carelessness by her parents Sylvia was always as penitent as she could be for the time being To be sure it was only to her father and mother that she remained the same as she had been when an awkward lassie of thirteen Out of the house there were the most contradictory opinions of her especially if the voices of women were to be listened to She was an ill favoured overgrown thing just as bonny as the first rose i June and as sweet i her nature as t honeysuckle a climbing round it she was a vixen with a tongue sharp enough to make yer very heart bleed she was just a bit o sunshine wheriver she went she was sulky lively witty silent affectionate or cold hearted according to the person who spoke about her In fact her peculiarity seemed to be this that every one who knew her talked about her either in praise or blame in church or in market she unconsciously attracted attention they could not forget her presence as they could that of other girls perhaps more personally attractive Now all this was a cause of anxiety to her mother who began to feel as if she would rather have had her child passed by in silence than so much noticed Bell s opinion was that it was creditable to a woman to go through life in the shadow of obscurity never named except in connexion with good housewifery husband or children Too much talking about a girl even in the way of praise disturbed missus Robson s opinion of her and when her neighbours told her how her own daughter was admired she would reply coldly She s just well enough and change the subject of conversation But it was quite different with her husband To his looser less restrained mind it was agreeable to hear of and still more to see the attention which his daughter s beauty received He felt it as reflecting consequence on himself He had never troubled his mind with speculations as to whether he himself was popular still less whether he was respected He was pretty welcome wherever he went as a jovial good natured man who had done adventurous and illegal things in his youth which in some measure entitled him to speak out his opinions on life in general in the authoritative manner he generally used but of the two he preferred consorting with younger men to taking a sober stand of respectability with the elders of the place and he perceived without reasoning upon it that the gay daring spirits were more desirous of his company when Sylvia was by his side than at any other time One or two of these would saunter up to Haytersbank on a Sunday afternoon and lounge round his fields with the old farmer Bell kept herself from the nap which had been her weekly solace for years in order to look after Sylvia and on such occasions she always turned as cold a shoulder to the visitors as her sense of hospitality and of duty to her husband would permit But if they did not enter the house old Robson would always have Sylvia with him when he went the round of his land Bell could see them from the upper window the young men standing in the attitudes of listeners while Daniel laid down the law on some point enforcing his words by pantomimic actions with his thick stick and Sylvia half turning away as if from some too admiring gaze was possibly picking flowers out of the hedge bank These Sunday afternoon strolls were the plague of Bell s life that whole summer Then it took as much of artifice as was in the simple woman s nature to keep Daniel from insisting on having Sylvia s company every time he went down to Monkshaven And here again came a perplexity the acknowledgement of which in distinct thought would have been an act of disloyalty according to Bell s conscience If Sylvia went with her father he never drank to excess and that was a good gain to health at any rate drinking was hardly a sin against morals in those days and in that place so occasionally she was allowed to accompany him to Monkshaven as a check upon his folly for he was too fond and proud of his daughter to disgrace her by any open excess But one Sunday afternoon early in November Philip came up before the time at which he usually paid his visits He looked grave and pale and his aunt began Why lad what s been ado Thou rt looking as peaked and pined as a Methody preacher after a love feast when he s talked hisself to Death s door Thee dost na get good milk enow that s what it is such stuff as Monkshaven folks put up wi No aunt I m quite well Only I m a bit put out vexed like at what I ve heerd about Sylvie His aunt s face changed immediately And whatten folk say of her next thing Oh said Philip struck by the difference of look and manner in his aunt and subdued by seeing how instantly she took alarm It were only my uncle he should na take a girl like her to a public She were wi him at t Admiral s Head upo All Souls Day that were all There were many a one there beside it were statute fair but such a one as our Sylvie ought not to be cheapened wi t rest And he took her there did he said Bell in severe meditation I had never no opinion o th wenches as ll set theirselves to be hired for servants i th fair they re a bad lot as cannot find places for theirselves bout going and stannin to be stared at by folk and grinnin wi th plough lads when no one s looking it s a bad look out for t missus as takes one o these wenches for a servant and dost ta mean to say as my Sylvie went and demeaned hersel to dance and marlock wi a th fair folk at th Admiral s Head No no she did na dance she barely set foot i th room but it were her own pride as saved her uncle would niver ha kept her from it for he had fallen in wi Hayley o Seaburn and one or two others and they were having a glass i t bar and missus Lawson t landlady knew how there was them who would come and dance among parish prentices if need were just to get a word or a look wi Sylvie So she tempts her in saying that the room were all smartened and fine wi flags and there was them in the room as told me that they never were so startled as when they saw our Sylvie s face peeping in among all t flustered maids and men rough and red wi weather and drink and Jem Macbean he said she were just like a bit o apple blossom among peonies and some man he didn t know who went up and spoke to her an either at that or at some o t words she heard for they d got a good way on afore that time she went quite white and mad as if fire were coming out of her eyes and then she turned red and left the room for all t landlady tried to laugh it off and keep her in I ll be down to Monkshaven before I m a day older and tell Margaret Lawson some on my mind as she ll not forget in a hurry Bell moved as though she would put on her cloak and hood there and then Nay it s not in reason as a woman i that line o life shouldn t try to make her house agreeable said Philip Not wi my wench said Bell in a determined voice Philip s information had made a deeper impression on his aunt than he intended He himself had been annoyed more at the idea that Sylvia would be spoken of as having been at a rough piece of rustic gaiety a yearly festival for the lower classes of Yorkshire servants out door as well as in door than at the affair itself for he had learnt from his informant how instantaneous her appearance had been He stood watching his aunt s troubled face and almost wishing that he had not spoken At last she heaved a deep sigh and stirring the fire as if by this little household occupation to compose her mind she said It s a pity as wenches aren t lads or married folk I could ha wished but it were the Lord s will It would ha been summut to look to if she d had a brother My master is so full on his own thoughts yo see he s no mind left for thinking on her what wi th oats and th wool and th young colt and his venture i th Lucky Mary She really believed her husband to have the serious and important occupation for his mind that she had been taught to consider befitting the superior intellect of the masculine gender she would have taxed herself severely if even in thought she had blamed him and Philip respected her feelings too much to say that Sylvia s father ought to look after her more closely if he made such a pretty creature so constantly his companion yet some such speech was only just pent within Philip s closed lips Again his aunt spoke I used to think as she and yo might fancy one another but thou rt too old fashioned like for her ye would na suit and it s as well for now I can say to thee that I would take it very kindly if thou would saint look after her a bit Philip s countenance fell into gloom He had to gulp down certain feelings before he could make answer with discretion How can I look after her and me tied to the shop more and more every day I could send her on a bit of an errand to Foster s and then for sure yo might keep an eye upon her when she s in th town and just walk a bit way with her when she s in th street and keep t other fellows off her Ned Simpson t butcher in special for folks do say he means no good by any girl he goes wi and I ll ask father to leave her a bit more wi me They re coming down th brow and Ned Simpson wi them Now Philip I look to thee to do a brother s part by my wench and warn off all as isn t fit The door opened and the coarse strong voice of Simpson made itself heard He was a stout man comely enough as to form and feature but with a depth of colour in his face that betokened the coming on of the habits of the sot His Sunday hat was in his hand and he smoothed the long nap of it as he said with a mixture of shyness and familiarity Sarvant missus Yo r measter is fain that I should come in an have a drop no offence I hope Sylvia passed quickly through the house place and went upstairs without speaking to her cousin Philip or to any one He sat on disliking the visitor and almost disliking his hospitable uncle for having brought Simpson into the house sympathizing with his aunt in the spirit which prompted her curt answers and in the intervals of all these feelings wondering what ground she had for speaking as if she had now given up all thought of Sylvia and him ever being married and in what way he was too old fashioned Robson would gladly have persuaded Philip to join him and Simpson in their drink but Philip was in no sociable mood and sate a little aloof watching the staircase down which sooner or later Sylvia must come for as perhaps has been already said the stairs went up straight out of the kitchen And at length his yearning watch was rewarded first the little pointed toe came daintily in sight then the trim ankle in the tight blue stocking the wool of which was spun and the web of which was knitted by her mother s careful hands then the full brown stuff petticoat the arm holding the petticoat back in decent folds so as not to encumber the descending feet the slender neck and shoulders hidden under the folded square of fresh white muslin the crowning beauty of the soft innocent face radiant in colour and with the light brown curls clustering around She made her way quickly to Philip s side how his heart beat at her approach and even more when she entered into a low voiced tete a tete Isn t he gone yet said she I cannot abide him I could ha pinched father when he asked him for t come in Maybe he ll not stay long said Philip hardly understanding the meaning of what he said so sweet was it to have her making her whispered confidences to him But Simpson was not going to let her alone in the dark corner between the door and the window He began paying her some coarse country compliments too strong in their direct flattery for even her father s taste more especially as he saw by his wife s set lips and frowning brow how much she disapproved of their visitor s style of conversation Come measter leave t lass alone she s set up enough a ready her mother makes such a deal on her Yo an me s men for sensible talk at our time o life An as I was saying t horse was a weaver if iver one was as any one could ha told as had come within a mile on him And in this way the old farmer and the bluff butcher chatted on about horses while Philip and Sylvia sate together he turning over all manner of hopes and projects for the future in spite of his aunt s opinion that he was too old fashioned for her dainty blooming daughter Perhaps too missus Robson saw some reason for changing her mind on this head as she watched Sylvia this night for she accompanied Philip to the door when the time came for him to start homewards and bade him good night with unusual fervour adding Thou saint been a deal o comfort to me lad a most as one as if thou wert a child o my own as at times I could welly think thou art to be Anyways I trust to thee to look after the lile lass as has no brother to guide her among men and men s very kittle for a woman to deal wi but if thou lieutenant have an eye on whom she consorts wi my mind ll be easier Philip s heart beat fast but his voice was as calm as usual when he replied I d just keep her a bit aloof from Monkshaven folks a lass is always the more thought on for being chary of herself and as for t rest I ll have an eye to the folks she goes among and if I see that they don t befit her I ll just give her a warning for she s not one to like such chaps as yon Simpson there she can see what s becoming in a man to say to a lass and what s not Philip set out on his two mile walk home with a tumult of happiness in his heart He was not often carried away by delusions of his own creating to night he thought he had good ground for believing that by patient self restraint he might win Sylvia s love A year ago he had nearly earned her dislike by obtruding upon her looks and words betokening his passionate love He alarmed her girlish coyness as well as wearied her with the wish he had then felt that she should take an interest in his pursuits But with unusual wisdom he had perceived his mistake it was many months now since he had betrayed by word or look that she was anything more to him than a little cousin to be cared for and protected when need was The consequence was that she had become tamed just as a wild animal is tamed he had remained tranquil and impassive almost as if he did not perceive her shy advances towards friendliness These advances were made by her after the lessons had ceased She was afraid lest he was displeased with her behaviour in rejecting his instructions and was not easy till she was at peace with him and now to all appearance he and she were perfect friends but nothing more In his absence she would not allow her young companions to laugh at his grave sobriety of character and somewhat prim demeanour she would even go against her conscience and deny that she perceived any peculiarity When she wanted it she sought his advice on such small subjects as came up in her daily life and she tried not to show signs of weariness when he used more words and more difficult words than were necessary to convey his ideas But her ideal husband was different from Philip in every point the two images never for an instant merged into one To Philip she was the only woman in the world it was the one subject on which he dared not consider for fear that both conscience and judgment should decide against him and that he should be convinced against his will that she was an unfit mate for him that she never would be his and that it was waste of time and life to keep her shrined in the dearest sanctuary of his being to the exclusion of all the serious and religious aims which in any other case he would have been the first to acknowledge as the object he ought to pursue For he had been brought up among the Quakers and shared in their austere distrust of a self seeking spirit yet what else but self seeking was his passionate prayer Give me Sylvia or else I die No other vision had ever crossed his masculine fancy for a moment his was a rare and constant love that deserved a better fate than it met with At this time his hopes were high as I have said not merely as to the growth of Sylvia s feelings towards him but as to the probability of his soon being in a position to place her in such comfort as his wife as she had never enjoyed before For the brothers Foster were thinking of retiring from business and relinquishing the shop to their two shopmen Philip Hepburn and William Coulson To be sure it was only by looking back for a few months and noticing chance expressions and small indications that this intention of theirs could be discovered But every step they took tended this way and Philip knew their usual practice of deliberation too well to feel in the least impatient for the quicker progress of the end which he saw steadily approaching The whole atmosphere of life among the Friends at this date partook of this character of self repression and both Coulson and Hepburn shared in it Coulson was just as much aware of the prospect opening before him as Hepburn but they never spoke together on the subject although their mutual knowledge might be occasionally implied in their conversation on their future lives Meanwhile the Fosters were imparting more of the background of their business to their successors For the present at least the brothers meant to retain an interest in the shop even after they had given up the active management and they sometimes thought of setting up a separate establishment as bankers The separation of the business the introduction of their shopmen to the distant manufacturers who furnished their goods in those days the system of travellers was not so widely organized as it is at present all these steps were in gradual progress and already Philip saw himself in imagination in the dignified position of joint master of the principal shop in Monkshaven with Sylvia installed as his wife with certainly a silk gown and possibly a gig at her disposal In all Philip s visions of future prosperity it was Sylvia who was to be aggrandized by them his own life was to be spent as it was now pretty much between the four shop walls CHAPTER XII NEW YEAR S FETE All this enlargement of interest in the shop occupied Philip fully for some months after the period referred to in the preceding chapter Remembering his last conversation with his aunt he might have been uneasy at his inability to perform his promise and look after his pretty cousin but that about the middle of November Bell Robson had fallen ill of a rheumatic fever and that her daughter had been entirely absorbed in nursing her No thought of company or gaiety was in Sylvia s mind as long as her mother s illness lasted vehement in all her feelings she discovered in the dread of losing her mother how passionately she was attached to her Hitherto she had supposed as children so often do that her parents would live for ever and now when it was a question of days whether by that time the following week her mother might not be buried out of her sight for ever she clung to every semblance of service to be rendered or affection shown as if she hoped to condense the love and care of years into the few days only that might remain missus Robson lingered on began slowly to recover and before Christmas was again sitting by the fireside in the house place wan and pulled down muffled up with shawls and blankets but still there once more where not long before Sylvia had scarcely expected to see her again Philip came up that evening and found Sylvia in wild spirits She thought that everything was done now that her mother had once come downstairs again she laughed with glee she kissed her mother she shook hands with Philip she almost submitted to a speech of more than usual tenderness from him but in the midst of his words her mother s pillows wanted arranging and she went to her chair paying no more heed to his words than if they had been addressed to the cat that lying on the invalid s knee was purring out her welcome to the weak hand feebly stroking her back Robson himself soon came in looking older and more subdued since Philip had seen him last He was very urgent that his wife should have some spirits and water but on her refusal almost as if she loathed the thought of the smell he contented himself with sharing her tea though he kept abusing the beverage as washing the heart out of a man and attributing all the degeneracy of the world growing up about him in his old age to the drinking of such slop At the same time his little self sacrifice put him in an unusually good temper and mingled with his real gladness at having his wife once more on the way to recovery brought back some of the old charm of tenderness combined with light heartedness which had won the sober Isabella Preston long ago He sat by her side holding her hand and talking of old times to the young couple opposite of his adventures and escapes and how he had won his wife She faintly smiling at the remembrance of those days yet half ashamed at having the little details of her courtship revealed from time to time kept saying For shame wi thee Dannel I never did and faint denials of a similar kind Niver believe her Sylvie She were a woman and there s niver a woman but likes to have a sweetheart and can tell when a chap s castin sheep s eyes at her ay an afore he knows what he s about hissen She were a pretty one then was my old ooman an liked them as thought her so though she did cock her head high as bein a Preston which were a family o standin and means i those parts aforetime There s Philip there I ll warrant is as proud o bein Preston by t mother s side for it runs i t blood lass A can tell when a child of a Preston tak s to being proud o their kin by t cut o their nose Now Philip s and my missus s has a turn beyond common i their nostrils as if they was sniffin at t rest of us world an seein if we was good enough for em to consort wi Thee an me lass is Robsons oat cake folk while they s pie crust Lord how Bell used to speak to me as short as though a wasn t a Christian an a t time she loved me as her very life an well a knew it tho a d to mak as tho a didn t Philip when thou goes courtin come t me and a ll give thee many a wrinkle A ve shown too as a know well how t choose a good wife by tokens an signs hannot a missus Come t me my lad and show me t lass an a ll just tak a squint at her an tell yo if she ll do or not an if she ll do a ll teach yo how to win her They say another o yon Corney girls is going to be married said missus Robson in her faint deliberate tones By gosh an it s well thou saint spoke on em a was as clean forgettin it as iver could be A met Nanny Corney i Monkshaven last neet and she axed me for t let our Sylvia come o New Year s Eve an see Molly an her man that n as is wed beyond Newcassel they ll be over at her feyther s for t New Year an there s to be a merry making Sylvia s colour came her eyes brightened she would have liked to go but the thought of her mother came across her and her features fell Her mother s eye caught the look and the change and knew what both meant as well as if Sylvia had spoken out Thursday se nnight said she I ll be rare and strong by then and Sylvie shall go play hersen she s been nurse tending long enough You re but weakly yet said Philip shortly he did not intend to say it but the words seemed to come out in spite of himself A said as our lass should come God willin if she only came and went an thee goin on sprightly old ooman An a ll turn nurse tender mysen for t occasion special if thou can stand t good honest smell o whisky by then So my lass get up thy smart clothes and cut t best on em out as becomes a Preston Maybe a ll fetch thee home an maybe Philip will convoy thee for Nanny Corney bade thee to t merry making as well She said her measter would be seem thee about t wool afore then I don t think as I can go said Philip secretly pleased to know that he had the opportunity in his power I m half bound to go Wi Hester Rose and her mother to t watch night Is Hester a Methodee asked Sylvia in surprise No she s neither a Methodee nor a Friend nor a Church person but she s a turn for serious things choose wherever they re found Well then said good natured farmer Robson only seeing the surface of things a ll make shift to fetch Sylvie back fra t merry making and thee an thy young woman can go to t prayer makin it s every man to his taste say I But in spite of his half promise nay against his natural inclination Philip was lured to the Corneys by the thought of meeting Sylvia of watching her and exulting in her superiority in pretty looks and ways to all the other girls likely to be assembled Besides he told his conscience he was pledged to his aunt to watch over Sylvia like a brother So in the interval before New Year s Eve he silently revelled as much as any young girl in the anticipation of the happy coming time At this hour all the actors in this story having played out their parts and gone to their rest there is something touching in recording the futile efforts made by Philip to win from Sylvia the love he yearned for But at the time any one who had watched him might have been amused to see the grave awkward plain young man studying patterns and colours for a new waistcoat with his head a little on one side after the meditative manner common to those who are choosing a new article of dress They might have smiled could they have read in his imagination the frequent rehearsals of the coming evening when he and she should each be dressed in their gala attire to spend a few hours under a bright festive aspect among people whose company would oblige them to assume a new demeanour towards each other not so familiar as their every day manner but allowing more scope for the expression of rustic gallantry Philip had so seldom been to anything of the kind that even had Sylvia not been going he would have felt a kind of shy excitement at the prospect of anything so unusual But indeed if Sylvia had not been going it is very probable that Philip s rigid conscience might have been aroused to the question whether such parties did not savour too much of the world for him to form one in them As it was however the facts to him were simply these He was going and she was going The day before he had hurried off to Haytersbank Farm with a small paper parcel in his pocket a ribbon with a little briar rose pattern running upon it for Sylvia It was the first thing he had ever ventured to give her the first thing of the kind would perhaps be more accurate for when he had first begun to teach her any lessons he had given her Mavor s Spelling book but that he might have done out of zeal for knowledge to any dunce of a little girl of his acquaintance This ribbon was quite a different kind of present he touched it tenderly as if he were caressing it when he thought of her wearing it the briar rose sweetness and thorns seemed to be the very flower for her the soft green ground on which the pink and brown pattern ran was just the colour to show off her complexion And she would in a way belong to him her cousin her mentor her chaperon her lover While others only admired he might hope to appropriate for of late they had been such happy friends Her mother approved of him her father liked him A few months perhaps only a few weeks more of self restraint and then he might go and speak openly of his wishes and what he had to offer For he had resolved with the quiet force of his character to wait until all was finally settled between him and his masters before he declared himself to either Sylvia or her parents The interval was spent in patient silent endeavours to recommend himself to her He had to give his ribbon to his aunt in charge for Sylvia and that was a disappointment to his fancy although he tried to reason himself into thinking that it was better so He had not time to wait for her return from some errand on which she had gone for he was daily more and more occupied with the affairs of the shop Sylvia made many a promise to her mother and more to herself that she would not stay late at the party but she might go as early as she liked and before the December daylight had faded away Sylvia presented herself at the Corneys She was to come early in order to help to set out the supper which was arranged in the large old flagged parlour which served as best bed room as well It opened out of the house place and was the sacred room of the house as chambers of a similar description are still considered in retired farmhouses in the north of England They are used on occasions like the one now described for purposes of hospitality but in the state bed overshadowing so large a portion of the floor the births and as far as may be the deaths of the household take place At the Corneys the united efforts of some former generation of the family had produced patchwork curtains and coverlet and patchwork was patchwork in those days before the early Yates and Peels had found out the secret of printing the parsley leaf Scraps of costly Indian chintzes and palempours were intermixed with commoner black and red calico in minute hexagons and the variety of patterns served for the useful purpose of promoting conversation as well as the more obvious one of displaying the work woman s taste Sylvia for instance began at once to her old friend Molly Brunton who had accompanied her into this chamber to take off her hat and cloak with a remark on one of the chintzes Stooping over the counterpane with a face into which the flush would come whether or no she said to Molly Dear I never seed this one afore this for all t world like th eyes in a peacock s tail Thou s seen it many a time and oft lass But weren t thou surprised to find Charley here We picked him up at Shields quite by surprise like and when Brunton and me said as we was comin here nought would serve him but comin with us for t see t new year in It s a pity as your mother s ta en this time for t fall ill and want yo back so early Sylvia had taken off her hat and cloak by this time and began to help Molly and a younger unmarried sister in laying out the substantial supper Here continued missus Brunton stick a bit o holly i yon pig s mouth that s the way we do things i Newcassel but folks is so behindhand in Monkshaven It s a fine thing to live in a large town Sylvia an if yo re looking out for a husband I d advise yo to tak one as lives in a town I feel as if I were buried alive comin back here such an out o t way place after t Side wheere there s many a hundred carts and carriages goes past in a day I ve a great mind for t tak yo two lassies back wi me and let yo see a bit o t world may be I may yet Her sister Bessy looked much pleased with this plan but Sylvia was rather inclined to take offence at Molly s patronizing ways and replied I m none so fond o noise and bustle why yo ll not be able to hear yoursels speak wi all them carts and carriages I d rayther bide at home let alone that mother can t spare me It was perhaps a rather ungracious way of answering Molly Brunton s speech and so she felt it to be although her invitation had been none of the most courteously worded She irritated Sylvia still further by repeating her last words Mother can t spare me why mother ll have to spare thee sometime when t time for wedding comes I m none going to be wed said Sylvia and if I were I d niver go far fra mother Eh what a spoilt darling it is How Brunton will laugh when I tell him about yo Brunton s a rare one for laughin It s a great thing to have got such a merry man for a husband Why he has his joke for every one as comes into t shop and he ll ha something funny to say to everything this evenin Bessy saw that Sylvia was annoyed and with more delicacy than her sister she tried to turn the conversation That s a pretty ribbon in thy hair Sylvia I d like to have one o t same pattern Feyther likes pickled walnuts stuck about t round o beef Molly I know what I m about replied missus Brunton with a toss of her married head Bessy resumed her inquiry Is there any more to be had wheere that come fra Sylvia I don t know replied Sylvia It come fra Foster s and yo can ask What might it cost said Betsy fingering an end of it to test its quality I can t tell said Sylvia it were a present Niver mak ado about t price said Molly I ll gi e thee enough on t to tie up thy hair just like Sylvia s Only thou hastn t such wealth o curls as she has it ll niver look t same i thy straight locks And who might it be as give it thee Sylvia asked the unscrupulous if good natured Molly My cousin Philip him as is shopman at Foster s said Sylvia innocently But it was far too good an opportunity for the exercise of Molly s kind of wit for her to pass over Oh oh our cousin Philip is it and he ll not be living so far away from your mother I ve no need be a witch to put two and two together He s a coming here to night isn t he Bessy I wish yo wouldn t talk so Molly said Sylvia me and Philip is good enough friends but we niver think on each other in that way leastways I don t Sweet butter now that s my mother s old fashioned way as if folks must eat sweet butter now a days because her mother did That way continued Molly in the manner that annoyed Sylvia so much repeating her words as if for the purpose of laughing at them That way and pray what is t way yo re speaking on I niver said nought about marrying did I that yo need look so red and shamefaced about yo r cousin Philip But as Brunton says if t cap fits yo put it on I m glad he s comin to night tho for as I m done makin love and courtin it s next best t watch other folks an yo r face Sylvia has letten me into a secret as I d some glimpses on afore I was wed Sylvia secretly determined not to speak a word more to Philip than she could help and wondered how she could ever have liked Molly at all much less have made a companion of her The table was now laid out and nothing remained but to criticize the arrangement a little Bessy was full of admiration Theere Molly said she Yo niver seed more vittle brought together i Newcassel I ll be bound there ll be above half a hundredweight o butcher s meat beside pies and custards I ve eaten no dinner these two days for thinking on t it s been a weary burden on my mind but it s off now I see how well it looks I told mother not to come near it till we d spread it all out and now I ll go fetch her Bessy ran off into the house place It s well enough in a country kind o way said Molly with the faint approbation of condescension But if I d thought on I d ha brought em down a beast or two done i sponge cake wi currants for his eyes to give t table an air The door was opened and Bessy came in smiling and blushing with proud pleasure Her mother followed her on tip toe smoothing down her apron and with her voice subdued to a whisper Ay my lass it is fine But dunnot mak an ado about it let em think it s just our common way If any one says aught about how good t vittle is tak it calm and say we n better i t house it ll mak em eat wi a better appetite and think the more on us Sylvie I m much beholden t ye for comin so early and helpin t lasses but yo mun come in t house place now t folks is gatherin an yo r cousin s been asking after yo a ready Molly gave her a nudge which made Sylvia s face go all aflame with angry embarrassment She was conscious that the watching which Molly had threatened her with began directly for Molly went up to her husband and whispered something to him which set him off in a chuckling laugh and Sylvia was aware that his eyes followed her about with knowing looks all the evening She would hardly speak to Philip and pretended not to see his outstretched hand but passed on to the chimney corner and tried to shelter herself behind the broad back of farmer Corney who had no notion of relinquishing his customary place for all the young people who ever came to the house or for any old people either for that matter It was his household throne and there he sat with no more idea of abdicating in favour of any comer than King George at saint James s But he was glad to see his friends and had paid them the unwonted compliment of shaving on a week day and putting on his Sunday coat The united efforts of wife and children had failed to persuade him to make any farther change in his attire to all their arguments on this head he had replied Them as doesn t like t see me i my work a day wescut and breeches may bide away It was the longest sentence he said that day but he repeated it several times over He was glad enough to see all the young people but they were not of his kidney as he expressed it to himself and he did not feel any call upon himself to entertain them He left that to his bustling wife all smartness and smiles and to his daughters and son in law His efforts at hospitality consisted in sitting still smoking his pipe when any one came he took it out of his mouth for an instant and nodded his head in a cheerful friendly way without a word of speech and then returned to his smoking with the greater relish for the moment s intermission He thought to himself They re a set o young chaps as thinks more on t lasses than on baccy they ll find out their mistake in time give em time give em time And before eight o clock he went as quietly as a man of twelve stone can upstairs to bed having made a previous arrangement with his wife that she should bring him up about two pounds of spiced beef and a hot tumbler of stiff grog But at the beginning of the evening he formed a good screen for Sylvia who was rather a favourite with the old man for twice he spoke to her Feyther smokes Yes said Sylvia Reach me t baccy box my lass And that was all the conversation that passed between her and her nearest neighbour for the first quarter of an hour after she came into company But for all her screen she felt a pair of eyes were fixed upon her with a glow of admiration deepening their honest brightness Somehow look in what direction she would she caught the glance of those eyes before she could see anything else So she played with her apron strings and tried not to feel so conscious There were another pair of eyes not such beautiful sparkling eyes deep set earnest sad nay even gloomy watching her every movement but of this she was not aware Philip had not recovered from the rebuff she had given him by refusing his offered hand and was standing still in angry silence when missus Corney thrust a young woman just arrived upon his attention Come Measter Hepburn here s Nancy Pratt wi out ev n a soul to speak t her an yo mopin theere She says she knows yo by sight fra having dealt at Foster s these six year See if yo can t find summut t say t each other for I mun go pour out tea Dixons an Walkers an Elliotts an Smiths is come said she marking off the families on her fingers as she looked round and called over their names an there s only Will Latham an his two sisters and Roger Harbottle an Taylor t come an they ll turn up afore tea s ended So she went off to her duty at the one table which placed alongside of the dresser was the only article of furniture left in the middle of the room all the seats being arranged as close to the four walls as could be managed The candles of those days gave but a faint light compared to the light of the immense fire which it was a point of hospitality to keep at the highest roaring blazing pitch the young women occupied the seats with the exception of two or three of the elder ones who in an eager desire to show their capability insisted on helping missus Corney in her duties very much to her annoyance as there were certain little contrivances for eking out cream and adjusting the strength of the cups of tea to the worldly position of the intended drinkers which she did not like every one to see The young men whom tea did not embolden and who had as yet had no chance of stronger liquor clustered in rustic shyness round the door not speaking even to themselves except now and then when one apparently the wag of the party made some whispered remark which set them all off laughing but in a minute they checked themselves and passed the back of their hands across their mouths to compose that unlucky feature and then some would try to fix their eyes on the rafters of the ceiling in a manner which was decorous if rather abstracted from the business in hand Most of these were young farmers with whom Philip had nothing in common and from whom in shy reserve he had withdrawn himself when he first came in But now he wished himself among them sooner than set to talk to Nancy Pratt when he had nothing to say And yet he might have had a companion less to his mind for she was a decent young woman of a sober age less inclined to giggle than many of the younger ones But all the time that he was making commonplace remarks to her he was wondering if he had offended Sylvia and why she would not shake hands with him and this pre occupation of his thoughts did not make him an agreeable companion Nancy Pratt who had been engaged for some years to a mate of a whaling ship perceived something of his state of mind and took no offence at it on the contrary she tried to give him pleasure by admiring Sylvia I ve often heerd tell on her said she but I niver thought she s be so pretty and so staid and quiet like too T most part o girls as has looks like hers are always gape gazing to catch other folks s eyes and see what is thought on em but she looks just like a child a bit flustered wi coming into company and gettin into as dark a corner and bidin as still as she can Just then Sylvia lifted up her long dark lashes and catching the same glance which she had so often met before Charley Kinraid was standing talking to Brunton on the opposite side of the fire place she started back into the shadow as if she had not expected it and in so doing spilt her tea all over her gown She could almost have cried she felt herself so awkward and as if everything was going wrong with her she thought that every one would think she had never been in company before and did not know how to behave and while she was thus fluttered and crimson she saw through her tearful eyes Kinraid on his knees before her wiping her gown with his silk pocket handkerchief and heard him speaking through all the buzz of commiserating voices Your cupboard handle is so much i th way I hurt my elbow against it only this very afternoon So perhaps it was no clumsiness of hers as they would all know now since he had so skilfully laid the blame somewhere else and after all it turned out that her accident had been the means of bringing him across to her side which was much more pleasant than having him opposite staring at her for now he began to talk to her and this was very pleasant although she was rather embarrassed at their tete a tete at first I did not know you again when I first saw you said he in a tone which implied a good deal more than was uttered in words I knowed yo at once she replied softly and then she blushed and played with her apron string and wondered if she ought to have confessed to the clearness of her recollection You re grown up into well perhaps it s not manners to say what you re grown into anyhow I shan t forget yo again More playing with her apron string and head hung still lower down though the corners of her mouth would go up in a shy smile of pleasure Philip watched it all as greedily as if it gave him delight Yo r father he ll be well and hearty I hope asked Charley Yes replied Sylvia and then she wished she could originate some remark he would think her so stupid if she just kept on saying such little short bits of speeches and if he thought her stupid he might perhaps go away again to his former place But he was quite far enough gone in love of her beauty and pretty modest ways not to care much whether she talked or no so long as she showed herself so pleasingly conscious of his close neighbourhood I must come and see the old gentleman and your mother too he added more slowly for he remembered that his visits last year had not been quite so much welcomed by Bell Robson as by her husband perhaps it was because of the amount of drink which he and Daniel managed to get through of an evening He resolved this year to be more careful to please the mother of Sylvia When tea was ended there was a great bustle and shifting of places while missus Corney and her daughters carried out trays full of used cups and great platters of uneaten bread and butter into the back kitchen to be washed up after the guests were gone Just because she was so conscious that she did not want to move and break up the little conversation between herself and Kinraid Sylvia forced herself to be as active in the service going on as became a friend of the house and she was too much her mother s own daughter to feel comfortable at leaving all the things in the disorder which to the Corney girls was second nature This milk mun go back to t dairy I reckon said she loading herself with milk and cream Niver fash thysel about it said Nelly Corney Christmas comes but onest a year if it does go sour and mother said she d have a game at forfeits first thing after tea to loosen folks s tongues and mix up t lads and lasses so come along But Sylvia steered her careful way to the cold chill of the dairy and would not be satisfied till she had carried away all the unused provision into some fresher air than that heated by the fires and ovens used for the long day s cooking of pies and cakes and much roast meat When they came back a round of red faced lads as young men up to five and thirty are called in Lancashire and Yorkshire if they are not married before and lasses whose age was not to be defined were playing at some country game in which the women were apparently more interested than the men who looked shamefaced and afraid of each other s ridicule missus Corney however knew how to remedy this and at a sign from her a great jug of beer was brought in This jug was the pride of her heart and was in the shape of a fat man in white knee breeches and a three cornered hat with one arm he supported the pipe in his broad smiling mouth and the other was placed akimbo and formed the handle There was also a great china punch bowl filled with grog made after an old ship receipt current in these parts but not too strong because if their visitors had too much to drink at that early part of the evening it would spoil t fun as Nelly Corney had observed Her father however after the notions of hospitality prevalent at that time in higher circles had stipulated that each man should have enough before he left the house enough meaning in Monkshaven parlance the liberty of getting drunk if they thought fit to do it Before long one of the lads was seized with a fit of admiration for Toby the name of the old gentleman who contained liquor and went up to the tray for a closer inspection He was speedily followed by other amateurs of curious earthenware and by and by mister Brunton who had been charged by his mother in law with the due supplying of liquor by his father in law that every man should have his fill and by his wife and her sisters that no one should have too much at any rate at the beginning of the evening thought fit to carry out Toby to be replenished and a faster spirit of enjoyment and mirth began to reign in the room Kinraid was too well seasoned to care what amount of liquor he drank Philip had what was called a weak head and disliked muddling himself with drink because of the immediate consequence of intense feelings of irritability and the more distant one of a racking headache next day so both these two preserved very much the same demeanour they had held at the beginning of the evening Sylvia was by all acknowledged and treated as the belle When they played at blind man s buff go where she would she was always caught she was called out repeatedly to do what was required in any game as if all had a pleasure in seeing her light figure and deft ways She was sufficiently pleased with this to have got over her shyness with all except Charley When others paid her their rustic compliments she tossed her head and made her little saucy repartees but when he said something low and flattering it was too honey sweet to her heart to be thrown off thus And somehow the more she yielded to this fascination the more she avoided Philip He did not speak flatteringly he did not pay compliments he watched her with discontented longing eyes and grew more inclined every moment as he remembered his anticipation of a happy evening to cry out in his heart vanitas vanitatum And now came crying the forfeits Molly Brunton knelt down her face buried in her mother s lap the latter took out the forfeits one by one and as she held them up said the accustomed formula A fine thing and a very fine thing what must he or she do who owns this thing One or two had been told to kneel to the prettiest bow to the wittiest and kiss those they loved best others had had to bite an inch off the poker or such plays upon words And now came Sylvia s pretty new ribbon that Philip had given her he almost longed to snatch it out of missus Corney s hands and burn it before all their faces so annoyed was he with the whole affair A fine thing and a very fine thing a most particular fine thing choose how she came by it What must she do as owns this thing She must blow out t candle and kiss t candlestick In one instant Kinraid had hold of the only candle within reach all the others had been put up high on inaccessible shelves and other places Sylvia went up and blew out the candle and before the sudden partial darkness was over he had taken the candle into his fingers and according to the traditional meaning of the words was in the place of the candlestick and as such was to be kissed Every one laughed at innocent Sylvia s face as the meaning of her penance came into it every one but Philip who almost choked I m candlestick said Kinraid with less of triumph in his voice than he would have had with any other girl in the room Yo mun kiss t candlestick cried the Corneys or yo ll niver get yo r ribbon back And she sets a deal o store by that ribbon said Molly Brunton maliciously I ll none kiss t candlestick nor him either said Sylvia in a low voice of determination turning away full of confusion Yo ll not get yo r ribbon if yo dunnot cried one and all I don t care for t ribbon said she flashing up with a look at her tormentors now her back was turned to Kinraid An I wunnot play any more at such like games she added with fresh indignation rising in her heart as she took her old place in the corner of the room a little away from the rest Philip s spirits rose and he yearned to go to her and tell her how he approved of her conduct Alas Philip Sylvia though as modest a girl as ever lived was no prude and had been brought up in simple straightforward country ways and with any other young man excepting perhaps Philip s self she would have thought no more of making a rapid pretence of kissing the hand or cheek of the temporary candlestick than our ancestresses did in a much higher rank on similar occasions Kinraid though mortified by his public rejection was more conscious of this than the inexperienced Philip he resolved not to be baulked and watched his opportunity For the time he went on playing as if Sylvia s conduct had not affected him in the least and as if he was hardly aware of her defection from the game As she saw others submitting quite as a matter of course to similar penances she began to be angry with herself for having thought twice about it and almost to dislike herself for the strange consciousness which had made it at the time seem impossible to do what she was told Her eyes kept filling with tears as her isolated position in the gay party the thought of what a fool she had made of herself kept recurring to her mind but no one saw her she thought thus crying and ashamed to be discovered when the party should pause in their game she stole round behind them into the great chamber in which she had helped to lay out the supper with the intention of bathing her eyes and taking a drink of water One instant Charley Kinraid was missing from the circle of which he was the life and soul and then back he came with an air of satisfaction on his face intelligible enough to those who had seen his game but unnoticed by Philip who amidst the perpetual noise and movements around him had not perceived Sylvia s leaving the room until she came back at the end of about a quarter of an hour looking lovelier than ever her complexion brilliant her eyes drooping her hair neatly and freshly arranged tied with a brown ribbon instead of that she was supposed to have forfeited She looked as if she did not wish her return to be noticed stealing softly behind the romping lads and lasses with noiseless motions and altogether such a contrast to them in her cool freshness and modest neatness that both Kinraid and Philip found it difficult to keep their eyes off her But the former had a secret triumph in his heart which enabled him to go on with his merry making as if it absorbed him while Philip dropped out of the crowd and came up to where she was standing silently by missus Corney who arms akimbo was laughing at the frolic and fun around her Sylvia started a little when Philip spoke and kept her soft eyes averted from him after the first glance she answered him shortly but with unaccustomed gentleness He had only asked her when she would like him to take her home and she a little surprised at the idea of going home when to her the evening seemed only beginning had answered Go home I don t know It s New Year s eve Ay but yo r mother ll lie awake till yo come home Sylvie But missus Corney having heard his question broke in with all sorts of upbraidings Go home Not see t New Year in Why what should take em home these six hours Wasn t there a moon as clear as day and did such a time as this come often And were they to break up the party before the New Year came in And was there not supper with a spiced round of beef that had been in pickle pretty nigh sin Martinmas and hams and mince pies and what not And if they thought any evil of her master s going to bed or that by that early retirement he meant to imply that he did not bid his friends welcome why he would not stay up beyond eight o clock for King George upon his throne as he d tell them soon enough if they d only step upstairs and ask him Well she knowed what it was to want a daughter when she was ailing so she d say nought more but hasten supper And this idea now took possession of missus Corney s mind for she would not willingly allow one of her guests to leave before they had done justice to her preparations and cutting her speech short she hastily left Sylvia and Philip together His heart beat fast his feeling towards her had never been so strong or so distinct as since her refusal to kiss the candlestick He was on the point of speaking of saying something explicitly tender when the wooden trencher which the party were using at their play came bowling between him and Sylvia and spun out its little period right betwixt them Every one was moving from chair to chair and when the bustle was over Sylvia was seated at some distance from him and he left standing outside the circle as if he were not playing In fact Sylvia had unconsciously taken his place as actor in the game while he remained spectator and as it turned out an auditor of a conversation not intended for his ears He was wedged against the wall close to the great eight day clock with its round moon like smiling face forming a ludicrous contrast to his long sallow grave countenance which was pretty much at the same level above the sanded floor Before him sat Molly Brunton and one of her sisters their heads close together in too deep talk to attend to the progress of the game Philip s attention was caught by the words I ll lay any wager he kissed her when he ran off into t parlour She s so coy she d niver let him replied Bessy Corney She couldn t help hersel and for all she looks so demure and prim now and then both heads were turned in the direction of Sylvia I m as sure as I m born that Charley is not t chap to lose his forfeit and yet yo see he says nought more about it and she s left off being feared of him There was something in Sylvia s look ay and in Charley Kinraid s too that shot conviction into Philip s mind He watched them incessantly during the interval before supper they were intimate and yet shy with each other in a manner that enraged while it bewildered Philip What was Charley saying to her in that whispered voice as they passed each other Why did they linger near each other Why did Sylvia look so dreamily happy so startled at every call of the game as if recalled from some pleasant idea Why did Kinraid s eyes always seek her while hers were averted or downcast and her cheeks all aflame Philip s dark brow grew darker as he gazed He too started when missus Corney close at his elbow bade him go in to supper along with some of the elder ones who were not playing for the parlour was not large enough to hold all at once even with the squeezing and cramming and sitting together on chairs which was not at all out of etiquette at Monkshaven Philip was too reserved to express his disappointment and annoyance at being thus arrested in his painful watch over Sylvia but he had no appetite for the good things set before him and found it hard work to smile a sickly smile when called upon by Josiah Pratt for applause at some country joke When supper was ended there was some little discussion between missus Corney and her son in law as to whether the different individuals of the company should be called upon for songs or stories as was the wont at such convivial meetings Brunton had been helping his mother in law in urging people to eat heaping their plates over their shoulders with unexpected good things filling the glasses at the upper end of the table and the mugs which supplied the deficiency of glasses at the lower And now every one being satisfied not to say stuffed to repletion the two who had been attending to their wants stood still hot and exhausted They re a most stawed said missus Corney with a pleased smile It ll be manners t ask some one as knows how to sing It may be manners for full men but not for fasting replied Brunton Folks in t next room will be wanting their victual and singing is allays out o tune to empty bellies But there s them here as ll take it ill if they re not asked I heerd Josiah Pratt a clearing his throat not a minute ago an he thinks as much on his singin as a cock does on his crowin If one sings I m afeard all on em will like to hear their own pipes But their dilemma was solved by Bessy Corney who opened the door to see if the hungry ones outside might not come in for their share of the entertainment and in they rushed bright and riotous scarcely giving the first party time to rise from their seats ere they took their places One or two young men released from all their previous shyness helped missus Corney and her daughters to carry off such dishes as were actually empty There was no time for changing or washing of plates but then as missus Corney laughingly observed We re a on us friends and some on us mayhap sweethearts so no need to be particular about plates Them as gets clean ones is lucky and them as doesn t and cannot put up wi plates that has been used mun go without It seemed to be Philip s luck this night to be pent up in places for again the space between the benches and the wall was filled up by the in rush before he had time to make his way out and all he could do was to sit quiet where he was But between the busy heads and over reaching arms he could see Charley and Sylvia sitting close together talking and listening more than eating She was in a new strange state of happiness not to be reasoned about or accounted for but in a state of more exquisite feeling than she had ever experienced before when suddenly lifting her eyes she caught Philip s face of extreme displeasure Oh said she I must go There s Philip looking at me so Philip said Kinraid with a sudden frown upon his face My cousin she replied instinctively comprehending what had flashed into his mind and anxious to disclaim the suspicion of having a lover Mother told him to see me home and he s noan one for staying up late But you needn t go I ll see yo home Mother s but ailing said Sylvia a little conscience smitten at having so entirely forgotten everything in the delight of the present and I said I wouldn t be late And do you allays keep to your word asked he with a tender meaning in his tone Allays leastways I think so replied she blushing Then if I ask you not to forget me and you give me your word I may be sure you ll keep it It wasn t I as forgot you said Sylvia so softly as not to be heard by him He tried to make her repeat what she had said but she would not and he could only conjecture that it was something more tell tale than she liked to say again and that alone was very charming to him I shall walk home with you said he as Sylvia at last rose to depart warned by a further glimpse of Philip s angry face No said she hastily I can t do with yo for somehow she felt the need of pacifying Philip and knew in her heart that a third person joining their tete a tete walk would only increase his displeasure Why not said Charley sharply Oh I don t know only please don t By this time her cloak and hood were on and she was slowly making her way down her side of the room followed by Charley and often interrupted by indignant remonstrances against her departure and the early breaking up of the party Philip stood hat in hand in the doorway between the kitchen and parlour watching her so intently that he forgot to be civil and drew many a jest and gibe upon him for his absorption in his pretty cousin When Sylvia reached him he said Yo re ready at last are yo Yes she replied in her little beseeching tone Yo ve not been wanting to go long han yo I ha but just eaten my supper Yo ve been so full of talk that s been the reason your supper lasted so long That fellow s none going wi us said he sharply as he saw Kinraid rummaging for his cap in a heap of men s clothes thrown into the back kitchen No said Sylvia in affright at Philip s fierce look and passionate tone I telled him not But at that moment the heavy outer door was opened by Daniel Robson himself bright broad and rosy a jolly impersonation of Winter His large drover s coat was covered with snow flakes and through the black frame of the doorway might be seen a white waste world of sweeping fell and field with the dark air filled with the pure down fall Robson stamped his snow laden feet and shook himself well still standing on the mat and letting a cold frosty current of fresh air into the great warm kitchen He laughed at them all before he spoke It s a coud new year as I m lettin in though it s noan t new year yet Yo ll a be snowed up as sure as my name s Dannel if yo stop for twel o clock Yo d better mak haste and go whoam Why Charley my lad how beest ta who d ha thought o seeing thee i these parts again Nay missus nay t new year mun find its way int t house by itsel for me for a ha promised my oud woman to bring Sylvie whoam as quick as may be she s lyin awake and frettin about t snow and what not Thank yo kindly missus but a ll tak nought to eat just a drop o somethin hot to keep out coud and wish yo a the compliments o the season Philip my man yo ll not be sorry to be spared t walk round by Haytersbank such a neet My missus were i such a way about Sylvie that a thought a d just step off mysel and have a peep at yo a and bring her some wraps Yo r sheep will be a folded a reckon Measter Pratt for there ll niver be a nibble o grass to be seen this two month accordin to my readin and a ve been at sea long enough and on land long enough t know signs and wonders It s good stuff that any way and worth comin for after he had gulped down a tumblerful of half and half grog Kinraid if ta doesn t come and see me afore thou rt many days ouder thee and me ll have words Come Sylvie what art ta about keepin me here Here s Mistress Corney mixin me another jorum Well this time a ll give T married happy and t single wed Sylvia was all this while standing by her father quite ready for departure and not a little relieved by his appearance as her convoy home I m ready to see Haytersbank to night master said Kinraid with easy freedom a freedom which Philip envied but could not have imitated although he was deeply disappointed at the loss of his walk with Sylvia when he had intended to exercise the power his aunt had delegated to him of remonstrance if her behaviour had been light or thoughtless and of warning if he saw cause to disapprove of any of her associates After the Robsons had left a blank fell upon both Charley and Philip In a few minutes however the former accustomed to prompt decision resolved that she and no other should be his wife Accustomed to popularity among women and well versed in the incipient signs of their liking for him he anticipated no difficulty in winning her Satisfied with the past and pleasantly hopeful about the future he found it easy to turn his attention to the next prettiest girl in the room and to make the whole gathering bright with his ready good temper and buoyant spirit missus Corney had felt it her duty to press Philip to stay now that as she said he had no one but himself to see home and the new year so near coming in To any one else in the room she would have added the clinching argument A shall take it very unkind if yo go now but somehow she could not say this for in truth Philip s look showed that he would be but a wet blanket on the merriment of the party So with as much civility as could be mustered up between them he took leave Shutting the door behind him he went out into the dreary night and began his lonesome walk back to Monkshaven The cold sleet almost blinded him as the sea wind drove it straight in his face it cut against him as it was blown with drifting force The roar of the wintry sea came borne on the breeze there was more light from the whitened ground than from the dark laden sky above The field paths would have been a matter of perplexity had it not been for the well known gaps in the dyke side which showed the whitened land beyond between the two dark stone walls Yet he went clear and straight along his way having unconsciously left all guidance to the animal instinct which company exists with the human soul and sometimes takes strange charge of the human body when all the nobler powers of the individual are absorbed in acute suffering At length he was in the lane toiling up the hill from which by day Monkshaven might be seen Now all features of the landscape before him were lost in the darkness of night against which the white flakes came closer and nearer thicker and faster On a sudden the bells of Monkshaven church rang out a welcome to the new year seventeen ninety six From the direction of the wind it seemed as if the sound was flung with strength and power right into Philip s face He walked down the hill to its merry sound its merry sound his heavy heart As he entered the long High Street of Monkshaven he could see the watching lights put out in parlour chamber or kitchen The new year had come and expectation was ended Reality had begun He turned to the right into the court where he lodged with Alice Rose There was a light still burning there and cheerful voices were heard He opened the door Alice her daughter and Coulson stood as if awaiting him Hester s wet cloak hung on a chair before the fire she had her hood on for she and Coulson had been to the watch night The solemn excitement of the services had left its traces upon her countenance and in her mind There was a spiritual light in her usually shadowed eyes and a slight flush on her pale cheek Merely personal and self conscious feelings were merged in a loving good will to all her fellow creatures Under the influence of this large charity she forgot her habitual reserve and came forward as Philip entered to meet him with her new year s wishes wishes that she had previously interchanged with the other two A happy new year to you Philip and may God have you in his keeping all the days thereof He took her hand and shook it warmly in reply The flush on her cheek deepened as she withdrew it Alice Rose said something curtly about the lateness of the hour and her being much tired and then she and her daughter went upstairs to the front chamber and Philip and Coulson to that which they shared at the back of the house CHAPTER XIII PERPLEXITIES Coulson and Philip were friendly but not intimate They never had had a dispute they never were confidential with each other in truth they were both reserved and silent men and probably respected each other the more for being so self contained There was a private feeling in Coulson s heart which would have made a less amiable fellow dislike Philip But of this the latter was unconscious they were not apt to exchange many words in the room which they occupied jointly Coulson asked Philip if he had enjoyed himself at the Corneys and Philip replied Not much such parties are noane to my liking And yet thou broke off from t watch night to go there No answer so Coulson went on with a sense of the duty laid upon him to improve the occasion the first that had presented itself since the good old Methodist minister had given his congregation the solemn warning to watch over the opportunities of various kinds which the coming year would present Jonas Barclay told us as the pleasures o this world were like apples o Sodom pleasant to look at but ashes to taste Coulson wisely left Philip to make the application for himself If he did he made no sign but threw himself on his bed with a heavy sigh Are yo not going to undress said Coulson as he covered him up in bed There had been a long pause of silence Philip did not answer him and he thought he had fallen asleep But he was roused from his first slumber by Hepburn s soft movements about the room Philip had thought better of it and with some penitence in his heart for his gruffness to the unoffending Coulson was trying not to make any noise while he undressed But he could not sleep He kept seeing the Corneys kitchen and the scenes that had taken place in it passing like a pageant before his closed eyes Then he opened them in angry weariness at the recurring vision and tried to make out the outlines of the room and the furniture in the darkness The white ceiling sloped into the whitewashed walls and against them he could see the four rush bottomed chairs the looking glass hung on one side the old carved oak chest his own property with the initials of forgotten ancestors cut upon it which held his clothes the boxes that belonged to Coulson sleeping soundly in the bed in the opposite corner of the room the casement window in the roof through which the snowy ground on the steep hill side could be plainly seen and when he got so far as this in the catalogue of the room he fell into a troubled feverish sleep which lasted two or three hours and then he awoke with a start and a consciousness of uneasiness though what about he could not remember at first When he recollected all that had happened the night before it impressed him much more favourably than it had done at the time If not joy hope had come in the morning and at any rate he could be up and be doing for the late wintry light was stealing down the hill side and he knew that although Coulson lay motionless in his sleep it was past their usual time of rising Still as it was new year s Day a time of some licence Philip had mercy on his fellow shopman and did not waken him till just as he was leaving the room Carrying his shoes in his hand he went softly downstairs for he could see from the top of the flight that neither Alice nor her daughter was down yet as the kitchen shutters were not unclosed It was missus Rose s habit to rise early and have all bright and clean against her lodgers came down but then in general she went to rest before nine o clock whereas the last night she had not gone till past twelve Philip went about undoing the shutters and trying to break up the raking coal with as little noise as might be for he had compassion on the tired sleepers The kettle had not been filled probably because missus Rose had been unable to face the storm of the night before in taking it to the pump just at the entrance of the court When Philip came back from filling it he found Alice and Hester both in the kitchen and trying to make up for lost time by hastening over their work Hester looked busy and notable with her gown pinned up behind her and her hair all tucked away under a clean linen cap but Alice was angry with herself for her late sleeping and that and other causes made her speak crossly to Philip as he came in with his snowy feet and well filled kettle Look the there droppin and drippin along t flags as was cleaned last night and meddlin wi woman s work as a man has no business wi Philip was surprised and annoyed He had found relief from his own thoughts in doing what he believed would help others He gave up the kettle to her snatching hands and sate down behind the door in momentary ill temper But the kettle was better filled and consequently heavier than the old woman expected and she could not manage to lift it to the crook from which it generally hung suspended She looked round for Hester but she was gone into the back kitchen In a minute Philip was at her side and had heaved it to its place for her She looked in his face for a moment wistfully but hardly condescended to thank him at least the sound of the words did not pass the lips that formed them Rebuffed by her manner he went back to his old seat and mechanically watched the preparations for breakfast but his thoughts went back to the night before and the comparative ease of his heart was gone The first stir of a new day had made him feel as if he had had no sufficient cause for his annoyance and despondency the previous evening but now condemned to sit quiet he reviewed looks and words and saw just reason for his anxiety After some consideration he resolved to go that very night to Haytersbank and have some talk with either Sylvia or her mother what the exact nature of this purposed conversation should be he did not determine much would depend on Sylvia s manner and mood and on her mother s state of health but at any rate something would be learnt During breakfast something was learnt nearer home though not all that a man less unconscious and more vain than Philip might have discovered He only found out that missus Rose was displeased with him for not having gone to the watch night with Hester according to the plan made some weeks before But he soothed his conscience by remembering that he had made no promise he had merely spoken of his wish to be present at the service about which Hester was speaking and although at the time and for a good while afterwards he had fully intended going yet as there had been William Coulson to accompany her his absence could not have been seriously noticed Still he was made uncomfortable by missus Rose s change of manner once or twice he said to himself that she little knew how miserable he had been during his gay evening as she would persist in calling it or she would not talk at him with such persevering bitterness this morning Before he left for the shop he spoke of his intention of going to see how his aunt was and of paying her a new year s day visit Hepburn and Coulson took it in turns week and week about to go first home to dinner the one who went first sate down with missus Rose and her daughter instead of having his portion put in the oven to keep warm for him To day it was Hepburn s turn to be last All morning the shop was full with customers come rather to offer good wishes than to buy and with an unspoken remembrance of the cake and wine which the two hospitable brothers Foster made a point of offering to all comers on new year s day It was busy work for all for Hester on her side where caps ribbons and women s gear were exclusively sold for the shopmen and boys in the grocery and drapery department Philip was trying to do his business with his mind far away and the consequence was that his manner was not such as to recommend him to the customers some of whom recollected it as very different courteous and attentive if grave and sedate One buxom farmer s wife noticed the change to him She had a little girl with her of about five years old that she had lifted up on the counter and who was watching Philip with anxious eyes occasionally whispering in her mother s ear and then hiding her face against her cloak She s thought a deal o coming to see yo and a dunnot think as yo mind her at all My pretty he s clean forgotten as how he said last new year s day he d gi thee a barley sugar stick if thou d hem him a handkercher by this The child s face was buried in the comfortable breadth of duffle at these words while the little outstretched hand held a small square of coarse linen Ay she s noane forgotten it and has done her five stitches a day bless her and a dunnot believe as yo know her again She s Phoebe Moorsom and a m Hannah and a ve dealt at t shop reg lar this fifteen year I m very sorry said Philip I was up late last night and I m a bit dazed to day Well this is nice work Phoebe and I m sure I m very much beholden to yo And here s five sticks o barley sugar one for every stitch and thank you kindly missus Moorsom too Philip took the handkerchief and hoped he had made honourable amends for his want of recognition But the wee lassie refused to be lifted down and whispered something afresh into her mother s ear who smiled and bade her be quiet Philip saw however that there was some wish ungratified on the part of the little maiden which he was expected to inquire into and accordingly he did his duty She s a little fool she says yo promised to gi e her a kiss and t make her yo r wife The child burrowed her face closer into her mother s neck and refused to allow the kiss which Philip willingly offered All he could do was to touch the back of the little white fat neck with his lips The mother carried her off only half satisfied and Philip felt that he must try and collect his scattered wits and be more alive to the occasion Towards the dinner hour the crowd slackened Hester began to replenish decanters and bottles and to bring out a fresh cake before she went home to dinner and Coulson and Philip looked over the joint present they always made to her on this day It was a silk handkerchief of the prettiest colours they could pick out of the shop intended for her to wear round her neck Each tried to persuade the other to give it to her for each was shy of the act of presentation Coulson was however the most resolute and when she returned from the parlour the little parcel was in Philip s hands Here Hester said he going round the counter to her just as she was leaving the shop It s from Coulson and me a handkerchief for yo to wear and we wish yo a happy New Year and plenty on em and there s many a one wishes the same He took her hand as he said this She went a little paler and her eyes brightened as though they would fill with tears as they met his she could not have helped it do what she would But she only said Thank yo kindly and going up to Coulson she repeated the words and action to him and then they went off together to dinner There was a lull of business for the next hour John and Jeremiah were dining like the rest of the world Even the elder errand boy had vanished Philip rearranged disorderly goods and then sate down on the counter by the window it was the habitual place for the one who stayed behind for excepting on market day there was little or no custom during the noon hour Formerly he used to move the drapery with which the window was ornamented and watch the passers by with careless eye But now though he seemed to gaze abroad he saw nothing but vacancy All the morning since he got up he had been trying to fight through his duties leaning against a hope a hope that first had bowed and then had broke as soon as he really tried its weight There was not a sign of Sylvia s liking for him to be gathered from the most careful recollection of the past evening It was of no use thinking that there was It was better to give it up altogether and at once But what if he could not What if the thought of her was bound up with his life and that once torn out by his own free will the very roots of his heart must come also No he was resolved he would go on as long as there was life there was hope as long as Sylvia remained unpledged to any one else there was a chance for him He would remodel his behaviour to her He could not be merry and light hearted like other young men his nature was not cast in that mould and the early sorrows that had left him a lonely orphan might have matured but had not enlivened his character He thought with some bitterness on the power of easy talking about trifles which some of those he had met with at the Corneys had exhibited But then he felt stirring within him a force of enduring love which he believed to be unusual and which seemed as if it must compel all things to his wish in the end A year or so ago he had thought much of his own cleverness and his painfully acquired learning and he had imagined that these were the qualities which were to gain Sylvia But now whether he had tried them and had failed to win even her admiration or whether some true instinct had told him that a woman s love may be gained in many ways sooner than by mere learning he was only angry with himself for his past folly in making himself her school nay her taskmaster To night though he would start off on a new tack He would not even upbraid her for her conduct the night before he had shown her his displeasure at the time but she should see how tender and forgiving he could be He would lure her to him rather than find fault with her There had perhaps been too much of that already When Coulson came back Philip went to his solitary dinner In general he was quite alone while eating it but to day Alice Rose chose to bear him company She watched him with cold severe eye for some time until he had appeased his languid appetite Then she began with the rebuke she had in store for him a rebuke the motives to which were not entirely revealed even to herself Thou re none so keen after thy food as common she began Plain victuals goes ill down after feastin Philip felt the colour mount to his face he was not in the mood for patiently standing the brunt of the attack which he saw was coming and yet he had a reverent feeling for woman and for age He wished she would leave him alone but he only said I had nought but a slice o cold beef for supper if you ll call that feasting Neither do godly ways savour delicately after the pleasures of the world continued she unheeding his speech Thou wert wont to seek the house of the Lord and I thought well on thee but of late thou saint changed and fallen away and I mun speak what is in my heart towards thee Mother said Philip impatiently both he and Coulson called Alice mother at times I don t think I am fallen away and any way I cannot stay now to be it s new year s Day and t shop is throng But Alice held up her hand Her speech was ready and she must deliver it Shop here shop there The flesh and the devil are gettin hold on yo and yo need more nor iver to seek t ways o grace New year s day comes and says Watch and pray and yo say Nay I ll seek feasts and market places and let times and seasons come and go without heedin into whose presence they re hastening me Time was Philip when thou d niver ha letten a merry making keep thee fra t watch night and t company o the godly I tell yo it was no merry making to me said Philip with sharpness as he left the house Alice sat down on the nearest seat and leant her head on her wrinkled hand He s tangled and snared said she my heart has yearned after him and I esteemed him as one o the elect And more nor me yearns after him O Lord I have but one child O Lord spare her But o er and above a I would like to pray for his soul that Satan might not have it for he came to me but a little lad At that moment Philip smitten by his conscience for his hard manner of speech came back but Alice did not hear or see him till he was close by her and then he had to touch her to recall her attention Mother said he I was wrong I m fretted by many things I shouldn t ha spoken so It was ill done of me Oh my lad said she looking up and putting her thin arm on his shoulder as he stooped Satan is desiring after yo that he may sift yo as wheat Bide at whoam bide at whoam and go not after them as care nought for holy things Why need yo go to Haytersbank this night Philip reddened He could not and would not give it up and yet it was difficult to resist the pleading of the usually stern old woman Nay said he withdrawing himself ever so little from her hold my aunt is but ailing they re my own flesh and blood and as good folks as needs be though they mayn t be o our o your way o thinking in a things Our ways your ways o thinking says he as if they were no longer his n And as good folks as need be repeated she with returning severity Them s Satan s words tho yo spoke em Philip I can do nought again Satan but I can speak to them as can an we ll see which pulls hardest for it ll be better for thee to be riven and rent i twain than to go body and soul to hell But don t think mother said Philip his last words of conciliation for the clock had given warning for two as I m boun for hell just because I go t see my own folks all I ha left o kin And once more after laying his hand with as much of a caress as was in his nature on hers he left the house Probably Alice would have considered the first words that greeted Philip on his entrance into the shop as an answer to her prayer for they were such as put a stop to his plan of going to see Sylvia that evening and if Alice had formed her inchoate thoughts into words Sylvia would have appeared as the nearest earthly representative of the spirit of temptation whom she dreaded for Philip As he took his place behind the counter Coulson said to him in a low voice Jeremiah Foster has been round to bid us to sup wi him to night He says that he and John have a little matter o business to talk over with us A glance from his eyes to Philip told the latter that Coulson believed the business spoken of had something to do with the partnership respecting which there had been a silent intelligence for some time between the shopmen And what did thou say asked Philip doggedly unwilling even yet to give up his purposed visit Say why what could a say but that we d come There was summat up for sure and summat as he thought we should be glad on I could tell it fra t look on his face I don t think as I can go said Philip feeling just then as if the long hoped for partnership was as nothing compared to his plan It was always distasteful to him to have to give up a project or to disarrange an intended order of things such was his nature but to day it was absolute pain to yield his own purpose Why man alive said Coulson in amaze at his reluctance I didn t say I mightn t go said Philip weighing consequences until called off to attend to customers In the course of the afternoon however he felt himself more easy in deferring his visit to Haytersbank till the next evening Charley Kinraid entered the shop accompanied by Molly Brunton and her sisters and though they all went towards Hester s side of the shop and Philip and Coulson had many people to attend to yet Hepburn s sharpened ears caught much of what the young women were saying From that he gathered that Kinraid had promised them new year s gifts for the purchase of which they were come and after a little more listening he learnt that Kinraid was returning to Shields the next day having only come over to spend a holiday with his relations and being tied with ship s work at the other end They all talked together lightly and merrily as if his going or staying was almost a matter of indifference to himself and his cousins The principal thought of the young women was to secure the articles they most fancied Charley Kinraid was so Philip thought especially anxious that the youngest and prettiest should be pleased Hepburn watched him perpetually with a kind of envy of his bright courteous manner the natural gallantry of the sailor If it were but clear that Sylvia took as little thought of him as he did of her to all appearance Philip could even have given him praise for manly good looks and a certain kind of geniality of disposition which made him ready to smile pleasantly at all strangers from babies upwards As the party turned to leave the shop they saw Philip the guest of the night before and they came over to shake hands with him across the counter Kinraid s hand was proffered among the number Last night Philip could not have believed it possible that such a demonstration of fellowship should have passed between them and perhaps there was a slight hesitation of manner on his part for some idea or remembrance crossed Kinraid s mind which brought a keen searching glance into the eyes which for a moment were fastened on Philip s face In spite of himself and during the very action of hand shaking Philip felt a cloud come over his face not altering or moving his features but taking light and peace out of his countenance Molly Brunton began to say something and he gladly turned to look at her She was asking him why he went away so early for they had kept it up for four hours after he left and last of all she added turning to Kinraid her cousin Charley had danced a hornpipe among the platters on the ground Philip hardly knew what he said in reply the mention of that pas seul lifted such a weight off his heart He could smile now after his grave fashion and would have shaken hands again with Kinraid had it been required for it seemed to him that no one caring ever so little in the way that he did for Sylvia could have borne four mortal hours of a company where she had been and was not least of all could have danced a hornpipe either from gaiety of heart or even out of complaisance He felt as if the yearning after the absent one would have been a weight to his legs as well as to his spirit and he imagined that all men were like himself CHAPTER XIV PARTNERSHIP As darkness closed in and the New Year s throng became scarce Philip s hesitation about accompanying Coulson faded away He was more comfortable respecting Sylvia and his going to see her might be deferred and after all he felt that the wishes of his masters ought to be attended to and the honour of an invitation to the private house of Jeremiah not to be slighted for anything short of a positive engagement Besides the ambitious man of business existed strongly in Philip It would never do to slight advances towards the second great earthly object in his life one also on which the first depended So when the shop was closed the two set out down Bridge Street to cross the river to the house of Jeremiah Foster They stood a moment on the bridge to breathe the keen fresh sea air after their busy day The waters came down swollen full and dark with rapid rushing speed from the snow fed springs high up on the moorland above The close packed houses in the old town seemed a cluster of white roofs irregularly piled against the more unbroken white of the hill side Lights twinkled here and there in the town and were slung from stern and bow of the ships in the harbour The air was very still settling in for a frost so still that all distant sounds seemed near the rumble of a returning cart in the High Street the voices on board ship the closing of shutters and barring of doors in the new town to which they were bound But the sharp air was filled as it were with saline particles in a freezing state little pungent crystals of sea salt burning lips and cheeks with their cold keenness It would not do to linger here in the very centre of the valley up which passed the current of atmosphere coming straight with the rushing tide from the icy northern seas Besides there was the unusual honour of a supper with Jeremiah Foster awaiting them He had asked each of them separately to a meal before now but they had never gone together and they felt that there was something serious in the conjuncture They began to climb the steep heights leading to the freshly built rows of the new town of Monkshaven feeling as if they were rising into aristocratic regions where no shop profaned the streets Jeremiah Foster s house was one of six undistinguished in size or shape or colour but noticed in the daytime by all passers by for its spotless cleanliness of lintel and doorstep window and window frame The very bricks seemed as though they came in for the daily scrubbing which brightened handle knocker all down to the very scraper The two young men felt as shy of the interview with their master under such unusual relations of guest and host as a girl does of her first party Each rather drew back from the decided step of knocking at the door but with a rebuffing shake at his own folly Philip was the one to give a loud single rap As if they had been waited for the door flew open and a middle aged servant stood behind as spotless and neat as the house itself and smiled a welcome to the familiar faces Let me dust yo a bit William said she suiting the action to the word You ve been leanin again some whitewash a ll be bound Ay Philip continued she turning him round with motherly freedom yo ll do if yo ll but gi your shoon a polishin wipe on yon other mat This n for takin t roughest mud off Measter allays polishes on that In the square parlour the same precise order was observed Every article of furniture was free from speck of dirt or particle of dust and everything was placed either in a parallel line or at exact right angles with every other Even John and Jeremiah sat in symmetry on opposite sides of the fire place the very smiles on their honest faces seemed drawn to a line of exactitude Such formality however admirable was not calculated to promote ease it was not until after supper until a good quantity of Yorkshire pie had been swallowed and washed down too with the best and most generous wine in Jeremiah s cellar that there was the least geniality among them in spite of the friendly kindness of the host and his brother The long silence during which mute thanks for the meal were given having come to an end Jeremiah called for pipes and three of the party began to smoke Politics in those days were tickle subjects to meddle with even in the most private company The nation was in a state of terror against France and against any at home who might be supposed to sympathise with the enormities she had just been committing The oppressive act against seditious meetings had been passed the year before and people were doubtful to what extremity of severity it might be construed Even the law authorities forgot to be impartial but either their alarms or their interests made too many of them vehement partisans instead of calm arbiters and thus destroyed the popular confidence in what should have been considered the supreme tribunal of justice Yet for all this there were some who dared to speak of reform of Parliament as a preliminary step to fair representation of the people and to a reduction of the heavy war taxation that was imminent if not already imposed But these pioneers of eighteen thirty were generally obnoxious The great body of the people gloried in being Tories and haters of the French with whom they were on tenter hooks to fight almost unaware of the rising reputation of the young Corsican warrior whose name would be used ere a dozen years had passed to hush English babies with a terror such as that of Marlborough once had for the French At such a place as Monkshaven all these opinions were held in excess One or two might for the mere sake of argument dispute on certain points of history or government but they took care to be very sure of their listeners before such arguments touched on anything of the present day for it had been not unfrequently found that the public duty of prosecuting opinions not your own overrode the private duty of respecting confidence Most of the Monkshaven politicians confined themselves therefore to such general questions as these Could an Englishman lick more than four Frenchmen at a time What was the proper punishment for members of the Corresponding Society correspondence with the French directory hanging and quartering or burning Would the forthcoming child of the Princess of Wales be a boy or a girl If a girl would it be more loyal to call it Charlotte or Elizabeth The Fosters were quite secure enough of their guests this evening to have spoken freely on politics had they been so inclined And they did begin on the outrages which had been lately offered to the king in crossing saint James s Park to go and open the House of Lords but soon so accustomed were their minds to caution and restraint the talk dropped down to the high price of provisions Bread at one s three d the quartern loaf according to the London test Wheat at one hundred twenty s per quarter as the home baking northerners viewed the matter and then the conversation died away to an ominous silence John looked at Jeremiah as if asking him to begin Jeremiah was the host and had been a married man Jeremiah returned the look with the same meaning in it John though a bachelor was the elder brother The great church bell brought from the Monkshaven monastery centuries ago high up on the opposite hill side began to ring nine o clock it was getting late Jeremiah began It seems a bad time for starting any one on business wi prices and taxes and bread so dear but John and I are getting into years and we ve no children to follow us yet we would fain draw out of some of our worldly affairs We would like to give up the shop and stick to banking to which there seemeth a plain path But first there is the stock and goodwill of the shop to be disposed on A dead pause This opening was not favourable to the hopes of the two moneyless young men who had been hoping to succeed their masters by the more gradual process of partnership But it was only the kind of speech that had been agreed upon by the two brothers with a view of impressing on Hepburn and Coulson the great and unusual responsibility of the situation into which the Fosters wished them to enter In some ways the talk of many was much less simple and straightforward in those days than it is now The study of effect shown in the London diners out of the last generation who prepared their conversation beforehand was not without its parallel in humbler spheres and for different objects than self display The brothers Foster had all but rehearsed the speeches they were about to make this evening They were aware of the youth of the parties to whom they were going to make a most favourable proposal and they dreaded that if that proposal was too lightly made it would be too lightly considered and the duties involved in it too carelessly entered upon So the role of one brother was to suggest that of the other to repress The young men too had their reserves They foresaw and had long foreseen what was coming that evening They were impatient to hear it in distinct words and yet they had to wait as if unconscious during all the long preamble Do age and youth never play the same parts now To return John Foster replied to his brother The stock and goodwill That would take much wealth And there will be fixtures to be considered Philip canst thee tell me the exact amount of stock in the shop at present It had only just been taken Philip had it at his fingers ends One thousand nine hundred and forty one pounds thirteen shillings and twopence Coulson looked at him in a little dismay and could not repress a sigh The figures put into words and spoken aloud seemed to indicate so much larger an amount of money than when quickly written down in numerals But Philip read the countenances nay by some process of which he was not himself aware he read the minds of the brothers and felt no dismay at what he saw there And the fixtures asked John Foster The appraiser valued them at four hundred and thirty five pounds three and sixpence when father died We have added to them since but we will reckon them at that How much does that make with the value of the stock Two thousand one hundred and seventy six pounds sixteen shillings and eightpence said Philip Coulson had done the sum quicker but was too much disheartened by the amount to speak And the goodwill asked the pitiless John What dost thee set that at I think brother that that would depend on who came forward with the purchase money of the stock and fixtures To some folks we might make it sit easy if they were known to us and those as we wished well to If Philip and William here for instance said they d like to purchase the business I reckon thee and me would not ask em so much as we should ask Millers Millers was an upstart petty rival shop at the end of the bridge in the New Town I wish Philip and William was to come after us said John But that s out of the question he continued knowing all the while that far from being out of the question it was the very question and that it was as good as settled at this very time No one spoke Then Jeremiah went on It s out of the question I reckon He looked at the two young men Coulson shook his head Philip more bravely said I have fifty three pounds seven and fourpence in yo r hands Master John and it s all I have i the world It s a pity said John and again they were silent Half past nine struck It was time to be beginning to make an end Perhaps brother they have friends who could advance em the money We might make it sit light to them for the sake of their good service Philip replied There s no one who can put forwards a penny for me I have but few kin and they have little to spare beyond what they need Coulson said My father and mother have nine on us Let alone let alone said John relenting fast for he was weary of his part of cold stern prudence Brother I think we have enough of this world s goods to do what we like wi our own Jeremiah was a little scandalized at the rapid melting away of assumed character and took a good pull at his pipe before he replied Upwards of two thousand pounds is a large sum to set on the well being and well doing of two lads the elder of whom is not three and twenty I fear we must look farther a field Why John replied Jeremiah it was but yesterday thee saidst thee would rather have Philip and William than any men o fifty that thee knowed And now to bring up their youth again them Well well t half on it is thine and thou shall do even as thou wilt But I think as I must have security for my moiety for it s a risk a great risk Have ye any security to offer any expectations any legacies as other folk have a life interest in at present No neither of them had So Jeremiah rejoined Then I suppose I mun do as thee dost John and take the security of character And it s a great security too lads and t best o all and one that I couldn t ha done without no not if yo d pay me down five thousand for goodwill and stock and fixtures For John Foster and Son has been a shop i Monkshaven this eighty years and more and I dunnot think there s a man living or dead for that matter as can say Fosters wronged him of a penny or gave short measure to a child or a Cousin Betty They all four shook hands round with the same heartiness as if it had been a legal ceremony necessary to the completion of the partnership The old men s faces were bright with smiles the eyes of the young ones sparkled with hope But after all said Jeremiah we ve not told you particulars Yo re thanking us for a pig in a poke but we had more forethought and we put all down on a piece o paper He took down a folded piece of paper from the mantel shelf put on his horn spectacles and began to read aloud occasionally peering over his glasses to note the effect on the countenances of the young men The only thing he was in the habit of reading aloud was a chapter in the Bible daily to his housekeeper servant and like many he reserved a peculiar tone for that solemn occupation a tone which he unconsciously employed for the present enumeration of pounds shillings and pence Average returns of the last three years one hundred and twenty seven pounds three shillings and seven penny and one sixth a week Profits thereupon thirty four per cent as near as may be Clear profits of the concern after deducting all expenses except rent for t house is our own one thousand two hundred and two pound a year This was far more than either Hepburn or Coulson had imagined it to be and a look of surprise almost amounting to dismay crept over their faces in spite of their endeavour to keep simply motionless and attentive It s a deal of money lads and the Lord give you grace to guide it said Jeremiah putting down his paper for a minute Amen said John shaking his head to give effect to his word Now what we propose is this continued Jeremiah beginning afresh to refer to his paper We will call t value of stock and fixtures two thousand one hundred and fifty You may have John Holden appraiser and auctioneer in to set a price on them if yo will or yo may look over books and bills or better still do both and so check one again t other but for t sake o making the ground o the bargain I state the sum as above and I reckon it so much capital left in yo r hands for the use o which yo re bound to pay us five per cent quarterly that s one hundred and seven pound ten per annum at least for t first year and after it will be reduced by the gradual payment on our money which must be at the rate of twenty per cent thus paying us our principal back in five years And the rent including all back yards right of wharfage warehouse and premises is reckoned by us to be sixty five pound per annum So yo will have to pay us John and Jeremiah Foster brothers six hundred and twelve pound ten out of the profits of the first year leaving at the present rate of profits about five hundred and eighty nine pound ten for the share to be divided between yo The plan had in all its details been carefully arranged by the two brothers They were afraid lest Hepburn and Coulson should be dazzled by the amount of profits and had so arranged the sliding scale of payment as to reduce the first year s income to what the elder men thought a very moderate sum but what to the younger ones appeared an amount of wealth such as they who had neither of them ever owned much more than fifty pounds considered almost inexhaustible It was certainly a remarkable instance of prosperity and desert meeting together so early in life For a moment or two the brothers were disappointed at not hearing any reply from either of them Then Philip stood up for he felt as if anything he could say sitting down would not be sufficiently expressive of gratitude and William instantly followed his example Hepburn began in a formal manner something the way in which he had read in the York newspapers that honourable members returned thanks when their health was given I can hardly express my feelings Coulson nudged him his feelings too of gratitude Oh Master John Master Jeremiah I thought it might come i time nay I ve thought it might come afore long but I niver thought as it would be so much or made so easy We ve got good kind friends we have have we not William and we ll do our best and I hope as we shall come up to their wishes Philip s voice quivered a little as some remembrance passed across his mind at this unusual moment of expansion out it came I wish mother could ha seen this day She shall see a better day my lad when thy name and William s is painted over t shop door and J and J Foster blacked out Nay master said William that mun never be I d a most sooner not come in for the business Anyhow it must be late J and J Foster and I m not sure as I can stomach that Well well William said John Foster highly gratified there be time enough to talk over that There was one thing more to be said was there not brother Jeremiah We do not wish to have this talked over in Monkshaven until shortly before the time when yo must enter on the business We have our own arrangements to make wi regard to the banking concern and there ll be lawyer s work to do after yo ve examined books and looked over stock again together may be we ve overstated it or t fixtures aren t worth so much as we said Anyhow yo must each on yo give us yo r word for to keep fra naming this night s conversation to any one Meantime Jeremiah and I will have to pay accounts and take a kind of farewell of the merchants and manufacturers with whom Fosters have had dealings this seventy or eighty year and when and where it seems fitting to us we will take one of yo to introduce as our successors and friends But all that s to come But yo must each give us yo r word not to name what has passed here to any one till further speech on the subject has passed between us Coulson immediately gave the promise Philip s assent came lagging He had thought of Sylvia living almost as much as of the dead mother whose last words had been a committal of her child to the Father of the friendless and now that a short delay was placed between the sight of the cup and his enjoyment of it there was an impatient chafing in the mind of the composed and self restrained Philip and then repentance quick as lightning effaced the feeling and he pledged himself to the secrecy which was enjoined Some few more details as to their mode of procedure of verifying the Fosters statements which to the younger men seemed a perfectly unnecessary piece of business of probable journeys and introductions and then farewell was bidden and Hepburn and Coulson were in the passage donning their wraps and rather to their indignation being assisted therein by Martha who was accustomed to the office with her own master Suddenly they were recalled into the parlour John Foster was fumbling with the papers a little nervously Jeremiah spoke We have not thought it necessary to commend Hester Rose to you if she had been a lad she would have had a third o the business along wi yo Being a woman it s ill troubling her with a partnership better give her a fixed salary till such time as she marries He looked a little knowingly and curiously at the faces of the young men he addressed William Coulson seemed sheepish and uncomfortable but said nothing leaving it as usual to Philip to be spokesman If we hadn t cared for Hester for hersel master we should ha cared for her as being forespoken by yo Yo and Master John shall fix what we ought t pay her and I think I may make bold to say that as our income rises hers shall too eh Coulson a sound of assent quite distinct enough for we both look on her as a sister and on Alice like a mother as I told her only this very day CHAPTER XV A DIFFICULT QUESTION Philip went to bed with that kind of humble penitent gratitude in his heart which we sometimes feel after a sudden revulsion of feeling from despondency to hope The night before it seemed as if all events were so arranged as to thwart him in his dearest wishes he felt now as if his discontent and repining not twenty four hours before had been almost impious so great was the change in his circumstances for the better Now all seemed promising for the fulfilment of what he most desired He was almost convinced that he was mistaken in thinking that Kinraid had had anything more than a sailor s admiration for a pretty girl with regard to Sylvia at any rate he was going away to morrow in all probability not to return for another year for Greenland ships left for the northern seas as soon as there was a chance of the ice being broken up and ere then he himself might speak out openly laying before her parents all his fortunate prospects and before her all his deep passionate love So this night his prayers were more than the mere form that they had been the night before they were a vehement expression of gratitude to God for having as it were interfered on his behalf to grant him the desire of his eyes and the lust of his heart He was like too many of us he did not place his future life in the hands of God and only ask for grace to do His will in whatever circumstances might arise but he yearned in that terrible way after a blessing which when granted under such circumstances too often turns out to be equivalent to a curse And that spirit brings with it the material and earthly idea that all events that favour our wishes are answers to our prayer and so they are in one sense but they need prayer in a deeper and higher spirit to keep us from the temptation to evil which such events invariably bring with them Philip little knew how Sylvia s time had been passed that day If he had he would have laid down this night with even a heavier heart than he had done on the last Charley Kinraid accompanied his cousins as far as the spot where the path to Haytersbank Farm diverged Then he stopped his merry talk and announced his intention of going to see farmer Robson Bessy Corney looked disappointed and a little sulky but her sister Molly Brunton laughed and said Tell truth lad Dannel Robson d niver have a call fra thee if he hadn t a pretty daughter Indeed but he would replied Charley rather annoyed when I ve said a thing I do it I promised last night to go see him besides I like the old man Well when shall we tell mother yo re comin whoam Toward eight o clock may be sooner Why it s bare five now bless t lad does he think o staying theere a neet and they up so late last night and missus Robson ailing beside Mother ll not think it kind on yo either will she Bess I dunno Charley mun do as he likes I daresay no one ll miss him if he does bide away till eight Well well I can t tell what I shall do but yo d best not stop lingering here for it s getting on and there ll be a keen frost by t look o the stars Haytersbank was closed for the night as far as it ever was closed there were no shutters to the windows nor did they care to draw the inside curtains so few were the passers by The house door was fastened but the shippen door a little on in the same long low block of building stood open and a dim light made an oblong upon the snowy ground outside As Kinraid drew near he heard talking there and a woman s voice he threw a passing glance through the window into the fire lit house place and seeing missus Robson asleep by the fireside in her easy chair he went on There was the intermittent sound of the sharp whistling of milk into the pail and Kester sitting on a three legged stool cajoling a capricious cow into letting her fragrant burden flow Sylvia stood near the farther window ledge on which a horn lantern was placed pretending to knit at a gray worsted stocking but in reality laughing at Kester s futile endeavours and finding quite enough to do with her eyes in keeping herself untouched by the whisking tail or the occasional kick The frosty air was mellowed by the warm and odorous breath of the cattle breath that hung about the place in faint misty clouds There was only a dim light such as it was it was not dearly defined against the dark heavy shadow in which the old black rafters and manger and partitions were enveloped As Charley came to the door Kester was saying Quiet wi thee wench Theere now she s a beauty if she ll stand still There s niver sich a cow i t Riding if she ll only behave hersel She s a bonny lass she is let down her milk theere s a pretty Why Kester laughed Sylvia thou rt asking her for her milk wi as many pretty speeches as if thou wert wooing a wife Hey lass said Kester turning a bit towards her and shutting one eye to cock the other the better upon her an operation which puckered up his already wrinkled face into a thousand new lines and folds An how does thee know how a man woos a wife that thee talks so knowin about it That s tellin Some un s been tryin it on thee There s niver a one been so impudent said Sylvia reddening and tossing her head a little I d like to see em try me Well well said Kester wilfully misunderstanding her meaning thou mun be patient wench and if thou s a good lass may be thy turn ll come and they ll try it I wish thou d talk of what thou s some knowledge on Kester i stead of i that silly way replied Sylvia Then a mun talk no more bout women for they re past knowin an druv e en King Solomon silly At this moment Charley stepped in Sylvia gave a little start and dropped her ball of worsted Kester made as though absorbed in his task of cajoling Black Nell but his eyes and ears were both vigilant I was going into the house but I saw yo r mother asleep and I didn t like to waken her so I just came on here Is yo r father to the fore No said Sylvia hanging down her head a little wondering if he could have heard the way in which she and Kester had been talking and thinking over her little foolish jokes with anger against herself Father is gone to Winthrop about some pigs as he s heerd on He ll not be back till seven o clock or so It was but half past five and Sylvia in the irritation of the moment believed that she wished Kinraid would go But she would have been extremely disappointed if he had Kinraid himself seemed to have no thought of the kind He saw with his quick eyes not unaccustomed to women that his coming so unexpectedly had fluttered Sylvia and anxious to make her quite at her ease with him and not unwilling to conciliate Kester he addressed his next speech to him with the same kind of air of interest in the old man s pursuit that a young man of a different class sometimes puts on when talking to the chaperone of a pretty girl in a ball room That s a handsome beast yo ve just been milking master Ay but handsome is as handsome does It were only yesterday as she aimed her leg right at t pail wi t afterings in She knowed it were afterings as well as any Christian and t more t mischief t better she likes it an if a hadn t been too quick for her it would have a gone swash down i t litter This n s a far better cow i t long run she s just a steady goer as the milky down pour came musical and even from the stall next to Black Nell s Sylvia was knitting away vigorously thinking all the while that it was a great pity she had not put on a better gown or even a cap with brighter ribbon and quite unconscious how very pretty she looked standing against the faint light her head a little bent down her hair catching bright golden touches as it fell from under her little linen cap her pink bed gown confined by her apron string giving a sort of easy grace to her figure her dark full linsey petticoat short above her trim ancles looking far more suitable to the place where she was standing than her long gown of the night before would have done Kinraid was wanting to talk to her and to make her talk but was uncertain how to begin In the meantime Kester went on with the subject last spoken about Black Nell s at her fourth calf now so she ought to ha left off her tricks and turned sober like But bless yo there s some cows as ll be skittish till they re fat for t butcher Not but what a like milking her better nor a steady goer a man has allays summat to be watchin for and a m kind o set up when a ve mastered her at last T young missus theere she s mighty fond o comin t see Black Nell at her tantrums She d niver come near me if a cows were like this n Do you often come and see the cows milked asked Kinraid Many a time said Sylvia smiling a little Why when we re throng I help Kester but now we ve only Black Nell and Daisy giving milk Kester knows as I can milk Black Nell quite easy she continued half vexed that Kester had not named this accomplishment Ay when she s in a good frame o mind as she is sometimes But t difficulty is to milk her at all times I wish I d come a bit sooner I should like t have seen you milk Black Nell addressing Sylvia Yo d better come to morrow e en and see what a hand she ll mak on her said Kester To morrow night I shall be far on my road back to Shields To morrow said Sylvia suddenly looking up at him and then dropping her eyes as she found he had been watching for the effect of his intelligence on her I mun be back at t whaler where I m engaged continued he She s fitting up after a fresh fashion and as I ve been one as wanted new ways I mun be on the spot for t look after her Maybe I shall take a run down here afore sailing in March I m sure I shall try There was a good deal meant and understood by these last few words The tone in which they were spoken gave them a tender intensity not lost upon either of the hearers Kester cocked his eye once more but with as little obtrusiveness as he could and pondered the sailor s looks and ways He remembered his coming about the place the winter before and how the old master had then appeared to have taken to him but at that time Sylvia had seemed to Kester too little removed from a child to have either art or part in Kinraid s visits now however the case was different Kester in his sphere among his circle of acquaintance narrow though it was had heard with much pride of Sylvia s bearing away the bell at church and at market wherever girls of her age were congregated He was a north countryman so he gave out no further sign of his feelings than his mistress and Sylvia s mother had done on a like occasion T lass is weel enough said he but he grinned to himself and looked about and listened to the hearsay of every lad wondering who was handsome and brave and good enough to be Sylvia s mate Now of late it had seemed to the canny farm servant pretty clear that Philip Hepburn was after her and to Philip Kester had an instinctive objection a kind of natural antipathy such as has existed in all ages between the dwellers in a town and those in the country between agriculture and trade So while Kinraid and Sylvia kept up their half tender half jesting conversation Kester was making up his slow persistent mind as to the desirability of the young man then present as a husband for his darling as much from his being other than Philip in every respect as from the individual good qualities he possessed Kester s first opportunity of favouring Kinraid s suit consisted in being as long as possible over his milking so never were cows that required such stripping or were expected to yield such afterings as Black Nell and Daisy that night But all things must come to an end and at length Kester got up from his three legged stool on seeing what the others did not that the dip candle in the lantern was coming to an end and that in two or three minutes more the shippen would be in darkness and so his pails of milk be endangered In an instant Sylvia had started out of her delicious dreamland her drooping eyes were raised and recovered their power of observation her ruddy arms were freed from the apron in which she had enfolded them as a protection from the gathering cold and she had seized and adjusted the wooden yoke across her shoulders ready to bear the brimming milk pails to the dairy Look yo at her exclaimed Kester to Charley as he adjusted the fragrant pails on the yoke She thinks she s missus a ready and she s allays for carrying in t milk since t rhumatiz cotched my shouther i t back end and when she says Yea it s as much as my heed s worth to say Nay And along the wall round the corner down the round slippery stones of the rambling farmyard behind the buildings did Sylvia trip safe and well poised though the ground wore all one coating of white snow and in many places was so slippery as to oblige Kinraid to linger near Kester the lantern bearer Kester did not lose his opportunity though the cold misty night air provoked his asthmatic cough when ever he breathed and often interrupted his words She s a good wench a good wench as iver was an come on a good stock an that s summat whether in a cow or a woman A ve known her from a baby she s a reet down good un By this time they had reached the back kitchen door just as Sylvia had unladen herself and was striking a light with flint and tinder The house seemed warm and inviting after the piercing outer air although the kitchen into which they entered contained only a raked and slumbering fire at one end over which on a crook hung the immense pan of potatoes cooking for the evening meal of the pigs To this pan Kester immediately addressed himself swinging it round with ease owing to the admirable simplicity of the old fashioned machinery Kinraid stood between Kester and the door into the dairy through which Sylvia had vanished with the milk He half wished to conciliate Kester by helping him but he seemed also attracted by a force which annihilated his will to follow her wherever she went Kester read his mind Let alone let alone said he pigs vittle takes noan such dainty carryin as milk A may set it down an niver spill a drop she s noan fit for t serve swine nor yo other mester better help her t teem t milk So Kinraid followed the light his light into the icy chill of the dairy where the bright polished tin cans were quickly dimmed with the warm sweet smelling milk that Sylvia was emptying out into the brown pans In his haste to help her Charley took up one of the pails Eh that n s to be strained Yo have a the cow s hair in Mother s very particular and cannot abide a hair So she went over to her awkward dairymaid and before she but not before he was aware of the sweet proximity she was adjusting his happy awkward arms to the new office of holding a milk strainer over the bowl and pouring the white liquid through it There said she looking up for a moment and half blushing now yo ll know how to do it next time I wish next time was to come now said Kinraid but she had returned to her own pail and seemed not to hear him He followed her to her side of the dairy I ve but a short memory can yo not show me again how t hold t strainer No said she half laughing but holding her strainer fast in spite of his insinuating efforts to unlock her fingers But there s no need to tell me yo ve getten a short memory Why what have I done how dun you know it Last night she began and then she stopped and turned away her head pretending to be busy in her dairy duties of rinsing and such like Well said he half conjecturing her meaning and flattered by it if his conjecture were right Last night what Oh yo know said she as if impatient at being both literally and metaphorically followed about and driven into a corner No tell me persisted he Well said she if yo will have it I think yo showed yo d but a short memory when yo didn t know me again and yo were five times at this house last winter and that s not so long sin But I suppose yo see a vast o things on yo r voyages by land or by sea and then it s but natural yo should forget She wished she could go on talking but could not think of anything more to say just then for in the middle of her sentence the flattering interpretation he might put upon her words on her knowing so exactly the number of times he had been to Haytersbank flashed upon her and she wanted to lead the conversation a little farther afield to make it a little less personal This was not his wish however In a tone which thrilled through her even in her own despite he said Do yo think that can ever happen again Sylvia She was quite silent almost trembling He repeated the question as if to force her to answer Driven to bay she equivocated What happen again Let me go I dunno what yo re talking about and I m a most numbed wi cold For the frosty air came sharp in through the open lattice window and the ice was already forming on the milk Kinraid would have found a ready way of keeping his cousins or indeed most young women warm but he paused before he dared put his arm round Sylvia she had something so shy and wild in her look and manner and her very innocence of what her words spoken by another girl might lead to inspired him with respect and kept him in check So he contented himself with saying I ll let yo go into t warm kitchen if yo ll tell me if yo think I can ever forget yo again She looked up at him defiantly and set her red lips firm He enjoyed her determination not to reply to this question it showed she felt its significance Her pure eyes looked steadily into his nor was the expression in his such as to daunt her or make her afraid They were like two children defying each other each determined to conquer At last she unclosed her lips and nodding her head as if in triumph said as she folded her arms once more in her check apron Yo ll have to go home sometime Not for a couple of hours yet said he and yo ll be frozen first so yo d better say if I can ever forget yo again without more ado Perhaps the fresh voices breaking on the silence perhaps the tones were less modulated than they had been before but anyhow Bell Robson s voice was heard calling Sylvia through the second door which opened from the dairy to the house place in which her mother had been till this moment asleep Sylvia darted off in obedience to the call glad to leave him as at the moment Kinraid resentfully imagined Through the open door he heard the conversation between mother and daughter almost unconscious of its meaning so difficult did he find it to wrench his thoughts from the ideas he had just been forming with Sylvia s bright lovely face right under his eyes Sylvia said her mother who s yonder Bell was sitting up in the attitude of one startled out of slumber into intensity of listening her hands on each of the chair arms as if just going to rise There s a fremd man i t house I heerd his voice It s only it s just Charley Kinraid he was a talking to me i t dairy I t dairy lass and how com d he i t dairy He com d to see feyther Feyther asked him last night said Sylvia conscious that he could overhear every word that was said and a little suspecting that he was no great favourite with her mother Thy feyther s out how com d he i t dairy persevered Bell He com d past this window and saw yo asleep and didn t like for t waken yo so he com d on to t shippen and when I carried t milk in But now Kinraid came in feeling the awkwardness of his situation a little yet with an expression so pleasant and manly in his open face and in his exculpatory manner that Sylvia lost his first words in a strange kind of pride of possession in him about which she did not reason nor care to define the grounds But her mother rose from her chair somewhat formally as if she did not intend to sit down again while he stayed yet was too weak to be kept in that standing attitude long I m afeared sir Sylvie hasn t told yo that my master s out and not like to be in till late He ll be main and sorry to have missed yo There was nothing for it after this but to go His only comfort was that on Sylvia s rosy face he could read unmistakable signs of regret and dismay His sailor s life in bringing him suddenly face to face with unexpected events had given him something of that self possession which we consider the attribute of a gentleman and with an apparent calmness which almost disappointed Sylvia who construed it into a symptom of indifference as to whether he went or stayed he bade her mother good night and only said in holding her hand a minute longer than was absolutely necessary I m coming back ere I sail and then may be you ll answer yon question He spoke low and her mother was rearranging herself in her chair else Sylvia would have had to repeat the previous words As it was with soft thrilling ideas ringing through her she could get her wheel and sit down to her spinning by the fire waiting for her mother to speak first Sylvia dreamt her dreams Bell Robson was partly aware of the state of things as far as it lay on the surface She was not aware how deep down certain feelings had penetrated into the girl s heart who sat on the other side of the fire with a little sad air diffused over her face and figure Bell looked upon Sylvia as still a child to be warned off forbidden things by threats of danger But the forbidden thing was already tasted and possible danger in its full acquisition only served to make it more precious sweet Bell sat upright in her chair gazing into the fire Her milk white linen mob cap fringed round and softened her face from which the usual apple red was banished by illness and the features from the same cause rendered more prominent and stern She had a clean buff kerchief round her neck and stuffed into the bosom of her Sunday woollen gown of dark blue if she had been in working trim she would have worn a bedgown like Sylvia s Her sleeves were pinned back at the elbows and her brown arms and hard working hands lay crossed in unwonted idleness on her check apron Her knitting was by her side and if she had been going through any accustomed calculation or consideration she would have had it busily clinking in her fingers But she had something quite beyond common to think about and perhaps to speak about and for the minute she was not equal to knitting Sylvie she began at length did I e er tell thee on Nancy Hartley as I knew when I were a child I m thinking a deal on her to night may be it s because I ve been dreaming on yon old times She was a bonny lass as ever were seen I ve heerd folk say but that were afore I knew her When I knew her she were crazy poor wench wi her black hair a streaming down her back and her eyes as were a most as black allays crying out for pity though never a word she spoke but He once was here Just that o er and o er again whether she were cold or hot full or hungry He once was here were all her speech She had been farm servant to my mother s brother James Hepburn thy great uncle as was she were a poor friendless wench a parish prentice but honest and gaum like till a lad as nobody knowed come o er the hills one sheep shearing fra Whitehaven he had summat to do wi th sea though not rightly to be called a sailor and he made a deal on Nancy Hartley just to beguile the time like and he went away and ne er sent a thought after her more It s the way as lads have and there s no holding em when they re fellows as nobody knows neither where they come fro nor what they ve been doing a their lives till they come athwart some poor wench like Nancy Hartley She were but a softy after all for she left off doing her work in a proper manner I ve heerd my aunt say as she found out as summat was wrong wi Nancy as soon as th milk turned bingy for there ne er had been such a clean lass about her milk cans afore that and from bad it grew to worse and she would sit and do nothing but play wi her fingers fro morn till night and if they asked her what ailed her she just said He once was here and if they bid her go about her work it were a the same And when they scolded her and pretty sharp too she would stand up and put her hair from her eyes and look about her like a crazy thing searching for her wits and ne er finding them for all she could think on was just He once was here It were a caution to me again thinking a man t mean what he says when he s a talking to a young woman But what became on poor Nancy asked Sylvia What should become on her or on any lass as gives hersel up to thinking on a man who cares nought for her replied her mother a little severely She were crazed and my aunt couldn t keep her on could she She did keep her a long weary time thinking as she would may be come to hersel and anyhow she were a motherless wench But at length she had for t go where she came fro back to Keswick workhouse and when last I heerd on her she were chained to th great kitchen dresser i t workhouse they d beaten her till she were taught to be silent and quiet i th daytime but at night when she were left alone she would take up th oud cry till it wrung their heart so they d many a time to come down and beat her again to get any peace It were a caution to me as I said afore to keep fro thinking on men as thought nought on me Poor crazy Nancy sighed Sylvia The mother wondered if she had taken the caution to herself or was only full of pity for the mad girl dead long before CHAPTER XVI THE ENGAGEMENT As the day lengthens so the cold strengthens It was so that year the hard frost which began on new year s eve lasted on and on into late February black and bitter but welcome enough to the farmers as it kept back the too early growth of autumn sown wheat and gave them the opportunity of leading manure But it did not suit invalids as well and Bell Robson though not getting worse did not make any progress towards amendment Sylvia was kept very busy notwithstanding that she had the assistance of a poor widow woman in the neighbourhood on cleaning or washing or churning days 
5339_14133_000002_000003	train-clean-100	Her life was quiet and monotonous although hard working and while her hands mechanically found and did their accustomed labour the thoughts that rose in her head always centred on Charley Kinraid his ways his words his looks whether they all meant what she would fain believe they did and whether meaning love at the time such a feeling was likely to endure 
5339_14133_000002_000004	train-clean-100	Her mother s story of crazy Nancy had taken hold of her but not as a caution rather as a parallel case to her own 
none	none	Like Nancy and borrowing the poor girl s own words she would say softly to herself He once was here but all along she believed in her heart he would come back again to her though it touched her strangely to imagine the agonies of forsaken love Philip knew little of all this He was very busy with facts and figures doggedly fighting through the necessary business and only now and then allowing himself the delicious relaxation of going to Haytersbank in an evening to inquire after his aunt s health and to see Sylvia for the two Fosters were punctiliously anxious to make their shopmen test all their statements insisting on an examination of the stock as if Hepburn and Coulson were strangers to the shop having the Monkshaven auctioneer in to appraise the fixtures and necessary furniture going over the shop books for the last twenty years with their successors an employment which took up evening after evening and not unfrequently taking one of the young men on the long commercial journeys which were tediously made in a gig 
5339_14133_000003_000002	train-clean-100	By degrees both Hepburn and Coulson were introduced to distant manufacturers and wholesale dealers 
none	none	They would have been willing to take the Fosters word for every statement the brothers had made on new year s day but this it was evident would not have satisfied their masters who were scrupulous in insisting that whatever advantage there was should always fall on the side of the younger men 
5339_14133_000004_000000	train-clean-100	When Philip saw Sylvia she was always quiet and gentle perhaps more silent than she had been a year ago and she did not attend so briskly to what was passing around her 
5339_14133_000004_000001	train-clean-100	She was rather thinner and paler but whatever change there was in her was always an improvement in Philip s eyes so long as she spoke graciously to him 
none	none	He thought she was suffering from long continued anxiety about her mother or that she had too much to do and either cause was enough to make him treat her with a grave regard and deference which had a repressed tenderness in it of which she otherwise occupied was quite unaware 
5339_14133_000004_000003	train-clean-100	She liked him better too than she had done a year or two before because he did not show her any of the eager attention which teased her then although its meaning was not fully understood 
5339_14133_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Things were much in this state when the frost broke and milder weather succeeded 
none	none	This was the time so long looked forward to by the invalid and her friends as favouring the doctor s recommendation of change of air Her husband was to take her to spend a fortnight with a kindly neighbour who lived near the farm they had occupied forty miles or so inland before they came to Haytersbank 
5339_14133_000005_000003	train-clean-100	The widow woman was to come and stay in the house to keep Sylvia company during her mother s absence 
none	none	Daniel indeed was to return home after conveying his wife to her destination but there was so much to be done on the land at this time of the year that Sylvia would have been alone all day had it not been for the arrangement just mentioned There was active stirring in Monkshaven harbour as well as on shore The whalers were finishing their fittings out for the Greenland seas It was a close season that is to say there would be difficulty in passing the barrier of ice which lay between the ships and the whaling grounds and yet these must be reached before June or the year s expedition would be of little avail Every blacksmith s shop rung with the rhythmical clang of busy hammers beating out old iron such as horseshoes nails or stubs into the great harpoons the quays were thronged with busy and important sailors rushing hither and thither conscious of the demand in which they were held at this season of the year It was war time too Many captains unable to procure men in Monkshaven would have to complete their crews in the Shetlands 
5339_14133_000006_000005	train-clean-100	The shops in the town were equally busy stores had to be purchased by the whaling masters warm clothing of all sorts to be provided 
5339_14133_000006_000006	train-clean-100	These were the larger wholesale orders but many a man and woman too brought out their small hoards to purchase extra comforts or precious keepsakes for some beloved one 
5339_14133_000006_000007	train-clean-100	It was the time of the great half yearly traffic of the place another impetus was given to business when the whalers returned in the autumn and the men were flush of money and full of delight at once more seeing their homes and their friends 
none	none	There was much to be done in Fosters shop and later hours were kept than usual Some perplexity or other was occupying John and Jeremiah Foster their minds were not so much on the alert as usual being engaged on some weighty matter of which they had as yet spoken to no one 
5339_14133_000007_000002	train-clean-100	But it thus happened that they did not give the prompt assistance they were accustomed to render at such times and Coulson had been away on some of the new expeditions devolving on him and Philip as future partners 
5339_14133_000007_000003	train-clean-100	One evening after the shop was closed while they were examining the goods and comparing the sales with the entries in the day book Coulson suddenly inquired 
none	none	By the way Hester does thee know where the parcel of best bandanas is gone There was four left as I m pretty sure when I set off to Sandsend and to day Mark Alderson came in and would fain have had one and I could find none nowhere I sold t last to day to yon sailor the specksioneer who fought the press gang same time as poor Darley were killed He took it and three yards of yon pink ribbon wi t black and yellow crosses on it as Philip could never abide Philip has got em i t book if he ll only look
5339_14133_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 Is he here again said Philip I didn t see him 
none	none	What brings him here where he s noan wanted T shop were throng wi folk said Hester and he knew his own mind about the handkercher and didn t tarry long Just as he was leaving his eye caught on t ribbon and he came back for it It were when yo were serving Mary Darby and there was a vast o folk about yo I wish I d seen him said Coulson I d ha gi en him a word and a look he d not ha forgotten in a hurry
5339_14133_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Why what s up said Philip surprised at William s unusual manner and at the same time rather gratified to find a reflection of his own feelings about Kinraid 
5339_14133_000013_000001	train-clean-100	Coulson s face was pale with anger but for a moment or two he seemed uncertain whether he would reply or not 
none	none	Up said he at length It s just this he came after my sister for better nor two year and a better lass no nor a prettier i my eyes niver broke bread And then my master saw another girl that he liked better William almost choked in his endeavour to keep down all appearance of violent anger and then went on and that he played t same game wi as I ve heerd tell And how did thy sister take it asked Philip eagerly She died in a six month said William she forgived him but it s beyond me I thought it were him when I heerd of t work about Darley Kinraid and coming fra Newcassel where Annie lived prentice and I made inquiry and it were t same man But I ll say no more about him for it stirs t old Adam more nor I like or is fitting 
5339_14133_000017_000000	train-clean-100	Out of respect to him Philip asked no more questions although there were many things that he fain would have known 
none	none	Both Coulson and he went silently and grimly through the remainder of their day s work Independent of any personal interest which either or both of them had or might have in Kinraid s being a light o love this fault of his was one with which the two grave sedate young men had no sympathy 
5339_14133_000017_000002	train-clean-100	Their hearts were true and constant whatever else might be their failings and it is no new thing to damn the faults we have no mind to Philip wished that it was not so late or that very evening he would have gone to keep guard over Sylvia in her mother s absence nay perhaps he might have seen reason to give her a warning of some kind 
5339_14133_000017_000003	train-clean-100	But if he had done so it would have been locking the stable door after the steed was stolen 
5339_14133_000017_000004	train-clean-100	Kinraid had turned his steps towards Haytersbank Farm as soon as ever he had completed his purchases 
none	none	He had only come that afternoon to Monkshaven and for the sole purpose of seeing Sylvia once more before he went to fulfil his engagement as specksioneer in the Urania a whaling vessel that was to sail from North Shields on Thursday morning and this was Monday 
5339_14133_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Sylvia sat in the house place her back to the long low window in order to have all the light the afternoon hour afforded for her work 
5339_14133_000018_000001	train-clean-100	A basket of her father s unmended stockings was on the little round table beside her and one was on her left hand which she supposed herself to be mending but from time to time she made long pauses and looked in the fire and yet there was but little motion of flame or light in it out of which to conjure visions 
5339_14133_000018_000002	train-clean-100	It was redd up for the afternoon covered with a black mass of coal over which the equally black kettle hung on the crook 
none	none	In the back kitchen Dolly Reid Sylvia s assistant during her mother s absence chanted a lugubrious ditty befitting her condition as a widow while she cleaned tins and cans and milking pails 
5339_14133_000018_000004	train-clean-100	Perhaps these bustling sounds prevented Sylvia from hearing approaching footsteps coming down the brow with swift advance at any rate she started and suddenly stood up as some one entered the open door 
none	none	It was strange she should be so much startled for the person who entered had been in her thoughts all during those long pauses Charley Kinraid and the story of crazy Nancy had been the subjects for her dreams for many a day and many a night 
5339_14133_000018_000006	train-clean-100	Now he stood there bright and handsome as ever with just that much timidity in his face that anxiety as to his welcome which gave his accost an added charm could she but have perceived it 
5339_14133_000018_000007	train-clean-100	But she was so afraid of herself so unwilling to show what she felt and how much she had been thinking of him in his absence that her reception seemed cold and still 
5339_14133_000018_000008	train-clean-100	She did not come forward to meet him she went crimson to the very roots of her hair but that in the waning light he could not see and she shook so that she felt as if she could hardly stand but the tremor was not visible to him 
none	none	She wondered if he remembered the kiss that had passed between them on new year s eve the words that had been spoken in the dairy on new year s day the tones the looks that had accompanied those words 
5339_14133_000018_000010	train-clean-100	But all she said was 
none	none	I didn t think to see yo I thought yo d ha sailed I told yo I should come back didn t I said he still standing with his hat in his hand waiting to be asked to sit down and she in her bashfulness forgetting to give the invitation but instead pretending to be attentively mending the stocking she held 
5339_14133_000020_000001	train-clean-100	Neither could keep quiet and silent long 
5339_14133_000020_000002	train-clean-100	She felt his eyes were upon her watching every motion and grew more and more confused in her expression and behaviour 
none	none	He was a little taken aback by the nature of his reception and was not sure at first whether to take the great change in her manner from what it had been when last he saw her as a favourable symptom or otherwise By and by luckily for him in some turn of her arm to reach the scissors on the table she caught the edge of her work basket and down it fell 
5339_14133_000020_000005	train-clean-100	She stooped to pick up the scattered stockings and ball of worsted and so did he and when they rose up he had fast hold of her hand and her face was turned away half ready to cry 
none	none	What ails yo at me said he beseechingly Yo might ha forgotten me and yet I thought we made a bargain against forgetting each other No answer He went on Yo ve never been out o my thoughts Sylvia Robson and I m come back to Monkshaven for nought but to see you once and again afore I go away to the northern seas It s not two hour sin I landed at Monkshaven and I ve been near neither kith nor kin as yet and now I m here you won t speak to me I don t know what to say said she in a low almost inaudible tone Then hardening herself and resolving to speak as if she did not understand his only half expressed meaning she lifted up her head and all but looking at him while she wrenched her hand out of his she said Mother s gone to Middleham for a visit and feyther s out i t plough field wi Kester but he ll be in afore long 
5339_14133_000023_000000	train-clean-100	Charley did not speak for a minute or so 
none	none	Then he said Yo re not so dull as to think I m come all this way for t see either your father or your mother I ve a great respect for em both but I d hardly ha come all this way for to see em and me bound to be back i Shields if I walk every step of the way by Wednesday night It s that yo won t understand my meaning Sylvia it s not that yo don t or that yo can t He made no effort to repossess himself of her hand She was quite silent but in spite of herself she drew long hard breaths
5339_14133_000024_000004	train-clean-100	 I may go back to where I came from he went on 
none	none	I thought to go to sea wi a blessed hope to cheer me up and a knowledge o some one as loved me as I d left behind some one as loved me half as much as I did her for th measure o my love toward her is so great and mighty I d be content wi half as much from her till I d taught her to love me more But if she s a cold heart and cannot care for a honest sailor why then I d best go back at once 
5339_14133_000025_000000	train-clean-100	He made for the door 
5339_14133_000025_000001	train-clean-100	He must have been pretty sure from some sign or other or he would never have left it to her womanly pride to give way and for her to make the next advance 
none	none	He had not taken two steps when she turned quickly towards him and said something the echo of which rather than the words themselves reached him I didn t know yo cared for me yo niver said so In an instant he was back at her side his arm round her in spite of her short struggle and his eager passionate voice saying Yo never knowed I loved you Sylvia say it again and look i my face while yo say it if yo can Why last winter I thought yo d be such a woman when yo d come to be one as my een had never looked upon and this year ever sin I saw yo i the kitchen corner sitting crouching behind my uncle I as good as swore I d have yo for wife or never wed at all And it was not long ere yo knowed it for all yo were so coy and now yo have the face no yo have not the face come my darling what is it for she was crying and on his turning her wet blushing face towards him the better to look at it she suddenly hid it in his breast He lulled and soothed her in his arms as if she had been a weeping child and he her mother and then they sat down on the settle together and when she was more composed they began to talk 
5339_14133_000026_000004	train-clean-100	He asked her about her mother not sorry in his heart at Bell Robson s absence 
5339_14133_000026_000005	train-clean-100	He had intended if necessary to acknowledge his wishes and desires with regard to Sylvia to her parents but for various reasons he was not sorry that circumstances had given him the chance of seeing her alone and obtaining her promise to marry him without being obliged to tell either her father or her mother at present 
none	none	I ha spent my money pretty free he said and I ve ne er a penny to the fore and yo r parents may look for something better for yo my pretty but when I come back fro this voyage I shall stand a chance of having a share i th Urania and may be I shall be mate as well as specksioneer and I can get a matter of from seventy to ninety pound a voyage let alone th half guineas for every whale I strike and six shilling a gallon on th oil and if I keep steady wi Forbes and Company they ll make me master i time for I ve had good schooling and can work a ship as well as any man an I leave yo wi yo r parents or take a cottage for yo nigh at hand but I would like to have something to the fore and that I shall have please God when we come back i th autumn I shall go to sea happy now thinking I ve yo r word Yo re not one to go back from it I m sure else it s a long time to leave such a pretty girl as yo and ne er a chance of a letter reaching yo just to tell yo once again how I love yo and to bid yo not forget yo r true love
5339_14133_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 There ll be no need o that murmured Sylvia 
5339_14133_000028_000000	train-clean-100	She was too dizzy with happiness to have attended much to his details of his worldly prospects but at the sound of his tender words of love her eager heart was ready to listen 
none	none	I don t know said he wanting to draw her out into more confession of her feelings There s many a one ready to come after yo and yo r mother is not o er captivated wi me and there s yon tall fellow of a cousin as looks black at me for if I m not mista en he s a notion of being sweet on yo hisself
5339_14133_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Not he said Sylvia with some contempt in her tone 
none	none	He s so full o business and t shop and o makin money and gettin wealth Ay ay but perhaps when he gets a rich man he ll come and ask my Sylvia to be his wife and what will she say then He ll niver come asking such a foolish question said she a little impatiently he knows what answer he d get if he did Kinraid said almost as if to himself Yo r mother favours him though But she weary of a subject she cared nothing about and eager to identify herself with all his interests asked him about his plans almost at the same time that he said these last words and they went on as lovers do intermixing a great many tender expressions with a very little conversation relating to facts 
5339_14133_000034_000000	train-clean-100	Dolly Reid came in and went out softly unheeded by them 
5339_14133_000034_000001	train-clean-100	But Sylvia s listening ears caught her father s voice as he and Kester returned homewards from their day s work in the plough field and she started away and fled upstairs in shy affright leaving Charley to explain his presence in the solitary kitchen to her father 
5339_14133_000035_000000	train-clean-100	He came in not seeing that any one was there at first for they had never thought of lighting a candle 
5339_14133_000035_000001	train-clean-100	Kinraid stepped forward into the firelight his purpose of concealing what he had said to Sylvia quite melted away by the cordial welcome her father gave him the instant that he recognized him 
5339_14133_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Bless thee lad 
none	none	who d ha thought o seein thee Why if iver a thought on thee at all it were half way to Davis Straits To be sure t winter s been a dree season and thou rt may be i t reet on t to mak a late start Latest start as iver I made was ninth o March an we struck thirteen whales that year I have something to say to you said Charley in a hesitating voice so different to his usual hearty way that Daniel gave him a keen look of attention before he began to speak 
5339_14133_000037_000001	train-clean-100	And perhaps the elder man was not unprepared for the communication that followed 
5339_14133_000037_000002	train-clean-100	At any rate it was not unwelcome 
none	none	He liked Kinraid and had strong sympathy not merely with what he knew of the young sailor s character but with the life he led and the business he followed Robson listened to all he said with approving nods and winks till Charley had told him everything he had to say and then he turned and struck his broad horny palm into Kinraid s as if concluding a bargain while he expressed in words his hearty consent to their engagement 
5339_14133_000037_000004	train-clean-100	He wound up with a chuckle as the thought struck him that this great piece of business of disposing of their only child had been concluded while his wife was away 
none	none	A m noan so sure as t missus ll like it said he tho whativer she ll ha to say again it mischief only knows But she s noan keen on matterimony though a have made her as good a man as there is in a t Ridings Anyhow a m master and that she knows But may be for t sake o peace an quietness tho she s niver a scolding tongue that a will say for her we n best keep this matter to ourselves till thou comes int port again T lass upstairs ll like nought better than t curl hersel round a secret and purr o er it just as t oud cat does o er her blind kitten But thou ll be wanting to see t lass a ll be bound An oud man like me isn t as good company as a pretty lass Laughing a low rich laugh over his own wit Daniel went to the bottom of the stairs and called Sylvie Sylvie come down lass a s reet come down 
5339_14133_000039_000000	train-clean-100	For a time there was no answer 
5339_14133_000039_000001	train-clean-100	Then a door was unbolted and Sylvia said 
5339_14133_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 I can t come down again 
5339_14133_000040_000001	train-clean-100	I m noan comin down again to night 
5339_14133_000041_000000	train-clean-100	Daniel laughed the more at this especially when he caught Charley s look of disappointment 
none	none	Hearken how she s bolted her door She ll noane come near us this night Eh but she s a stiff little un she s been our only one and we n mostly let her have her own way But we ll have a pipe and a glass and that to my thinking is as good company as iver a woman in Yorkshire 
5339_14134_000004_000000	train-clean-100	CHAPTER XVII
none	none	 REJECTED WARNINGS The post arrived at Monkshaven three times in the week sometimes indeed there were not a dozen letters in the bag which was brought thither by a man in a light mail cart who took the better part of a day to drive from York dropping private bags here and there on the moors at some squire s lodge or roadside inn 
5339_14134_000006_000001	train-clean-100	Of the number of letters that arrived in Monkshaven the Fosters shopkeepers and bankers had the largest share 
none	none	The morning succeeding the day on which Sylvia had engaged herself to Kinraid the Fosters seemed unusually anxious to obtain their letters 
5339_14134_000007_000001	train-clean-100	Several times Jeremiah came out of the parlour in which his brother John was sitting in expectant silence and passing through the shop looked up and down the market place in search of the old lame woman who was charitably employed to deliver letters and who must have been lamer than ever this morning to judge from the lateness of her coming 
5339_14134_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Although none but the Fosters knew the cause of their impatience for their letters yet there was such tacit sympathy between them and those whom they employed that Hepburn Coulson and Hester were all much relieved when the old woman at length appeared with her basket of letters 
5339_14134_000008_000000	train-clean-100	One of these seemed of especial consequence to the good brothers They each separately looked at the direction and then at one another and without a word they returned with it unread into the parlour shutting the door and drawing the green silk curtain close the better to read it in privacy 
none	none	Both Coulson and Philip felt that something unusual was going on and were perhaps as full of consideration as to the possible contents of this London letter as of attention to their more immediate business 
5339_14134_000009_000001	train-clean-100	But fortunately there was little doing in the shop 
5339_14134_000009_000002	train-clean-100	Philip indeed was quite idle when John Foster opened the parlour door and half doubtfully called him into the room 
5339_14134_000009_000003	train-clean-100	As the door of communication shut the three in Coulson felt himself a little aggrieved 
5339_14134_000009_000004	train-clean-100	A minute ago Philip and he were on a level of ignorance from which the former was evidently going to be raised But he soon returned to his usual state of acquiescence in things as they were which was partly constitutional and partly the result of his Quaker training 
5339_14134_000010_000000	train-clean-100	It was apparently by John Foster s wish that Philip had been summoned 
5339_14134_000010_000001	train-clean-100	Jeremiah the less energetic and decided brother was still discussing the propriety of the step when Philip entered 
none	none	No need for haste John better not call the young man till we have further considered the matter 
5339_14134_000012_000000	train-clean-100	But the young man was there in presence and John s will carried the day 
5339_14134_000013_000000	train-clean-100	It seemed from his account to Philip explanatory of what he in advance of his brother s slower judgment thought to be a necessary step that the Fosters had for some time received anonymous letters warning them with distinct meaning though in ambiguous terms against a certain silk manufacturer in Spitalfields with whom they had had straightforward business dealings for many years but to whom they had latterly advanced money 
5339_14134_000013_000001	train-clean-100	The letters hinted at the utter insolvency of this manufacturer 
5339_14134_000013_000002	train-clean-100	They had urged their correspondent to give them his name in confidence and this morning s letter had brought it but the name was totally unknown to them though there seemed no reason to doubt the reality of either it or the address the latter of which was given in full 
5339_14134_000013_000003	train-clean-100	Certain circumstances were mentioned regarding the transactions between the Fosters and this manufacturer which could be known only to those who were in the confidence of one or the other and to the Fosters the man was as has been said a perfect stranger 
5339_14134_000013_000004	train-clean-100	Probably they would have been unwilling to incur the risk they had done on this manufacturer Dickinson s account if it had not been that he belonged to the same denomination as themselves and was publicly distinguished for his excellent and philanthropic character but these letters were provocative of anxiety especially since this morning s post had brought out the writer s full name and various particulars showing his intimate knowledge of Dickinson s affairs 
5339_14134_000014_000000	train-clean-100	After much perplexed consultation John had hit upon the plan of sending Hepburn to London to make secret inquiries respecting the true character and commercial position of the man whose creditors not a month ago they had esteemed it an honour to be 
none	none	Even now Jeremiah was ashamed of their want of confidence in one so good he believed that the information they had received would all prove a mistake founded on erroneous grounds if not a pure invention of an enemy and he had only been brought partially to consent to the sending of Hepburn by his brother s pledging himself that the real nature of Philip s errand should be unknown to any human creature save them three 
5339_14134_000016_000000	train-clean-100	As all this was being revealed to Philip he sat apparently unmoved and simply attentive 
5339_14134_000016_000001	train-clean-100	In fact he was giving all his mind to understanding the probabilities of the case leaving his own feelings in the background till his intellect should have done its work 
5339_14134_000016_000002	train-clean-100	He said little but what he did say was to the point and satisfied both brothers 
none	none	John perceived that his messenger would exercise penetration and act with energy while Jeremiah was soothed by Philip s caution in not hastily admitting the probability of any charge against Dickinson and in giving full weight to his previous good conduct and good character 
5339_14134_000017_000000	train-clean-100	Philip had the satisfaction of feeling himself employed on a mission which would call out his powers and yet not exceed them 
5339_14134_000017_000001	train-clean-100	In his own mind he forestalled the instructions of his masters and was silently in advance of John Foster s plans and arrangements while he appeared to listen to all that was said with quiet business like attention 
5339_14134_000018_000000	train-clean-100	It was settled that the next morning he was to make his way northwards to Hartlepool whence he could easily proceed either by land or sea to Newcastle from which place smacks were constantly sailing to London 
none	none	As to his personal conduct and behaviour there the brothers overwhelmed him with directions and advice nor did they fail to draw out of the strong box in the thick wall of their counting house a more than sufficient sum of money for all possible expenses 
5339_14134_000018_000002	train-clean-100	Philip had never had so much in his hands before and hesitated to take it saying it was more than he should require but they repeated with fresh urgency their warnings about the terrible high prices of London till he could only resolve to keep a strict account and bring back all that he did not expend since nothing but his taking the whole sum would satisfy his employers 
5339_14134_000019_000000	train-clean-100	When he was once more behind the counter he had leisure enough for consideration as far as Coulson could give it him 
5339_14134_000019_000001	train-clean-100	The latter was silent brooding over the confidence which Philip had apparently received but which was withheld from him 
none	none	He did not yet know of the culminating point of Philip s proposed journey to London that great city of London which from its very inaccessibility fifty years ago loomed so magnificent through the mist of men s imaginations It is not to be denied that Philip felt exultant at the mere fact of going to London But then again the thought of leaving Sylvia of going out of possible daily reach of her of not seeing her for a week a fortnight nay he might be away for a month for no rash hurry was to mar his delicate negotiation gnawed at his heart and spoilt any enjoyment he might have anticipated from gratified curiosity or even from the consciousness of being trusted by those whose trust and regard he valued The sense of what he was leaving grew upon him the longer he thought on the subject he almost wished that he had told his masters earlier in the conversation of his unwillingness to leave Monkshaven for so long a time and then again he felt that the gratitude he owed them quite prohibited his declining any task they might impose especially as they had more than once said that it would not do for them to appear in the affair and yet that to no one else could they entrust so difficult and delicate a matter 
5339_14134_000019_000005	train-clean-100	Several times that day as he perceived Coulson s jealous sullenness he thought in his heart that the consequence of the excessive confidence for which Coulson envied him was a burden from which he would be thankful to be relieved 
none	none	As they all sat at tea in Alice Rose s house place Philip announced his intended journey a piece of intelligence he had not communicated earlier to Coulson because he had rather dreaded the increase of dissatisfaction it was sure to produce and of which he knew the expression would be restrained by the presence of Alice Rose and her daughter
5339_14134_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 To Lunnon exclaimed Alice 
none	none	Hester said nothing Well some folks has the luck said Coulson
5339_14134_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Luck said Alice turning sharp round on him 
none	none	Niver let me hear such a vain word out o thy mouth laddie again 
5339_14134_000024_000002	train-clean-100	It s the Lord s doing and luck s the devil s way o putting it 
none	none	Maybe it s to try Philip he s sent there happen it may be a fiery furnace to him for I ve heerd tell it s full o temptations and he may fall into sin and then where d be the luck on it But why art ta going and the morning say saint thou Why thy best shirt is in t suds and no time for t starch and iron it Whatten the great haste as should take thee to Lunnon wi out thy ruffled shirt
5339_14134_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 It s none o my doing said Philip there s business to be done and John Foster says I m to do it and I m to start to morrow 
none	none	I ll not turn thee out wi out thy ruffled shirt if I sit up a neet said Alice resolutely Niver fret thyself mother about t shirt said Philip If I need a shirt London s not what I take it for if I can t buy mysel one ready made Hearken to him said Alice He speaks as if buying o ready made shirts were nought to him and he wi a good half dozen as I made mysel Eh lad but if that s the frame o mind thou rt in Lunnon is like for to be a sore place o temptation There s pitfalls for men and traps for money at ivery turn as I ve heerd say It would ha been better if John Foster had sent an older man on his business whativer it be They seem to make a deal o Philip all on a sudden said Coulson He s sent for and talked to i privacy while Hester and me is left i t shop for t bear t brunt o t serving
5339_14134_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Philip knows said Hester and then somehow her voice failed her and she stopped 
5339_14134_000031_000000	train-clean-100	Philip paid no attention to this half uttered sentence he was eager to tell Coulson as far as he could do so without betraying his master s secret how many drawbacks there were to his proposed journey in the responsibility which it involved and his unwillingness to leave Monkshaven he said 
none	none	Coulson I d give a deal it were thou that were going and not me At least there is many a time I d give a deal I ll not deny but at other times I m pleased at the thought on t But if I could I d change places wi thee at this moment
5339_14134_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 It s fine talking said Coulson half mollified and yet not caring to show it 
none	none	I make no doubt it were an even chance betwixt us two at first which on us was to go but somehow thou got the start and thou saint stuck to it till it s too late for aught but to say thou s sorry Nay William said Philip rising it s an ill look out for the future if thee and me is to quarrel like two silly wenches o er each bit of pleasure or what thou fancies to be pleasure as falls in t way of either on us I ve said truth to thee and played thee fair and I ve got to go to Haytersbank for to wish em good by so I ll not stay longer here to be misdoubted by thee 
5339_14134_000035_000000	train-clean-100	He took his cap and was gone not heeding Alice s shrill inquiry as to his clothes and his ruffled shirt 
5339_14134_000035_000001	train-clean-100	Coulson sat still penitent and ashamed at length he stole a look at Hester 
none	none	She was playing with her teaspoon but he could see that she was choking down her tears he could not choose but force her to speak with an ill timed question What s to do Hester said he 
5339_14134_000037_000000	train-clean-100	She lifted up those eyes usually so soft and serene now they were full of the light of indignation shining through tears 
none	none	To do she said Coulson I d thought better of thee going and doubting and envying Philip as niver did thee an ill turn or said an ill word or thought an ill thought by thee and sending him away out o t house this last night of all may be wi thy envyings and jealousy 
5339_14134_000039_000000	train-clean-100	She hastily got up and left the room 
5339_14134_000039_000001	train-clean-100	Alice was away looking up Philip s things for his journey 
5339_14134_000039_000002	train-clean-100	Coulson remained alone feeling like a guilty child but dismayed by Hester s words even more than by his own regret at what he had said 
none	none	Philip walked rapidly up the hill road towards Haytersbank 
5339_14134_000040_000001	train-clean-100	He was chafed and excited by Coulson s words and the events of the day 
none	none	He had meant to shape his life and now it was as it were being shaped for him and yet he was reproached for the course it was taking as much as though he were an active agent accused of taking advantage over Coulson his intimate companion for years he who esteemed himself above taking an unfair advantage over any man His feeling on the subject was akin to that of Hazael Is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing 
5339_14134_000041_000000	train-clean-100	His feelings disturbed on this one point shook his judgment off its balance on another 
5339_14134_000041_000001	train-clean-100	The resolution he had deliberately formed of not speaking to Sylvia on the subject of his love till he could announce to her parents the fact of his succession to Fosters business and till he had patiently with long continuing and deep affection worked his way into her regard was set aside during the present walk 
5339_14134_000041_000002	train-clean-100	He would speak to her of his passionate attachment before he left for an uncertain length of time and the certain distance of London 
none	none	And all the modification on this point which his judgment could obtain from his impetuous and excited heart was that he would watch her words and manner well when he announced his approaching absence and if in them he read the slightest token of tender regretful feeling he would pour out his love at her feet not even urging the young girl to make any return or to express the feelings of which he hoped the germ was already budding in her 
5339_14134_000041_000004	train-clean-100	He would be patient with her he could not be patient himself 
5339_14134_000041_000005	train-clean-100	His heart beating his busy mind rehearsing the probable coming scene he turned into the field path that led to Haytersbank 
5339_14134_000041_000006	train-clean-100	Coming along it and so meeting him advanced Daniel Robson in earnest talk with Charley Kinraid 
none	none	Kinraid then had been at the farm Kinraid had been seeing Sylvia her mother away 
5339_14134_000041_000008	train-clean-100	The thought of poor dead Annie Coulson flashed into Philip s mind 
5339_14134_000041_000009	train-clean-100	Could he be playing the same game with Sylvia 
5339_14134_000041_000010	train-clean-100	Philip set his teeth and tightened his lips at the thought of it 
5339_14134_000041_000011	train-clean-100	They had stopped talking they had seen him already or his impulse would have been to dodge behind the wall and avoid them even though one of his purposes in going to Haytersbank had been to bid his uncle farewell 
none	none	Kinraid took him by surprise from the hearty greeting he gave him and which Philip would fain have avoided But the specksioneer was full of kindliness towards all the world especially towards all Sylvia s friends and convinced of her great love towards himself had forgotten any previous jealousy of Philip 
5339_14134_000042_000002	train-clean-100	Secure and exultant his broad handsome weather bronzed face was as great a contrast to Philip s long thoughtful sallow countenance as his frank manner was to the other s cold reserve 
none	none	It was some minutes before Hepburn could bring himself to tell the great event that was about to befall him before this third person whom he considered as an intrusive stranger But as Kinraid seemed to have no idea of going on and as there really was no reason why he and all the world should not know of Philip s intentions he told his uncle that he was bound for London the next day on business connected with the Fosters 
5339_14134_000043_000000	train-clean-100	Daniel was deeply struck with the fact that he was talking to a man setting off for London at a day s notice 
none	none	Thou ll niver tell me this hasn t been brewin longer nor twelve hours thou s a sly close chap and we hannot seen thee this se nnight thou ll ha been thinkin on this and cogitating it may be a that time Nay said Philip I knew nought about it last night it s none o my doing going for I d liefer ha stayed where I am Yo ll like it when once yo re there said Kinraid with a travelled air of superiority as Philip fancied
5339_14134_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 No I shan t he replied shortly 
5339_14134_000047_000001	train-clean-100	 Liking has nought to do with it 
none	none	Ah yo knew nought about it last neet continued Daniel musingly Well life s soon o er else when I were a young fellow folks made their wills afore goin to Lunnon Yet I ll be bound to say yo niver made a will before going to sea said Philip half smiling Na na but that s quite another mak o thing going to sea comes natteral to a man but goin to Lunnon I were once there and were near deafened wi t throng and t sound I were but two hours i t place though our ship lay a fortneet off Gravesend 
5339_14134_000051_000000	train-clean-100	Kinraid now seemed in a hurry but Philip was stung with curiosity to ascertain his movements and suddenly addressed him 
none	none	I heard yo were i these parts Are you for staying here long There was a certain abruptness in Philip s tone if not in his words which made Kinraid look in his face with surprise and answer with equal curtness I m off i th morning and sail for the north seas day after 
5339_14134_000055_000000	train-clean-100	He turned away and began to whistle as if he did not wish for any further conversation with his interrogator 
5339_14134_000055_000001	train-clean-100	Philip indeed had nothing more to say to him he had learned all he wanted to know 
5339_14134_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 I d like to bid good by to Sylvie 
5339_14134_000056_000001	train-clean-100	Is she at home he asked of her father 
none	none	A m thinking thou ll not find her She ll be off to Yesterbarrow t see if she d get a settin o their eggs her grey speckled hen is cluckin and nought ll serve our Sylvia but their eggs to set her upon But for a that she mayn t be gone yet Best go on and see for thysel 
5339_14134_000058_000000	train-clean-100	So they parted but Philip had not gone many steps before his uncle called him back Kinraid slowly loitering on meanwhile 
5339_14134_000058_000001	train-clean-100	Robson was fumbling among some dirty papers he had in an old leather case which he had produced out of his pocket 
none	none	Fact is Philip t pleugh s in a bad way gearin and a an folk is talkin on a new kind o mak and if thou s bound for York
5339_14134_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 I m not going by York I m going by a Newcastle smack

5339_14134_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 I see said Philip Robinson Side Newcastle can give all requisite information

5339_14134_000064_000000	train-clean-100	Philip promised to do his best and to write word to Robson who satisfied with his willingness to undertake the commission bade him go on and see if he could not find the lass 
5339_14134_000064_000001	train-clean-100	Her father was right in saying that she might not have set out for Yesterbarrow 
5339_14134_000064_000002	train-clean-100	She had talked about it to Kinraid and her father in order to cover her regret at her lover s accompanying her father to see some new kind of harpoon about which the latter had spoken 
5339_14134_000064_000003	train-clean-100	But as soon as they had left the house and she had covertly watched them up the brow in the field she sate down to meditate and dream about her great happiness in being beloved by her hero Charley Kinraid 
none	none	No gloomy dread of his long summer s absence no fear of the cold glittering icebergs bearing mercilessly down on the Urania nor shuddering anticipation of the dark waves of evil import crossed her mind 
5339_14134_000064_000005	train-clean-100	He loved her and that was enough 
none	none	Her eyes looked trance like into a dim glorious future of life her lips still warm and reddened by his kiss were just parted in a happy smile when she was startled by the sound of an approaching footstep a footstep quite familiar enough for her to recognize it and which was unwelcome now as disturbing her in the one blessed subject of thought in which alone she cared to indulge Well Philip an what brings yo here was her rather ungracious greeting Why Sylvie are yo sorry to see me asked Philip reproachfully But she turned it off with assumed lightness
5339_14134_000067_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh yes said she 
none	none	I ve been wanting yo this week past wi t match to my blue ribbon yo said yo d get and bring me next time yo came I ve forgotten it Sylvie 
5339_14134_000068_000001	train-clean-100	It s clean gone out of my mind said Philip with true regret 
none	none	But I ve had a deal to think on he continued penitently as if anxious to be forgiven 
5339_14134_000068_000003	train-clean-100	Sylvia did not want his penitence did not care for her ribbon was troubled by his earnestness of manner but he knew nothing of all that he only knew that she whom he loved had asked him to do something for her and he had neglected it so anxious to be excused and forgiven he went on with the apology she cared not to hear 
5339_14134_000069_000000	train-clean-100	If she had been less occupied with her own affairs less engrossed with deep feeling she would have reproached him if only in jest for his carelessness 
5339_14134_000069_000001	train-clean-100	As it was she scarcely took in the sense of his words 
5339_14134_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 You see Sylvie I ve had a deal to think on before long I intend telling yo all about it just now I m not free to do it 
none	none	And when a man s mind is full o business most particular when it s other folk s as is trusted to him he seems to lose count on the very things he d most care for at another time He paused a little 
5339_14134_000071_000000	train-clean-100	Sylvia s galloping thoughts were pulled suddenly up by his silence she felt that he wanted her to say something but she could think of nothing besides an ambiguous 
none	none	Well And I m off to London i t morning added he a little wistfully almost as if beseeching her to show or express some sorrow at a journey the very destination of which showed that he would be absent for some time To Lunnon said she with some surprise Yo re niver thinking o going to live theere for sure 
5339_14134_000075_000000	train-clean-100	Surprise and curiosity and wonder nothing more as Philip s instinct told him 
5339_14134_000075_000001	train-clean-100	But he reasoned that first correct impression away with ingenious sophistry 
5339_14134_000076_000000	train-clean-100	 Not to live there only to stay for some time 
5339_14134_000076_000001	train-clean-100	I shall be back I reckon in a month or so 
none	none	Oh that s nought of a going away said she rather petulantly Them as goes to t Greenland seas has to bide away for six months and more and she sighed 
5339_14134_000078_000000	train-clean-100	Suddenly a light shone down into Philip s mind 
5339_14134_000078_000001	train-clean-100	His voice was changed as he spoke next 
none	none	I met that good for nothing chap Kinraid wi yo r father just now He ll ha been here Sylvie 
5339_14134_000080_000000	train-clean-100	She stooped for something she had dropped and came up red as a rose 
none	none	To be sure what then And she eyed him defiantly though in her heart she trembled she knew not why
5339_14134_000082_000000	train-clean-100	 What then and yo r mother away 
5339_14134_000082_000001	train-clean-100	He s no company for such as thee at no time Sylvie 
none	none	Feyther and me chooses our own company without iver asking leave o yo said Sylvia hastily arranging the things in the little wooden work box that was on the table preparatory to putting it away 
5339_14134_000083_000001	train-clean-100	At the time in his agitation he saw but did not affix any meaning to it that the half of some silver coin was among the contents thus turned over before the box was locked 
none	none	But thy mother wouldn t like it Sylvie he s played false wi other lasses he ll be playing thee false some o these days if thou lets him come about thee He went on wi Annie Coulson William s sister till he broke her heart and sin then he s been on wi others I dunnot believe a word on t said Sylvia standing up all aflame I niver telled a lie i my life said Philip almost choking with grief at her manner to him and the regard for his rival which she betrayed It were Willie Coulson as telled me as solemn and serious as one man can speak to another and he said it weren t the first nor the last time as he had made his own game with young women And how dare yo come here to me wi yo r backbiting tales said Sylvia shivering all over with passion Philip tried to keep calm and to explain It were yo r own mother Sylvia as knowed yo had no brother or any one to see after yo and yo so pretty so pretty Sylvia he continued shaking his head sadly that men run after yo against their will as one may say and yo r mother bade me watch o er ye and see what company yo kept and who was following after yo and to warn yo if need were My mother niver bade yo to come spying after me and blaming me for seeing a lad as my feyther thinks well on An I don t believe a word about Annie Coulson an I m not going to suffer yo to come wi yo r tales to me say em out to his face and hear what he ll say to yo
5339_14134_000091_000000	train-clean-100	 Sylvie Sylvie cried poor Philip as his offended cousin rushed past him and upstairs to her little bedroom where he heard the sound of the wooden bolt flying into its place 
none	none	He could hear her feet pacing quickly about through the unceiled rafters 
5339_14134_000091_000002	train-clean-100	He sate still in despair his head buried in his two hands 
5339_14134_000091_000003	train-clean-100	He sate till it grew dusk dark the wood fire not gathered together by careful hands died out into gray ashes 
5339_14134_000091_000004	train-clean-100	Dolly Reid had done her work and gone home 
none	none	There were but Philip and Sylvia in the house 
5339_14134_000091_000006	train-clean-100	He knew he ought to be going home for he had much to do and many arrangements to make 
5339_14134_000091_000007	train-clean-100	Yet it seemed as though he could not stir 
5339_14134_000091_000008	train-clean-100	At length he raised his stiffened body and stood up dizzy 
5339_14134_000091_000009	train-clean-100	Up the little wooden stairs he went where he had never been before to the small square landing almost filled up with the great chest for oat cake 
5339_14134_000091_000010	train-clean-100	He breathed hard for a minute and then knocked at the door of Sylvia s room 
none	none	Sylvie 
5339_14134_000092_000001	train-clean-100	I m going away say good by No answer 
5339_14134_000092_000002	train-clean-100	Not a sound heard Sylvie a little louder and less hoarsely spoken 
5339_14134_000092_000003	train-clean-100	There was no reply 
5339_14134_000093_000000	train-clean-100	no reply 
none	none	Sylvie I shall be a long time away perhaps I may niver come back at all here he bitterly thought of an unregarded death Say good by No answer 
5339_14134_000092_000006	train-clean-100	He waited patiently 
5339_14134_000092_000007	train-clean-100	Can she be wearied out and gone to sleep he wondered 
5339_14134_000092_000008	train-clean-100	Yet once again Good by Sylvie and God bless yo 
5339_14134_000092_000009	train-clean-100	I m sorry I vexed yo 
none	none	No reply 
5339_14134_000094_000000	train-clean-100	With a heavy heavy heart he creaked down the stairs felt for his cap and left the house 
none	none	She s warned any way thought he 
5339_14134_000095_000001	train-clean-100	Just at that moment the little casement window of Sylvia s room was opened and she said 
5339_14134_000096_000000	train-clean-100	 Good by Philip 
5339_14134_000097_000000	train-clean-100	The window was shut again as soon as the words were spoken 
5339_14134_000097_000001	train-clean-100	Philip knew the uselessness of remaining the need for his departure and yet he stood still for a little time like one entranced as if his will had lost all power to compel him to leave the place 
5339_14134_000097_000002	train-clean-100	Those two words of hers which two hours before would have been so far beneath his aspirations had now power to re light hope to quench reproach or blame 
none	none	She s but a young lassie said he to himself an Kinraid has been playing wi her as such as he can t help doing once they get among the women An I came down sudden on her about Annie Coulson and touched her pride Maybe too it were ill advised to tell her how her mother was feared for her I couldn t ha left the place to morrow if he d been biding here but he s off for half a year or so and I ll be home again as soon as iver I can In half a year such as he forgets if iver he s thought serious about her but in a my lifetime if I live to fourscore I can niver forget God bless her for saying Good by Philip He repeated the words aloud in fond mimicry of her tones Good by Philip CHAPTER XVIII EDDY IN LOVE S CURRENT The next morning shone bright and clear if ever a March morning did The beguiling month was coming in like a lamb with whatever storms it might go raging out It was long since Philip had tasted the freshness of the early air on the shore or in the country as his employment at the shop detained him in Monkshaven till the evening And as he turned down the quays or staithes on the north side of the river towards the shore and met the fresh sea breeze blowing right in his face it was impossible not to feel bright and elastic With his knapsack slung over his shoulder he was prepared for a good stretch towards Hartlepool whence a coach would take him to Newcastle before night For seven or eight miles the level sands were as short and far more agreeable a road than the up and down land ways Philip walked on pretty briskly unconsciously enjoying the sunny landscape before him the crisp curling waves rushing almost up to his feet on his right hand and then swishing back over the fine small pebbles into the great swelling sea To his left were the cliffs rising one behind another having deep gullies here and there between with long green slopes upward from the land and then sudden falls of brown and red soil or rock deepening to a yet greater richness of colour at their base towards the blue ocean before him The loud monotonous murmur of the advancing and receding waters lulled him into dreaminess the sunny look of everything tinged his day dreams with hope So he trudged merrily over the first mile or so not an obstacle to his measured pace on the hard level pavement not a creature to be seen since he had left the little gathering of bare legged urchins dabbling in the sea pools near Monkshaven The cares of land were shut out by the glorious barrier of rocks before him There were some great masses that had been detached by the action of the weather and lay half embedded in the sand draperied over by the heavy pendent olive green seaweed The waves were nearer at this point the advancing sea came up with a mighty distant length of roar here and there the smooth swell was lashed by the fret against unseen rocks into white breakers but otherwise the waves came up from the German Ocean upon that English shore with a long steady roll that might have taken its first impetus far away in the haunt of the sea serpent on the coast of Norroway over the foam The air was soft as May right overhead the sky was blue but it deadened into gray near the sea lines Flocks of seagulls hovered about the edge of the waves slowly rising and turning their white under plumage to glimmer in the sunlight as Philip approached The whole scene was so peaceful so soothing that it dispelled the cares and fears too well founded in fact which had weighed down on his heart during the dark hours of the past night There was Haytersbank gully opening down its green entrance among the warm brown bases of the cliffs Below in the sheltered brushwood among the last year s withered leaves some primroses might be found He half thought of gathering Sylvia a posy of them and rushing up to the farm to make a little farewell peace offering But on looking at his watch he put all thoughts of such an action out of his head it was above an hour later than he had supposed and he must make all haste on to Hartlepool Just as he was approaching this gully a man came dashing down and ran out some way upon the sand with the very force of his descent then he turned to the left and took the direction of Hartlepool a hundred yards or so in advance of Philip He never stayed to look round him but went swiftly and steadily on his way By the peculiar lurch in his walk by everything Philip knew it was the specksioneer Kinraid Now the road up Haytersbank gully led to the farm and nowhere else Still any one wishing to descend to the shore might do so by first going up to the Robsons house and skirting the walls till they came to the little slender path down to the shore But by the farm by the very house door they must of necessity pass Philip slackened his pace keeping under the shadow of the rock By and by Kinraid walking on the sunlight open sands turned round and looked long and earnestly towards Haytersbank gully Hepburn paused when he paused but as intently as he looked at some object above so intently did Hepburn look at him No need to ascertain by sight towards whom his looks his thoughts were directed He took off his hat and waved it touching one part of it as if with particular meaning When he turned away at last Hepburn heaved a heavy sigh and crept yet more into the cold dank shadow of the cliffs Each step was now a heavy task his sad heart tired and weary After a while he climbed up a few feet so as to mingle his form yet more completely with the stones and rocks around Stumbling over the uneven and often jagged points slipping on the sea weed plunging into little pools of water left by the ebbing tide in some natural basins he yet kept his eyes fixed as if in fascination on Kinraid and made his way almost alongside of him But the last hour had pinched Hepburn s features into something of the wan haggardness they would wear when he should first be lying still for ever And now the two men were drawing near a creek about eight miles from Monkshaven The creek was formed by a beck or small stream that came flowing down from the moors and took its way to the sea between the widening rocks The melting of the snows and running of the flooded water springs above made this beck in the early spring time both deep and wide Hepburn knew that here they both must take a path leading inland to a narrow foot bridge about a quarter of a mile up the stream indeed from this point owing to the jutting out of the rocks the land path was the shortest and this way lay by the water side at an angle right below the cliff to which Hepburn s steps were leading him He knew that on this long level field path he might easily be seen by any one following nay if he followed any one at a short distance for it was full of turnings and he resolved late as he was to sit down for a while till Kinraid was far enough in advance for him to escape being seen He came up to the last rock behind which he could be concealed seven or eight feet above the stream he stood and looked cautiously for the specksioneer Up by the rushing stream he looked then right below It is God s providence he murmured It is God s providence He crouched down where he had been standing and covered his face with his hands He tried to deafen as well as to blind himself that he might neither hear nor see anything of the coming event of which he an inhabitant of Monkshaven at that day well understood the betokening signs Kinraid had taken the larger angle of the sands before turning up towards the bridge He came along now nearing the rocks By this time he was sufficiently buoyant to whistle to himself It steeled Philip s heart to what was coming to hear his rival whistling Weel may the keel row so soon after parting with Sylvia The instant Kinraid turned the corner of the cliff the ambush was upon him Four man of war s men sprang on him and strove to pinion him In the King s name cried they with rough triumphant jeers Their boat was moored not a dozen yards above they were sent by the tender of a frigate lying off Hartlepool for fresh water The tender was at anchor just beyond the jutting rocks in face They knew that fishermen were in the habit of going to and from their nets by the side of the creek but such a prize as this active strong and evidently superior sailor was what they had not hoped for and their endeavours to secure him were in proportion to the value of the prize Although taken by surprise and attacked by so many Kinraid did not lose his wits He wrenched himself free crying out loud Avast I m a protected whaler I claim my protection I ve my papers to show I m bonded specksioneer to the Urania whaler Donkin captain North Shields port As a protected whaler the press gang had by the seventeenth section of Act twenty six Geo III no legal right to seize him unless he had failed to return to his ship by the tenth March following the date of his bond But of what use were the papers he hastily dragged out of his breast of what use were laws in those days of slow intercourse with such as were powerful enough to protect and in the time of popular panic against a French invasion D n your protection cried the leader of the press gang come and serve his Majesty that s better than catching whales Is it though said the specksioneer with a motion of his hand which the swift eyed sailor opposed to him saw and interpreted rightly Thou wilt wilt thou Close with him Jack and ware the cutlass In a minute his cutlass was forced from him and it became a hand to hand struggle of which from the difference in numbers it was not difficult to foretell the result Yet Kinraid made desperate efforts to free himself he wasted no breath in words but fought as the men said like a very devil Hepburn heard loud pants of breath great thuds the dull struggle of limbs on the sand the growling curses of those who thought to have managed their affair more easily the sudden cry of some one wounded not Kinraid he knew Kinraid would have borne any pain in silence at such a moment another wrestling swearing infuriated strife and then a strange silence Hepburn sickened at the heart was then his rival dead had he left this bright world lost his life his love For an instant Hepburn felt guilty of his death he said to himself he had never wished him dead and yet in the struggle he had kept aloof and now it might be too late for ever Philip could not bear the suspense he looked stealthily round the corner of the rock behind which he had been hidden and saw that they had overpowered Kinraid and too exhausted to speak were binding him hand and foot to carry him to their boat Kinraid lay as still as any hedgehog he rolled when they pushed him he suffered himself to be dragged without any resistance any motion the strong colour brought into his face while fighting was gone now his countenance was livid pale his lips were tightly held together as if it cost him more effort to be passive wooden and stiff in their hands than it had done to fight and struggle with all his might His eyes seemed the only part about him that showed cognizance of what was going on They were watchful vivid fierce as those of a wild cat brought to bay seeking in its desperate quickened brain for some mode of escape not yet visible and in all probability never to become visible to the hopeless creature in its supreme agony Without a motion of his head he was perceiving and taking in everything while he lay bound at the bottom of the boat A sailor sat by his side who had been hurt by a blow from him The man held his head in his hand moaning but every now and then he revenged himself by a kick at the prostrate specksioneer till even his comrades stopped their cursing and swearing at their prisoner for the trouble he had given them to cry shame on their comrade But Kinraid never spoke nor shrank from the outstretched foot One of his captors with the successful insolence of victory ventured to jeer him on the supposed reason for his vehement and hopeless resistance He might have said yet more insolent things the kicks might have hit harder Kinraid did not hear or heed His soul was beating itself against the bars of inflexible circumstance reviewing in one terrible instant of time what had been what might have been what was Yet while these thoughts thus stabbed him he was still mechanically looking out for chances He moved his head a little so as to turn towards Haytersbank where Sylvia must be quickly if sadly going about her simple daily work and then his quick eye caught Hepburn s face blanched with excitement rather than fear watching eagerly from behind the rock where he had sat breathless during the affray and the impressment of his rival Come here lad shouted the specksioneer as soon as he saw Philip heaving and writhing his body the while with so much vigour that the sailors started away from the work they were engaged in about the boat and held him down once more as if afraid he should break the strong rope that held him like withes of green flax But the bound man had no such notion in his head His mighty wish was to call Hepburn near that he might send some message by him to Sylvia Come here Hepburn he cried again falling back this time so weak and exhausted that the man of war s men became sympathetic Come down peeping Tom and don t be afeared they called out I m not afeared said Philip I m no sailor for yo t impress me nor have yo any right to take that fellow he s a Greenland specksioneer under protection as I know and can testify Yo and yo r testify go hang Make haste man and hear what this gem man as was in a dirty blubbery whale ship and is now in his Majesty s service has got to say I dare say Jack went on the speaker it s some message to his sweetheart asking her to come for to serve on board ship along with he like Billy Taylor s young woman Philip was coming towards them slowly not from want of activity but because he was undecided what he should be called upon to do or to say by the man whom he hated and dreaded yet whom just now he could not help admiring Kinraid groaned with impatience at seeing one free to move with quick decision so slow and dilatory Come on then cried the sailors or we ll take you too on board and run you up and down the main mast a few times Nothing like life aboard ship for quickening a land lubber Yo d better take him and leave me said Kinraid grimly I ve been taught my lesson and seemingly he has his yet to learn His Majesty isn t a schoolmaster to need scholars but a jolly good captain to need men replied the leader of the gang eyeing Philip nevertheless and questioning within himself how far with only two other available men they durst venture on his capture as well as the specksioneer s It might be done he thought even though there was this powerful captive aboard and the boat to manage too but running his eye over Philip s figure he decided that the tall stooping fellow was never cut out for a sailor and that he should get small thanks if he captured him to pay him for the possible risk of losing the other Or else the mere fact of being a landsman was of as little consequence to the press gang as the protecting papers which Kinraid had vainly showed Yon fellow wouldn t have been worth his grog this many a day and be d d to you said he catching Hepburn by the shoulder and giving him a push Philip stumbled over something in this his forced run He looked down his foot had caught in Kinraid s hat which had dropped off in the previous struggle In the band that went round the low crown a ribbon was knotted a piece of that same ribbon which Philip had chosen out with such tender hope to give to Sylvia for the Corneys party on new year s eve He knew every delicate thread that made up the briar rose pattern and a spasm of hatred towards Kinraid contracted his heart He had been almost relenting into pity for the man captured before his eyes now he abhorred him Kinraid did not speak for a minute or two The sailors who had begun to take him into favour were all agog with curiosity to hear the message to his sweetheart which they believed he was going to send Hepburn s perceptions quickened with his vehement agitation of soul were aware of this feeling of theirs and it increased his rage against Kinraid who had exposed the idea of Sylvia to be the subject of ribald whispers But the specksioneer cared little what others said or thought about the maiden whom he yet saw before his closed eyelids as she stood watching him from the Haytersbank gully waving her hands her handkerchief all in one passionate farewell What do yo want wi me asked Hepburn at last in a gloomy tone If he could have helped it he would have kept silence till Kinraid spoke first but he could no longer endure the sailors nudges and winks and jests among themselves Tell Sylvia said Kinraid There s a smart name for a sweetheart exclaimed one of the men but Kinraid went straight on What yo ve seen how I ve been pressed by this cursed gang Civil words messmate if you please Sylvia can t abide cursing and swearing I m sure We re gentlemen serving his Majesty on board the Alcestis and this proper young fellow shall be helped on to more honour and glory than he d ever get bobbing for whales Tell Sylvia this with my love Jack Carter s love if she s anxious about my name One of the sailors laughed at this rude humour another bade Carter hold his stupid tongue Philip hated him in his heart Kinraid hardly heard him He was growing faint with the heavy blows he had received the stunning fall he had met with and the reaction from his dogged self control at first Philip did not speak nor move Tell her continued Kinraid rousing himself for another effort what yo ve seen Tell her I ll come back to her Bid her not forget the great oath we took together this morning she s as much my wife as if we d gone to church I ll come back and marry her afore long Philip said something inarticulately Hurra cried Carter and I ll be best man Tell her too that I ll have an eye on her sweetheart and keep him from running after other girls Yo ll have yo r hands full then muttered Philip his passion boiling over at the thought of having been chosen out from among all men to convey such a message as Kinraid s to Sylvia Make an end of yo r d d yarns and be off said the man who had been hurt by Kinraid and who had sate apart and silent till now Philip turned away Kinraid raised himself and cried after him Hepburn Hepburn tell her what he added Philip could not hear for the words were lost before they reached him in the outward noise of the regular splash of the oars and the rush of the wind down the gully with which mingled the closer sound that filled his ears of his own hurrying blood surging up into his brain He was conscious that he had said something in reply to Kinraid s adjuration that he would deliver his message to Sylvia at the very time when Carter had stung him into fresh anger by the allusion to the possibility of the specksioneer s running after other girls for for an instant Hepburn had been touched by the contrast of circumstances Kinraid an hour or two ago Kinraid a banished man for in those days an impressed sailor might linger out years on some foreign station far from those he loved who all this time remained ignorant of his cruel fate But Hepburn began to wonder what he himself had said how much of a promise he had made to deliver those last passionate words of Kinraid s He could not recollect how much how little he had said he knew he had spoken hoarsely and low almost at the same time as Carter had uttered his loud joke But he doubted if Kinraid had caught his words And then the dread Inner Creature who lurks in each of our hearts arose and said It is as well a promise given is a fetter to the giver But a promise is not given when it has not been received At a sudden impulse he turned again towards the shore when he had crossed the bridge and almost ran towards the verge of the land Then he threw himself down on the soft fine turf that grew on the margin of the cliffs overhanging the sea and commanding an extent of view towards the north His face supported by his hands he looked down upon the blue rippling ocean flashing here and there into the sunlight in long glittering lines The boat was still in the distance making her swift silent way with long regular bounds to the tender that lay in the offing Hepburn felt insecure as in a nightmare dream so long as the boat did not reach her immediate destination His contracted eyes could see four minute figures rowing with ceaseless motion and a fifth sate at the helm But he knew there was a sixth unseen lying bound and helpless at the bottom of the boat and his fancy kept expecting this man to start up and break his bonds and overcome all the others and return to the shore free and triumphant It was by no fault of Hepburn s that the boat sped well away that she was now alongside the tender dancing on the waves now emptied of her crew now hoisted up to her place No fault of his and yet it took him some time before he could reason himself into the belief that his mad feverish wishes not an hour before his wild prayer to be rid of his rival as he himself had scrambled onward over the rocks alongside of Kinraid s path on the sands had not compelled the event Anyhow thought he as he rose up my prayer is granted God be thanked Once more he looked out towards the ship She had spread her beautiful great sails and was standing out to sea in the glittering path of the descending sun He saw that he had been delayed on his road and had lingered long He shook his stiffened limbs shouldered his knapsack and prepared to walk on to Hartlepool as swiftly as he could CHAPTER XIX AN IMPORTANT MISSION Philip was too late for the coach he had hoped to go by but there was another that left at night and which reached Newcastle in the forenoon so that by the loss of a night s sleep he might overtake his lost time But restless and miserable he could not stop in Hartlepool longer than to get some hasty food at the inn from which the coach started He acquainted himself with the names of the towns through which it would pass and the inns at which it would stop and left word that the coachman was to be on the look out for him and pick him up at some one of these places He was thoroughly worn out before this happened too much tired to gain any sleep in the coach When he reached Newcastle he went to engage his passage in the next London bound smack and then directed his steps to Robinson s in the Side to make all the inquiries he could think of respecting the plough his uncle wanted to know about So it was pretty late in the afternoon indeed almost evening before he arrived at the small inn on the quay side where he intended to sleep It was but a rough kind of place frequented principally by sailors he had been recommended to it by Daniel Robson who had known it well in former days The accommodation in it was however clean and homely and the people keeping it were respectable enough in their way Still Hepburn was rather repelled by the appearance of the sailors who sate drinking in the bar and he asked in a low voice if there was not another room The woman stared in surprise and only shook her head Hepburn went to a separate table away from the roaring fire which on this cold March evening was the great attraction and called for food and drink Then seeing that the other men were eyeing him with the sociable idea of speaking to him he asked for pen and ink and paper with the intention of defeating their purpose by pre occupation on his part But when the paper came the new pen the unused thickened ink he hesitated long before he began to write and at last he slowly put down the words DEAR AND HONOURED UNCLE There was a pause his meal was brought and hastily swallowed Even while he was eating it he kept occasionally touching up the letters of these words When he had drunk a glass of ale he began again to write fluently this time for he was giving an account of the plough Then came another long stop he was weighing in his own mind what he should say about Kinraid Once he thought for a second of writing to Sylvia herself and telling her how much She might treasure up her lover s words like grains of gold while they were lighter than dust in their meaning to Philip s mind words which such as the specksioneer used as counters to beguile and lead astray silly women It was for him to prove his constancy by action and the chances of his giving such proof were infinitesimal in Philip s estimation But should the latter mention the bare fact of Kinraid s impressment to Robson That would have been the natural course of things remembering that the last time Philip had seen either they were in each other s company Twenty times he put his pen to the paper with the intention of relating briefly the event that had befallen Kinraid and as often he stopped as though the first word would be irrevocable While he thus sate pen in hand thinking himself wiser than conscience and looking on beyond the next step which she bade him take into an indefinite future he caught some fragments of the sailors talk at the other end of the room which made him listen to their words They were speaking of that very Kinraid the thought of whom filled his own mind like an actual presence In a rough careless way they spoke of the specksioneer with admiration enough for his powers as a sailor and harpooner and from that they passed on to jesting mention of his power amongst women and one or two girls names were spoken of in connection with him Hepburn silently added Annie Coulson and Sylvia Robson to this list and his cheeks turned paler as he did so Long after they had done speaking about Kinraid after they had paid their shot and gone away he sate in the same attitude thinking bitter thoughts The people of the house prepared for bed Their silent guest took no heed of their mute signs At length the landlord spoke to him and he started gathered his wits together with an effort and prepared to retire with the rest But before he did so he signed and directed the letter to his uncle leaving it still open however in case some sudden feeling should prompt him to add a postscript The landlord volunteered the information that the letter his guest had been writing must be posted early the next morning if it was going south as the mails in that direction only left Newcastle every other day All night long Hepburn wearied himself with passionate tossings prompted by stinging recollection Towards morning he fell into a dead sound sleep He was roused by a hasty knocking at the door It was broad full daylight he had overslept himself and the smack was leaving by the early tide He was even now summoned on board He dressed wafered his letter and rushed with it to the neighbouring post office and without caring to touch the breakfast for which he paid he embarked Once on board he experienced the relief which it always is to an undecided man and generally is at first to any one who has been paltering with duty when circumstances decide for him In the first case it is pleasant to be relieved from the burden of decision in the second the responsibility seems to be shifted on to impersonal events And so Philip sailed out of the mouth of the Tyne on to the great open sea It would be a week before the smack reached London even if she pursued a tolerably straight course but she had to keep a sharp look out after possible impressment of her crew and it was not until after many dodges and some adventures that at the end of a fortnight from the time of his leaving Monkshaven Philip found himself safely housed in London and ready to begin the delicate piece of work which was given him to do He felt himself fully capable of unravelling each clue to information and deciding on the value of the knowledge so gained But during the leisure of the voyage he had wisely determined to communicate everything he learnt about Dickinson in short every step he took in the matter by letter to his employers And thus his mind both in and out of his lodgings might have appeared to have been fully occupied with the concerns of others But there were times when the miserable luxury of dwelling upon his own affairs was his when he lay down in his bed till he fell into restless sleep when the point to which his steps tended in his walks was ascertained Then he gave himself up to memory and regret which often deepened into despair and but seldom was cheered by hope He grew so impatient of the ignorance in which he was kept for in those days of heavy postage any correspondence he might have had on mere Monkshaven intelligence was very limited as to the affairs at Haytersbank that he cut out an advertisement respecting some new kind of plough from a newspaper that lay in the chop house where he usually dined and rising early the next morning he employed the time thus gained in going round to the shop where these new ploughs were sold That night he wrote another letter to Daniel Robson with a long account of the merits of the implements he had that day seen With a sick heart and a hesitating hand he wound up with a message of regard to his aunt and to Sylvia an expression of regard which he dared not make as warm as he wished and which consequently fell below the usual mark attained by such messages and would have appeared to any one who cared to think about it as cold and formal When this letter was despatched Hepburn began to wonder what he had hoped for in writing it He knew that Daniel could write or rather that he could make strange hieroglyphics the meaning of which puzzled others and often himself but these pen and ink signs were seldom employed by Robson and never so far as Philip knew for the purpose of letter writing But still he craved so for news of Sylvia even for a sight of paper which she had seen and perhaps touched that he thought all his trouble about the plough to say nothing of the one and twopence postage which he had prepaid in order to make sure of his letter s reception in the frugal household at Haytersbank well lost for the mere chance of his uncle s caring enough for the intelligence to write in reply or even to get some friend to write an answer for in such case perhaps Philip might see her name mentioned in some way even though it was only that she sent her duty to him But the post office was dumb no letter came from Daniel Robson Philip heard it is true from his employers pretty frequently on business and he felt sure they would have named it if any ill had befallen his uncle s family for they knew of the relationship and of his intimacy there They generally ended their formal letters with as formal a summary of Monkshaven news but there was never a mention of the Robsons and that of itself was well but it did not soothe Philip s impatient curiosity He had never confided his attachment to his cousin to any one it was not his way but he sometimes thought that if Coulson had not taken his present appointment to a confidential piece of employment so ill he would have written to him and asked him to go up to Haytersbank Farm and let him know how they all were All this time he was transacting the affair on which he had been sent with great skill and indeed in several ways he was quietly laying the foundation for enlarging the business in Monkshaven Naturally grave and quiet and slow to speak he impressed those who saw him with the idea of greater age and experience than he really possessed Indeed those who encountered him in London thought he was absorbed in the business of money making Yet before the time came when he could wind up affairs and return to Monkshaven he would have given all he possessed for a letter from his uncle telling him something about Sylvia For he still hoped to hear from Robson although he knew that he hoped against reason But we often convince ourselves by good argument that what we wish for need never have been expected and then at the end of our reasoning find that we might have saved ourselves the trouble for that our wishes are untouched and are as strong enemies to our peace of mind as ever Hepburn s baulked hope was the Mordecai sitting in Haman s gate all his success in his errand to London his well doing in worldly affairs was tasteless and gave him no pleasure because of this blank and void of all intelligence concerning Sylvia And yet he came back with a letter from the Fosters in his pocket curt yet expressive of deep gratitude for his discreet services in London and at another time in fact if Philip s life had been ordered differently to what it was it might have given this man a not unworthy pleasure to remember that without a penny of his own simply by diligence honesty and faithful quick sightedness as to the interests of his masters he had risen to hold the promise of being their successor and to be ranked by them as a trusted friend As the Newcastle smack neared the shore on her voyage home Hepburn looked wistfully out for the faint gray outline of Monkshaven Priory against the sky and the well known cliffs as if the masses of inanimate stone could tell him any news of Sylvia In the streets of Shields just after landing he encountered a neighbour of the Robsons and an acquaintance of his own By this honest man he was welcomed as a great traveller is welcomed on his return from a long voyage with many hearty good shakes of the hand much repetition of kind wishes and offers to treat him to drink Yet from some insurmountable feeling Philip avoided all mention of the family who were the principal bond between the honest farmer and himself He did not know why but he could not bear the shock of first hearing her name in the open street or in the rough public house And thus he shrank from the intelligence he craved to hear Thus he knew no more about the Robsons when he returned to Monkshaven than he had done on the day when he had last seen them and of course his first task there was to give a long viva voce account of all his London proceedings to the two brothers Foster who considering that they had heard the result of everything by letter seemed to take an insatiable interest in details He could hardly tell why but even when released from the Fosters parlour he was unwilling to go to Haytersbank Farm It was late it is true but on a May evening even country people keep up till eight or nine o clock Perhaps it was because Hepburn was still in his travel stained dress having gone straight to the shop on his arrival in Monkshaven Perhaps it was because if he went this night for the short half hour intervening before bed time he would have no excuse for paying a longer visit on the following evening At any rate he proceeded straight to Alice Rose s as soon as he had finished his interview with his employers Both Hester and Coulson had given him their welcome home in the shop which they had however left an hour or two before him Yet they gave him a fresh greeting almost one in which surprise was blended when he came to his lodgings Even Alice seemed gratified by his spending this first evening with them as if she had thought it might have been otherwise Weary though he was he exerted himself to talk and to relate what he had done and seen in London as far as he could without breaking confidence with his employers It was something to see the pleasure he gave to his auditors although there were several mixed feelings in their minds to produce the expression of it which gratified him Coulson was sorry for his former ungenerous reception of the news that Philip was going to London Hester and her mother each secretly began to feel as if this evening was like more happy evenings of old before the Robsons came to Haytersbank Farm and who knows what faint delicious hopes this resemblance may not have suggested While Philip restless and excited feeling that he could not sleep was glad to pass away the waking hours that must intervene before to morrow night at times he tried to make them talk of what had happened in Monkshaven during his absence but all had gone on in an eventless manner as far as he could gather if they knew of anything affecting the Robsons they avoided speaking of it to him and indeed how little likely were they ever to have heard their names while he was away CHAPTER XX LOVED AND LOST Philip walked towards the Robsons farm like a man in a dream who has everything around him according to his wish and yet is conscious of a secret mysterious inevitable drawback to his enjoyment Hepburn did not care to think would not realize what this drawback which need not have been mysterious in his case was The May evening was glorious in light and shadow The crimson sun warmed up the chilly northern air to a semblance of pleasant heat The spring sights and sounds were all about the lambs were bleating out their gentle weariness before they sank to rest by the side of their mothers the linnets were chirping in every bush of golden gorse that grew out of the stone walls the lark was singing her good night in the cloudless sky before she dropped down to her nest in the tender green wheat all spoke of brooding peace but Philip s heart was not at peace Yet he was going to proclaim his good fortune His masters had that day publicly announced that Coulson and he were to be their successors and he had now arrived at that longed for point in his business when he had resolved to openly speak of his love to Sylvia and might openly strive to gain her love But alas the fulfilment of that wish of his had lagged sadly behind He was placed as far as he could even in his most sanguine moments have hoped to be as regarded business but Sylvia was as far from his attainment as ever nay farther Still the great obstacle was removed in Kinraid s impressment Philip took upon himself to decide that with such a man as the specksioneer absence was equivalent to faithless forgetfulness He thought that he had just grounds for this decision in the account he had heard of Kinraid s behaviour to Annie Coulson to the other nameless young girl her successor in his fickle heart in the ribald talk of the sailors in the Newcastle public house It would be well for Sylvia if she could forget as quickly and to promote this oblivion the name of her lover should never be brought up either in praise or blame And Philip would be patient and enduring all the time watching over her and labouring to win her reluctant love There she was He saw her as he stood at the top of the little hill path leading down to the Robsons door She was out of doors in the garden which at some distance from the house sloped up the bank on the opposite side of the gully much too far off to be spoken to not too far off to be gazed at by eyes that caressed her every movement How well Philip knew that garden placed long ago by some tenant of the farm on a southern slope walled in with rough moorland stones planted with berry bushes for use and southernwood and sweet briar for sweetness of smell When the Robsons had first come to Haytersbank and Sylvia was scarcely more than a pretty child how well he remembered helping her with the arrangement of this garden laying out his few spare pence in hen and chicken daisies at one time in flower seeds at another again in a rose tree in a pot He knew how his unaccustomed hands had laboured with the spade at forming a little primitive bridge over the beck in the hollow before winter streams should make it too deep for fording how he had cut down branches of the mountain ash and covered them over yet decked with their scarlet berries with sods of green turf beyond which the brilliancy crept out but now it was months and years since he had been in that garden which had lost its charm for Sylvia as she found the bleak sea winds came up and blighted all endeavours at cultivating more than the most useful things pot herbs marigolds potatoes onions and such like Why did she tarry there now standing quite motionless up by the highest bit of wall looking over the sea with her hand shading her eyes Quite motionless as if she were a stone statue He began to wish she would move would look at him but any way that she would move and not stand gazing thus over that great dreary sea He went down the path with an impatient step and entered the house place There sat his aunt spinning and apparently as well as ever He could hear his uncle talking to Kester in the neighbouring shippen all was well in the household Why was Sylvia standing in the garden in that strange quiet way Why lad thou rt a sight for sair een said his aunt as she stood up to welcome him back An when didst ta come eh but thy uncle will be glad to see thee and to hear thee talk about yon pleughs he s thought a deal o thy letters I ll go call him in Not yet said Philip stopping her in her progress towards the door He s busy talking to Kester I m in no haste to be gone I can stay a couple of hours Sit down and tell me how you are yoursel and how iverything is And I ve a deal to tell you To be sure to be sure To think thou s been in Lunnon sin I saw thee well to be sure There s a vast o coming and going i this world Thou ll mind yon specksioneer lad him as was cousin to t Corneys Charley Kinraid Mind him As if he could forget him Well he s dead and gone Dead Who told you I don t understand said Philip in strange bewilderment Could Kinraid have tried to escape after all and been wounded killed in the attempt If not how should they know he was dead Missing he might be though how this should be known was strange as he was supposed to be sailing to the Greenland seas But dead What did they mean At Philip s worst moment of hatred he had hardly dared to wish him dead Dunnot yo mention it afore our Sylvie we niver speak on him to her for she takes it a deal to heart though I m thinkin it were a good thing for her for he d got a hold of her he had on Bessy Corney too as her mother telled me not that I iver let on to them as Sylvia frets after him so keep a calm sough my lad It s a girl s fancy just a kind o calf love let it go by and it s well for her he s dead though it s hard to say so on a drowned man Drowned said Philip How do yo know half hoping that the poor drenched swollen body might have been found and thus all questions and dilemmas solved Kinraid might have struggled overboard with ropes or handcuffs on and so have been drowned Eh lad there s no misdoubtin it He were thought a deal on by t captain o t Urania and when he niver come back on t day when she ought for to have sailed he sent to Kinraid s people at Cullercoats and they sent to Brunton s i Newcassel and they knew he d been here T captain put off sailing for two or three days that he might ha that much law but when he heard as Kinraid were not at Corneys but had left em a most on to a week he went off to them Northern seas wi t next best specksioneer he could find For there s no use speaking ill on t dead an though I couldn t abear his coming for iver about t house he were a rare good specksioneer as I ve been told But how do you know he was drowned said Philip feeling guiltily disappointed at his aunt s story Why lad I m a most ashamed to tell thee I were sore put out mysel but Sylvia were so broken hearted like I couldn t cast it up to her as I should ha liked th silly lass had gone and gi en him a bit o ribbon as many a one knowed for it had been a vast noticed and admired that evenin at th Corneys new year s eve I think it were and t poor vain peacock had tied it on his hat so that when t tide hist there s Sylvie coming in at t back door never let on and in a forced made up voice she inquired aloud for hitherto she had been speaking almost in a whisper And didst ta see King George an Queen Charlotte Philip could not answer did not hear His soul had gone out to meet Sylvia who entered with quiet slowness quite unlike her former self Her face was wan and white her gray eyes seemed larger and full of dumb tearless sorrow she came up to Philip as if his being there touched her with no surprise and gave him a gentle greeting as if he were a familiar indifferent person whom she had seen but yesterday Philip who had recollected the quarrel they had had and about Kinraid too the very last time they had met had expected some trace of this remembrance to linger in her looks and speech to him But there was no such sign her great sorrow had wiped away all anger almost all memory Her mother looked at her anxiously and then said in the same manner of forced cheerfulness which she had used before Here s Philip lass a full o Lunnon call thy father in an we ll hear a about t new fangled pleughs It ll be rare an nice a sitting together again Sylvia silent and docile went out to the shippen to obey her mother s wish Bell Robson leant forward towards Philip misinterpreting the expression on his face which was guilt as much as sympathy and checked the possible repentance which might have urged him on at that moment to tell all he knew by saying Lad it s a for t best He were noane good enough for her and I misdoubt me he were only playin wi her as he d done by others Let her a be let her a be she ll come round to be thankful Robson bustled in with loud welcome all the louder and more talkative because he like his wife assumed a cheerful manner before Sylvia Yet he unlike his wife had many a secret regret over Kinraid s fate At first while merely the fact of his disappearance was known Daniel Robson had hit on the truth and had stuck to his opinion that the cursed press gang were at the bottom of it He had backed his words by many an oath and all the more because he had not a single reason to give that applied to the present occasion No one on the lonely coast had remarked any sign of the presence of the men of war or the tenders that accompanied them for the purpose of impressment on the king s ships At Shields and at the mouth of the Tyne where they lay in greedy wait the owners of the Urania had caused strict search to be made for their skilled and protected specksioneer but with no success All this positive evidence in contradiction to Daniel Robson s opinion only made him cling to it the more until the day when the hat was found on the shore with Kinraid s name written out large and fair in the inside and the tell tale bit of ribbon knotted in the band Then Daniel by a sudden revulsion gave up every hope it never entered his mind that it could have fallen off by any accident No now Kinraid was dead and drowned and it was a bad job and the sooner it could be forgotten the better for all parties and it was well no one knew how far it had gone with Sylvia especially now since Bessy Corney was crying her eyes out as if he had been engaged to her So Daniel said nothing to his wife about the mischief that had gone on in her absence and never spoke to Sylvia about the affair only he was more than usually tender to her in his rough way and thought morning noon and night on what he could do to give her pleasure and drive away all recollection of her ill starred love To night he would have her sit by him while Philip told his stories or heavily answered questions put to him Sylvia sat on a stool by her father s knee holding one of his hands in both of hers and presently she laid down her head upon them and Philip saw her sad eyes looking into the flickering fire light with long unwinking stare showing that her thoughts were far distant He could hardly go on with his tales of what he had seen and what done he was so full of pity for her Yet for all his pity he had now resolved never to soothe her with the knowledge of what he knew nor to deliver the message sent by her false lover He felt like a mother withholding something injurious from the foolish wish of her plaining child But he went away without breathing a word of his good fortune in business The telling of such kind of good fortune seemed out of place this night when the thought of death and the loss of friends seemed to brood over the household and cast its shadow there obscuring for the time all worldly things And so the great piece of news came out in the ordinary course of gossip told by some Monkshaven friend to Robson the next market day For months Philip had been looking forward to the sensation which the intelligence would produce in the farm household as a preliminary to laying his good fortune at Sylvia s feet And they heard of it and he away and all chance of his making use of it in the manner he had intended vanished for the present Daniel was always curious after other people s affairs and now was more than ever bent on collecting scraps of news which might possibly interest Sylvia and rouse her out of the state of indifference as to everything into which she had fallen Perhaps he thought that he had not acted altogether wisely in allowing her to engage herself to Kinraid for he was a man apt to judge by results and moreover he had had so much reason to repent of the encouragement which he had given to the lover whose untimely end had so deeply affected his only child that he was more unwilling than ever that his wife should know of the length to which the affair had gone during her absence He even urged secrecy upon Sylvia as a personal favour unwilling to encounter the silent blame which he openly affected to despise We ll noane fret thy mother by lettin on how oft he came and went She ll may be be thinkin he were for speakin to thee my poor lass an it would put her out a deal for she s a woman of a stern mind towards matteremony And she ll be noane so strong till summer weather comes and I d be loath to give her aught to worrit hersel about So thee and me ll keep our own counsel I wish mother had been here then she d ha known all without my telling her Cheer up lass it s better as it is Thou ll get o er it sooner for havin no one to let on to A myself am noane going to speak on t again No more he did but there was a strange tenderness in his tones when he spoke to her a half pathetic way of seeking after her if by any chance she was absent for a minute from the places where he expected to find her a consideration for her about this time in his way of bringing back trifling presents or small pieces of news that he thought might interest her which sank deep into her heart And what dun yo think a t folks is talkin on i Monkshaven asked he almost before he had taken off his coat on the day when he had heard of Philip s promotion in the world Why missus thy nephew Philip Hepburn has got his name up i gold letters four inch long o er Fosters door Him and Coulson has set up shop together and Fosters is gone out That s t secret of his journey t Lunnon said Bell more gratified than she chose to show Four inch long if they re theere at all I heerd on it at t Bay Horse first but I thought yo d niver be satisfied bout I seed it wi my own eyes They do say as Gregory Jones t plumber got it done i York for that nought else would satisfy old Jeremiah It ll be a matter o some hundreds a year i Philip s pocket There ll be Fosters i th background as one may say to take t biggest share on t profits said Bell Ay ay that s but as it should be for I reckon they ll ha to find t brass the first my lass said he turning to Sylvia A m fain to tak thee in to t town next market day just for thee t see t A ll buy thee a bonny ribbon for thy hair out o t cousin s own shop Some thought of another ribbon which had once tied up her hair and afterwards been cut in twain must have crossed Sylvia s mind for she answered as if she shrank from her father s words I cannot go I m noane wantin a ribbon I m much obliged father a t same Her mother read her heart clearly and suffered with her but never spoke a word of sympathy But she went on rather more quickly than she would otherwise have done to question her husband as to all he knew about this great rise of Philip s Once or twice Sylvia joined in with languid curiosity but presently she became tired and went to bed For a few moments after she left her parents sate silent Then Daniel in a tone as if he were justifying his daughter and comforting himself as well as his wife observed that it was almost on for nine the evenings were light so long now Bell said nothing in reply but gathered up her wool and began to arrange the things for night By and by Daniel broke the silence by saying A thowt at one time as Philip had a fancy for our Sylvie For a minute or two Bell did not speak Then with deeper insight into her daughter s heart than her husband in spite of his greater knowledge of the events that had happened to affect it she said If thou s thinking on a match between em it ll be a long time afore th poor sad wench is fit t think on another man as sweetheart A said nought about sweethearts replied he as if his wife had reproached him in some way Woman s allays so full o sweethearts and matteremony A only said as a d thowt once as Philip had a fancy for our lass and a think so still and he ll be worth his two hunder a year afore long But a niver said nought about sweethearts CHAPTER XXI A REJECTED SUITOR There were many domestic arrangements to be made in connection with the new commercial ones which affected Hepburn and Coulson The Fosters with something of the busybodiness which is apt to mingle itself with kindly patronage had planned in their own minds that the Rose household should be removed altogether to the house belonging to the shop and that Alice with the assistance of the capable servant who at present managed all John s domestic affairs should continue as mistress of the house with Philip and Coulson for her lodgers But arrangements without her consent did not suit Alice at any time and she had very good reasons for declining to accede to this She was not going to be uprooted at her time of life she said nor would she consent to enter upon a future which might be so uncertain Why Hepburn and Coulson were both young men she said and they were as likely to marry as not and then the bride would be sure to wish to live in the good old fashioned house at the back of the shop It was in vain she was told by every one concerned that in case of such an event the first married partner should take a house of his own leaving her in undisputed possession She replied with apparent truth that both might wish to marry and surely the wife of one ought to take possession of the house belonging to the business that she was not going to trust herself to the fancies of young men who were always the best of them going and doing the very thing that was most foolish in the way of marriage of which state in fact she spoke with something of acrimonious contempt and dislike as if young people always got mismatched yet had not the sense to let older and wiser people choose for them Thou ll not have been understanding why Alice Rose spoke as she did this morning said Jeremiah Foster to Philip on the afternoon succeeding the final discussion of this plan She was a thinking of her youth I reckon when she was a well favoured young woman and our John was full of the thought of marrying her As he could not have her he has lived a bachelor all his days But if I am not a vast mistaken all that he has will go to her and to Hester for all that Hester is the child of another man Thee and Coulson should have a try for Hester Philip I have told Coulson this day of Hester s chances I told him first because he is my wife s nephew but I tell thee now Philip It would be a good thing for the shop if one of ye was married Philip reddened Often as the idea of marriage had come into his mind this was the first time it had been gravely suggested to him by another But he replied quietly enough I don t think Hester Rose has any thought of matrimony To be sure not it is for thee or for William Coulson to make her think She may be remembers enough of her mother s life with her father to make her slow to think on such things But it s in her to think on matrimony it s in all of us Alice s husband was dead before I knew her said Philip rather evading the main subject It was a mercy when he were taken A mercy to them who were left I mean Alice was a bonny young woman with a smile for everybody when he wed her a smile for every one except our John who never could do enough to try and win one from her But no she would have none of him but set her heart on Jack Rose a sailor in a whale ship And so they were married at last though all her own folks were against it And he was a profligate sinner and went after other women and drank and beat her She turned as stiff and as grey as thou seest her now within a year of Hester s birth I believe they d have perished for want and cold many a time if it had not been for John If she ever guessed where the money came from it must have hurt her pride above a bit for she was always a proud woman But mother s love is stronger than pride Philip fell to thinking a generation ago something of the same kind had been going on as that which he was now living through quick with hopes and fears A girl beloved by two nay those two so identical in occupation as he and Kinraid were Rose identical even in character with what he knew of the specksioneer a girl choosing the wrong lover and suffering and soured all her life in consequence of her youth s mistake was that to be Sylvia s lot or rather was she not saved from it by the event of the impressment and by the course of silence he himself had resolved upon Then he went on to wonder if the lives of one generation were but a repetition of the lives of those who had gone before with no variation but from the internal cause that some had greater capacity for suffering than others Would those very circumstances which made the interest of his life now return in due cycle when he was dead and Sylvia was forgotten Perplexed thoughts of this and a similar kind kept returning into Philip s mind whenever he had leisure to give himself up to consideration of anything but the immediate throng of business And every time he dwelt on this complication and succession of similar events he emerged from his reverie more and more satisfied with the course he had taken in withholding from Sylvia all knowledge of her lover s fate It was settled at length that Philip was to remove to the house belonging to the shop Coulson remaining with Alice and her daughter But in the course of the summer the latter told his partner that he had offered marriage to Hester on the previous day and been refused It was an awkward affair altogether as he lived in their house and was in daily companionship with Hester who however seemed to preserve her gentle calmness with only a tinge more of reserve in her manner to Coulson I wish yo could find out what she has again me Philip said Coulson about a fortnight after he had made the proposal The poor young man thought that Hester s composure of manner towards him since the event argued that he was not distasteful to her and as he was now on very happy terms with Philip he came constantly to him as if the latter could interpret the meaning of all the little occurrences between him and his beloved I m o right age not two months betwixt us and there s few in Monkshaven as would think on her wi better prospects than me and she knows my folks we re kind o cousins in fact and I d be like a son to her mother and there s noane i Monkshaven as can speak again my character There s nought between yo and her is there Philip I ha telled thee many a time that she and me is like brother and sister She s no more thought on me nor I have for her So be content wi t for I se not tell thee again Don t be vexed Philip if thou knew what it was to be in love thou d be always fancying things just as I am I might be said Philip but I dunnut think I should be always talking about my fancies I wunnot talk any more after this once if thou ll just find out fra thysel as it were what it is she has again me I d go to chapel for iver with her if that s what she wants Just ask her Philip It s an awkward thing for me to be melling wi said Hepburn reluctantly But thou said thee and she were like brother and sister and a brother would ask a sister and niver think twice about it Well well replied Philip I ll see what I can do but lad I dunnot think she ll have thee She doesn t fancy thee and fancy is three parts o love if reason is t other fourth But somehow Philip could not begin on the subject with Hester He did not know why except that as he said it was so awkward But he really liked Coulson so much as to be anxious to do what the latter wished although he was almost convinced that it would be of no use So he watched his opportunity and found Alice alone and at leisure one Sunday evening She was sitting by the window reading her Bible when he went in She gave him a curt welcome hearty enough for her for she was always chary in her expressions of pleasure or satisfaction But she took off her horn spectacles and placed them in the book to keep her place and then turning more fully round on her chair so as to face him she said Well lad and how does it go on Though it s not a day for t ask about worldly things But I niver see thee now but on Sabbath day and rarely then Still we munnot speak o such things on t Lord s day So thee mun just say how t shop is doing and then we ll leave such vain talk T shop is doing main an well thank ye mother But Coulson could tell yo o that any day I d a deal rayther hear fra thee Philip Coulson doesn t know how t manage his own business let alone half the business as it took John and Jeremiah s heads ay and tasked em too to manage I ve no patience with Coulson Why he s a decent young fellow as ever there is in Monkshaven He may be He s noane cut his wisdom teeth yet But for that matter there s other folks as far fra sense as he is Ay and farther Coulson mayn t be so bright at all times as he might be but he s a steady goer and I d back him again any chap o his age i Monkshaven I know who I d sooner back in many a thing Philip She said it with so much meaning that he could not fail to understand that he himself was meant and he replied ingenuously enough If yo mean me mother I ll noane deny that in a thing or two I may be more knowledgeable than Coulson I ve had a deal o time on my hands i my youth and I d good schooling as long as father lived Lad it s not schooling nor knowledge nor book learning as carries a man through t world It s mother wit And it s noane schooling nor knowledge nor book learning as takes a young woman It s summat as cannot be put into words That s just what I told Coulson said Philip quickly He were sore put about because Hester had gi en him the bucket and came to me about it And what did thou say asked Alice her deep eyes gleaming at him as if to read his face as well as his words Philip thinking he could now do what Coulson had begged of him in the neatest manner went on I told him I d help him all as I could Thou did did thou Well well there s nought sa queer as folks that a will say muttered Alice between her teeth but that fancy had three parts to do wi love continued Philip and it would be hard may be to get a reason for her not fancying him Yet I wish she d think twice about it he so set upon having her I think he ll do himself a mischief wi fretting if it goes on as it is It ll noane go on as it is said Alice with gloomy oracularness How not asked Philip Then receiving no answer he went on He loves her true and he s within a month or two on her age and his character will bear handling on a sides and his share on t shop will be worth hundreds a year afore long Another pause Alice was trying to bring down her pride to say something which she could not with all her efforts Maybe yo ll speak a word for him mother said Philip annoyed at her silence I ll do no such thing Marriages are best made wi out melling How do I know but what she likes some one better Our Hester s not th lass to think on a young man unless he s been a wooing on her And yo know mother as well as I do and Coulson does too she s niver given any one a chance to woo her living half her time here and t other half in t shop and niver speaking to no one by t way I wish thou wouldn t come here troubling me on a Sabbath day wi thy vanity and thy worldly talk I d liefer by far be i that world wheere there s neither marrying nor giving in marriage for it s all a moithering mess here She turned to the closed Bible lying on the dresser and opened it with a bang While she was adjusting her spectacles on her nose with hands trembling with passion she heard Philip say I ask yo r pardon I m sure I couldn t well come any other day It s a t same I care not But thou might as well tell truth I ll be bound thou s been at Haytersbank Farm some day this week Philip reddened in fact he had forgotten how he had got to consider his frequent visits to the farm as a regular piece of occupation He kept silence Alice looked at him with a sharp intelligence that read his silence through I thought so Next time thou thinks to thyself I m more knowledgeable than Coulson just remember Alice Rose s words and they are these If Coulson s too thick sighted to see through a board thou rt too blind to see through a window As for comin and speakin up for Coulson why he ll be married to some one else afore t year s out for all he thinks he s so set upon Hester now Go thy ways and leave me to my Scripture and come no more on Sabbath days wi thy vain babbling So Philip returned from his mission rather crestfallen but quite as far as ever from seeing through a glass window Before the year was out Alice s prophecy was fulfilled Coulson who found the position of a rejected lover in the same house with the girl who had refused him too uncomfortable to be endured as soon as he was convinced that his object was decidedly out of his reach turned his attention to some one else He did not love his new sweetheart as he had done Hester there was more of reason and less of fancy in his attachment But it ended successfully and before the first snow fell Philip was best man at his partner s wedding CHAPTER XXII DEEPENING SHADOWS But before Coulson was married many small events happened small events to all but Philip To him they were as the sun and moon The days when he went up to Haytersbank and Sylvia spoke to him the days when he went up and she had apparently no heart to speak to any one but left the room as soon as he came or never entered it at all although she must have known that he was there these were his alternations from happiness to sorrow From her parents he always had a welcome Oppressed by their daughter s depression of spirits they hailed the coming of any visitor as a change for her as well as for themselves The former intimacy with the Corneys was in abeyance for all parties owing to Bessy Corney s out spoken grief for the loss of her cousin as if she had had reason to look upon him as her lover whereas Sylvia s parents felt this as a slur upon their daughter s cause of grief But although at this time the members of the two families ceased to seek after each other s society nothing was said The thread of friendship might be joined afresh at any time only just now it was broken and Philip was glad of it Before going to Haytersbank he sought each time for some little present with which to make his coming welcome And now he wished even more than ever that Sylvia had cared for learning if she had he could have taken her many a pretty ballad or story book such as were then in vogue He did try her with the translation of the Sorrows of Werther so popular at the time that it had a place in all pedlars baskets with Law s Serious Call the Pilgrim s Progress Klopstock s Messiah and Paradise Lost But she could not read it for herself and after turning the leaves languidly over and smiling a little at the picture of Charlotte cutting bread and butter in a left handed manner she put it aside on the shelf by the Complete Farrier and there Philip saw it upside down and untouched the next time he came to the farm Many a time during that summer did he turn to the few verses in Genesis in which Jacob s twice seven years service for Rachel is related and try and take fresh heart from the reward which came to the patriarch s constancy at last After trying books nosegays small presents of pretty articles of dress such as suited the notions of those days and finding them all received with the same languid gratitude he set himself to endeavour to please her in some other way It was time that he should change his tactics for the girl was becoming weary of the necessity for thanking him every time he came for some little favour or other She wished he would let her alone and not watch her continually with such sad eyes Her father and mother hailed her first signs of impatient petulance towards him as a return to the old state of things before Kinraid had come to disturb the tenour of their lives for even Daniel had turned against the specksioneer irritated by the Corneys loud moans over the loss of the man to whom their daughter said that she was attached If Daniel wished for him to be alive again it was mainly that the Corneys might be convinced that his last visit to the neighbourhood of Monkshaven was for the sake of the pale and silent Sylvia and not for that of Bessy who complained of Kinraid s untimely death rather as if by it she had been cheated of a husband than for any overwhelming personal love towards the deceased If he were after her he were a big black scoundrel that s what he were and a wish he were alive again to be hung But a dunnot believe it them Corney lasses were allays a talkin an a thinking on sweethearts and niver a man crossed t threshold but they tried him on as a husband An their mother were no better Kinraid has spoken civil to Bessy as became a lad to a lass and she makes an ado over him as if they d been to church together not a week sin I dunnot uphold t Corneys but Molly Corney as is Molly Brunton now used to speak on this dead man to our Sylvie as if he were her sweetheart in old days Now there s no smoke without fire and I m thinking it s likely enough he were one of them fellows as is always after some lass or another and as often as not two or three at a time Now look at Philip what a different one he is He s niver thought on a woman but our Sylvie I ll be bound I wish he wern t so old fashioned and faint hearted Ay and t shop s doin a vast o business I ve heard say He s a deal better company too n or he used to be He d a way o preaching wi him as a couldn t abide but now he tak s his glass an holds his tongue leavin room for wiser men to say their say Such was a conjugal colloquy about this time Philip was gaining ground with Daniel and that was something towards winning Sylvia s heart for she was unaware of her father s change of feeling towards Kinraid and took all his tenderness towards herself as if they were marks of his regard for her lost lover and his sympathy in her loss instead of which he was rather feeling as if it might be a good thing after all that the fickle hearted sailor was dead and drowned In fact Daniel was very like a child in all the parts of his character He was strongly affected by whatever was present and apt to forget the absent He acted on impulse and too often had reason to be sorry for it but he hated his sorrow too much to let it teach him wisdom for the future With all his many faults however he had something in him which made him be dearly loved both by the daughter whom he indulged and the wife who was in fact superior to him but whom he imagined that he ruled with a wise and absolute sway Love to Sylvia gave Philip tact He seemed to find out that to please the women of the household he must pay all possible attention to the man and though he cared little in comparison for Daniel yet this autumn he was continually thinking of how he could please him When he had said or done anything to gratify or amuse her father Sylvia smiled and was kind Whatever he did was right with his aunt but even she was unusually glad when her husband was pleased Still his progress was slow towards his object and often he sighed himself to sleep with the words seven years and maybe seven years more Then in his dreams he saw Kinraid again sometimes struggling sometimes sailing towards land the only one on board a swift advancing ship alone on deck stern and avenging till Philip awoke in remorseful terror Such and similar dreams returned with the greater frequency when in the November of that year the coast between Hartlepool and Monkshaven was overshadowed by the presence of guard ships driven south from their station at North Shields by the resolution which the sailors of that port had entered into to resist the press gang and the energy with which they had begun to carry out their determination For on a certain Tuesday evening yet remembered by old inhabitants of North Shields the sailors in the merchant service met together and overpowered the press gang dismissing them from the town with the highest contempt and with their jackets reversed A numerous mob went with them to Chirton Bar gave them three cheers at parting but vowed to tear them limb from limb should they seek to re enter North Shields But a few days afterwards some fresh cause of irritation arose and five hundred sailors armed with such swords and pistols as they could collect paraded through the town in the most riotous manner and at last attempted to seize the tender Eleanor on some pretext of the ill treatment of the impressed men aboard This endeavour failed however owing to the energetic conduct of the officers in command Next day this body of sailors set off for Newcastle but learning before they reached the town that there was a strong military and civil force prepared to receive them there they dispersed for the time but not before the good citizens had received a great fright the drums of the North Yorkshire militia beating to arms and the terrified people rushing out into the streets to learn the reason of the alarm and some of them seeing the militia under the command of the Earl of Fauconberg marching from the guard house adjoining New Gate to the house of rendezvous for impressed seamen in the Broad Chase But a few weeks after the impressment service took their revenge for the insults they had been subjected to in North Shields In the dead of night a cordon was formed round that town by a regiment stationed at Tynemouth barracks the press gangs belonging to armed vessels lying off Shields harbour were let loose no one within the circle could escape and upwards of two hundred and fifty men sailors mechanics labourers of every description were forced on board the armed ships With that prize they set sail and wisely left the place where deep passionate vengeance was sworn against them Not all the dread of an invasion by the French could reconcile the people of these coasts to the necessity of impressment Fear and confusion prevailed after this to within many miles of the sea shore A Yorkshire gentleman of rank said that his labourers dispersed like a covey of birds because a press gang was reported to have established itself so far inland as Tadcaster and they only returned to work on the assurance from the steward of his master s protection but even then begged leave to sleep on straw in the stables or outhouses belonging to their landlord not daring to sleep at their own homes No fish was caught for the fishermen dared not venture out to sea the markets were deserted as the press gangs might come down on any gathering of men prices were raised and many were impoverished many others ruined For in the great struggle in which England was then involved the navy was esteemed her safeguard and men must be had at any price of money or suffering or of injustice Landsmen were kidnapped and taken to London there in too many instances to be discharged without redress and penniless because they were discovered to be useless for the purpose for which they had been taken Autumn brought back the whaling ships But the period of their return was full of gloomy anxiety instead of its being the annual time of rejoicing and feasting of gladdened households where brave steady husbands or sons returned of unlimited and reckless expenditure and boisterous joviality among those who thought that they had earned unbounded licence on shore by their six months of compelled abstinence In other years this had been the time for new and handsome winter clothing for cheerful if humble hospitality for the shopkeepers to display their gayest and best for the public houses to be crowded for the streets to be full of blue jackets rolling along with merry words and open hearts In other years the boiling houses had been full of active workers the staithes crowded with barrels the ship carpenters yards thronged with seamen and captains now a few men tempted by high wages went stealthily by back lanes to their work clustering together with sinister looks glancing round corners and fearful of every approaching footstep as if they were going on some unlawful business instead of true honest work Most of them kept their whaling knives about them ready for bloody defence if they were attacked The shops were almost deserted there was no unnecessary expenditure by the men they dared not venture out to buy lavish presents for the wife or sweetheart or little children The public houses kept scouts on the look out while fierce men drank and swore deep oaths of vengeance in the bar men who did not maunder in their cups nor grow foolishly merry but in whom liquor called forth all the desperate bad passions of human nature Indeed all along the coast of Yorkshire it seemed as if a blight hung over the land and the people Men dodged about their daily business with hatred and suspicion in their eyes and many a curse went over the sea to the three fatal ships lying motionless at anchor three miles off Monkshaven When first Philip had heard in his shop that these three men of war might be seen lying fell and still on the gray horizon his heart sank and he scarcely dared to ask their names For if one should be the Alcestis if Kinraid should send word to Sylvia if he should say he was living and loving and faithful if it should come to pass that the fact of the undelivered message sent by her lover through Philip should reach Sylvia s ears what would be the position of the latter not merely in her love that of course would be hopeless but in her esteem All sophistry vanished the fear of detection awakened Philip to a sense of guilt and besides he found out that in spite of all idle talk and careless slander he could not help believing that Kinraid was in terrible earnest when he uttered those passionate words and entreated that they might be borne to Sylvia Some instinct told Philip that if the specksioneer had only flirted with too many yet that for Sylvia Robson his love was true and vehement Then Philip tried to convince himself that from all that was said of his previous character Kinraid was not capable of an enduring constant attachment and with such poor opiate to his conscience as he could obtain from this notion Philip was obliged to remain content until a day or two after the first intelligence of the presence of those three ships he learned with some trouble and pains that their names were the Megoera the Bellerophon and the Hanover Then he began to perceive how unlikely it was that the Alcestis should have been lingering on this shore all these many months She was doubtless gone far away by this time she had probably joined the fleet on the war station Who could tell what had become of her and her crew she might have been in battle before now and if so So his previous fancies shrank to nothing rebuked for their improbability and with them vanished his self reproach Yet there were times when the popular attention seemed totally absorbed by the dread of the press gang when no other subject was talked about hardly in fact thought about At such flows of panic Philip had his own private fears lest a flash of light should come upon Sylvia and she should suddenly see that Kinraid s absence might be accounted for in another way besides death But when he reasoned this seemed unlikely No man of war had been seen off the coast or if seen had never been spoken about at the time of Kinraid s disappearance If he had vanished this winter time every one would have been convinced that the press gang had seized upon him Philip had never heard any one breathe the dreaded name of the Alcestis Besides he went on to think at the farm they are out of hearing of this one great weary subject of talk But it was not so as he became convinced one evening His aunt caught him a little aside while Sylvia was in the dairy and her husband talking in the shippen with Kester For good s sake Philip dunnot thee bring us talk about t press gang It s a thing as has got hold on my measter till thou d think him possessed He s speaking perpetual on it i such a way that thou d think he were itching to kill em a afore he tasted bread again He really trembles wi rage and passion an a night it s just as bad He starts up i his sleep swearing and cursing at em till I m sometimes afeard he ll mak an end o me by mistake And what mun he do last night but open out on Charley Kinraid and tell Sylvie he thought m appen t gang had got hold on him It might make her cry a her saut tears o er again Philip spoke by no wish of his own but as if compelled to speak An who knows but what it s true The instant these words had come out of his lips he could have bitten his tongue off And yet afterwards it was a sort of balm to his conscience that he had so spoken What nonsense Philip said his aunt why these fearsome ships were far out o sight when he went away good go wi him and Sylvie just getting o er her trouble so nicely and even my master went on for to say if they d getten hold on him he were not a chap to stay wi em he d gi en proofs on his hatred to em time on He either ha made off an then sure enough we should ha heerd on him somehow them Corneys is full on him still and they ve a deal to wi his folk beyond Newcassel or as my master says he were just t chap to hang or drown hissel sooner nor do aught against his will What did Sylvie say asked Philip in a hoarse low voice Say why a she could say was to burst out crying and after a bit she just repeated her feyther s words and said anyhow he was dead for he d niver live to go to sea wi a press gang She knowed him too well for that Thou sees she thinks a deal on him for a spirited chap as can do what he will I belie me she first began to think on him time o t fight aboard th Good Fortune when Darley were killed and he would seem tame like to her if he couldn t conquer press gangs and men o war She s sooner think on him drowned as she s ne er to see him again It s best so said Philip and then to calm his unusually excited aunt he promised to avoid the subject of the press gang as much as possible But it was a promise very difficult of performance for Daniel Robson was as his wife said like one possessed He could hardly think of anything else though he himself was occasionally weary of the same constantly recurring idea and would fain have banished it from his mind He was too old a man to be likely to be taken by them he had no son to become their victim but the terror of them which he had braved and defied in his youth seemed to come back and take possession of him in his age and with the terror came impatient hatred Since his wife s illness the previous winter he had been a more sober man until now He was never exactly drunk for he had a strong well seasoned head but the craving to hear the last news of the actions of the press gang drew him into Monkshaven nearly every day at this dead agricultural season of the year and a public house is generally the focus from which gossip radiates and probably the amount of drink thus consumed weakened Robson s power over his mind and caused the concentration of thought on one subject This may be a physiological explanation of what afterwards was spoken of as a supernatural kind of possession leading him to his doom CHAPTER XXIII RETALIATION The public house that had been chosen by the leaders of the press gang in Monkshaven at this time for their rendezvous or Randyvowse as it was generally pronounced was an inn of poor repute with a yard at the back which opened on to the staithe or quay nearest to the open sea A strong high stone wall bounded this grass grown mouldy yard on two sides the house and some unused out buildings formed the other two The choice of the place was good enough both as to situation which was sufficiently isolated and yet near to the widening river and as to the character of the landlord John Hobbs was a failing man one who seemed as if doomed to be unfortunate in all his undertakings and the consequence of all this was that he was envious of the more prosperous and willing to do anything that might bring him in a little present success in life His household consisted of his wife her niece who acted as servant and an out of doors man a brother of Ned Simpson the well doing butcher who at one time had had a fancy for Sylvia But the one brother was prosperous the other had gone on sinking in life like him who was now his master Neither Hobbs nor his man Simpson were absolutely bad men if things had gone well with them they might each have been as scrupulous and conscientious as their neighbours and even now supposing the gain in money to be equal they would sooner have done good than evil but a very small sum was enough to turn the balance And in a greater degree than in most cases was the famous maxim of Rochefoucault true with them for in the misfortunes of their friends they seemed to see some justification of their own It was blind fate dealing out events not that the events themselves were the inevitable consequences of folly or misconduct To such men as these the large sum offered by the lieutenant of the press gang for the accommodation of the Mariners Arms was simply and immediately irresistible The best room in the dilapidated house was put at the service of the commanding officer of the impress service and all other arrangements made at his desire irrespective of all the former unprofitable sources of custom and of business If the relatives both of Hobbs and of Simpson had not been so well known and so prosperous in the town they themselves would have received more marks of popular ill opinion than they did during the winter the events of which are now being recorded As it was people spoke to them when they appeared at kirk or at market but held no conversation with them no not although they each appeared better dressed than they had either of them done for years past and although their whole manner showed a change inasmuch as they had been formerly snarling and misanthropic and were now civil almost to deprecation Every one who was capable of understanding the state of feeling in Monkshaven at this time must have been aware that at any moment an explosion might take place and probably there were those who had judgment enough to be surprised that it did not take place sooner than it did For until February there were only occasional cries and growls of rage as the press gang made their captures first here then there often apparently tranquil for days then heard of at some distance along the coast then carrying off a seaman from the very heart of the town They seemed afraid of provoking any general hostility such as that which had driven them from Shields and would have conciliated the inhabitants if they could the officers on the service and on board the three men of war coming often into the town spending largely talking to all with cheery friendliness and making themselves very popular in such society as they could obtain access to at the houses of the neighbouring magistrates or at the rectory But this however agreeable did not forward the object the impress service had in view and accordingly a more decided step was taken at a time when although there was no apparent evidence as to the fact the town was full of the Greenland mariners coming quietly in to renew their yearly engagements which when done would legally entitle them to protection from impressment One night it was on a Saturday February twenty third when there was a bitter black frost with a north east wind sweeping through the streets and men and women were close shut in their houses all were startled in their household content and warmth by the sound of the fire bell busily swinging and pealing out for help The fire bell was kept in the market house where High Street and Bridge Street met every one knew what it meant Some dwelling or maybe a boiling house was on fire and neighbourly assistance was summoned with all speed in a town where no water was laid on nor fire engines kept in readiness Men snatched up their hats and rushed out wives following some with the readiest wraps they could lay hands on with which to clothe the over hasty husbands others from that mixture of dread and curiosity which draws people to the scene of any disaster Those of the market people who were making the best of their way homewards having waited in the town till the early darkness concealed their path turned back at the sound of the ever clanging fire bell ringing out faster and faster as if the danger became every instant more pressing As men ran against or alongside of each other their breathless question was ever Where is it and no one could tell so they pressed onwards into the market place sure of obtaining the information desired there where the fire bell kept calling out with its furious metal tongue The dull oil lamps in the adjoining streets only made darkness visible in the thronged market place where the buzz of many men s unanswered questions was rising louder and louder A strange feeling of dread crept over those nearest to the closed market house Above them in the air the bell was still clanging but before them was a door fast shut and locked no one to speak and tell them why they were summoned where they ought to be They were at the heart of the mystery and it was a silent blank Their unformed dread took shape at the cry from the outside of the crowd from where men were still coming down the eastern side of Bridge Street The gang the gang shrieked out some one The gang are upon us Help help Then the fire bell had been a decoy a sort of seething the kid in its mother s milk leading men into a snare through their kindliest feelings Some dull sense of this added to utter dismay and made them struggle and strain to get to all the outlets save that in which a fight was now going on the swish of heavy whips the thud of bludgeons the groans the growls of wounded or infuriated men coming with terrible distinctness through the darkness to the quickened ear of fear A breathless group rushed up the blackness of a narrow entry to stand still awhile and recover strength for fresh running For a time nothing but heavy pants and gasps were heard amongst them No one knew his neighbour and their good feeling so lately abused and preyed upon made them full of suspicion The first who spoke was recognized by his voice Is it thee Daniel Robson asked his neighbour in a low tone Ay Who else should it be A dunno If a am to be any one else I d like to be a chap of nobbut eight stun A m welly done for It were as bloody a shame as iver I heerd on Who s to go t t next fire a d like to know A tell yo what lads said Daniel recovering his breath but speaking in gasps We were a pack o cowards to let em carry off yon chaps as easy as they did a m reckoning A think so indeed said another voice Daniel went on We was two hunder if we was a man an t gang has niver numbered above twelve But they was armed A seen t glitter on their cutlasses spoke out a fresh voice What then replied he who had latest come and who stood at the mouth of the entry A had my whalin knife wi me i my pea jacket as my missus threw at me and a d ha ripped em up as soon as winkin if a could ha thought what was best to do wi that d d bell makin such a din reet above us A man can but die onest and we was ready to go int t fire for t save folks lives and yet we d none on us t wit to see as we might ha saved yon poor chaps as screeched out for help They ll ha getten em to t Randyvowse by now said some one They cannot tak em aboard till morning t tide won t serve said the last speaker but one Daniel Robson spoke out the thought that was surging up into the brain of every one there There s a chance for us a How many be we By dint of touching each other the numbers were counted Seven Seven But if us seven turns out and rouses t town there ll be many a score ready to gang t Mariners Arms and it ll be easy work reskyin them chaps as is pressed Us seven each man jack on us go and seek up his friends and get him as well as he can to t church steps then mebbe there ll be some theere as ll not be so soft as we was lettin them poor chaps be carried off from under our noses just becase our ears was busy listenin to yon confounded bell whose clip clappin tongue a ll tear out afore this week is out Before Daniel had finished speaking those nearest to the entrance muttered their assent to his project and had stolen off keeping to the darkest side of the streets and lanes which they threaded in different directions most of them going straight as sleuth hounds to the haunts of the wildest and most desperate portion of the seafaring population of Monkshaven For in the breasts of many revenge for the misery and alarm of the past winter took a deeper and more ferocious form than Daniel had thought of when he made his proposal of a rescue To him it was an adventure like many he had been engaged in in his younger days indeed the liquor he had drunk had given him a fictitious youth for the time and it was more in the light of a rough frolic of which he was to be the leader that he limped along always lame from old attacks of rheumatism chuckling to himself at the apparent stillness of the town which gave no warning to the press gang at the Rendezvous of anything in the wind Daniel too had his friends to summon old hands like himself but deep uns also like himself as he imagined It was nine o clock when all who were summoned met at the church steps and by nine o clock Monkshaven in those days was more quiet and asleep than many a town at present is at midnight The church and churchyard above them were flooded with silver light for the moon was high in the heavens the irregular steps were here and there in pure white clearness here and there in blackest shadow But more than half way up to the top men clustered like bees all pressing so as to be near enough to question those who stood nearest to the planning of the attack Here and there a woman with wild gestures and shrill voice that no entreaty would hush down to the whispered pitch of the men pushed her way through the crowd this one imploring immediate action that adjuring those around her to smite and spare not those who had carried off her man the father the breadwinner Low down in the darkened silent town were many whose hearts went with the angry and excited crowd and who would bless them and caress them for that night s deeds Daniel soon found himself a laggard in planning compared to some of those around him But when with the rushing sound of many steps and but few words they had arrived at the blank dark shut up Mariners Arms they paused in surprise at the uninhabited look of the whole house it was Daniel once more who took the lead Speak em fair said he try good words first Hobbs ll mebbe let em out quiet if we can catch a word wi him A say Hobbs said he raising his voice is a shut up for t neet for a d be glad of a glass A m Dannel Robson thou knows Not one word in reply any more than from the tomb but his speech had been heard nevertheless The crowd behind him began to jeer and to threaten there was no longer any keeping down their voices their rage their terrible oaths If doors and windows had not of late been strengthened with bars of iron in anticipation of some such occasion they would have been broken in with the onset of the fierce and now yelling crowd who rushed against them with the force of a battering ram to recoil in baffled rage from the vain assault No sign no sound from within in that breathless pause Come away round here a ve found a way to t back o behint where belike it s not so well fenced said Daniel who had made way for younger and more powerful men to conduct the assault and had employed his time meanwhile in examining the back premises The men rushed after him almost knocking him down as he made his way into the lane into which the doors of the outbuildings belonging to the inn opened Daniel had already broken the fastening of that which opened into a damp mouldy smelling shippen in one corner of which a poor lean cow shifted herself on her legs in an uneasy restless manner as her sleeping place was invaded by as many men as could cram themselves into the dark hold Daniel at the end farthest from the door was almost smothered before he could break down the rotten wooden shutter that when opened displayed the weedy yard of the old inn the full clear light defining the outline of each blade of grass by the delicate black shadow behind This hole used to give air and light to what had once been a stable in the days when horse travellers were in the habit of coming to the Mariners Arms was large enough to admit the passage of a man and Daniel in virtue of its discovery was the first to get through But he was larger and heavier than he had been his lameness made him less agile and the impatient crowd behind him gave him a helping push that sent him down on the round stones with which the yard was paved and for the time disabled him so much that he could only just crawl out of the way of leaping feet and heavy nailed boots which came through the opening till the yard was filled with men who now set up a fierce derisive shout which to their delight was answered from within No more silence no more dead opposition a living struggle a glowing raging fight and Daniel thought he should be obliged to sit there still leaning against the wall inactive while the strife and the action were going on in which he had once been foremost He saw the stones torn up he saw them used with good effect on the unguarded back door he cried out in useless warning as he saw the upper windows open and aim taken among the crowd but just then the door gave way and there was an involuntary forward motion in the throng so that no one was so disabled by the shots as to prevent his forcing his way in with the rest And now the sounds came veiled by the walls as of some raging ravening beast growling over his prey the noise came and went once utterly ceased and Daniel raised himself with difficulty to ascertain the cause when again the roar came clear and fresh and men poured into the yard again shouting and rejoicing over the rescued victims of the press gang Daniel hobbled up and shouted and rejoiced and shook hands with the rest hardly caring to understand that the lieutenant and his gang had quitted the house by a front window and that all had poured out in search of them the greater part however returning to liberate the prisoners and then glut their vengeance on the house and its contents From all the windows upper and lower furniture was now being thrown into the yard The smash of glass the heavier crash of wood the cries the laughter the oaths all excited Daniel to the utmost and forgetting his bruises he pressed forwards to lend a helping hand The wild rough success of his scheme almost turned his head He hurraed at every flagrant piece of destruction he shook hands with every one around him and at last when the destroyers inside paused to take breath he cried out If a was as young as onest a was a d have t Randyvowse down and mak a bonfire on it We d ring t fire bell then t some purpose No sooner said than done Their excitement was ready to take the slightest hint of mischief old chairs broken tables odd drawers smashed chests were rapidly and skilfully heaped into a pyramid and one who at the first broaching of the idea had gone for live coals the speedier to light up the fire came now through the crowd with a large shovelful of red hot cinders The rioters stopped to take breath and look on like children at the uncertain flickering blaze which sprang high one moment and dropped down the next only to creep along the base of the heap of wreck and make secure of its future work Then the lurid blaze darted up wild high and irrepressible and the men around gave a cry of fierce exultation and in rough mirth began to try and push each other in In one of the pauses of the rushing roaring noise of the flames the moaning low and groan of the poor alarmed cow fastened up in the shippen caught Daniel s ear and he understood her groans as well as if they had been words He limped out of the yard through the now deserted house where men were busy at the mad work of destruction and found his way back to the lane into which the shippen opened The cow was dancing about at the roar and dazzle and heat of the fire but Daniel knew how to soothe her and in a few minutes he had a rope round her neck and led her gently out from the scene of her alarm He was still in the lane when Simpson the man of all work at the Mariners Arms crept out of some hiding place in the deserted outbuilding and stood suddenly face to face with Robson The man was white with fear and rage Here tak thy beast and lead her wheere she ll noane hear yon cries and shouts She s fairly moithered wi heat an noise They re brennin ivery rag I have i t world gasped out Simpson I niver had much and now I m a beggar Well thou shouldn t ha turned again thine own town folks and harboured t gang Sarves thee reet A d noane be here leadin beasts if a were as young as a were a d be in t thick on it It was thee set m on a heerd thee a see d thee a helping on em t break in they d niver ha thought on attackin t house and settin fire to yon things if thou hadn t spoken on it Simpson was now fairly crying But Daniel did not realize what the loss of all the small property he had in the world was to the poor fellow rapscallion though he was broken down unprosperous ne er do weel in his pride at the good work he believed he had set on foot Ay said he it s a great thing for folk to have a chap for t lead em wi a head on his shouthers A misdoubt me if there were a felly theere as would ha thought o routling out yon wasps nest it tak s a deal o mother wit to be up to things But t gang ll niver harbour theere again one while A only wish we d cotched em An a should like t ha gi en Hobbs a bit o my mind He s had his sauce said Simpson dolefully Him and me is ruined Tut tut thou s got thy brother he s rich enough And Hobbs ll do a deal better he s had his lesson now and he ll stick to his own side time to come Here tak thy beast an look after her for my bones is achin An mak thysel scarce for some o them fellys has getten their blood up an wunnot be for treating thee o er well if they fall in wi thee Hobbs ought to be served out it were him as made t bargain wi lieutenant and he s off safe wi his wife and his money bag and a m left a beggar this neet i Monkshaven street My brother and me has had words and he ll do nought for me but curse me A had three crown pieces and a good pair o breeches and a shirt and a dare say better nor two pair o stockings A wish t gang and thee and Hobbs and them mad folk up yonder were a down i hell a do Coom lad said Daniel noways offended at his companion s wish on his behalf A m noane flush mysel but here s half a crown and tuppence it s a a ve getten wi me but it ll keep thee and t beast i food and shelter to neet and get thee a glass o comfort too A had thought o takin one mysel but a shannot ha a penny left so a ll just toddle whoam to my missus Daniel was not in the habit of feeling any emotion at actions not directly affecting himself or else he might have despised the poor wretch who immediately clutched at the money and overwhelmed that man with slobbery thanks whom he had not a minute before been cursing But all Simpson s stronger passions had been long ago used up now he only faintly liked and disliked where once he loved and hated his only vehement feeling was for himself that cared for other men might wither or flourish as best suited them Many of the doors which had been close shut when the crowd went down the High Street were partially open as Daniel slowly returned and light streamed from them on the otherwise dark road The news of the successful attempt at rescue had reached those who had sate in mourning and in desolation an hour or two ago and several of these pressed forwards as from their watching corner they recognized Daniel s approach they pressed forward into the street to shake him by the hand to thank him for his name had been bruited abroad as one of those who had planned the affair and at several places he was urged to have a dram urgency that he was loath for many reasons to refuse but his increasing uneasiness and pain made him for once abstinent and only anxious to get home and rest But he could not help being both touched and flattered at the way in which those who formed his world looked upon him as a hero and was not insensible to the words of blessing which a wife whose husband had been impressed and rescued this night poured down upon him as he passed Theere theere dunnot crack thy throat wi blessin Thy man would ha done as much for me though mebbe he mightn t ha shown so much gumption and capability but them s gifts and not to be proud on When Daniel reached the top of the hill on the road home he turned to look round but he was lame and bruised he had gone along slowly the fire had pretty nearly died out only a red hue in the air about the houses at the end of the long High Street and a hot lurid mist against the hill side beyond where the Mariners Arms had stood were still left as signs and token of the deed of violence Daniel looked and chuckled That comes o ringin t fire bell said he to himself it were shame for it to be tellin a lie poor oud story teller CHAPTER XXIV BRIEF REJOICING Daniel s unusually late absence from home disturbed Bell and Sylvia not a little He was generally at home between eight and nine on market days They expected to see him the worse for liquor at such times but this did not shock them he was no worse than most of his neighbours indeed better than several who went off once or twice a year or even oftener on drinking bouts of two or three days duration returning pale sodden and somewhat shame faced when all their money was gone and after the conjugal reception was well over settling down into hard working and decently sober men until the temptation again got power over them But on market days every man drank more than usual every bargain or agreement was ratified by drink they came from greater or less distances either afoot or on horseback and the good accommodation for man and beast as the old inn signs expressed it always included a considerable amount of liquor to be drunk by the man Daniel s way of announcing his intention of drinking more than ordinary was always the same He would say at the last moment Missus I ve a mind to get fuddled to neet and be off disregarding her look of remonstrance and little heeding the injunctions she would call after him to beware of such and such companions or to attend to his footsteps on his road home But this night he had given no such warning Bell and Sylvia put the candle on the low window seat at the usual hour to guide him through the fields it was a habit kept up even on moonlight nights like this and sate on each side of the fire at first scarcely caring to listen so secure were they of his return Bell dozed and Sylvia sate gazing at the fire with abstracted eyes thinking of the past year and of the anniversary which was approaching of the day when she had last seen the lover whom she believed to be dead lying somewhere fathoms deep beneath the surface of that sunny sea on which she looked day by day without ever seeing his upturned face through the depths with whatsoever heart sick longing for just one more sight she yearned and inwardly cried If she could set her eyes on his bright handsome face that face which was fading from her memory overtasked in the too frequent efforts to recall it if she could but see him once again coming over the waters beneath which he lay with supernatural motion awaiting her at the stile with the evening sun shining ruddy into his bonny eyes even though after that one instant of vivid and visible life he faded into mist if she could but see him now sitting in the faintly flickering fire light in the old happy careless way on a corner of the dresser his legs dangling his busy fingers playing with some of her woman s work she wrung her hands tight together as she implored some any Power to let her see him just once again just once for one minute of passionate delight Never again would she forget that dear face if but once more she might set her eyes upon it Her mother s head fell with a sudden jerk and she roused herself up and Sylvia put by her thought of the dead and her craving after his presence into that receptacle of her heart where all such are kept closed and sacred from the light of common day Feyther s late said Bell It s gone eight replied Sylvia But our clock is better nor an hour forrard answered Bell Ay but t wind brings Monkshaven bells clear to night I heerd t eight o clock bell ringing not five minutes ago It was the fire bell but she had not distinguished the sound There was another long silence both wide awake this time He ll have his rheumatics again said Bell It s cold for sartin said Sylvia March weather come afore its time But I ll make him a treacle posset it s a famous thing for keeping off hoasts The treacle posset was entertainment enough for both while it was being made But once placed in a little basin in the oven there was again time for wonder and anxiety He said nought about having a bout did he mother asked Sylvia at length No said Bell her face a little contracting After a while she added There s many a one as has husbands that goes off drinking without iver saying a word to their wives My master is none o that mak Mother broke in Sylvia again I ll just go and get t lantern out of t shippen and go up t brow and mebbe to t ash field end Do lass said her mother I ll get my wraps and go with thee Thou shall do niver such a thing said Sylvia Thou s too frail to go out i t night air such a night as this Then call Kester up Not I I m noane afraid o t dark But of what thou mayst meet i t dark lass Sylvia shivered all over at the sudden thought suggested by this speech of her mother s that the idea that had flashed into her own mind of going to look for her father might be an answer to the invocation to the Powers which she had made not long ago that she might indeed meet her dead lover at the ash field stile but though she shivered as this superstitious fancy came into her head her heart beat firm and regular not from darkness nor from the spirits of the dead was she going to shrink her great sorrow had taken away all her girlish nervous fear She went and she came back Neither man nor spirit had she seen the wind was blowing on the height enough to sweep all creatures before it but no one was coming So they sate down again to keep watch At length his step was heard close to the door and it startled them even in their state of expectation Why feyther cried Sylvia as he entered while his wife stood up trembling but not saying a word A m a most done up said he sitting heavily down on the chair nearest the door Poor old feyther said Sylvia stooping to take off his heavy clogged shoes while Bell took the posset out of the oven What s this posset what creatures women is for slops said he but he drank it all the same while Sylvia fastened the door and brought the flaring candle from the window seat The fresh arrangement of light displayed his face blackened with smoke and his clothes disarranged and torn Who s been melling wi thee asked Bell No one has melled wi me but a ve been mellin wi t gang at last Thee they niver were for pressing thee exclaimed both the women at once No they knowed better They n getten their belly full as it is Next time they try it on a reckon they ll ax if Daniel Robson is wi in hearin A ve led a resky this neet and saved nine or ten honest chaps as was pressed and carried off to t Randyvowse Me and some others did it And Hobbs things and t lieutenant s is a burnt and by this time a reckon t Randyvowse is pretty nigh four walls ready for a parish pound Thou rt niver for saying thou burnt it down wi t gang in it for sure asked Bell Na na not this time T gang fled up t hill like coneys and Hobbs and his folks carried off a bag o money but t oud tumbledown place is just a heap o brick and mortar an t furniture is smoulderin int ashes and best of a t men is free and will niver be cotched wi a fire bell again And so he went on to tell of the ruse by which they had been enticed into the market place interrupted from time to time by their eager questions and interrupting himself every now and then with exclamations of weariness and pain which made him at last say Now a m willing to tell yo a about it to morrow for it s not ivery day a man can do such great things but to neet a mun go to bed even if King George were wantin for to know how a managed it a He went wearily upstairs and wife and daughter both strove their best to ease his aching limbs and make him comfortable The warming pan only used on state occasions was taken down and unpapered for his service and as he got between the warm sheets he thanked Sylvia and her mother in a sleepy voice adding It s a vast o comfort to think on yon poor lads as is sleepin i their own homes this neet and then slumber fell upon him and he was hardly roused by Bell s softly kissing his weather beaten cheek and saying low God bless thee my man Thou was allays for them that was down and put upon He murmured some monosyllabic reply unheard by his wife who stole away to undress herself noiselessly and laid herself down on her side of the bed as gently as her stiffened limbs would permit They were late in rising the next morning Kester was long since up and at his work among the cattle before he saw the house door open to admit the fresh chill morning air and even then Sylvia brushed softly and went about almost on tip toe When the porridge was ready Kester was called in to his breakfast which he took sitting at the dresser with the family A large wooden platter stood in the middle and each had a bowl of the same material filled with milk The way was for every one to dip his pewter spoon into the central dish and convey as much or as little as he liked at a time of the hot porridge into his pure fresh milk But to day Bell told Kester to help himself all at once and to take his bowl up to the master s room and keep him company For Daniel was in bed resting from his weariness and bemoaning his painful bruises whenever he thought of them But his mind was still so much occupied with the affair of the previous night that Bell judged rightly that a new listener would give ease to his body as well as to his mind and her proposal of Kester s carrying up his breakfast had been received by Daniel with satisfaction So Kester went up slowly carrying his over full basin tenderly and seated himself on the step leading down into the bed room for levels had not been calculated when the old house was built facing his master who half sitting up in the blue check bed not unwillingly began his relation again to which Kester listened so attentively that his spoon was often arrested in its progress from the basin to his mouth open ready to receive it while he gazed with unwinking eyes at Daniel narrating his exploits But after Daniel had fought his battle o er again to every auditor within his reach he found the seclusion of his chamber rather oppressive without even the usual week days noises below so after dinner though far from well he came down and wandered about the stable and the fields nearest to the house consulting with Kester as to crops and manure for the most part but every now and then breaking out into an episodical chuckle over some part of last night s proceedings Kester enjoyed the day even more than his master for he had no bruises to remind him that although a hero he was also flesh and blood When they returned to the house they found Philip there for it was already dusk It was Kester s usual Sunday plan to withdraw to bed at as early an hour as he could manage to sleep often in winter before six but now he was too full of interest in what Philip might have to tell of Monkshaven news to forego his Sabbath privilege of spending the evening sitting on the chair at the end of the dresser behind the door Philip was as close to Sylvia as he could possibly get without giving her offence when they came in Her manner was listless and civil she had lost all that active feeling towards him which made him positively distasteful and had called out her girlish irritation and impertinence She now was rather glad to see him than otherwise He brought some change into the heavy monotony of her life monotony so peaceful until she had been stirred by passion out of that content with the small daily events which had now become burdensome recurrences Insensibly to herself she was becoming dependent on his timid devotion his constant attention and he lover like once so attracted in spite of his judgment by her liveliness and piquancy now doted on her languor and thought her silence more sweet than words He had only just arrived when master and man came in He had been to afternoon chapel none of them had thought of going to the distant church worship with them was only an occasional duty and this day their minds had been too full of the events of the night before Daniel sate himself heavily down in his accustomed chair the three cornered arm chair in the fireside corner which no one thought of anybody else ever occupying on any occasion whatever In a minute or two he interrupted Philip s words of greeting and inquiry by breaking out into the story of the rescue of last night But to the mute surprise of Sylvia the only one who noticed it Philip s face instead of expressing admiration and pleasant wonder lengthened into dismay once or twice he began to interrupt but stopped himself as if he would consider his words again Kester was never tired of hearing his master talk by long living together they understood every fold of each other s minds and small expressions had much significance to them Bell too sate thankful that her husband should have done such deeds Only Sylvia was made uneasy by Philip s face and manner When Daniel had ended there was a great silence instead of the questions and compliments he looked to receive He became testy and turning to Bell said My nephew looks as though he was a thinking more on t little profit he has made on his pins an bobs than as if he was heeding how honest men were saved from being haled out to yon tender an carried out o sight o wives and little uns for iver Wives an little uns may go t workhouse or clem for aught he cares Philip went very red and then more sallow than usual He had not been thinking of Charley Kinraid but of quite another thing while Daniel had told his story but this last speech of the old man s brought up the remembrance that was always quick do what he would to smother or strangle it He did not speak for a moment or two then he said To day has not been like Sabbath in Monkshaven T rioters as folks call em have been about all night They wanted to give battle to t men o war s men and it were taken up by th better end and they ve sent to my Lord Malton for t militia and they re come into t town and they re hunting for a justice for t read th act folk do say there ll be niver a shop opened to morrow This was rather a more serious account of the progress of the affair than any one had calculated upon They looked grave upon it awhile then Daniel took heart and said A think we d done a most enough last neet but men s not to be stopped wi a straw when their blood is up still it s hard lines to call out t sojers even if they be but militia So what we seven hatched in a dark entry has ta en a lord to put a stop to t continued he chuckling a little but more faintly this time Philip went on still graver than before boldly continuing to say what he knew would be discordant to the family he loved so well I should ha telled yo all about it I thought on it just as a bit o news I d niver thought on such a thing as uncle there having been in it and I m main sorry to hear on it I am Why said Sylvia breathlessly It s niver a thing to be sorry on I m proud and glad said Bell Let a be let a be said Daniel in much dudgeon A were a fool to tell him o such like doings they re noane i his line we ll talk on yard measures now Philip took no notice of this poor attempt at sarcasm he seemed as if lost in thought then he said I m vexed to plague yo but I d best say all I ve got i my mind There was a vast o folk at our chapel speaking about it last night s doings and this morning s work and how them as set it afoot was assured o being clapt int prison and tried for it and when I heered uncle say as he was one it like ran through me for they say as t justices will be all on t Government side and mad for vengeance For an instant there was dead silence The women looked at each other with blank eyes as if they were as yet unable to take in the new idea that the conduct which had seemed to them a subject for such just pride could be regarded by any one as deserving of punishment or retribution Daniel spoke before they had recovered from their amazement A m noane sorry for what a did an a d do it again to neet if need were So theere s for thee Thou may tell t justices fra me that a reckon a did righter nor them as letten poor fellys be carried off i t very midst o t town they re called justices for Perhaps Philip had better have held his tongue but he believed in the danger which he was anxious to impress upon his uncle in order that knowing what was to be apprehended the latter might take some pains to avert it He went on But they re making a coil about the Randyvowse being all destroyed Daniel had taken down his pipe from the shelf in the chimney corner and was stuffing tobacco into the bowl He went on pretending to do this a little while after it was filled for to tell the truth he was beginning to feel uncomfortable at the new view of his conduct presented to him Still he was not going to let this appear so lifting up his head with an indifferent air he lighted the pipe blew into it took it out and examined it as something were wrong about it and until that was put to rights he was unable to attend to anything else all the while the faithful three who hung upon his well being gazing breathless at his proceedings and anxious for his reply Randyvowse said he at length it were a good job it were brenned down for such a harbour for vermin a never seed t rats ran across t yard by hunders an thousands an it were no man s property as a ve heerd tell but belonged to Chancery up i Lunnon so wheere s t harm done my fine felly Philip was silent He did not care to brave any further his uncle s angry frown and contracted eye If he had only known of Daniel Robson s part in the riot before he had left the town he would have taken care to have had better authority for the reality of the danger which he had heard spoken about and in which he could not help believing As it was he could only keep quiet until he had ascertained what was the legal peril overhanging the rioters and how far his uncle had been recognized Daniel went on puffing angrily Kester sighed audibly and then was sorry he had done so and began to whistle Bell full of her new fear yet desirous to bring all present into some kind of harmony said It ll ha been a loss to John Hobbs all his things burnt or trampled on Mebbe he desarved it all but one s a kind o tender feeling to one s tables and chairs special if one s had t bees waxing on em A wish he d been burnt on t top on em a do growled out Daniel shaking the ash out of his pipe Don t speak so ill o thysel said his wife Thou d ha been t first t pluck him down if he d screeched out An a ll warrant if they come about wi a paper asking for feyther s name to make up for what Hobbs has lost by t fire feyther ll be for giving him summut said Sylvia Thou knows nought about it said Daniel Hold thy tongue next time till thou s axed to speak my wench His sharp irritated way of speaking was so new to Sylvia that the tears sprang to her eyes and her lip quivered Philip saw it all and yearned over her He plunged headlong into some other subject to try and divert attention from her but Daniel was too ill at ease to talk much and Bell was obliged to try and keep up the semblance of conversation with an occasional word or two from Kester who seemed instinctively to fall into her way of thinking and to endeavour to keep the dark thought in the background Sylvia stole off to bed more concerned at her father s angry way of speaking than at the idea of his being amenable to law for what he had done the one was a sharp present evil the other something distant and unlikely Yet a dim terror of this latter evil hung over her and once upstairs she threw herself on her bed and sobbed Philip heard her where he sate near the bottom of the short steep staircase and at every sob the cords of love round his heart seemed tightened and he felt as if he must there and then do something to console her But instead he sat on talking of nothings a conversation in which Daniel joined with somewhat of surliness while Bell grave and anxious kept wistfully looking from one to the other desirous of gleaning some further information on the subject which had begun to trouble her mind She hoped some chance would give her the opportunity of privately questioning Philip but it seemed to be equally her husband s wish to thwart any such intention of hers He remained in the house place till after Philip had left although he was evidently so much fatigued as to give some very distinct though unintentional hints to his visitor to be gone At length the house door was locked on Philip and then Daniel prepared to go to bed Kester had left for his loft above the shippen more than an hour before Bell had still to rake the fire and then she would follow her husband upstairs As she was scraping up the ashes she heard intermixed with the noise she was making the sound of some one rapping gently at the window In her then frame of mind she started a little but on looking round she saw Kester s face pressed against the glass and reassured she softly opened the door There he stood in the dusk outer air distinct against the gray darkness beyond and in his hand something which she presently perceived was a pitchfork Missus whispered he a ve watched t maister t bed an now a d be greatly beholden to yo if yo d let me just lay me down i t house place A d warrant niver a constable i a Monkshaven should get sight o t maister an me below t keep ward Bell shivered a little Nay Kester she said patting her hand kindly on his shoulder there s nought for t fear Thy master is not one for t hurt nobody and I dunnot think they can harm him for setting yon poor chaps free as t gang catched i their wicked trap Kester stood still then he shook his head slowly It s t work at t Randyvowse as a m afeared on Some folks thinks such a deal o a bonfire Then a may lay me down afore t fire missus said he beseechingly Nay Kester she began but suddenly changing she said God bless thee my man come in and lay thee down on t settle and I ll cover thee up wi my cloak as hangs behind t door We re not many on us that love him an we ll be all on us under one roof an niver a stone wall or a lock betwixt us So Kester took up his rest in the house place that night and none knew of it besides Bell CHAPTER XXV COMING TROUBLES The morning brought more peace if it did not entirely dissipate fear Daniel seemed to have got over his irritability and was unusually kind and tender to wife and daughter especially striving by silent little deeds to make up for the sharp words he had said the night before to the latter As if by common consent all allusion to the Saturday night s proceedings was avoided They spoke of the day s work before them of the crops to be sown of the cattle of the markets but each one was conscious of a wish to know more distinctly what were the chances of the danger that to judge from Philip s words hung over them falling upon them and cutting them off from all these places for the coming days Bell longed to send Kester down into Monkshaven as a sort of spy to see how the land lay but she dared not manifest her anxiety to her husband and could not see Kester alone She wished that she had told him to go to the town when she had had him to herself in the house place the night before now it seemed as though Daniel were resolved not to part from him and as though both had forgotten that any peril had been anticipated Sylvia and her mother in like manner clung together not speaking of their fears yet each knowing that it was ever present in the other s mind So things went on till twelve o clock dinner time If at any time that morning they had had the courage to speak together on the thought which was engrossing all their minds it is possible that some means might have been found to avert the calamity that was coming towards them with swift feet But among the uneducated the partially educated nay even the weakly educated the feeling exists which prompted the futile experiment of the well known ostrich They imagine that by closing their own eyes to apprehended evil they avert it The expression of fear is supposed to accelerate the coming of its cause Yet on the other hand they shrink from acknowledging the long continuance of any blessing in the idea that when unusual happiness is spoken about it disappears So although perpetual complaints of past or present grievances and sorrows are most common among this class they shrink from embodying apprehensions for the future in words as if it then took shape and drew near They all four sate down to dinner but not one of them was inclined to eat The food was scarcely touched on their plates yet they were trying to make talk among themselves as usual they seemed as though they dared not let themselves be silent when Sylvia sitting opposite to the window saw Philip at the top of the brow running rapidly towards the farm She had been so full of the anticipation of some kind of misfortune all the morning that she felt now as if this was the very precursive circumstance she had been expecting she stood up turning quite white and pointing with her finger said There he is Every one at table stood up too An instant afterwards Philip breathless was in the room He gasped out They re coming the warrant is out You must go I hoped you were gone God help us said Bell and sate suddenly down as if she had received a blow that made her collapse into helplessness but she got up again directly Sylvia flew for her father s hat He really seemed the most unmoved of the party A m noane afeared said he A d do it o er again a would an a ll tell em so It s a fine time o day when men s to be trapped and carried off an them as lays traps to set em free is to be put i t lock ups for it But there was rioting beside the rescue t house was burnt continued eager breathless Philip An a m noane goin t say a m sorry for that neyther tho mebbe a wouldn t do it again Sylvia had his hat on his head by this time and Bell wan and stiff trembling all over had his over coat and his leather purse with the few coins she could muster ready for him to put on He looked at these preparations at his wife and daughter and his colour changed from its ruddy brown A d face lock ups an a fair spell o jail but for these said he hesitating Oh said Philip for God s sake lose no time but be off Where mun he go asked Bell as if Philip must decide all Anywhere anywhere out of this house say Haverstone This evening I ll go and meet him there and plan further only be off now Philip was so keenly eager he hardly took note at the time of Sylvia s one vivid look of unspoken thanks yet he remembered it afterwards A ll dang em dead said Kester rushing to the door for he saw what the others did not that all chance of escape was over the constables were already at the top of the little field path not twenty yards off Hide him hide him cried Bell wringing her hands in terror for she indeed they all knew that flight would now be impossible Daniel was heavy rheumatic and moreover had been pretty severely bruised on that unlucky night Philip without another word pushed Daniel before him upstairs feeling that his own presence at Haytersbank Farm at that hour of the day would be a betrayal They had just time to shut themselves up in the larger bed room before they heard a scuffle and the constables entry down stairs They re in said Philip as Daniel squeezed himself under the bed and then they held quite still Philip as much concealed by the scanty blue check curtain as he could manage to be They heard a confusion of voices below a hasty moving of chairs a banging of doors a further parley and then a woman s scream shrill and pitiful then steps on the stairs That screech spoiled all sighed Philip In one instant the door was opened and each of the hiders was conscious of the presence of the constables although at first the latter stood motionless surveying the apparently empty room with disappointment Then in another moment they had rushed at Philip s legs exposed as these were They drew him out with violence and then let him go Measter Hepburn said one in amaze But immediately they put two and two together for in so small a place as Monkshaven every one s relationships and connexions and even likings were known and the motive of Philip s coming out to Haytersbank was perfectly clear to these men T other ll not be far off said the other constable His plate were down stairs full o victual a seed Measter Hepburn a walking briskly before me as a left Monkshaven Here he be here he be called out the other man dragging Daniel out by his legs we ve getten him Daniel kicked violently and came out from his hiding place in a less ignominious way than by being pulled out by his heels He shook himself and then turned facing his captors A wish a d niver hidden mysel it were his doing jerking his thumb toward Philip a m ready to stand by what a ve done Yo ve getten a warrant a ll be bound for them justices is grand at writin when t fight s over He was trying to carry it off with bravado but Philip saw that he had received a shock from his sudden look of withered colour and shrunken feature Don t handcuff him said Philip putting money into the constable s hand You ll be able to guard him well enough without them things Daniel turned round sharp at this whisper Let a be let a be my lad he said It ll be summut to think on i t lock up how two able bodied fellys were so afeared on t chap as reskyed them honest sailors o Saturday neet as they mun put him i gyves and he sixty two come Martinmas and sore laid up wi t rheumatics But it was difficult to keep up this tone of bravado when he was led a prisoner through his own house place and saw his poor wife quivering and shaking all over with her efforts to keep back all signs of emotion until he was gone and Sylvia standing by her mother her arm round Bell s waist and stroking the poor shrunken fingers which worked so perpetually and nervously in futile unconscious restlessness Kester was in a corner of the room sullenly standing Bell quaked from head to foot as her husband came down stairs a prisoner She opened her lips several times with an uneasy motion as if she would fain say something but knew not what Sylvia s passionate swollen lips and her beautiful defiant eyes gave her face quite a new aspect she looked a helpless fury A may kiss my missus a reckon said Daniel coming to a standstill as he passed near her Oh Dannel Dannel cried she opening her arms wide to receive him Dannel Dannel my man and she shook with her crying laying her head on his shoulder as if he was all her stay and comfort Come missus come missus said he there couldn t be more ado if a d been guilty of murder an yet a say again as a said afore a m noane ashamed o my doings Here Sylvie lass tak thy mother off me for a cannot do it mysel it like sets me off His voice was quavering as he said this But he cheered up a little and said Now good by oud wench kissing her and keep a good heart and let me see thee lookin lusty and strong when a come back Good by my lass look well after mother and ask Philip for guidance if it s needed He was taken out of his home and then arose the shrill cries of the women but in a minute or two they were checked by the return of one of the constables who cap in hand at the sight of so much grief said He wants a word wi his daughter The party had come to a halt about ten yards from the house Sylvia hastily wiping her tears on her apron ran out and threw her arms round her father as if to burst out afresh on his neck Nay nay my wench it s thee as mun be a comfort to mother nay nay or thou ll niver hear what a ve got to say Sylvie my lass a m main and sorry a were so short wi thee last neet a ax thy pardon lass a were cross to thee and sent thee to thy bed wi a sore heart Thou munnot think on it again but forgie me now a m leavin thee Oh feyther feyther was all Sylvia could say and at last they had to make as though they would have used force to separate her from their prisoner Philip took her hand and softly led her back to her weeping mother For some time nothing was to be heard in the little farmhouse kitchen but the sobbing and wailing of the women Philip stood by silent thinking as well as he could for his keen sympathy with their grief what had best be done next Kester after some growls at Sylvia for having held back the uplifted arm which he thought might have saved Daniel by a well considered blow on his captors as they entered the house went back into his shippen his cell for meditation and consolation where he might hope to soothe himself before going out to his afternoon s work labour which his master had planned for him that very morning with a strange foresight as Kester thought for the job was one which would take him two or three days without needing any further directions than those he had received and by the end of that time he thought that his master would be at liberty again So he so they all thought in their ignorance and inexperience Although Daniel himself was unreasoning hasty impulsive in a word often thinking and acting very foolishly yet somehow either from some quality in his character or from the loyalty of nature in those with whom he had to deal in his every day life he had made his place and position clear as the arbiter and law giver of his household On his decision as that of husband father master perhaps superior natures waited So now that he was gone and had left them in such strange new circumstances so suddenly it seemed as though neither Bell nor Sylvia knew exactly what to do when their grief was spent so much had every household action and plan been regulated by the thought of him Meanwhile Philip had slowly been arriving at the conclusion that he was more wanted at Monkshaven to look after Daniel s interests to learn what were the legal probabilities in consequence of the old man s arrest and to arrange for his family accordingly than standing still and silent in the Haytersbank kitchen too full of fellow feeling and heavy foreboding to comfort awkwardly unsympathetic in appearance from the very aching of his heart So when his aunt with instinctive sense of regularity and propriety began to put away the scarcely tasted dinner and Sylvia blinded with crying and convulsively sobbing was yet trying to help her mother Philip took his hat and brushing it round and round with the sleeve of his coat said I think I ll just go back and see how matters stand He had a more distinct plan in his head than these words implied but it depended on so many contingencies of which he was ignorant that he said only these few words and with a silent resolution to see them again that day but a dread of being compelled to express his fears so far beyond theirs he went off without saying anything more Then Sylvia lifted up her voice with a great cry Somehow she had expected him to do something what she did not know but he was gone and they were left without stay or help Hush thee hush thee said her mother trembling all over herself it s for the best The Lord knows But I niver thought he d leave us moaned Sylvia half in her mother s arms and thinking of Philip Her mother took the words as applied to Daniel And he d niver ha left us my wench if he could ha stayed Oh mother mother it s Philip as has left us and he could ha stayed He ll come back or mebbe send I ll be bound Leastways he ll be gone to see feyther and he ll need comfort most on all in a fremd place in Bridewell and niver a morsel of victual or a piece o money And now she sate down and wept the dry hot tears that come with such difficulty to the eyes of the aged And so first one grieving and then the other and each draining her own heart of every possible hope by way of comfort alternately trying to cheer and console the February afternoon passed away the continuous rain closing in the daylight even earlier than usual and adding to the dreariness with the natural accompaniments of wailing winds coming with long sweeps over the moors and making the sobbings at the windows that always sound like the gasps of some one in great agony Meanwhile Philip had hastened back to Monkshaven He had no umbrella he had to face the driving rain for the greater part of the way but he was thankful to the weather for it kept men indoors and he wanted to meet no one but to have time to think and mature his plans The town itself was so to speak in mourning The rescue of the sailors was a distinctly popular movement the subsequent violence which had indeed gone much further than has been described after Daniel left it was in general considered as only a kind of due punishment inflicted in wild justice on the press gang and their abettors The feeling of the Monkshaven people was therefore in decided opposition to the vigorous steps taken by the county magistrates who in consequence of an appeal from the naval officers in charge of the impressment service had called out the militia from a distant and inland county stationed within a few miles and had thus summarily quenched the riots that were continuing on the Sunday morning after a somewhat languid fashion the greater part of the destruction of property having been accomplished during the previous night Still there was little doubt but that the violence would have been renewed as evening drew on and the more desperate part of the population and the enraged sailors had had the Sabbath leisure to brood over their wrongs and to encourage each other in a passionate attempt at redress or revenge So the authorities were quite justified in the decided steps they had taken both in their own estimation then and now in ours looking back on the affair in cold blood But at the time feeling ran strongly against them and all means of expressing itself in action being prevented men brooded sullenly in their own houses Philip as the representative of the family the head of which was now suffering for his deeds in the popular cause would have met with more sympathy ay and more respect than he imagined as he went along the streets glancing from side to side fearful of meeting some who would shy him as the relation of one who had been ignominiously taken to Bridewell a few hours before But in spite of this wincing of Philip s from observation and remark he never dreamed of acting otherwise than as became a brave true friend And this he did and would have done from a natural faithfulness and constancy of disposition without any special regard for Sylvia He knew his services were needed in the shop business which he had left at a moment s warning awaited him unfinished but at this time he could not bear the torture of giving explanations and alleging reasons to the languid intelligence and slow sympathies of Coulson He went to the offices of mister Donkin the oldest established and most respected attorney in Monkshaven he who had been employed to draw up the law papers and deeds of partnership consequent on Hepburn and Coulson succeeding to the shop of John and Jeremiah Foster Brothers mister Donkin knew Philip from this circumstance But indeed nearly every one in Monkshaven knew each other if not enough to speak to at least enough to be acquainted with the personal appearance and reputation of most of those whom they met in the streets It so happened that mister Donkin had a favourable opinion of Philip and perhaps for this reason the latter had a shorter time to wait before he obtained an interview with the head of the house than many of the clients who came for that purpose from town or country for many miles round Philip was ushered in mister Donkin sate with his spectacles pushed up on his forehead ready to watch his countenance and listen to his words Good afternoon mister Hepburn Good afternoon sir Philip hesitated how to begin mister Donkin became impatient and tapped with the fingers of his left hand on his desk Philip s sensitive nerves felt and rightly interpreted the action Please sir I m come to speak to you about Daniel Robson of Haytersbank Farm Daniel Robson said mister Donkin after a short pause to try and compel Philip into speed in his story Yes sir He s been taken up on account of this affair sir about the press gang on Saturday night To be sure I thought I knew the name And mister Donkin s face became graver and the expression more concentrated Looking up suddenly at Philip he said You are aware that I am the clerk to the magistrates No sir in a tone that indicated the unexpressed What then Well but I am And so of course if you want my services or advice in favour of a prisoner whom they have committed or are going to commit you can t have them that s all I am very sorry very said Philip and then he was again silent for a period long enough to make the busy attorney impatient Well mister Hepburn have you anything else to say to me Yes sir I ve a deal to ask of you for you see I don t rightly understand what to do and yet I m all as Daniel s wife and daughter has to look to and I ve their grief heavy on my heart You could not tell me what is to be done with Daniel could you sir He ll be brought up before the magistrates to morrow morning for final examination along with the others you know before he s sent to York Castle to take his trial at the spring assizes To York Castle sir mister Donkin nodded as if words were too precious to waste And when will he go asked poor Philip in dismay To morrow most probably as soon as the examination is over The evidence is clear as to his being present aiding and abetting indicted on the fourth section of one George I statute one chapter five I m afraid it s a bad look out Is he a friend of yours mister Hepburn Only an uncle sir said Philip his heart getting full more from mister Donkin s manner than from his words But what can they do to him sir Do mister Donkin half smiled at the ignorance displayed Why hang him to be sure if the judge is in a hanging mood He s been either a principal in the offence or a principal in the second degree and as such liable to the full punishment I drew up the warrant myself this morning though I left the exact name to be filled up by my clerk Oh sir can you do nothing for me asked Philip with sharp beseeching in his voice He had never imagined that it was a capital offence and the thought of his aunt s and Sylvia s ignorance of the possible fate awaiting him whom they so much loved was like a stab to his heart No my good fellow I m sorry but you see it s my duty to do all I can to bring criminals to justice My uncle thought he was doing such a fine deed Demolishing and pulling down destroying and burning dwelling houses and outhouses said mister Donkin He must have some peculiar notions The people is so mad with the press gang and Daniel has been at sea hisself and took it so to heart when he heard of mariners and seafaring folk being carried off and just cheated into doing what was kind and helpful leastways what would have been kind and helpful if there had been a fire I m against violence and riots myself sir I m sure but I cannot help thinking as Daniel had a deal to justify him on Saturday night sir Well you must try and get a good lawyer to bring out all that side of the question There s a good deal to be said on it but it s my duty to get up all the evidence to prove that he and others were present on the night in question so as you ll perceive I can give you no help in defending him But who can sir I came to you as a friend who I thought would see me through it And I don t know any other lawyer leastways to speak to mister Donkin was really more concerned for the misguided rioters than he was aware and he was aware of more interest than he cared to express So he softened his tone a little and tried to give the best advice in his power You d better go to Edward Dawson on the other side of the river he that was articled clerk with me two years ago you know He s a clever fellow and has not too much practice he ll do the best he can for you He ll have to be at the court house tell him to morrow morning at ten when the justices meet He ll watch the case for you and then he ll give you his opinion and tell you what to do You can t do better than follow his advice I must do all I can to collect evidence for a conviction you know Philip stood up looked at his hat and then came forward and laid down six and eightpence on the desk in a blushing awkward way Pooh pooh said mister Donkin pushing the money away Don t be a fool you ll need it all before the trial s over I ve done nothing man It would be a pretty thing for me to be feed by both parties Philip took up the money and left the room In an instant he came back again glanced furtively at mister Donkin s face and then once more having recourse to brushing his hat he said in a low voice You ll not be hard upon him sir I hope I must do my duty replied mister Donkin a little sternly without any question of hardness Philip discomfited left the room an instant of thought and mister Donkin had jumped up and hastening to the door he opened it and called after Philip Hepburn Hepburn I say he ll be taken to York as soon as may be to morrow morning if any one wants to see him before then they d better look sharp about it Philip went quickly along the streets towards mister Dawson s pondering upon the meaning of all that he had heard and what he had better do He had made his plans pretty clearly out by the time he arrived at mister Dawson s smart door in one of the new streets on the other side of the river A clerk as smart as the door answered Philip s hesitating knock and replied to his inquiry as to whether mister Dawson was at home in the negative adding after a moment s pause He ll be at home in less than an hour he s only gone to make missus Dawson s will missus Dawson of Collyton she s not expected to get better Probably the clerk of an older established attorney would not have given so many particulars as to the nature of his master s employment but as it happened it was of no consequence the unnecessary information made no impression on Philip s mind he thought the matter over and then said I ll be back in an hour then It s gone a quarter to four I ll be back before five tell mister Dawson He turned on his heel and went back to the High Street as fast as he could with a far more prompt and decided step than before He hastened through the streets emptied by the bad weather to the principal inn of the town the George the sign of which was fastened to a piece of wood stretched across the narrow street and going up to the bar with some timidity for the inn was frequented by the gentry of Monkshaven and the neighbourhood and was considered as a touch above such customers as Philip he asked if he could have a tax cart made ready in a quarter of an hour and sent up to the door of his shop To be sure he could how far was it to go Philip hesitated before he replied Up the Knotting Lane to the stile leading down to Haytersbank Farm they ll have to wait there for some as are coming They must not wait long such an evening as this standing in such rain and wind as there ll be up there is enough to kill a horse They shan t wait long said Philip decisively in a quarter of an hour mind He now went back to the shop beating against the storm which was increasing as the tide came in and the night hours approached Coulson had no word for him but he looked reproachfully at his partner for his long unexplained absence Hester was putting away the ribbons and handkerchiefs and bright coloured things which had been used to deck the window for no more customers were likely to come this night through the blustering weather to a shop dimly lighted by two tallow candles and an inefficient oil lamp Philip came up to her and stood looking at her with unseeing eyes but the strange consciousness of his fixed stare made her uncomfortable and called the faint flush to her pale cheeks and at length compelled her as it were to speak and break the spell of the silence So curiously enough all three spoke at once Hester asked without looking at Philip Yo re sadly wet I m feared Coulson said Thou might have a bit o news to tell one after being on the gad all afternoon Philip whispered to Hester Wilt come into t parlour I want a word wi thee by oursel s Hester quietly finished rolling up the ribbon she had in her hands when he spoke and then followed him into the room behind the shop before spoken of Philip set down on the table the candle which he had brought out of the shop and turning round to Hester took her trembling hand into both of his and gripping it nervously said Oh Hester thou must help me thou will will not thou Hester gulped down something that seemed to rise in her throat and choke her before she answered Anything thou knows Philip Yes yes I know Thou sees the matter is this Daniel Robson he who married my aunt is taken up for yon riot on Saturday night at t Mariners Arms They spoke on it this afternoon they said the warrant was out said Hester filling up the sentence as Philip hesitated lost for an instant in his own thoughts Ay the warrant is out and he s in t lock up and will be carried to York Castle to morrow morn and I m afeared it will go bad with him and they at Haytersbank is not prepared and they must see him again before he goes Now Hester will thou go in a tax cart as will be here in less than ten minutes from t George and bring them back here and they must stay all night for to be ready to see him to morrow before he goes It s dree weather for them but they ll not mind that He had used words as if he was making a request to Hester but he did not seem to await her answer so sure was he that she would go She noticed this and noticed also that the rain was spoken of in reference to them not to her A cold shadow passed over her heart though it was nothing more than she already knew that Sylvia was the one centre of his thoughts and his love I ll go put on my things at once said she gently Philip pressed her hand tenderly a glow of gratitude overspread him Thou s a real good one God bless thee said he Thou must take care of thyself too continued he there s wraps and plenty i th house and if there are not there s those i the shop as ll be none the worse for once wearing at such a time as this and wrap thee well up and take shawls and cloaks for them and mind as they put em on Thou ll have to get out at a stile I ll tell t driver where and thou must get over t stile and follow t path down two fields and th house is right before ye and bid em make haste and lock up th house for they mun stay all night here Kester ll look after things All this time Hester was hastily putting on her hat and cloak which she had fetched from the closet where they usually hung through the day now she stood listening as it were for final directions But suppose they will not come said she they dunnot know me and mayn t believe my words They must said he impatiently They don t know what awaits em he continued I ll tell thee because thou ll not let out and it seems as if I mun tell some one it were such a shock he s to be tried for s life They know not it s so serious and Hester said he going on in his search after sympathy she s like as if she was bound up in her father His lips quivered as he looked wistfully into Hester s face at these words No need to tell her who was she No need to put into words the fact told plainer than words could have spoken it that his heart was bound up in Sylvia Hester s face instead of responding to his look contracted a little and for the life of her she could not have helped saying Why don t yo go yourself Philip I can t I can t said he impatiently I d give the world to go for I might be able to comfort her but there s lawyers to see and iver so much to do and they ve niver a man friend but me to do it all You ll tell her said Philip insinuatingly as if a fresh thought had struck him as how I would ha come I would fain ha come for em myself but I couldn t because of th lawyer mind yo say because of th lawyer I d be loath for her to think I was minding any business of my own at this time and whatever yo do speak hopeful and for t life of yo don t speak of th hanging it s likely it s a mistake o Donkin s and anyhow there s t cart anyhow I should perhaps not ha telled thee but it s a comfort to make a clean breast to a friend at times God bless thee Hester I don t know what I should ha done without thee said he as he wrapped her well up in the cart and placed the bundles of cloaks and things by her side Along the street in the jolting cart as long as Hester could see the misty light streaming out of the shop door so long was Philip standing bareheaded in the rain looking after her But she knew that it was not her own poor self that attracted his lingering gaze It was the thought of the person she was bound to CHAPTER XXVI A DREARY VIGIL Through the dark rain against the cold wind shaken over the rough stones went Hester in the little tax cart Her heart kept rising against her fate the hot tears came unbidden to her eyes But rebellious heart was soothed and hot tears were sent back to their source before the time came for her alighting The driver turned his horse in the narrow lane and shouted after her an injunction to make haste as with her head bent low she struggled down to the path to Haytersbank Farm She saw the light in the window from the top of the brow and involuntarily she slackened her pace She had never seen Bell Robson and would Sylvia recollect her If she did not how awkward it would be to give the explanation of who she was and what her errand was and why she was sent Nevertheless it must be done so on she went and standing within the little porch she knocked faintly at the door but in the bluster of the elements the sound was lost Again she knocked and now the murmur of women s voices inside was hushed and some one came quickly to the door and opened it sharply It was Sylvia Although her face was completely in shadow of course Hester knew her well but she if indeed she would have recognized Hester less disguised did not know in the least who the woman muffled up in a great cloak with her hat tied down with a silk handkerchief standing in the porch at this time of night could be Nor indeed was she in a mood to care or to inquire She said hastily in a voice rendered hoarse and arid with grief Go away This is no house for strangers to come to We ve enough on our own to think on and she hastily shut the door in Hester s face before the latter could put together the right words in which to explain her errand Hester stood outside in the dark wet porch discomfited and wondering how next to obtain a hearing through the shut and bolted door Not long did she stand however some one was again at the door talking in a voice of distress and remonstrance and slowly unbarring the bolts A tall thin figure of an elderly woman was seen against the warm fire light inside as soon as the door was opened a hand was put out like that which took the dove into the ark and Hester was drawn into the warmth and the light while Bell s voice went on speaking to Sylvia before addressing the dripping stranger It s not a night to turn a dog fra t door it s ill letting our grief harden our hearts But oh missus to Hester yo mun forgive us for a great sorrow has fallen upon us this day an we re like beside ourselves wi crying an plaining Bell sate down and threw her apron over her poor worn face as if decently to shield the signs of her misery from a stranger s gaze Sylvia all tear swollen and looking askance and almost fiercely at the stranger who had made good her intrusion was drawn as it were to her mother s side and kneeling down by her put her arms round her waist and almost lay across her lap still gazing at Hester with cold distrustful eyes the expression of which repelled and daunted that poor unwilling messenger and made her silent for a minute or so after her entrance Bell suddenly put down her apron Yo re cold and drenched said she Come near to t fire and warm yo rsel yo mun pardon us if we dunnot think on everything at onest Yo re very kind very kind indeed said Hester touched by the poor woman s evident effort to forget her own grief in the duties of hospitality and loving Bell from that moment I m Hester Rose she continued half addressing Sylvia who she thought might remember the name and Philip Hepburn has sent me in a tax cart to t stile yonder to fetch both on yo back to Monkshaven Sylvia raised her head and looked intently at Hester Bell clasped her hands tight together and leant forwards It s my master as wants us said she in an eager questioning tone It s for to see yo r master said Hester Philip says he ll be sent to York to morrow and yo ll be fain to see him before he goes and if yo ll come down to Monkshaven to night yo ll be on t spot again the time comes when t justices will let ye Bell was up and about making for the place where she kept her out going things almost before Hester had begun to speak She hardly understood about her husband s being sent to York in the possession of the idea that she might go and see him She did not understand or care how in this wild night she was to get to Monkshaven all she thought of was that she might go and see her husband But Sylvia took in more points than her mother and almost suspiciously began to question Hester Why are they sending him to York What made Philip leave us Why didn t he come hissel He couldn t come hissel he bade me say because he was bound to be at the lawyer s at five about yo r father s business I think yo might ha known he would ha come for any business of his own and about York it s Philip as telled me and I never asked why I never thought on yo r asking me so many questions I thought yo d be ready to fly on any chance o seeing your father Hester spoke out the sad reproach that ran from her heart to her lips To distrust Philip to linger when she might hasten Oh said Sylvia breaking out into a wild cry that carried with it more conviction of agony than much weeping could have done I may be rude and hard and I may ask strange questions as if I cared for t answers yo may gi me an in my heart o hearts I care for nought but to have father back wi us as love him so dear I can hardly tell what I say much less why I say it Mother is so patient it puts me past mysel for I could fight wi t very walls I m so mad wi grieving Sure they ll let him come back wi us to morrow when they hear from his own sel why he did it She looked eagerly at Hester for an answer to this last question which she had put in a soft entreating tone as if with Hester herself the decision rested Hester shook her head Sylvia came up to her and took her hands almost fondling them Yo dunnot think they ll be hard wi him when they hear all about it done yo Why York Castle s t place they send a t thieves and robbers to not honest men like feyther Hester put her hand on Sylvia s shoulder with a soft caressing gesture Philip will know she said using Philip s name as a kind of spell it would have been so to her Come away to Philip said she again urging Sylvia by her looks and manner to prepare for the little journey Sylvia moved away for this purpose saying to herself It s going to see feyther he will tell me all Poor missus Robson was collecting a few clothes for her husband with an eager trembling hand so trembling that article after article fell to the floor and it was Hester who picked them up and at last after many vain attempts by the grief shaken woman it was Hester who tied the bundle and arranged the cloak and fastened down the hood Sylvia standing by not unobservant though apparently absorbed in her own thoughts At length all was arranged and the key given over to Kester As they passed out into the storm Sylvia said to Hester Thou s a real good wench Thou s fitter to be about mother than me I m but a cross patch at best an now it s like as if I was no good to nobody Sylvia began to cry but Hester had no time to attend to her even had she the inclination all her care was needed to help the hasty tottering steps of the wife who was feebly speeding up the wet and slippery brow to her husband All Bell thought of was that he was at the end of her toil She hardly understood when she was to see him her weary heart and brain had only received one idea that each step she was now taking was leading her to him Tired and exhausted with her quick walk up hill battling all the way with wind and rain she could hardly have held up another minute when they reached the tax cart in the lane and Hester had almost to lift her on to the front seat by the driver She covered and wrapped up the poor old woman and afterwards placed herself in the straw at the back of the cart packed up close by the shivering weeping Sylvia Neither of them spoke a word at first but Hester s tender conscience smote her for her silence before they had reached Monkshaven She wanted to say some kind word to Sylvia and yet knew not how to begin Somehow without knowing why or reasoning upon it she hit upon Philip s message as the best comfort in her power to give She had delivered it before but it had been apparently little heeded Philip bade me say it was business as kept him from fetchin yo hissel business wi the lawyer about about yo r father What do they say said Sylvia suddenly lifting her bowed head as though she would read her companion s face in the dim light I dunnot know said Hester sadly They were now jolting over the paved streets and not a word could be spoken They were now at Philip s door which was opened to receive them even before they arrived as if some one had been watching and listening The old servant Phoebe the fixture in the house who had belonged to it and to the shop for the last twenty years came out holding a candle and sheltering it in her hand from the weather while Philip helped the tottering steps of missus Robson as she descended behind As Hester had got in last so she had now to be the first to move Just as she was moving Sylvia s cold little hand was laid on her arm I am main and thankful to yo I ask yo r pardon for speaking cross but indeed my heart s a most broken wi fear about feyther The voice was so plaintive so full of tears that Hester could not but yearn towards the speaker She bent over and kissed her cheek and then clambered unaided down by the wheel on the dark side of the cart Wistfully she longed for one word of thanks or recognition from Philip in whose service she had performed this hard task but he was otherwise occupied and on casting a further glance back as she turned the corner of the street she saw Philip lifting Sylvia carefully down in his arms from her footing on the top of the wheel and then they all went into the light and the warmth the door was shut the lightened cart drove briskly away and Hester in rain and cold and darkness went homewards with her tired sad heart Philip had done all he could since his return from lawyer Dawson s to make his house bright and warm for the reception of his beloved He had a strong apprehension of the probable fate of poor Daniel Robson he had a warm sympathy with the miserable distress of the wife and daughter but still at the back of his mind his spirits danced as if this was to them a festal occasion He had even taken unconscious pleasure in Phoebe s suspicious looks and tones as he had hurried and superintended her in her operations A fire blazed cheerily in the parlour almost dazzling to the travellers brought in from the darkness and the rain candles burned two candles much to Phoebe s discontent Poor Bell Robson had to sit down almost as soon as she entered the room so worn out was she with fatigue and excitement yet she grudged every moment which separated her as she thought from her husband I m ready now said she standing up and rather repulsing Sylvia s cares I m ready now said she looking eagerly at Philip as if for him to lead the way It s not to night replied he almost apologetically You can t see him to night it s to morrow morning before he goes to York it was better for yo to be down here in town ready and beside I didn t know when I sent for ye that he was locked up for the night Well a day well a day said Bell rocking herself backwards and forwards and trying to soothe herself with these words Suddenly she said But I ve brought his comforter wi me his red woollen comforter as he s allays slept in this twelvemonth past he ll get his rheumatiz again oh Philip cannot I get it to him I ll send it by Phoebe said Philip who was busy making tea hospitable and awkward Cannot I take it mysel repeated Bell I could make surer nor anybody else they d maybe not mind yon woman Phoebe d ye call her Nay mother said Sylvia thou s not fit to go Shall I go asked Philip hoping she would say no and be content with Phoebe and leave him where he was Oh Philip would yo said Sylvia turning round Ay said Bell if thou would take it they d be minding yo So there was nothing for it but for him to go in the first flush of his delightful rites of hospitality It s not far said he consoling himself rather than them I ll be back in ten minutes the tea is maskit and Phoebe will take yo r wet things and dry em by t kitchen fire and here s the stairs opening a door in the corner of the room from which the stairs immediately ascended There s two rooms at the top that to t left is all made ready t other is mine said he reddening a little as he spoke Bell was busy undoing her bundle with trembling fingers Here said she and oh lad here s a bit o peppermint cake he s main and fond on it and I catched sight on it by good luck just t last minute Philip was gone and the excitement of Bell and Sylvia flagged once more and sank into wondering despondency Sylvia however roused herself enough to take off her mother s wet clothes and she took them timidly into the kitchen and arranged them before Phoebe s fire Phoebe opened her lips once or twice to speak in remonstrance and then with an effort gulped her words down for her sympathy like that of all the rest of the Monkshaven world was in favour of Daniel Robson and his daughter might place her dripping cloak this night wherever she would for Phoebe Sylvia found her mother still sitting on the chair next the door where she had first placed herself on entering the room I ll gi e you some tea mother said she struck with the shrunken look of Bell s face No no said her mother It s not manners for t help oursel s I m sure Philip would ha wished yo for to take it said Sylvia pouring out a cup Just then he returned and something in his look some dumb expression of delight at her occupation made her blush and hesitate for an instant but then she went on and made a cup of tea ready saying something a little incoherent all the time about her mother s need of it After tea Bell Robson s weariness became so extreme that Philip and Sylvia urged her to go to bed She resisted a little partly out of manners and partly because she kept fancying poor woman that somehow or other her husband might send for her But about seven o clock Sylvia persuaded her to come upstairs Sylvia too bade Philip good night and his look followed the last wave of her dress as she disappeared up the stairs then leaning his chin on his hand he gazed at vacancy and thought deeply for how long he knew not so intent was his mind on the chances of futurity He was aroused by Sylvia s coming down stairs into the sitting room again He started up Mother is so shivery said she May I go in there indicating the kitchen and make her a drop of gruel Phoebe shall make it not you said Philip eagerly preventing her by going to the kitchen door and giving his orders When he turned round again Sylvia was standing over the fire leaning her head against the stone mantel piece for the comparative coolness She did not speak at first or take any notice of him He watched her furtively and saw that she was crying the tears running down her cheeks and she too much absorbed in her thoughts to wipe them away with her apron While he was turning over in his mind what he could best say to comfort her his heart like hers being almost too full for words she suddenly looked him full in the face saying Philip won t they soon let him go what can they do to him Her open lips trembled while awaiting his answer the tears came up and filled her eyes It was just the question he had most dreaded it led to the terror that possessed his own mind but which he had hoped to keep out of hers He hesitated Speak lad said she impatiently with a little passionate gesture I can see thou knows He had only made it worse by consideration he rushed blindfold at a reply He s ta en up for felony Felony said she There thou re out he s in for letting yon men out thou may call it rioting if thou s a mind to set folks again him but it s too bad to cast such hard words at him as yon felony she repeated in a half offended tone It s what the lawyers call it said Philip sadly it s no word o mine Lawyers is allays for making the worst o things said she a little pacified but folks shouldn t allays believe them It s lawyers as has to judge i t long run Cannot the justices mister Harter and them as is no lawyers give him a sentence to morrow wi out sending him to York No said Philip shaking his head He went to the kitchen door and asked if the gruel was not ready so anxious was he to stop the conversation at this point but Phoebe who held her young master in but little respect scolded him for a stupid man who thought like all his sex that gruel was to be made in a minute whatever the fire was and bade him come and make it for himself if he was in such a hurry He had to return discomfited to Sylvia who meanwhile had arranged her thoughts ready to return to the charge And say he s sent to York and say he s tried theere what s t worst they can do again him asked she keeping down her agitation to look at Philip the more sharply Her eyes never slackened their penetrating gaze at his countenance until he replied with the utmost unwillingness and most apparent confusion They may send him to Botany Bay He knew that he held back a worse contingency and he was mortally afraid that she would perceive this reserve But what he did say was so much beyond her utmost apprehension which had only reached to various terms of imprisonment that she did not imagine the dark shadow lurking behind What he had said was too much for her Her eyes dilated her lips blanched her pale cheeks grew yet paler After a minute s look into his face as if fascinated by some horror she stumbled backwards into the chair in the chimney comer and covered her face with her hands moaning out some inarticulate words Philip was on his knees by her dumb from excess of sympathy kissing her dress all unfelt by her he murmured half words he began passionate sentences that died away upon his lips and she she thought of nothing but her father and was possessed and rapt out of herself by the dread of losing him to that fearful country which was almost like the grave to her so all but impassable was the gulf But Philip knew that it was possible that the separation impending might be that of the dark mysterious grave that the gulf between the father and child might indeed be that which no living breathing warm human creature can ever cross Sylvie Sylvie said he and all their conversation had to be carried on in low tones and whispers for fear of the listening ears above don t don t thou rt rending my heart Oh Sylvie hearken There s not a thing I ll not do there s not a penny I ve got th last drop of blood that s in me I ll give up my life for his Life said she putting down her hands and looking at him as if her looks could pierce his soul who talks o touching his life Thou re going crazy Philip I think but she did not think so although she would fain have believed it In her keen agony she read his thoughts as though they were an open page she sate there upright and stony the conviction creeping over her face like the grey shadow of death No more tears no more trembling almost no more breathing He could not bear to see her and yet she held his eyes and he feared to make the effort necessary to move or to turn away lest the shunning motion should carry conviction to her heart Alas conviction of the probable danger to her father s life was already there it was that that was calming her down tightening her muscles bracing her nerves In that hour she lost all her early youth Then he may be hung said she low and solemnly after a long pause Philip turned away his face and did not utter a word Again deep silence broken only by some homely sound in the kitchen Mother must not know on it said Sylvia in the same tone in which she had spoken before It s t worst as can happen to him said Philip More likely he ll be transported maybe he ll be brought in innocent after all No said Sylvia heavily as one without hope as if she were reading some dreadful doom in the tablets of the awful future They ll hang him Oh feyther feyther she choked out almost stuffing her apron into her mouth to deaden the sound and catching at Philip s hand and wringing it with convulsive force till the pain that he loved was nearly more than he could bear No words of his could touch such agony but irrepressibly and as he would have done it to a wounded child he bent over her and kissed her with a tender trembling kiss She did not repulse it probably she did not even perceive it At that moment Phoebe came in with the gruel Philip saw her and knew in an instant what the old woman s conclusion must needs be but Sylvia had to be shaken by the now standing Philip before she could be brought back to the least consciousness of the present time She lifted up her white face to understand his words then she rose up like one who slowly comes to the use of her limbs I suppose I mun go she said but I d sooner face the dead If she asks me Philip what mun I say She ll not ask yo said he if yo go about as common She s never asked yo all this time an if she does put her on to me I ll keep it from her as long as I can I ll manage better nor I ve done wi thee Sylvie said he with a sad faint smile looking with fond penitence at her altered countenance Thou mustn t blame thysel said Sylvia seeing his regret I brought it on me mysel I thought I would ha t truth whativer came on it and now I m not strong enough to stand it God help me she continued piteously Oh Sylvie let me help yo I cannot do what God can I m not meaning that but I can do next to Him of any man I have loved yo for years an years in a way it s terrible to think on if my love can do nought now to comfort yo in your sore distress Cousin Philip she replied in the same measured tone in which she had always spoken since she had learnt the extent of her father s danger and the slow stillness of her words was in harmony with the stony look of her face thou s a comfort to me I couldn t bide my life without thee but I cannot take in the thought o love it seems beside me quite I can think on nought but them that is quick and them that is dead CHAPTER XXVII GLOOMY DAYS Philip had money in the Fosters bank not so much as it might have been if he had not had to pay for the furniture in his house Much of this furniture was old and had belonged to the brothers Foster and they had let Philip have it at a very reasonable rate but still the purchase of it had diminished the amount of his savings But on the sum which he possessed he drew largely he drew all nay he overdrew his account somewhat to his former masters dismay although the kindness of their hearts overruled the harder arguments of their heads All was wanted to defend Daniel Robson at the approaching York assizes His wife had handed over to Philip all the money or money s worth she could lay her hands upon Daniel himself was not one to be much beforehand with the world but to Bell s thrifty imagination the round golden guineas tied up in the old stocking foot against rent day seemed a mint of money on which Philip might draw infinitely As yet she did not comprehend the extent of her husband s danger Sylvia went about like one in a dream keeping back the hot tears that might interfere with the course of life she had prescribed for herself in that terrible hour when she first learnt all Every penny of money either she or her mother could save went to Philip Kester s hoard too was placed in Hepburn s hands at Sylvia s earnest entreaty for Kester had no great opinion of Philip s judgment and would rather have taken his money straight himself to mister Dawson and begged him to use it for his master s behoof Indeed if anything the noiseless breach between Kester and Philip had widened of late It was seed time and Philip in his great anxiety for every possible interest that might affect Sylvia and also as some distraction from his extreme anxiety about her father had taken to study agriculture of an evening in some old books which he had borrowed The Farmer s Complete Guide and such like and from time to time he came down upon the practical dogged Kester with directions gathered from the theories in his books Of course the two fell out but without many words Kester persevered in his old ways making light of Philip and his books in manner and action till at length Philip withdrew from the contest Many a man may lead a horse to water but there s few can make him drink and Philip certainly was not one of those few Kester indeed looked upon him with jealous eyes on many accounts He had favoured Charley Kinraid as a lover of Sylvia s and though he had no idea of the truth though he believed in the drowning of the specksioneer as much as any one yet the year which had elapsed since Kinraid s supposed death was but a very short while to the middle aged man who forgot how slowly time passes with the young and he could often have scolded Sylvia if the poor girl had been a whit less heavy at heart than she was for letting Philip come so much about her come though it was on her father s business For the darkness of their common dread drew them together occasionally to the comparative exclusion of Bell and Kester which the latter perceived and resented Kester even allowed himself to go so far as to wonder what Philip could want with all the money which to him seemed unaccountable and once or twice the ugly thought crossed his mind that shops conducted by young men were often not so profitable as when guided by older heads and that some of the coin poured into Philip s keeping might have another destination than the defence of his master Poor Philip and he was spending all his own and more than all his own money and no one ever knew it as he had bound down his friendly bankers to secrecy Once only Kester ventured to speak to Sylvia on the subject of Philip She had followed her cousin to the field just in front of their house just outside the porch to ask him some question she dared not put in her mother s presence Bell indeed in her anxiety usually absorbed all the questions when Philip came and stood after Philip had bid her good by hardly thinking about him at all but looking unconsciously after him as he ascended the brow and at the top he had turned to take a last glance at the place his love inhabited and seeing her he had waved his hat in gratified farewell She meanwhile was roused from far other thoughts than of him and of his now acknowledged love by the motion against the sky and was turning back into the house when she heard Kester s low hoarse call and saw him standing at the shippen door Come hither wench said he indignantly is this a time for courtin Courting said she drawing up her head and looking back at him with proud defiance Ay courtin what other mak o thing is t when thou s gazin after yon meddlesome chap as if thou d send thy eyes after him and he making marlocks back at thee It s what we ca ed courtin i my young days anyhow And it s noane a time for a wench to go courtin when her feyther s i prison said he with a consciousness as he uttered these last words that he was cruel and unjust and going too far yet carried on to say them by his hot jealousy against Philip Sylvia continued looking at him without speaking she was too much offended for expression Thou may glower an thou may look lass said he but a d thought better on thee It s like last week thy last sweetheart were drowned but thou s not one to waste time i rememberin them as is gone if indeed thou iver cared a button for yon Kinraid if it wasn t a make believe Her lips were contracted and drawn up showing her small glittering teeth which were scarcely apart as she breathed out Thou thinks so does thou that I ve forgetten him Thou d better have a care o thy tongue Then as if fearful that her self command might give way she turned into the house and going through the kitchen like a blind person she went up to her now unused chamber and threw herself face downwards flat on her bed almost smothering herself Ever since Daniel s committal the decay that had imperceptibly begun in his wife s bodily and mental strength during her illness of the previous winter had been making quicker progress She lost her reticence of speech and often talked to herself She had not so much forethought as of old slight differences it is true but which with some others of the same description gave foundation for the homely expression which some now applied to Bell She ll never be t same woman again This afternoon she had cried herself to sleep in her chair after Philip s departure She had not heard Sylvia s sweeping passage through the kitchen but half an hour afterwards she was startled up by Kester s abrupt entry Where s Sylvie asked he I don t know said Bell looking scared and as if she was ready to cry It s no news about him said she standing up and supporting herself on the stick she was now accustomed to use Bless yo no dunnot be afeared missus it s only as a spoke hasty to t wench an a want t tell her as a m sorry said Kester advancing into the kitchen and looking round for Sylvia Sylvie Sylvie shouted he she mun be i t house Sylvia came slowly down the stairs and stood before him Her face was pale her mouth set and determined the light of her eyes veiled in gloom Kester shrank from her look and even more from her silence A m come to ax pardon said he after a little pause She was still silent A m noane above axing pardon though a m fifty and more and thee s but a silly wench as a ve nursed i my arms A ll say before thy mother as a ought niver to ha used them words and as how a m sorry for t I don t understand it all said Bell in a hurried and perplexed tone What has Kester been saying my lass she added turning to Sylvia Sylvia went a step or two nearer to her mother and took hold of her hand as if to quieten her then facing once more round she said deliberately to Kester If thou wasn t Kester I d niver forgive thee Niver she added with bitterness as the words he had used recurred to her mind It s in me to hate thee now for saying what thou did but thou re dear old Kester after all and I can t help mysel I mun needs forgive thee and she went towards him He took her little head between his horny hands and kissed it She looked up with tears in her eyes saying softly Niver say things like them again Niver speak on A ll bite my tongue off first he interrupted He kept his word In all Philip s comings and goings to and from Haytersbank Farm at this time he never spoke again of his love In look words manner he was like a thoughtful tender brother nothing more He could be nothing more in the presence of the great dread which loomed larger upon him after every conversation with the lawyer For mister Donkin had been right in his prognostication Government took up the attack on the Rendezvous with a high and heavy hand It was necessary to assert authority which had been of late too often braved An example must be made to strike dismay into those who opposed and defied the press gang and all the minor authorities who held their powers from Government were in a similar manner severe and relentless in the execution of their duty So the attorney who went over to see the prisoner in York Castle told Philip He added that Daniel still retained his pride in his achievement and could not be brought to understand the dangerous position in which he was placed that when pressed and questioned as to circumstances that might possibly be used in his defence he always wandered off to accounts of previous outrages committed by the press gang or to passionate abuse of the trick by which men had been lured from their homes on the night in question to assist in putting out an imaginary fire and then seized and carried off Some of this very natural indignation might possibly have some effect on the jury and this seemed the only ground of hope and was indeed a slight one as the judge was likely to warn the jury against allowing their natural sympathy in such a case to divert their minds from the real question Such was the substance of what Philip heard and heard repeatedly during his many visits to mister Dawson And now the time of trial drew near for the York assizes opened on March the twelfth not much above three weeks since the offence was committed which took Daniel from his home and placed him in peril of death Philip was glad that the extremity of his danger never having been hinted to Bell and travelling some forty miles being a most unusual exertion at that time to persons of her class the idea of going to see her husband at York had never suggested itself to Bell s mind Her increasing feebleness made this seem a step only to be taken in case of the fatal extreme necessity such was the conclusion that both Sylvia and he had come to and it was the knowledge of this that made Sylvia strangle her own daily longing to see her father Not but that her hopes were stronger than her fears Philip never told her the causes for despondency she was young and she like her father could not understand how fearful sometimes is the necessity for prompt and severe punishment of rebellion against authority Philip was to be in York during the time of the assizes and it was understood almost without words that if the terrible worst occurred the wife and daughter were to come to York as soon as might be For this end Philip silently made all the necessary arrangements before leaving Monkshaven The sympathy of all men was with him it was too large an occasion for Coulson to be anything but magnanimous He urged Philip to take all the time requisite to leave all business cares to him And as Philip went about pale and sad there was another cheek that grew paler still another eye that filled with quiet tears as his heaviness of heart became more and more apparent The day for opening the assizes came on Philip was in York Minster watching the solemn antique procession in which the highest authority in the county accompanies the judges to the House of the Lord to be there admonished as to the nature of their duties As Philip listened to the sermon with a strained and beating heart his hopes rose higher than his fears for the first time and that evening he wrote his first letter to Sylvia DEAR SYLVIA It will be longer first than I thought for mister Dawson says Tuesday in next week But keep up your heart I have been hearing the sermon to day which is preached to the judges and the clergyman said so much in it about mercy and forgiveness I think they cannot fail to be lenient this assize I have seen uncle who looks but thin but is in good heart only he will keep saying he would do it over again if he had the chance which neither mister Dawson nor I think is wise in him in especial as the gaoler is by and hears every word as is said He was very fain of hearing all about home and wants you to rear Daisy s calf as he thinks she will prove a good one He bade me give his best love to you and my aunt and his kind duty to Kester Sylvia will you try and forget how I used to scold you about your writing and spelling and just write me two or three lines I think I would rather have them badly spelt than not because then I shall be sure they are yours And never mind about capitals I was a fool to say such a deal about them for a man does just as well without them A letter from you would do a vast to keep me patient all these days till Tuesday Direct mister Philip Hepburn Care of mister Fraser Draper Micklegate York My affectionate duty to my aunt Your respectful cousin and servant PHILIP HEPBURN P S The sermon was grand The text was Zechariah vii nine Execute true judgment and show mercy God grant it may have put mercy into the judge s heart as is to try my uncle Heavily the days passed over On Sunday Bell and Sylvia went to church with a strange half superstitious feeling as if they could propitiate the Most High to order the events in their favour by paying Him the compliment of attending to duties in their time of sorrow which they had too often neglected in their prosperous days But He who knoweth our frame and remembereth that we are dust took pity upon His children and sent some of His blessed peace into their hearts else they could scarce have endured the agony of suspense of those next hours For as they came slowly and wearily home from church Sylvia could no longer bear her secret but told her mother of the peril in which Daniel stood Cold as the March wind blew they had not felt it and had sate down on a hedge bank for Bell to rest And then Sylvia spoke trembling and sick for fear yet utterly unable to keep silence any longer Bell heaved up her hands and let them fall down on her knees before she replied The Lord is above us said she solemnly He has sent a fear o this into my heart afore now I niver breathed it to thee my lass And I niver spoke on it to thee mother because Sylvia choked with crying and laid her head on her mother s lap feeling that she was no longer the strong one and the protector but the protected Bell went on stroking her head The Lord is like a tender nurse as weans a child to look on and to like what it lothed once He has sent me dreams as has prepared me for this if so be it comes to pass Philip is hopeful said Sylvia raising her head and looking through her tears at her mother Ay he is And I cannot tell but I think it s not for nought as the Lord has ta en away all fear o death out o my heart I think He means as Daniel and me is to go hand in hand through the valley like as we walked up to our wedding in Crosthwaite Church I could never guide th house without Daniel and I should be feared he d take a deal more nor is good for him without me But me mother thou s forgetting me moaned out Sylvia Oh mother mother think on me Nay my lass I m noane forgetting yo I d a sore heart a last winter a thinking on thee when that chap Kinraid were hanging about thee I ll noane speak ill on the dead but I were uneasylike But sin Philip and thee seem to ha made it up Sylvia shivered and opened her mouth to speak but did not say a word And sin the Lord has been comforting me and talking to me many a time when thou s thought I were asleep things has seemed to redd theirselves up and if Daniel goes I m ready to follow I could niver stand living to hear folks say he d been hung it seems so unnatural and shameful But mother he won t he shan t be hung said Sylvia springing to her feet Philip says he won t Bell shook her head They walked on Sylvia both disheartened and almost irritated at her mother s despondency But before they went to bed at night Bell said things which seemed as though the morning s feelings had been but temporary and as if she was referring every decision to the period of her husband s return When father comes home seemed a sort of burden at the beginning or end of every sentence and this reliance on his certain coming back to them was almost as great a trial to Sylvia as the absence of all hope had been in the morning But that instinct told her that her mother was becoming incapable of argument she would have asked her why her views were so essentially changed in so few hours This inability of reason in poor Bell made Sylvia feel very desolate Monday passed over how neither of them knew for neither spoke of what was filling the thoughts of both Before it was light on Tuesday morning Bell was astir It s very early mother said weary sleepy Sylvia dreading returning consciousness Ay lass said Bell in a brisk cheerful tone but he ll maybe be home to night and I se bound to have all things ready for him Anyhow said Sylvia sitting up in bed he couldn t come home to night Tut lass thou doesn t know how quick a man comes home to wife and child I ll be a ready at any rate She hurried about in a way which Sylvia wondered to see till at length she fancied that perhaps her mother did so to drive away thought Every place was cleaned there was scarce time allowed for breakfast till at last long before mid day all the work was done and the two sat down to their spinning wheels Sylvia s spirits sank lower and lower at each speech of her mother s from whose mind all fear seemed to have disappeared leaving only a strange restless kind of excitement It s time for t potatoes said Bell after her wool had snapped many a time from her uneven tread Mother said Sylvia it s but just gone ten Put em on said Bell without attending to the full meaning of her daughter s words It ll maybe hasten t day on if we get dinner done betimes But Kester is in t Far Acre field and he ll not be home till noon This seemed to settle matters for a while but then Bell pushed her wheel away and began searching for her hood and cloak Sylvia found them for her and then asked sadly What does ta want em for mother I ll go up t brow and through t field and just have a look down t lane I ll go wi thee said Sylvia feeling all the time the uselessness of any looking for intelligence from York so early in the day Very patiently did she wait by her mother s side during the long half hour which Bell spent in gazing down the road for those who never came When they got home Sylvia put the potatoes on to boil but when dinner was ready and the three were seated at the dresser Bell pushed her plate away from her saying it was so long after dinner time that she was past eating Kester would have said something about its being only half past twelve but Sylvia gave him a look beseeching silence and he went on with his dinner without a word only brushing away the tears from his eyes with the back of his hand from time to time A ll noane go far fra home t rest o t day said he in a whisper to Sylvia as he went out Will this day niver come to an end cried Bell plaintively Oh mother it ll come to an end some time never fear I ve heerd say Be the day weary or be the day long At length it ringeth to even song To even song to even song repeated Bell D ye think now that even song means death Sylvie I cannot tell I cannot bear it Mother said Sylvia in despair I ll make some clap bread that s a heavy job and will while away t afternoon Ay do replied the mother He ll like it fresh he ll like it fresh Murmuring and talking to herself she fell into a doze from which Sylvia was careful not to disturb her The days were now getting long although as cold as ever and at Haytersbank Farm the light lingered as there was no near horizon to bring on early darkness Sylvia had all ready for her mother s tea against she wakened but she slept on and on the peaceful sleep of a child and Sylvia did not care to waken her Just after the sun had set she saw Kester outside the window making signs to her to come out She stole out on tip toe by the back kitchen the door of which was standing open She almost ran against Philip who did not perceive her as he was awaiting her coming the other way round the corner of the house and who turned upon her a face whose import she read in an instant Philip was all she said and then she fainted at his feet coming down with a heavy bang on the round paving stones of the yard Kester Kester he cried for she looked like one dead and with all his strength the wearied man could not lift her and carry her into the house With Kester s help she was borne into the back kitchen and Kester rushed to the pump for some cold water to throw over her While Philip kneeling at her head was partly supporting her in his arms and heedless of any sight or sound the shadow of some one fell upon him He looked up and saw his aunt the old dignified sensible expression on her face exactly like her former self composed strong and calm My lass said she sitting down by Philip and gently taking her out of his arms into her own Lass bear up we mun bear up and be agait on our way to him he ll be needing us now Bear up my lass the Lord will give us strength We mun go to him ay time s precious thou mun cry thy cry at after Sylvia opened her dim eyes and heard her mother s voice the ideas came slowly into her mind and slowly she rose up standing still like one who has been stunned to regain her strength and then taking hold of her mother s arm she said in a soft strange voice Let s go I m ready CHAPTER XXVIII THE ORDEAL It was the afternoon of an April day in that same year and the sky was blue above with little sailing white clouds catching the pleasant sunlight The earth in that northern country had scarcely yet put on her robe of green The few trees grew near brooks running down from the moors and the higher ground The air was full of pleasant sounds prophesying of the coming summer The rush and murmur and tinkle of the hidden watercourses the song of the lark poised high up in the sunny air the bleat of the lambs calling to their mothers everything inanimate was full of hope and gladness For the first time for a mournful month the front door of Haytersbank Farm was open the warm spring air might enter and displace the sad dark gloom if it could There was a newly lighted fire in the unused grate and Kester was in the kitchen with his clogs off his feet so as not to dirty the spotless floor stirring here and there and trying in his awkward way to make things look home like and cheerful He had brought in some wild daffodils which he had been to seek in the dawn and he placed them in a jug on the dresser Dolly Reid the woman who had come to help Sylvia during her mother s illness a year ago was attending to something in the back kitchen making a noise among the milk cans and singing a ballad to herself as she worked yet every now and then she checked herself in her singing as if a sudden recollection came upon her that this was neither the time nor the place for songs Once or twice she took up the funeral psalm which is sung by the bearers of the body in that country Our God our help in ages past But it was of no use the pleasant April weather out of doors and perhaps the natural spring in the body disposed her nature to cheerfulness and insensibly she returned to her old ditty Kester was turning over many things in his rude honest mind as he stood there giving his finishing touches every now and then to the aspect of the house place in preparation for the return of the widow and daughter of his old master It was a month and more since they had left home more than a fortnight since Kester with three halfpence in his pocket had set out after his day s work to go to York to walk all night long and to wish Daniel Robson his last farewell Daniel had tried to keep up and had brought out one or two familiar thread bare well worn jokes such as he had made Kester chuckle over many a time and oft when the two had been together afield or in the shippen at the home which he should never more see But no Old Grouse in the gunroom could make Kester smile or do anything except groan in but a heart broken sort of fashion and presently the talk had become more suitable to the occasion Daniel being up to the last the more composed of the two for Kester when turned out of the condemned cell fairly broke down into the heavy sobbing he had never thought to sob again on earth He had left Bell and Sylvia in their lodging at York under Philip s care he dared not go to see them he could not trust himself he had sent them his duty and bade Philip tell Sylvia that the game hen had brought out fifteen chickens at a hatch Yet although Kester sent this message through Philip although he saw and recognized all that Philip was doing in their behalf in the behalf of Daniel Robson the condemned felon his honoured master he liked Hepburn not a whit better than he had done before all this sorrow had come upon them Philip had perhaps shown a want of tact in his conduct to Kester Acute with passionate keenness in one direction he had a sort of dull straightforwardness in all others For instance he had returned Kester the money which the latter had so gladly advanced towards the expenses incurred in defending Daniel Now the money which Philip gave him back was part of an advance which Foster Brothers had made on Philip s own account Philip had thought that it was hard on Kester to lose his savings in a hopeless cause and had made a point of repaying the old man but Kester would far rather have felt that the earnings of the sweat of his brow had gone in the attempt to save his master s life than have had twice ten times as many golden guineas Moreover it seemed to take his action in lending his hoard out of the sphere of love and make it but a leaden common loan when it was Philip who brought him the sum not Sylvia into whose hands he had given it With these feelings Kester felt his heart shut up as he saw the long watched for two coming down the little path with a third person with Philip holding up the failing steps of poor Bell Robson as loaded with her heavy mourning and feeble from the illness which had detained her in York ever since the day of her husband s execution she came faltering back to her desolate home Sylvia was also occupied in attending to her mother one or twice when they paused a little she and Philip spoke in the familiar way in which there is no coyness nor reserve Kester caught up his clogs and went quickly out through the back kitchen into the farm yard not staying to greet them as he had meant to do and yet it was dull sighted of him not to have perceived that whatever might be the relations between Philip and Sylvia he was sure to have accompanied them home for alas he was the only male protector of their blood remaining in the world Poor Kester who would fain have taken that office upon himself chose to esteem himself cast off and went heavily about the farmyard knowing that he ought to go in and bid such poor welcome as he had to offer yet feeling too much to like to show himself before Philip It was long too before any one had leisure to come and seek him Bell s mind had flashed up for a time till the fatal day only to be reduced by her subsequent illness into complete and hopeless childishness It was all Philip and Sylvia could do to manage her in the first excitement of returning home her restless inquiry for him who would never more be present in the familiar scene her feverish weariness and uneasiness all required tender soothing and most patient endurance of her refusals to be satisfied with what they said or did At length she took some food and refreshed by it and warmed by the fire she sank asleep in her chair Then Philip would fain have spoken with Sylvia before the hour came at which he must return to Monkshaven but she eluded him and went in search of Kester whose presence she had missed She had guessed some of the causes which kept him from greeting them on their first return But it was not as if she had shaped these causes into the definite form of words It is astonishing to look back and find how differently constituted were the minds of most people fifty or sixty years ago they felt they understood without going through reasoning or analytic processes and if this was the case among the more educated people of course it was still more so in the class to which Sylvia belonged She knew by some sort of intuition that if Philip accompanied them home as indeed under the circumstances was so natural as to be almost unavoidable the old servant and friend of the family would absent himself and so she slipped away at the first possible moment to go in search of him There he was in the farm yard leaning over the gate that opened into the home field apparently watching the poultry that scratched and pecked at the new springing grass with the utmost relish A little farther off were the ewes with their new dropped lambs beyond that the great old thorn tree with its round fresh clusters of buds again beyond that there was a glimpse of the vast sunny rippling sea but Sylvia knew well that Kester was looking at none of these things She went up to him and touched his arm He started from his reverie and turned round upon her with his dim eyes full of unshed tears When he saw her black dress her deep mourning he had hard work to keep from breaking out but by dint of a good brush of his eyes with the back of his hand and a moment s pause he could look at her again with tolerable calmness Why Kester why didst niver come to speak to us said Sylvia finding it necessary to be cheerful if she could A dun know niver ax me A say they n gi en Dick Simpson whose evidence had been all material against poor Daniel Robson at the trial a t rotten eggs and fou things they could o Saturday they did continued he in a tone of satisfaction ay and they niver stopped t see whether t eggs were rotten or fresh when their blood was up nor whether stones was hard or soft he added in a lower tone and chuckling a little Sylvia was silent He looked at her now chuckling still Her face was white her lips tightened her eyes a flame She drew a long breath I wish I d been theere I wish I could do him an ill turn sighed she with some kind of expression on her face that made Kester quail a little Nay lass he ll get it fra others Niver fret thysel about sich rubbish A n done ill to speak on him No thou hasn t Then as was friends o father s I ll love for iver and iver them as helped for t hang him she shuddered from head to foot a sharp irrepressible shudder I ll niver forgive niver Niver s a long word said Kester musingly A could horsewhip him or cast stones at him or duck him mysel but lass niver s a long word Well niver heed if it is it s me as said it and I m turned savage late days Come in Kester and see poor mother A cannot said he turning his wrinkled puckered face away that she might not see the twitchings of emotion on it There s kine to be fetched up and what not and he s theere isn t he Sylvie facing round upon her with inquisitiveness Under his peering eyes she reddened a little Yes if it s Philip thou means he s been all we ve had to look to sin Again the shudder Well now he ll be seein after his shop a reckon Sylvia was calling to the old mare nibbling tufts of early springing grass here and there and half unconsciously coaxing the creature to come up to the gate to be stroked But she heard Kester s words well enough and so he saw although she made this excuse not to reply But Kester was not to be put off Folks is talkin about thee and him thou ll ha to mind lest thee and him gets yo r names coupled together It s right down cruel on folks then said she crimsoning from some emotion As if any man as was a man wouldn t do all he could for two lone women at such a time and he a cousin too Tell me who said so continued she firing round at Kester and I ll niver forgive em that s all Hoots said Kester a little conscious that he himself was the principal representative of that name of multitude folk Here s a pretty lass she s got a ll niver forgi e at her tongue s end wi a vengeance Sylvia was a little confused Oh Kester man said she my heart is sore again every one for feyther s sake And at length the natural relief of plentiful tears came and Kester with instinctive wisdom let her weep undisturbed indeed he cried not a little himself They were interrupted by Philip s voice from the back door Sylvie your mother s awake and wants you Come Kester come and taking hold of him she drew him with her into the house Bell rose as they came in holding by the arms of the chair At first she received Kester as though he had been a stranger I m glad to see yo sir t master s out but he ll be in afore long It ll be about t lambs yo re come mebbe Mother said Sylvia dunnot yo see it s Kester Kester wi his Sunday clothes on Kester ay sure it is my eyes have getten so sore and dim of late just as if I d been greeting I m sure lad I m glad to see thee It s a long time I ve been away but it were not pleasure seeking as took me it were business o some mak tell him Sylvie what it were for my head s clean gone I only know I wouldn t ha left home if I could ha helped it for I think I should ha kept my health better if I d bided at home wi my master I wonder as he s not comed in for t bid me welcome Is he far afield think ye Kester Kester looked at Sylvia mutely imploring her to help him out in the dilemma of answering but she was doing all she could to help crying Philip came to the rescue Aunt said he the clock has stopped can you tell me where t find t key and I ll wind it up T key said she hurriedly t key it s behind th big Bible on yon shelf But I d rayther thou wouldn t touch it lad it s t master s work and he distrusts folk meddling wi it Day after day there was this constant reference to her dead husband In one sense it was a blessing all the circumstances attendant on his sad and untimely end were swept out of her mind along with the recollection of the fact itself She referred to him as absent and had always some plausible way of accounting for it which satisfied her own mind and accordingly they fell into the habit of humouring her and speaking of him as gone to Monkshaven or afield or wearied out and taking a nap upstairs as her fancy led her to believe for the moment But this forgetfulness though happy for herself was terrible for her child It was a constant renewing of Sylvia s grief while her mother could give her no sympathy no help or strength in any circumstances that arose out of this grief She was driven more and more upon Philip his advice and his affection became daily more necessary to her Kester saw what would be the end of all this more clearly than Sylvia did herself and impotent to hinder what he feared and disliked he grew more and more surly every day Yet he tried to labour hard and well for the interests of the family as if they were bound up in his good management of the cattle and land He was out and about by the earliest dawn working all day long with might and main He bought himself a pair of new spectacles which might he fancied enable him to read the Farmer s Complete Guide his dead master s vade mecum But he had never learnt more than his capital letters and had forgotten many of them so the spectacles did him but little good Then he would take the book to Sylvia and ask her to read to him the instructions he needed instructions be it noted that he would formerly have despised as mere book learning but his present sense of responsibility had made him humble Sylvia would find the place with all deliberation and putting her finger under the line to keep the exact place of the word she was reading she would strive in good earnest to read out the directions given but when every fourth word had to be spelt it was rather hopeless work especially as all these words were unintelligible to the open mouthed listener however intent he might be He had generally to fall back on his own experience and guided by that things were not doing badly in his estimation when one day Sylvia said to him as they were in the hay field heaping up the hay into cocks with Dolly Reid s assistance Kester I didn t tell thee there were a letter from Measter Hall Lord Malton s steward that came last night and that Philip read me She stopped for a moment Ay lass Philip read it thee and whatten might it say Only that he had an offer for Haytersbank Farm and would set mother free to go as soon as t crops was off t ground She sighed a little as she said this Only sayst ta Whatten business has he for to go an offer to let t farm afore iver he were told as yo wished to leave it observed Kester in high dudgeon Oh replied Sylvia throwing down her rake as if weary of life What could we do wi t farm and land If it were all dairy I might ha done but wi so much on it arable And if tis arable is not I allays to t fore Oh man dunnot find fault wi me I m just fain to lie down and die if it were not for mother Ay thy mother will be sore unsettled if thou s for quitting Haytersbank said merciless Kester I cannot help it I cannot help it What can I do It would take two pair o men s hands to keep t land up as Measter Hall likes it and beside Beside what said Kester looking up at her with his sudden odd look one eye shut the other open there she stood her two hands clasped tight together her eyes filling with tears her face pale and sad Beside what he asked again sharply T answer s sent to Measter Hall Philip wrote it last night so there s no use planning and fretting it were done for t best and mun be done She stooped and picked up her rake and began tossing the hay with energy the tears streaming down her cheeks unheeded It was Kester s turn to throw down his rake She took no notice he did not feel sure that she had observed his action He began to walk towards the field gate this movement did catch her eye for in a minute her hand was on his arm and she was stooping forward to look into his face It was working and twitching with emotion Kester oh man speak out but dunnot leave me a this ns What could I ha done Mother is gone dateless wi sorrow and I am but a young lass i years I mean for I m old enough wi weeping I d ha put up for t farm mysel sooner than had thee turned out said Kester in a low voice then working himself up into a passion as a new suspicion crossed his mind he added An what for didn t yo tell me on t letter Yo were in a mighty hurry to settle it a and get rid on t oud place Measter Hall had sent a notice to quit on Midsummer day but Philip had answered it hisself Thou knows I m not good at reading writing special when a letter s full o long words and Philip had ta en it in hand to answer Wi out asking thee Sylvia went on without minding the interruption And Measter Hall makes a good offer for t man as is going to come in will take t stock and a t implements and if mother if we if I like th furniture and a Furniture said Kester in grim surprise What s to come o t missus and thee that yo ll not need a bed to lie on or a pot to boil yo r vittel in Sylvia reddened but kept silence Cannot yo speak Oh Kester I didn t think thou d turn again me and me so friendless It s as if I d been doin something wrong and I have so striven to act as is best there s mother as well as me to be thought on Cannot yo answer a question said Kester once more Whatten s up that t missus and yo ll not need bed and table pots and pans I think I m going to marry Philip said Sylvia in so low a tone that if Kester had not suspected what her answer was to be he could not have understood it After a moment s pause he recommenced his walk towards the field gate But she went after him and held him tight by the arm speaking rapidly Kester what could I do What can I do He s my cousin and mother knows him and likes him and he s been so good to us in a this time o trouble and heavy grief and he ll keep mother in comfort all t rest of her days Ay and thee in comfort There s a deal in a well filled purse in a wench s eyes or one would ha thought it weren t so easy forgettin yon lad as loved thee as t apple on his eye Kester Kester she cried I ve niver forgotten Charley I think on him I see him ivery night lying drowned at t bottom o t sea Forgetten him Man it s easy talking She was like a wild creature that sees its young but is unable to reach it without a deadly spring and yet is preparing to take that fatal leap Kester himself was almost startled and yet it was as if he must go on torturing her An who telled thee so sure and certain as he were drowned He might ha been carried off by t press gang as well as other men Oh if I were but dead that I might know all cried she flinging herself down on the hay Kester kept silence Then she sprang up again and looking with eager wistfulness into his face she said Tell me t chances Tell me quick Philip s very good and kind and he says he shall die if I will not marry him and there s no home for mother and me no home for her for as for me I dunnot care what becomes on me but if Charley s alive I cannot marry Philip no not if he dies for want o me and as for mother poor mother Kester it s an awful strait only first tell me if there s a chance just one in a thousand only one in a hundred thousand as Charley were ta en by t gang She was breathless by this time what with her hurried words and what with the beating of her heart Kester took time to answer He had spoken before too hastily this time he weighed his words Kinraid went away from this here place t join his ship An he niver joined it no more an t captain an all his friends at Newcassel as iver were made search for him on board t king s ships That s more nor fifteen month ago an nought has iver been heerd on him by any man That s what s to be said on one side o t matter Then on t other there s this as is known His hat were cast up by t sea wi a ribbon in it as there s reason t think as he d not ha parted wi so quick if he d had his own will But yo said as he might ha been carried off by t gang yo did Kester tho now yo re a for t other side My lass a d fain have him alive an a dunnot fancy Philip for thy husband but it s a serious judgment as thou s put me on an a m trying it fair There s allays one chance i a thousand as he s alive for no man iver saw him dead But t gang were noane about Monkshaven then there were niver a tender on t coast nearer than Shields an those theere were searched He did not say any more but turned back into the field and took up his hay making again Sylvia stood quite still thinking and wistfully longing for some kind of certainty Kester came up to her Sylvie thou knows Philip paid me back my money and it were eight pound fifteen and three pence and t hay and stock ll sell for summat above t rent and a ve a sister as is a decent widow woman tho but badly off livin at Dale End and if thee and thy mother ll go live wi her a ll give thee well on to all a can earn and it ll be a matter o five shilling a week But dunnot go and marry a man as thou s noane taken wi and another as is most like for t be dead but who mebbe is alive havin a pull on thy heart Sylvia began to cry as if her heart was broken She had promised herself more fully to Philip the night before than she had told Kester and with some pains and much patience her cousin her lover alas her future husband had made the fact clear to the bewildered mind of her poor mother who had all day long shown that her mind and heart were full of the subject and that the contemplation of it was giving her as much peace as she could ever know And now Kester s words came to call up echoes in the poor girl s heart Just as she was in this miserable state wishing that the grave lay open before her and that she could lie down and be covered up by the soft green turf from all the bitter sorrows and carking cares and weary bewilderments of this life wishing that her father was alive that Charley was once more here that she had not repeated the solemn words by which she had promised herself to Philip only the very evening before she heard a soft low whistle and looking round unconsciously there was her lover and affianced husband leaning on the gate and gazing into the field with passionate eyes devouring the fair face and figure of her his future wife Oh Kester said she once more what mun I do I m pledged to him as strong as words can make it and mother blessed us both wi more sense than she s had for weeks Kester man speak Shall I go and break it all off say Nay it s noane for me t say m appen thou s gone too far Them above only knows what is best Again that long cooing whistle Sylvie He s been very kind to us all said Sylvia laying her rake down with slow care and I ll try t make him happy CHAPTER XXIX WEDDING RAIMENT Philip and Sylvia were engaged It was not so happy a state of things as Philip had imagined He had already found that out although it was not twenty four hours since Sylvia had promised to be his He could not have defined why he was dissatisfied if he had been compelled to account for his feeling he would probably have alleged as a reason that Sylvia s manner was so unchanged by her new position towards him She was quiet and gentle but no shyer no brighter no coyer no happier than she had been for months before When she joined him at the field gate his heart was beating fast his eyes were beaming out love at her approach She neither blushed nor smiled but seemed absorbed in thought of some kind But she resisted his silent effort to draw her away from the path leading to the house and turned her face steadily homewards He murmured soft words which she scarcely heard Right in their way was the stone trough for the fresh bubbling water that issuing from a roadside spring served for all the household purposes of Haytersbank Farm By it were the milk cans glittering and clean Sylvia knew she should have to stop for these and carry them back home in readiness for the evening s milking and at this time during this action she resolved to say what was on her mind They were there Sylvia spoke Philip Kester has been saying as how it might ha been Well said Philip Sylvia sate down on the edge of the trough and dipped her hot little hand in the water Then she went on quickly and lifting her beautiful eyes to Philip s face with a look of inquiry He thinks as Charley Kinraid may ha been took by t press gang It was the first time she had named the name of her former lover to her present one since the day long ago now when they had quarrelled about him and the rosy colour flushed her all over but her sweet trustful eyes never flinched from their steady unconscious gaze Philip s heart stopped beating literally as if he had come to a sudden precipice while he had thought himself securely walking on sunny greensward He went purple all over from dismay he dared not take his eyes away from that sad earnest look of hers but he was thankful that a mist came before them and drew a veil before his brain He heard his own voice saying words he did not seem to have framed in his own mind Kester s a d d fool he growled He says there s mebbe but one chance i a hundred said Sylvia pleading as it were for Kester but oh Philip think yo there s just that one chance Ay there s a chance sure enough said Philip in a kind of fierce despair that made him reckless what he said or did There s a chance I suppose for iverything i life as we have not seen with our own eyes as it may not ha happened Kester may say next as there s a chance as your father is not dead because we none on us saw him Hung he was going to have said but a touch of humanity came back into his stony heart Sylvia sent up a little sharp cry at his words He longed at the sound to take her in his arms and hush her up as a mother hushes her weeping child But the very longing having to be repressed only made him more beside himself with guilt anxiety and rage They were quite still now Sylvia looking sadly down into the bubbling merry flowing water Philip glaring at her wishing that the next word were spoken though it might stab him to the heart But she did not speak At length unable to bear it any longer he said Thou sets a deal o store on that man Sylvie If that man had been there at the moment Philip would have grappled with him and not let go his hold till one or the other were dead Sylvia caught some of the passionate meaning of the gloomy miserable tone of Philip s voice as he said these words She looked up at him I thought yo knowed that I cared a deal for him There was something so pleading and innocent in her pale troubled face so pathetic in her tone that Philip s anger which had been excited against her as well as against all the rest of the world melted away into love and once more he felt that have her for his own he must at any cost He sate down by her and spoke to her in quite a different manner to that which he had used before with a ready tact and art which some strange instinct or tempter close at his ear supplied Yes darling I knew yo cared for him I ll not say ill of him that is dead ay dead and drowned whativer Kester may say before now but if I chose I could tell tales No tell no tales I ll not hear them said she wrenching herself out of Philip s clasping arm They may misca him for iver and I ll not believe em I ll niver miscall one who is dead said Philip each new unconscious sign of the strength of Sylvia s love for her former lover only making him the more anxious to convince her that he was dead only rendering him more keen at deceiving his own conscience by repeating to it the lie that long ere this Kinraid was in all probability dead killed by either the chances of war or tempestuous sea that even if not he was as good as dead to her so that the word dead might be used in all honest certainty as in one of its meanings Kinraid was dead for sure Think yo that if he were not dead he wouldn t ha written ere this to some one of his kin if not to thee Yet none of his folk Newcassel way but believe him dead So Kester says sighed Sylvia Philip took heart He put his arm softly round her again and murmured My lassie try not to think on them as is gone as is dead but t think a bit more on him as loves yo wi heart and soul and might and has done iver sin he first set eyes on yo Oh Sylvie my love for thee is just terrible At this moment Dolly Reid was seen at the back door of the farmhouse and catching sight of Sylvia she called out Sylvia thy mother is axing for thee and I cannot make her mind easy In a moment Sylvia had sprung up from her seat and was running in to soothe and comfort her mother s troubled fancies Philip sate on by the well side his face buried in his two hands Presently he lifted himself up drank some water eagerly out of his hollowed palm sighed and shook himself and followed his cousin into the house Sometimes he came unexpectedly to the limits of his influence over her In general she obeyed his expressed wishes with gentle indifference as if she had no preferences of her own once or twice he found that she was doing what he desired out of the spirit of obedience which as her mother s daughter she believed to be her duty towards her affianced husband And this last motive for action depressed her lover more than anything He wanted the old Sylvia back again captious capricious wilful haughty merry charming Alas that Sylvia was gone for ever But once especially his power arising from whatever cause was stopped entirely short was utterly of no avail It was on the occasion of Dick Simpson s mortal illness Sylvia and her mother kept aloof from every one They had never been intimate with any family but the Corneys and even this friendship had considerably cooled since Molly s marriage and most especially since Kinraid s supposed death when Bessy Corney and Sylvia had been as it were rival mourners But many people both in Monkshaven and the country round about held the Robson family in great respect although missus Robson herself was accounted high and distant and poor little Sylvia in her heyday of beautiful youth and high spirits had been spoken of as a bit flighty and a set up lassie Still when their great sorrow fell upon them there were plenty of friends to sympathize deeply with them and as Daniel had suffered in a popular cause there were even more who scarcely knowing them personally were ready to give them all the marks of respect and friendly feeling in their power But neither Bell nor Sylvia were aware of this The former had lost all perception of what was not immediately before her the latter shrank from all encounters of any kind with a sore heart and sensitive avoidance of everything that could make her a subject of remark So the poor afflicted people at Haytersbank knew little of Monkshaven news What little did come to their ears came through Dolly Reid when she returned from selling the farm produce of the week and often indeed even then she found Sylvia too much absorbed in other cares or thoughts to listen to her gossip So no one had ever named that Simpson was supposed to be dying till Philip began on the subject one evening Sylvia s face suddenly flashed into glow and life He s dying is he t earth is well rid on such a fellow Eh Sylvie that s a hard speech o thine said Philip it gives me but poor heart to ask a favour of thee If it s aught about Simpson replied she and then she interrupted herself But say on it were ill mannered in me for t interrupt yo Thou would be sorry to see him I think Sylvie He cannot get over the way t folk met him and pelted him when he came back fra York and he s weak and faint and beside himself at times and he ll lie a dreaming and a fancying they re all at him again hooting and yelling and pelting him I m glad on t said Sylvia it s t best news I ve heered for many a day he to turn again feyther who gave him money fo t get a lodging that night when he d no place to go to It were his evidence as hung feyther and he s rightly punished for it now For a that and he s done a vast o wrong beside he s dying now Sylvie Well let him die it s t best thing he could do But he s lying i such dree poverty and niver a friend to go near him niver a person to speak a kind word t him It seems as yo ve been speaking wi him at any rate said Sylvia turning round on Philip Ay He sent for me by Nell Manning th old beggar woman who sometimes goes in and makes his bed for him poor wretch he s lying in t ruins of th cow house of th Mariners Arms Sylvie Well said she in the same hard dry tone And I went and fetched th parish doctor for I thought he d ha died before my face he was so wan and ashen grey so thin too his eyes seem pushed out of his bony face That last time feyther s eyes were starting wild like and as if he couldn t meet ours or bear the sight on our weeping It was a bad look out for Philip s purpose but after a pause he went bravely on He s a poor dying creature anyhow T doctor said so and told him he hadn t many hours let alone days to live And he d shrink fra dying wi a his sins on his head said Sylvia almost exultingly Philip shook his head He said this world had been too strong for him and men too hard upon him he could niver do any good here and he thought he should maybe find folks i t next place more merciful He ll meet feyther theere said Sylvia still hard and bitter He s a poor ignorant creature and doesn t seem to know rightly who he s like to meet only he seems glad to get away fra Monkshaven folks he were really hurt I am afeared that night Sylvie and he speaks as if he d had hard times of it ever since he were a child and he talks as if he were really grieved for t part t lawyers made him take at th trial they made him speak against his will he says Couldn t he ha bitten his tongue out asked Sylvia It s fine talking o sorrow when the thing is done Well anyhow he s sorry now and he s not long for to live And Sylvie he bid me ask thee if for the sake of all that is dear to thee both here and i th world to come thou d go wi me and just say to him that thou forgives him his part that day He sent thee on that errand did he And thou could come and ask me I ve a mind to break it off for iver wi thee Philip She kept gasping as if she could not say any more Philip watched and waited till her breath came his own half choked Thee and me was niver meant to go together It s not in me to forgive I sometimes think it s not in me to forget I wonder Philip if thy feyther had done a kind deed and a right deed and a merciful deed and some one as he d been good to even i t midst of his just anger had gone and let on about him to th judge as was trying to hang him and had getten him hanged hanged dead so that his wife were a widow and his child fatherless for ivermore I wonder if thy veins would run milk and water so that thou could go and make friends and speak soft wi him as had caused thy feyther s death It s said in t Bible Sylvie that we re to forgive Ay there s some things as I know I niver forgive and there s others as I can t and I won t either But Sylvie yo pray to be forgiven your trespasses as you forgive them as trespass against you Well if I m to be taken at my word I ll noane pray at all that s all It s well enough for them as has but little to forgive to use them words and I don t reckon it s kind or pretty behaved in yo Philip to bring up Scripture again me Thou may go about thy business Thou rt vexed with me Sylvie and I m not meaning but that it would go hard with thee to forgive him but I think it would be right and Christian like i thee and that thou d find thy comfort in thinking on it after If thou d only go and see his wistful eyes I think they d plead wi thee more than his words or mine either I tell thee my flesh and blood wasn t made for forgiving and forgetting Once for all thou must take my word When I love I love and when I hate I hate and him as has done hard to me or to mine I may keep fra striking or murdering but I ll niver forgive I should be just a monster fit to be shown at a fair if I could forgive him as got feyther hanged Philip was silent thinking what more he could urge Yo d better be off said Sylvia in a minute or two Yo and me has got wrong and it ll take a night s sleep to set us right Yo ve said all yo can for him and perhaps it s not yo as is to blame but yo r nature But I m put out wi thee and want thee out o my sight for awhile One or two more speeches of this kind convinced him that it would be wise in him to take her at her word He went back to Simpson and found him though still alive past the understanding of any words of human forgiveness Philip had almost wished he had not troubled or irritated Sylvia by urging the dying man s request the performance of this duty seemed now to have been such a useless office After all the performance of a duty is never a useless office though we may not see the consequences or they may be quite different to what we expected or calculated on In the pause of active work when daylight was done and the evening shades came on Sylvia had time to think and her heart grew sad and soft in comparison to what it had been when Philip s urgency had called out all her angry opposition She thought of her father his sharp passions his frequent forgiveness or rather his forgetfulness that he had even been injured All Sylvia s persistent or enduring qualities were derived from her mother her impulses from her father It was her dead father whose example filled her mind this evening in the soft and tender twilight She did not say to herself that she would go and tell Simpson that she forgave him but she thought that if Philip asked her again that she should do so But when she saw Philip again he told her that Simpson was dead and passed on from what he had reason to think would be an unpleasant subject to her Thus he never learnt how her conduct might have been more gentle and relenting than her words words which came up into his memory at a future time with full measure of miserable significance In general Sylvia was gentle and good enough but Philip wanted her to be shy and tender with him and this she was not She spoke to him her pretty eyes looking straight and composedly at him She consulted him like the family friend that he was she met him quietly in all the arrangements for the time of their marriage which she looked upon more as a change of home as the leaving of Haytersbank as it would affect her mother than in any more directly personal way Philip was beginning to feel though not as yet to acknowledge that the fruit he had so inordinately longed for was but of the nature of an apple of Sodom Long ago lodging in widow Rose s garret he had been in the habit of watching some pigeons that were kept by a neighbour the flock disported themselves on the steep tiled roofs just opposite to the attic window and insensibly Philip grew to know their ways and one pretty soft little dove was somehow perpetually associated in his mind with his idea of his cousin Sylvia The pigeon would sit in one particular place sunning herself and puffing out her feathered breast with all the blue and rose coloured lights gleaming in the morning rays cooing softly to herself as she dressed her plumage Philip fancied that he saw the same colours in a certain piece of shot silk now in the shop and none other seemed to him so suitable for his darling s wedding dress He carried enough to make a gown and gave it to her one evening as she sate on the grass just outside the house half attending to her mother half engaged in knitting stockings for her scanty marriage outfit He was glad that the sun was not gone down thus allowing him to display the changing colours in fuller light Sylvia admired it duly even missus Robson was pleased and attracted by the soft yet brilliant hues Philip whispered to Sylvia he took delight in whispers she on the contrary always spoke to him in her usual tone of voice Thou lieutenant look so pretty in it sweetheart o Thursday fortnight Thursday fortnight On the fourth yo re thinking on But I cannot wear it then I shall be i black Not on that day sure said Philip Why not There s nought t happen on that day for t make me forget feyther I couldn t put off my black Philip no not to save my life Yon silk is just lovely far too good for the likes of me and I m sure I m much beholden to yo and I ll have it made up first of any gown after last April come two years but oh Philip I cannot put off my mourning Not for our wedding day said Philip sadly No lad I really cannot I m just sorry about it for I see thou rt set upon it and thou rt so kind and good I sometimes think I can niver be thankful enough to thee When I think on what would ha become of mother and me if we hadn t had thee for a friend i need I m noane ungrateful Philip tho I sometimes fancy thou rt thinking I am I don t want yo to be grateful Sylvie said poor Philip dissatisfied yet unable to explain what he did want only knowing that there was something he lacked yet fain would have had As the marriage day drew near all Sylvia s care seemed to be for her mother all her anxiety was regarding the appurtenances of the home she was leaving In vain Philip tried to interest her in details of his improvements or contrivances in the new home to which he was going to take her She did not tell him but the idea of the house behind the shop was associated in her mind with two times of discomfort and misery The first time she had gone into the parlour about which Philip spoke so much was at the time of the press gang riot when she had fainted from terror and excitement the second was on that night of misery when she and her mother had gone in to Monkshaven to bid her father farewell before he was taken to York in that room on that night she had first learnt something of the fatal peril in which he stood She could not show the bright shy curiosity about her future dwelling that is common enough with girls who are going to be married All she could do was to restrain herself from sighing and listen patiently when he talked on the subject In time he saw that she shrank from it so he held his peace and planned and worked for her in silence smiling to himself as he looked on each completed arrangement for her pleasure or comfort and knowing well that her happiness was involved in what fragments of peace and material comfort might remain to her mother The wedding day drew near apace It was Philip s plan that after they had been married in Kirk Moorside church he and his Sylvia his cousin his love his wife should go for the day to Robin Hood s Bay returning in the evening to the house behind the shop in the market place There they were to find Bell Robson installed in her future home for Haytersbank Farm was to be given up to the new tenant on the very day of the wedding Sylvia would not be married any sooner she said that she must stay there till the very last and had said it with such determination that Philip had desisted from all urgency at once He had told her that all should be settled for her mother s comfort during their few hours absence otherwise Sylvia would not have gone at all He told her he should ask Hester who was always so good and kind who never yet had said him nay to go to church with them as bridesmaid for Sylvia would give no thought or care to anything but her mother and that they would leave her at Haytersbank as they returned from church she would manage missus Robson s removal she would do this do that do everything Such friendly confidence had Philip in Hester s willingness and tender skill Sylvia acquiesced at length and Philip took upon himself to speak to Hester on the subject Hester said he one day when he was preparing to go home after the shop was closed would yo mind stopping a bit I should like to show yo the place now it s done up and I ve a favour to ask on yo besides He was so happy he did not see her shiver all over She hesitated just a moment before she answered I ll stay if thou wishes it Philip But I m no judge o fashions and such like Thou rt a judge o comfort and that s what I ve been aiming at I were niver so comfortable in a my life as when I were a lodger at thy house said he with brotherly tenderness in his tone If my mind had been at ease I could ha said I niver were happier in all my days than under thy roof and I know it were thy doing for the most part So come along Hester and tell me if there s aught more I can put in for Sylvie It might not have been a very appropriate text but such as it was the words From him that would ask of thee turn not thou away seemed the only source of strength that could have enabled her to go patiently through the next half hour As it was she unselfishly brought all her mind to bear upon the subject admired this thought and decided upon that as one by one Philip showed her all his alterations and improvements Never was such a quiet little bit of unconscious and unrecognized heroism She really ended by such a conquest of self that she could absolutely sympathize with the proud expectant lover and had quenched all envy of the beloved in sympathy with the delight she imagined Sylvia must experience when she discovered all these proofs of Philip s fond consideration and care But it was a great strain on the heart that source of life and when Hester returned into the parlour after her deliberate survey of the house she felt as weary and depressed in bodily strength as if she had gone through an illness of many days She sate down on the nearest chair and felt as though she never could rise again Philip joyous and content stood near her talking And Hester said he Sylvie has given me a message for thee she says thou must be her bridesmaid she ll have none other I cannot said Hester with sudden sharpness Oh yes but yo must It wouldn t be like my wedding if thou wasn t there why I ve looked upon thee as a sister iver since I came to lodge with thy mother Hester shook her head Did her duty require her not to turn away from this asking too Philip saw her reluctance and by intuition rather than reason he knew that what she would not do for gaiety or pleasure she would consent to if by so doing she could render any service to another So he went on Besides Sylvie and me has planned to go for our wedding jaunt to Robin Hood s Bay I ha been to engage a shandry this very morn before t shop was opened and there s no one to leave wi my aunt Th poor old body is sore crushed with sorrow and is as one may say childish at times she s to come down here that we may find her when we come back at night and there s niver a one she ll come with so willing and so happy as with thee Hester Sylvie and me has both said so Hester looked up in his face with her grave honest eyes I cannot go to church wi thee Philip and thou must not ask me any further But I ll go betimes to Haytersbank Farm and I ll do my best to make the old lady happy and to follow out thy directions in bringing her here before nightfall Philip was on the point of urging her afresh to go with them to church but something in her eyes brought a thought across his mind as transitory as a breath passes over a looking glass and he desisted from his entreaty and put away his thought as a piece of vain coxcombry insulting to Hester He passed rapidly on to all the careful directions rendered necessary by her compliance with the latter part of his request coupling Sylvia s name with his perpetually so that Hester looked upon her as a happy girl as eager in planning all the details of her marriage as though no heavy shameful sorrow had passed over her head not many months ago Hester did not see Sylvia s white dreamy resolute face that answered the solemn questions of the marriage service in a voice that did not seem her own Hester was not with them to notice the heavy abstraction that made the bride as if unconscious of her husband s loving words and then start and smile and reply with a sad gentleness of tone No Hester s duty lay in conveying the poor widow and mother down from Haytersbank to the new home in Monkshaven and for all Hester s assistance and thoughtfulness it was a dreary painful piece of work the poor old woman crying like a child with bewilderment at the confused bustle which in spite of all Sylvia s careful forethought could not be avoided on this final day when her mother had to be carried away from the homestead over which she had so long presided But all this was as nothing to the distress which overwhelmed poor Bell Robson when she entered Philip s house the parlour the whole place so associated with the keen agony she had undergone there that the stab of memory penetrated through her deadened senses and brought her back to misery In vain Hester tried to console her by telling her the fact of Sylvia s marriage with Philip in every form of words that occurred to her Bell only remembered her husband s fate which filled up her poor wandering mind and coloured everything insomuch that Sylvia not being at hand to reply to her mother s cry for her the latter imagined that her child as well as her husband was in danger of trial and death and refused to be comforted by any endeavour of the patient sympathizing Hester In a pause of missus Robson s sobs Hester heard the welcome sound of the wheels of the returning shandry bearing the bride and bridegroom home It stopped at the door an instant and Sylvia white as a sheet at the sound of her mother s wailings which she had caught while yet at a distance with the quick ears of love came running in her mother feebly rose and tottered towards her and fell into her arms saying Oh Sylvie Sylvie take me home and away from this cruel place Hester could not but be touched with the young girl s manner to her mother as tender as protecting as if their relation to each other had been reversed and she was lulling and tenderly soothing a wayward frightened child She had neither eyes nor ears for any one till her mother was sitting in trembling peace holding her daughter s hand tight in both of hers as if afraid of losing sight of her then Sylvia turned to Hester and with the sweet grace which is a natural gift to some happy people thanked her in common words enough she thanked her but in that nameless manner and with that strange rare charm which made Hester feel as if she had never been thanked in all her life before and from that time forth she understood if she did not always yield to the unconscious fascination which Sylvia could exercise over others at times Did it enter into Philip s heart to perceive that he had wedded his long sought bride in mourning raiment and that the first sounds which greeted them as they approached their home were those of weeping and wailing CHAPTER XXX HAPPY DAYS And now Philip seemed as prosperous as his heart could desire The business flourished and money beyond his moderate wants came in As for himself he required very little but he had always looked forward to placing his idol in a befitting shrine and means for this were now furnished to him The dress the comforts the position he had desired for Sylvia were all hers She did not need to do a stroke of household work if she preferred to sit in her parlour and sew up a seam Indeed Phoebe resented any interference in the domestic labour which she had performed so long that she looked upon the kitchen as a private empire of her own missus Hepburn as Sylvia was now termed had a good dark silk gown piece in her drawers as well as the poor dove coloured against the day when she chose to leave off mourning and stuff for either gray or scarlet cloaks was hers at her bidding What she cared for far more were the comforts with which it was in her power to surround her mother In this Philip vied with her for besides his old love and new pity for his aunt Bell he never forgot how she had welcomed him to Haytersbank and favoured his love to Sylvia in the yearning days when he little hoped he should ever win his cousin to be his wife But even if he had not had these grateful and affectionate feelings towards the poor woman he would have done much for her if only to gain the sweet rare smiles which his wife never bestowed upon him so freely as when she saw him attending to mother for so both of them now called Bell For her creature comforts her silk gowns and her humble luxury Sylvia did not care Philip was almost annoyed at the indifference she often manifested to all his efforts to surround her with such things It was even a hardship to her to leave off her country dress her uncovered hair her linsey petticoat and loose bed gown and to don a stiff and stately gown for her morning dress Sitting in the dark parlour at the back of the shop and doing white work was much more wearying to her than running out into the fields to bring up the cows or spinning wool or making up butter She sometimes thought to herself that it was a strange kind of life where there were no out door animals to look after the ox and the ass had hitherto come into all her ideas of humanity and her care and gentleness had made the dumb creatures round her father s home into mute friends with loving eyes looking at her as if wistful to speak in words the grateful regard that she could read without the poor expression of language She missed the free open air the great dome of sky above the fields she rebelled against the necessity of dressing as she called it to go out although she acknowledged that it was a necessity where the first step beyond the threshold must be into a populous street It is possible that Philip was right at one time when he had thought to win her by material advantages but the old vanities had been burnt out of her by the hot iron of acute suffering A great deal of passionate feeling still existed concealed and latent but at this period it appeared as though she were indifferent to most things and had lost the power of either hoping or fearing much She was stunned into a sort of temporary numbness on most points those on which she was sensitive being such as referred to the injustice and oppression of her father s death or anything that concerned her mother She was quiet even to passiveness in all her dealings with Philip he would have given not a little for some of the old bursts of impatience the old pettishness which naughty as they were had gone to form his idea of the former Sylvia Once or twice he was almost vexed with her for her docility he wanted her so much to have a will of her own if only that he might know how to rouse her to pleasure by gratifying it Indeed he seldom fell asleep at nights without his last thoughts being devoted to some little plan for the morrow that he fancied she would like and when he wakened in the early dawn he looked to see if she were indeed sleeping by his side or whether it was not all a dream that he called Sylvia wife He was aware that her affection for him was not to be spoken of in the same way as his for her but he found much happiness in only being allowed to love and cherish her and with the patient perseverance that was one remarkable feature in his character he went on striving to deepen and increase her love when most other men would have given up the endeavour made themselves content with half a heart and turned to some other object of attainment All this time Philip was troubled by a dream that recurred whenever he was over fatigued or otherwise not in perfect health Over and over again in this first year of married life he dreamt this dream perhaps as many as eight or nine times and it never varied It was always of Kinraid s return Kinraid was full of life in Philip s dream though in his waking hours he could and did convince himself by all the laws of probability that his rival was dead He never remembered the exact sequence of events in that terrible dream after he had roused himself with a fight and a struggle from his feverish slumbers He was generally sitting up in bed when he found himself conscious his heart beating wildly with a conviction of Kinraid s living presence somewhere near him in the darkness Occasionally Sylvia was disturbed by his agitation and would question him about his dreams having like most of her class at that time great faith in their prophetic interpretation but Philip never gave her any truth in his reply After all and though he did not acknowledge it even to himself the long desired happiness was not so delicious and perfect as he had anticipated Many have felt the same in their first year of married life but the faithful patient nature that still works on striving to gain love and capable itself of steady love all the while is a gift not given to all For many weeks after their wedding Kester never came near them a chance word or two from Sylvia showed Philip that she had noticed this and regretted it and accordingly he made it his business at the next leisure opportunity to go to Haytersbank never saying a word to his wife of his purpose and seek out Kester All the whole place was altered It was new white washed new thatched the patches of colour in the surrounding ground were changed with altered tillage the great geraniums were gone from the window and instead was a smart knitted blind Children played before the house door a dog lying on the step flew at Philip all was so strange that it was even the strangest thing of all for Kester to appear where everything else was so altered Philip had to put up with a good deal of crabbed behaviour on the part of the latter before he could induce Kester to promise to come down into the town and see Sylvia in her new home Somehow the visit when paid was but a failure at least it seemed so at the time though probably it broke the ice of restraint which was forming over the familiar intercourse between Kester and Sylvia The old servant was daunted by seeing Sylvia in a strange place and stood sleeking his hair down and furtively looking about him instead of seating himself on the chair Sylvia had so eagerly brought forward for him Then his sense of the estrangement caused by their new positions infected her and she began to cry pitifully saying Oh Kester Kester tell me about Haytersbank Is it just as it used to be in feyther s days Well a cannot say as it is said Kester thankful to have a subject started They n pleughed up t oud pasture field and are settin it for taters They re not for much cattle isn t Higginses They ll be for corn in t next year a reckon and they ll just ha their pains for their payment But they re allays so pig headed is folk fra a distance So they went on discoursing on Haytersbank and the old days till Bell Robson having finished her afternoon nap came slowly down stairs to join them and after that the conversation became so broken up from the desire of the other two to attend and reply as best they could to her fragmentary and disjointed talk that Kester took his leave before long falling as he did so into the formal and unnaturally respectful manner which he had adopted on first coming in But Sylvia ran after him and brought him back from the door To think of thy going away Kester without either bit or drink nay come back wi thee and taste wine and cake Kester stood at the door half shy half pleased while Sylvia in all the glow and hurry of a young housekeeper s hospitality sought for the decanter of wine and a wine glass in the corner cupboard and hastily cut an immense wedge of cake which she crammed into his hand in spite of his remonstrances and then she poured him out an overflowing glass of wine which Kester would far rather have gone without as he knew manners too well to suppose that he might taste it without having gone through the preliminary ceremony of wishing the donor health and happiness He stood red and half smiling with his cake in one hand his wine in the other and then began Long may ye live Happy may ye he And blest with a num rous Pro ge ny Theere that s po try for yo as I larnt i my youth But there s a deal to be said as cannot be put int po try an yet a cannot say it somehow It d tax a parson t say a as a ve getten i my mind It s like a heap o woo just after shearin time it s worth a deal but it tak s a vast o combin an cardin an spinnin afore it can be

thought yon man ud mak a m not above sayin as he s mebbe better nor a took him for so here s to ye both and wishin ye health and happiness ay and money to buy yo another as country folk say Having ended his oration much to his own satisfaction Kester tossed off his glass of wine smacked his lips wiped his mouth with the back of his hand pocketed his cake and made off That night Sylvia spoke of his visit to her husband Philip never said how he himself had brought it to pass nor did he name the fact that he had heard the old man come in just as he himself had intended going into the parlour for tea but had kept away as he thought Sylvia and Kester would most enjoy their interview undisturbed And Sylvia felt as if her husband s silence was unsympathizing and shut up the feelings that were just beginning to expand towards him She sank again into the listless state of indifference from which nothing but some reference to former days or present consideration for her mother could rouse her Hester was almost surprised at Sylvia s evident liking for her By slow degrees Hester was learning to love the woman whose position as Philip s wife she would have envied so keenly had she not been so truly good and pious But Sylvia seemed as though she had given Hester her whole affection all at once Hester could not understand this while she was touched and melted by the trust it implied For one thing Sylvia remembered and regretted her harsh treatment of Hester the rainy stormy night on which the latter had come to Haytersbank to seek her and her mother and bring them into Monkshaven to see the imprisoned father and husband Sylvia had been struck with Hester s patient endurance of her rudeness a rudeness which she was conscious that she herself should have immediately and vehemently resented Sylvia did not understand how a totally different character from hers might immediately forgive the anger she could not forget and because Hester had been so meek at the time Sylvia who knew how passing and transitory was her own anger thought that all was forgotten while Hester believed that the words which she herself could not have uttered except under deep provocation meant much more than they did and admired and wondered at Sylvia for having so entirely conquered her anger against her Again the two different women were divergently affected by the extreme fondness which Bell had shown towards Hester ever since Sylvia s wedding day Sylvia who had always received more love from others than she knew what to do with had the most entire faith in her own supremacy in her mother s heart though at times Hester would do certain things more to the poor old woman s satisfaction Hester who had craved for the affection which had been withheld from her and had from that one circumstance become distrustful of her own power of inspiring regard while she exaggerated the delight of being beloved feared lest Sylvia should become jealous of her mother s open display of great attachment and occasional preference for Hester But such a thought never entered Sylvia s mind She was more thankful than she knew how to express towards any one who made her mother happy as has been already said the contributing to Bell Robson s pleasures earned Philip more of his wife s smiles than anything else And Sylvia threw her whole heart into the words and caresses she lavished on Hester whenever poor missus Robson spoke of the goodness and kindness of the latter Hester attributed more virtue to these sweet words and deeds of gratitude than they deserved they did not imply in Sylvia any victory over evil temptation as they would have done in Hester It seemed to be Sylvia s fate to captivate more people than she cared to like back again She turned the heads of John and Jeremiah Foster who could hardly congratulate Philip enough on his choice of a wife They had been prepared to be critical on one who had interfered with their favourite project of a marriage between Philip and Hester and though full of compassion for the cruelty of Daniel Robson s fate they were too completely men of business not to have some apprehension that the connection of Philip Hepburn with the daughter of a man who was hanged might injure the shop over which both his and their name appeared But all the possible proprieties demanded that they should pay attention to the bride of their former shopman and present successor and the very first visitors whom Sylvia had received after her marriage had been John and Jeremiah Foster in their sabbath day clothes They found her in the parlour so familiar to both of them clear starching her mother s caps which had to be got up in some particular fashion that Sylvia was afraid of dictating to Phoebe She was a little disturbed at her visitors discovering her at this employment but she was on her own ground and that gave her self possession and she welcomed the two old men so sweetly and modestly and looked so pretty and feminine and besides so notable in her handiwork that she conquered all their prejudices at one blow and their first thought on leaving the shop was how to do her honour by inviting her to a supper party at Jeremiah Foster s house Sylvia was dismayed when she was bidden to this wedding feast and Philip had to use all his authority though tenderly to make her consent to go at all She had been to merry country parties like the Corneys and to bright haymaking romps in the open air but never to a set stately party at a friend s house She would fain have made attendance on her mother an excuse but Philip knew he must not listen to any such plea and applied to Hester in the dilemma asking her to remain with missus Robson while he and Sylvia went out visiting and Hester had willingly nay eagerly consented it was much more to her taste than going out So Philip and Sylvia set out arm in arm down Bridge Street across the bridge and then clambered up the hill On the way he gave her the directions she asked for about her behaviour as bride and most honoured guest and altogether succeeded against his intention and will in frightening her so completely as to the grandeur and importance of the occasion and the necessity of remembering certain set rules and making certain set speeches and attending to them when the right time came that if any one so naturally graceful could have been awkward Sylvia would have been so that night As it was she sate pale and weary looking on the very edge of her chair she uttered the formal words which Philip had told her were appropriate to the occasion and she heartily wished herself safe at home and in bed Yet she left but one unanimous impression on the company when she went away namely that she was the prettiest and best behaved woman they had ever seen and that Philip Hepburn had done well in choosing her felon s daughter though she might be Both the hosts had followed her into the lobby to help Philip in cloaking her and putting on her pattens They were full of old fashioned compliments and good wishes one speech of theirs came up to her memory in future years Now Sylvia Hepburn said Jeremiah I ve known thy husband long and I don t say but what thou hast done well in choosing him but if he ever neglects or ill uses thee come to me and I ll give him a sound lecture on his conduct Mind I m thy friend from this day forrards and ready to take thy part against him Philip smiled as if the day would never come when he should neglect or ill use his darling Sylvia smiled a little without much attending to or caring for the words that were detaining her tired as she was John and Jeremiah chuckled over the joke but the words came up again in after days as words idly spoken sometimes do Before the end of that first year Philip had learnt to be jealous of his wife s new love for Hester To the latter Sylvia gave the free confidence on many things which Philip fancied she withheld from him A suspicion crossed his mind from time to time that Sylvia might speak of her former lover to Hester It would be not unnatural he thought if she did so believing him to be dead but the idea irritated him He was entirely mistaken however Sylvia with all her apparent frankness kept her deep sorrows to herself She never mentioned her father s name though he was continually present to her mind Nor did she speak of Kinraid to human being though for his sake her voice softened when by chance she spoke to a passing sailor and for his sake her eyes lingered on such men longer than on others trying to discover in them something of the old familiar gait and partly for his dead sake and partly because of the freedom of the outlook and the freshness of the air she was glad occasionally to escape from the comfortable imprisonment of her parlour and the close streets around the market place and to mount the cliffs and sit on the turf gazing abroad over the wide still expanse of the open sea for at that height even breaking waves only looked like broken lines of white foam on the blue watery plain She did not want any companion on these rambles which had somewhat of the delight of stolen pleasures for all the other respectable matrons and town dwellers whom she knew were content to have always a business object for their walk or else to stop at home in their own households and Sylvia was rather ashamed of her own yearnings for solitude and open air and the sight and sound of the mother like sea She used to take off her hat and sit there her hands clasping her knees the salt air lifting her bright curls gazing at the distant horizon over the sea in a sad dreaminess of thought if she had been asked on what she meditated she could not have told you But by and by the time came when she was a prisoner in the house a prisoner in her room lying in bed with a little baby by her side her child Philip s child His pride his delight knew no bounds this was a new fast tie between them this would reconcile her to the kind of life that with all its respectability and comfort was so different from what she had lived before and which Philip had often perceived that she felt to be dull and restraining He already began to trace in the little girl only a few days old the lovely curves that he knew so well by heart in the mother s face Sylvia too pale still and weak was very happy yes really happy for the first time since her irrevocable marriage For its irrevocableness had weighed much upon her with a sense of dull hopelessness she felt all Philip s kindness she was grateful to him for his tender regard towards her mother she was learning to love him as well as to like and respect him She did not know what else she could have done but marry so true a friend and she and her mother so friendless but at the same time it was like lead on her morning spirits when she awoke and remembered that the decision was made the dead was done the choice taken which comes to most people but once in their lives Now the little baby came in upon this state of mind like a ray of sunlight into a gloomy room Even her mother was rejoiced and proud even with her crazed brain and broken heart the sight of sweet peaceful infancy brought light to her All the old ways of holding a baby of hushing it to sleep of tenderly guarding its little limbs from injury came back like the habits of her youth to Bell and she was never so happy or so easy in her mind or so sensible and connected in her ideas as when she had Sylvia s baby in her arms It was a pretty sight to see however familiar to all of us such things may be the pale worn old woman in her quaint old fashioned country dress holding the little infant on her knees looking at its open unspeculative eyes and talking the little language to it as though it could understand the father on his knees kept prisoner by a small small finger curled round his strong and sinewy one and gazing at the tiny creature with wondering idolatry the young mother fair pale and smiling propped up on pillows in order that she too might see the wonderful babe it was astonishing how the doctor could come and go without being drawn into the admiring vortex and look at this baby just as if babies came into the world every day Philip said Sylvia one night as he sate as still as a mouse in her room imagining her to be asleep He was by her bed side in a moment I ve been thinking what she s to be called Isabella after mother and what were yo r mother s name Margaret said he Margaret Isabella Isabella Margaret Mother s called Bell She might be called Bella I could ha wished her to be called after thee She made a little impatient movement Nay Sylvia s not a lucky name Best be called after thy mother and mine And I want for to ask Hester to be godmother Anything thou likes sweetheart Shall we call her Rose after Hester Rose No no said Sylvia she mun be called after my mother or thine or both I should like her to be called Bella after mother because she s so fond of baby Anything to please thee darling Don t say that as if it didn t signify there s a deal in having a pretty name said Sylvia a little annoyed I ha allays hated being called Sylvia It were after father s mother Sylvia Steele I niver thought any name in a the world so sweet and pretty as Sylvia said Philip fondly but she was too much absorbed in her own thoughts to notice either his manner or his words There yo ll not mind if it is Bella because yo see my mother is alive to be pleased by its being named after her and Hester may be godmother and I ll ha t dove coloured silk as yo gave me afore we were married made up into a cloak for it to go to church in I got it for thee said Philip a little disappointed It ll be too good for the baby Eh but I m so careless I should be spilling something on it But if thou got it for me I cannot find i my heart for t wear it on baby and I ll have it made into a christening gown for mysel But I ll niver feel at my ease in it for fear of spoiling it Well an if thou does spoil it love I ll get thee another I make account of riches only for thee that I may be able to get thee whativer thou s a fancy for for either thysel or thy mother She lifted her pale face from her pillow and put up her lips to kiss him for these words Perhaps on that day Philip reached the zenith of his life s happiness CHAPTER XXXI EVIL OMENS The first step in Philip s declension happened in this way Sylvia had made rapid progress in her recovery but now she seemed at a stationary point of weakness wakeful nights succeeding to languid days Occasionally she caught a little sleep in the afternoons but she usually awoke startled and feverish One afternoon Philip had stolen upstairs to look at her and his child but the efforts he made at careful noiselessness made the door creak on its hinges as he opened it The woman employed to nurse her had taken the baby into another room that no sound might rouse her from her slumber and Philip would probably have been warned against entering the chamber where his wife lay sleeping had he been perceived by the nurse As it was he opened the door made a noise and Sylvia started up her face all one flush her eyes wild and uncertain she looked about her as if she did not know where she was pushed the hair off her hot forehead all which actions Philip saw dismayed and regretful But he kept still hoping that she would lie down and compose herself Instead she stretched out her arms imploringly and said in a voice full of yearning and tears Oh Charley come to me come to me and then as she more fully became aware of the place where she was her actual situation she sank back and feebly began to cry Philip s heart boiled within him any man s would under the circumstances but he had the sense of guilty concealment to aggravate the intensity of his feelings Her weak cry after another man too irritated him partly through his anxious love which made him wise to know how much physical harm she was doing herself At this moment he stirred or unintentionally made some sound she started up afresh and called out Oh who s theere Do for God s sake tell me who yo are It s me said Philip coming forwards striving to keep down the miserable complication of love and jealousy and remorse and anger that made his heart beat so wildly and almost took him out of himself Indeed he must have been quite beside himself for the time or he could never have gone on to utter the unwise cruel words he did But she spoke first in a distressed and plaintive tone of voice Oh Philip I ve been asleep and yet I think I was awake And I saw Charley Kinraid as plain as iver I see thee now and he wasn t drowned at all I m sure he s alive somewheere he were so clear and life like Oh what shall I do what shall I do She wrung her hands in feverish distress Urged by passionate feelings of various kinds and also by his desire to quench the agitation which was doing her harm Philip spoke hardly knowing what he said Kinraid s dead I tell yo Sylvie And what kind of a woman are yo to go dreaming of another man i this way and taking on so about him when yo re a wedded wife with a child as yo ve borne to another man In a moment he could have bitten out his tongue She looked at him with the mute reproach which some of us see God help us in the eyes of the dead as they come before our sad memories in the night season looked at him with such a solemn searching look never saying a word of reply or defence Then she lay down motionless and silent He had been instantly stung with remorse for his speech the words were not beyond his lips when an agony had entered his heart but her steady dilated eyes had kept him dumb and motionless as if by a spell Now he rushed to the bed on which she lay and half knelt half threw himself upon it imploring her to forgive him regardless for the time of any evil consequences to her it seemed as if he must have her pardon her relenting at any price even if they both died in the act of reconciliation But she lay speechless and as far as she could be motionless the bed trembling under her with the quivering she could not still Philip s wild tones caught the nurse s ears and she entered full of the dignified indignation of wisdom Are yo for killing yo r wife measter she asked She s noane so strong as she can bear flytin and scoldin nor will she be for many a week to come Go down wi ye and leave her i peace if yo re a man as can be called a man Her anger was rising as she caught sight of Sylvia s averted face It was flushed crimson her eyes full of intense emotion of some kind her lips compressed but an involuntary twitching overmastering her resolute stillness from time to time Philip who did not see the averted face nor understand the real danger in which he was placing his wife felt as though he must have one word one responsive touch of the hand which lay passive in his which was not even drawn away from the kisses with which he covered it any more than if it had been an impassive stone The nurse had fairly to take him by the shoulders and turn him out of the room In half an hour the doctor had to be summoned Of course the nurse gave him her version of the events of the afternoon with much animus against Philip and the doctor thought it his duty to have some very serious conversation with him I do assure you mister Hepburn that in the state your wife has been in for some days it was little less than madness on your part to speak to her about anything that could give rise to strong emotion It was madness sir replied Philip in a low miserable tone of voice The doctor s heart was touched in spite of the nurse s accusations against the scolding husband Yet the danger was now too serious for him to mince matters I must tell you that I cannot answer for her life unless the greatest precautions are taken on your part and unless the measures I shall use have the effect I wish for in the next twenty four hours She is on the verge of a brain fever Any allusion to the subject which has been the final cause of the state in which she now is must be most cautiously avoided even to a chance word which may bring it to her memory And so on but Philip seemed to hear only this then he might not express contrition or sue for pardon he must go on unforgiven through all this stress of anxiety and even if she recovered the doctor warned him of the undesirableness of recurring to what had passed Heavy miserable times of endurance and waiting have to be passed through by all during the course of their lives and Philip had had his share of such seasons when the heart and the will and the speech and the limbs must be bound down with strong resolution to patience For many days nay for weeks he was forbidden to see Sylvia as the very sound of his footstep brought on a recurrence of the fever and convulsive movement Yet she seemed from questions she feebly asked the nurse to have forgotten all that had happened on the day of her attack from the time when she dropped off to sleep But how much she remembered of after occurrences no one could ascertain She was quiet enough when at length Philip was allowed to see her But he was half jealous of his child when he watched how she could smile at it while she never changed a muscle of her face at all he could do or say And of a piece with this extreme quietude and reserve was her behaviour to him when at length she had fully recovered and was able to go about the house again Philip thought many a time of the words she had used long before before their marriage Ominous words they were It s not in me to forgive I sometimes think it s not in me to forget Philip was tender even to humility in his conduct towards her But nothing stirred her from her fortress of reserve And he knew she was so different he knew how loving nay passionate was her nature vehement demonstrative oh how could he stir her once more into expression even if the first show or speech she made was of anger Then he tried being angry with her himself he was sometimes unjust to her consciously and of a purpose in order to provoke her into defending herself and appealing against his unkindness He only seemed to drive her love away still more If any one had known all that was passing in that household while yet the story of it was not ended nor indeed come to its crisis their hearts would have been sorry for the man who lingered long at the door of the room in which his wife sate cooing and talking to her baby and sometimes laughing back to it or who was soothing the querulousness of failing age with every possible patience of love sorry for the poor listener who was hungering for the profusion of tenderness thus scattered on the senseless air yet only by stealth caught the echoes of what ought to have been his It was so difficult to complain too impossible in fact Everything that a wife could do from duty she did but the love seemed to have fled and in such cases no reproaches or complaints can avail to bring it back So reason outsiders and are convinced of the result before the experiment is made But Philip could not reason or could not yield to reason and so he complained and reproached She did not much answer him but he thought that her eyes expressed the old words It s not in me to forgive I sometimes think it s not in me to forget However it is an old story an ascertained fact that even in the most tender and stable masculine natures at the supremest season of their lives there is room for other thoughts and passions than such as are connected with love Even with the most domestic and affectionate men their emotions seem to be kept in a cell distinct and away from their actual lives Philip had other thoughts and other occupations than those connected with his wife during all this time An uncle of his mother s a Cumberland statesman of whose existence he was barely conscious died about this time leaving to his unknown great nephew four or five hundred pounds which put him at once in a different position with regard to his business Henceforward his ambition was roused such humble ambition as befitted a shop keeper in a country town sixty or seventy years ago To be respected by the men around him had always been an object with him and was perhaps becoming more so than ever now as a sort of refuge from his deep sorrowful mortification in other directions He was greatly pleased at being made a sidesman and in preparation for the further honour of being churchwarden he went regularly twice a day to church on Sundays There was enough religious feeling in him to make him disguise the worldly reason for such conduct from himself He believed that he went because he thought it right to attend public worship in the parish church whenever it was offered up but it may be questioned of him as of many others how far he would have been as regular in attendance in a place where he was not known With this however we have nothing to do The fact was that he went regularly to church and he wished his wife to accompany him to the pew newly painted with his name on the door where he sate in full sight of the clergyman and congregation Sylvia had never been in the habit of such regular church going and she felt it as a hardship and slipped out of the duty as often as ever she could In her unmarried days she and her parents had gone annually to the mother church of the parish in which Haytersbank was situated on the Monday succeeding the Sunday next after the Romish Saint s Day to whom the church was dedicated there was a great feast or wake held and on the Sunday all the parishioners came to church from far and near Frequently too in the course of the year Sylvia would accompany one or other of her parents to Scarby Moorside afternoon service when the hay was got in and the corn not ready for cutting or the cows were dry and there was no afternoon milking Many clergymen were languid in those days and did not too curiously inquire into the reasons which gave them such small congregations in country parishes Now she was married this weekly church going which Philip seemed to expect from her became a tie and a small hardship which connected itself with her life of respectability and prosperity A crust of bread and liberty was much more accordant to Sylvia s nature than plenty of creature comforts and many restraints Another wish of Philip s against which she said no word but constantly rebelled in thought and deed was his desire that the servant he had engaged during the time of her illness to take charge of the baby should always carry it whenever it was taken out for a walk Sylvia often felt now she was strong as if she would far rather have been without the responsibility of having this nursemaid of whom she was in reality rather afraid The good side of it was that it set her at liberty to attend to her mother at times when she would have been otherwise occupied with her baby but Bell required very little from any one she was easily pleased unexacting and methodical even in her dotage preserving the quiet undemonstrative habits of her earlier life now that the faculty of reason which had been at the basis of the formation of such habits was gone She took great delight in watching the baby and was pleased to have it in her care for a short time but she dozed so much that it prevented her having any strong wish on the subject So Sylvia contrived to get her baby as much as possible to herself in spite of the nursemaid and above all she would carry it out softly cradled in her arms warm pillowed on her breast and bear it to the freedom and solitude of the sea shore on the west side of the town where the cliffs were not so high and there was a good space of sand and shingle at all low tides Once here she was as happy as she ever expected to be in this world The fresh sea breeze restored something of the colour of former days to her cheeks the old buoyancy to her spirits here she might talk her heart full of loving nonsense to her baby here it was all her own no father to share in it no nursemaid to dispute the wisdom of anything she did with it She sang to it she tossed it it crowed and it laughed back again till both were weary and then she would sit down on a broken piece of rock and fall to gazing on the advancing waves catching the sunlight on their crests advancing receding for ever and for ever as they had done all her life long as they did when she had walked with them that once by the side of Kinraid those cruel waves that forgetful of the happy lovers talk by the side of their waters had carried one away and drowned him deep till he was dead Every time she sate down to look at the sea this process of thought was gone through up to this point the next step would she knew bring her to the question she dared not must not ask He was dead he must be dead for was she not Philip s wife Then came up the recollection of Philip s speech never forgotten only buried out of sight What kind of a woman are yo to go on dreaming of another man and yo a wedded wife She used to shudder as if cold steel had been plunged into her warm living body as she remembered these words cruel words harmlessly provoked They were too much associated with physical pains to be dwelt upon only their memory was always there She paid for these happy rambles with her baby by the depression which awaited her on her re entrance into the dark confined house that was her home its very fulness of comfort was an oppression Then when her husband saw her pale and fatigued he was annoyed and sometimes upbraided her for doing what was so unnecessary as to load herself with her child She knew full well it was not that that caused her weariness By and by when he inquired and discovered that all these walks were taken in one direction out towards the sea he grew jealous of her love for the inanimate ocean Was it connected in her mind with the thought of Kinraid Why did she so perseveringly in wind or cold go out to the sea shore the western side too where if she went but far enough she would come upon the mouth of the Haytersbank gully the point at which she had last seen Kinraid Such fancies haunted Philip s mind for hours after she had acknowledged the direction of her walks But he never said a word that could distinctly tell her he disliked her going to the sea otherwise she would have obeyed him in this as in everything else for absolute obedience to her husband seemed to be her rule of life at this period obedience to him who would so gladly have obeyed her smallest wish had she but expressed it She never knew that Philip had any painful association with the particular point on the sea shore that she instinctively avoided both from a consciousness of wifely duty and also because the sight of it brought up so much sharp pain Philip used to wonder if the dream that preceded her illness was the suggestive cause that drew her so often to the shore Her illness consequent upon that dream had filled his mind so that for many months he himself had had no haunting vision of Kinraid to disturb his slumbers But now the old dream of Kinraid s actual presence by Philip s bedside began to return with fearful vividness Night after night it recurred each time with some new touch of reality and close approach till it was as if the fate that overtakes all men were then even then knocking at his door In his business Philip prospered Men praised him because he did well to himself He had the perseverance the capability for head work and calculation the steadiness and general forethought which might have made him a great merchant if he had lived in a large city Without any effort of his own almost too without Coulson s being aware of it Philip was now in the position of superior partner the one to suggest and arrange while Coulson only carried out the plans that emanated from Philip The whole work of life was suited to the man he did not aspire to any different position only to the full development of the capabilities of that which he already held He had originated several fresh schemes with regard to the traffic of the shop and his old masters with all their love of tried ways and distrust of everything new had been candid enough to confess that their successors plans had resulted in success Their successors Philip was content with having the power when the exercise of it was required and never named his own important share in the new improvements Possibly if he had Coulson s vanity might have taken the alarm and he might not have been so acquiescent for the future As it was he forgot his own subordinate share and always used the imperial we we thought it struck us c CHAPTER XXXII RESCUED FROM THE WAVES Meanwhile Hester came and went as usual in so quiet and methodical a way with so even and undisturbed a temper that she was almost forgotten when everything went well in the shop or household She was a star the brightness of which was only recognized in times of darkness She herself was almost surprised at her own increasing regard for Sylvia She had not thought she should ever be able to love the woman who had been such a laggard in acknowledging Philip s merits and from all she had ever heard of Sylvia before she came to know her from the angry words with which Sylvia had received her when she had first gone to Haytersbank Farm Hester had intended to remain on friendly terms but to avoid intimacy But her kindness to Bell Robson had won both the mother s and daughter s hearts and in spite of herself certainly against her own mother s advice she had become the familiar friend and welcome guest of the household Now the very change in Sylvia s whole manner and ways which grieved and vexed Philip made his wife the more attractive to Hester Brought up among Quakers although not one herself she admired and respected the staidness and outward peacefulness common amongst the young women of that sect Sylvia whom she had expected to find volatile talkative vain and wilful was quiet and still as if she had been born a Friend she seemed to have no will of her own she served her mother and child for love she obeyed her husband in all things and never appeared to pine after gaiety or pleasure And yet at times Hester thought or rather a flash came across her mind as if all things were not as right as they seemed Philip looked older more care worn nay even Hester was obliged to allow to herself that she had heard him speak to his wife in sharp aggrieved tones Innocent Hester she could not understand how the very qualities she so admired in Sylvia were just what were so foreign to her nature that the husband who had known her from a child felt what an unnatural restraint she was putting upon herself and would have hailed petulant words or wilful actions with an unspeakable thankfulness for relief One day it was in the spring of seventeen ninety eight Hester was engaged to stay to tea with the Hepburns in order that after that early meal she might set to again in helping Philip and Coulson to pack away the winter cloths and flannels for which there was no longer any use The tea time was half past four about four o clock a heavy April shower came on the hail pattering against the window panes so as to awaken missus Robson from her afternoon s nap She came down the corkscrew stairs and found Phoebe in the parlour arranging the tea things Phoebe and missus Robson were better friends than Phoebe and her young mistress and so they began to talk a little together in a comfortable familiar way Once or twice Philip looked in as if he would be glad to see the tea table in readiness and then Phoebe would put on a spurt of busy bustle which ceased almost as soon as his back was turned so eager was she to obtain missus Robson s sympathy in some little dispute that had occurred between her and the nurse maid The latter had misappropriated some hot water prepared and required by Phoebe to the washing of the baby s clothes it was a long story and would have tired the patience of any one in full possession of their senses but the details were just within poor Bell s comprehension and she was listening with the greatest sympathy Both the women were unaware of the lapse of time but it was of consequence to Philip as the extra labour was not to be begun until after tea and the daylight hours were precious At a quarter to five Hester and he came in and then Phoebe began to hurry Hester went up to sit by Bell and talk to her Philip spoke to Phoebe in the familiar words of country folk Indeed until his marriage Phoebe had always called him by his Christian name and had found it very difficult to change it into master Where s Sylvie said he Gone out wi t babby replied Phoebe Why can t Nancy carry it out asked Philip It was touching on the old grievance he was tired and he spoke with sharp annoyance Phoebe might easily have told him the real state of the case Nancy was busy at her washing which would have been reason enough But the nursemaid had vexed her and she did not like Philip s sharpness so she only said It s noane o my business it s yo t look after yo r own wife and child but yo r but a lad after a This was not conciliatory speech and just put the last stroke to Philip s fit of ill temper I m not for my tea to night said he to Hester when all was ready Sylvie s not here and nothing is nice or as it should be I ll go and set to on t stock taking Don t yo hurry Hester stop and chat a bit with th old lady Nay Philip said Hester thou s sadly tired just take this cup o tea Sylvia ll be grieved if yo haven t something Sylvia doesn t care whether I m full or fasting replied he impatiently putting aside the cup If she did she d ha taken care to be in and ha seen to things being as I like them Now in general Philip was the least particular of men about meals and to do Sylvia justice she was scrupulously attentive to every household duty in which old Phoebe would allow her to meddle and always careful to see after her husband s comforts But Philip was too vexed at her absence to perceive the injustice of what he was saying nor was he aware how Bell Robson had been attending to what he said But she was sadly discomfited by it understanding just enough of the grievance in hand to think that her daughter was neglectful of those duties which she herself had always regarded as paramount to all others nor could Hester convince her that Philip had not meant what he said neither could she turn the poor old woman s thoughts from the words which had caused her distress Presently Sylvia came in bright and cheerful although breathless with hurry Oh said she taking off her wet shawl we ve had to shelter from such a storm of rain baby and me but see she s none the worse for it as bonny as iver bless her Hester began some speech of admiration for the child in order to prevent Bell from delivering the lecture she felt sure was coming down on the unsuspecting Sylvia but all in vain Philip s been complaining on thee Sylvie said Bell in the way in which she had spoken to her daughter when she was a little child grave and severe in tone and look more than in words I forget justly what about but he spoke on thy neglecting him continual It s not right my lass it s not right a woman should but my head s very tired and all I can think on to say is it s not right Philip been complaining of me and to mother said Sylvia ready to burst into tears so grieved and angry was she No said Hester thy mother has taken it a little too strong he were vexed like at his tea not being ready Sylvia said no more but the bright colour faded from her cheek and the contraction of care returned to her brow She occupied herself with taking off her baby s walking things Hester lingered anxious to soothe and make peace she was looking sorrowfully at Sylvia when she saw tears dropping on the baby s cloak and then it seemed as if she must speak a word of comfort before going to the shop work where she knew she was expected by both Philip and Coulson She poured out a cup of tea and coming close up to Sylvia and kneeling down by her she whispered Just take him this into t ware room it ll put all to rights if thou ll take it to him wi thy own hands Sylvia looked up and Hester then more fully saw how she had been crying She whispered in reply for fear of disturbing her mother I don t mind anything but his speaking ill on me to mother I know I m for iver trying and trying to be a good wife to him an it s very dull work harder than yo think on Hester an I would ha been home for tea to night only I was afeared of baby getting wet wi t storm o hail as we had down on t shore and we sheltered under a rock It s a weary coming home to this dark place and to find my own mother set against me Take him his tea like a good lassie I ll answer for it he ll be all right A man takes it hardly when he comes in tired a thinking his wife ll be there to cheer him up a bit to find her off and niver know nought of t reason why I m glad enough I ve getten a baby said Sylvia but for aught else I wish I d niver been married I do Hush thee lass said Hester rising up indignant now that is a sin Eh if thou only knew the lot o some folk But let s talk no more on that that cannot be helped go take him his tea for it s a sad thing to think on him fasting all this time Hester s voice was raised by the simple fact of her change of position and the word fasting caught missus Robson s ear as she sate at her knitting by the chimney corner Fasting he said thou didn t care if he were full or fasting Lassie it s not right in thee I say go take him his tea at once Sylvia rose and gave up the baby which she had been suckling to Nancy who having done her washing had come for her charge to put it to bed Sylvia kissed it fondly making a little moan of sad passionate tenderness as she did so Then she took the cup of tea but she said rather defiantly to Hester I ll go to him with it because mother bids me and it ll ease her mind Then louder to her mother she added Mother I ll take him his tea though I couldn t help the being out If the act itself was conciliatory the spirit in which she was going to do it was the reverse Hester followed her slowly into the ware room with intentional delay thinking that her presence might be an obstacle to their mutually understanding one another Sylvia held the cup and plate of bread and butter out to Philip but avoided meeting his eye and said not a word of explanation or regret or self justification If she had spoken though ever so crossly Philip would have been relieved and would have preferred it to her silence He wanted to provoke her to speech but did not know how to begin Thou s been out again wandering on that sea shore said he She did not answer him I cannot think what s always taking thee there when one would ha thought a walk up to Esdale would be far more sheltered both for thee and baby in such weather as this Thou ll be having that baby ill some of these days At this she looked up at him and her lips moved as though she were going to say something Oh how he wished she would that they might come to a wholesome quarrel and a making friends again and a tender kissing in which he might whisper penitence for all his hasty words or unreasonable vexation But she had come resolved not to speak for fear of showing too much passion too much emotion Only as she was going away she turned and said Philip mother hasn t many more years to live dunnot grieve her and set her again me by finding fault wi me afore her Our being wed were a great mistake but before t poor old widow woman let us make as if we were happy Sylvie Sylvie he called after her She must have heard but she did not turn He went after her and seized her by the arm rather roughly she had stung him to the heart with her calm words which seemed to reveal a long formed conviction Sylvie said he almost fiercely what do yo mean by what you ve said Speak I will have an answer He almost shook her she was half frightened by his vehemence of behaviour which she took for pure anger while it was the outburst of agonized and unrequited love Let me go Oh Philip yo hurt me Just at this moment Hester came up Philip was ashamed of his passionate ways in her serene presence and loosened his grasp of his wife and she ran away ran into her mother s empty room as to a solitary place and there burst into that sobbing miserable crying which we instinctively know is too surely lessening the length of our days on earth to be indulged in often When she had exhausted that first burst and lay weak and quiet for a time she listened in dreading expectation of the sound of his footstep coming in search of her to make friends But he was detained below on business and never came Instead her mother came clambering up the stairs she was now in the habit of going to bed between seven and eight and to night she was retiring at even an earlier hour Sylvia sprang up and drew down the window blind and made her face and manner as composed as possible in order to soothe and comfort her mother s last waking hours She helped her to bed with gentle patience the restraint imposed upon her by her tender filial love was good for her though all the time she was longing to be alone to have another wild outburst When her mother was going off to sleep Sylvia went to look at her baby also in a soft sleep Then she gazed out at the evening sky high above the tiled roofs of the opposite houses and the longing to be out under the peaceful heavens took possession of her once more It s my only comfort said she to herself and there s no earthly harm in it I would ha been at home to his tea if I could but when he doesn t want me and mother doesn t want me and baby is either in my arms or asleep why I ll go any cry my fill out under yon great quiet sky I cannot stay in t house to be choked up wi my tears nor yet to have him coming about me either for scolding or peace making So she put on her things and went out again this time along the High Street and up the long flights of steps towards the parish church and there she stood and thought that here she had first met Kinraid at Darley s burying and she tried to recall the very look of all the sad earnest faces round the open grave the whole scene in fact and let herself give way to the miserable regrets she had so often tried to control Then she walked on crying bitterly almost unawares to herself on through the high bleak fields at the summit of the cliffs fields bounded by loose stone fences and far from all sight of the habitation of man But below the sea rose and raged it was high water at the highest tide and the wind blew gustily from the land vainly combating the great waves that came invincibly up with a roar and an impotent furious dash against the base of the cliffs below Sylvia heard the sound of the passionate rush and rebound of many waters like the shock of mighty guns whenever the other sound of the blustering gusty wind was lulled for an instant She was more quieted by this tempest of the elements than she would have been had all nature seemed as still as she had imagined it to be while she was yet in doors and only saw a part of the serene sky She fixed on a certain point in her own mind which she would reach and then turn back again It was where the outline of the land curved inwards dipping into a little bay Here the field path she had hitherto followed descended somewhat abruptly to a cluster of fishermen s cottages hardly large enough to be called a village and then the narrow roadway wound up the rising ground till it again reached the summit of the cliffs that stretched along the coast for many and many a mile Sylvia said to herself that she would turn homewards when she came within sight of this cove Headlington Cove they called it All the way along she had met no one since she had left the town but just as she had got over the last stile or ladder of stepping stones into the field from which the path descended she came upon a number of people quite a crowd in fact men moving forward in a steady line hauling at a rope a chain or something of that kind boys children and women holding babies in their arms as if all were fain to come out and partake in some general interest They kept within a certain distance from the edge of the cliff and Sylvia advancing a little now saw the reason why The great cable the men held was attached to some part of a smack which could now be seen by her in the waters below half dismantled and all but a wreck yet with her deck covered with living men as far as the waning light would allow her to see The vessel strained to get free of the strong guiding cable the tide was turning the wind was blowing off shore and Sylvia knew without being told that almost parallel to this was a line of sunken rocks that had been fatal to many a ship before now if she had tried to take the inner channel instead of keeping out to sea for miles and then steering in straight for Monkshaven port And the ships that had been thus lost had been in good plight and order compared to this vessel which seemed nothing but a hull without mast or sail By this time the crowd the fishermen from the hamlet down below with their wives and children all had come but the bedridden had reached the place where Sylvia stood The women in a state of wild excitement rushed on encouraging their husbands and sons by words even while they hindered them by actions and from time to time one of them would run to the edge of the cliff and shout out some brave words of hope in her shrill voice to the crew on the deck below Whether these latter heard it or not no one could tell but it seemed as if all human voice must be lost in the tempestuous stun and tumult of wind and wave It was generally a woman with a child in her arms who so employed herself As the strain upon the cable became greater and the ground on which they strove more uneven every hand was needed to hold and push and all those women who were unencumbered held by the dear rope on which so many lives were depending On they came a long line of human beings black against the ruddy sunset sky As they came near Sylvia a woman cried out Dunnot stand idle lass but houd on wi us there s many a bonny life at stake and many a mother s heart a hangin on this bit o hemp Tak houd lass and give a firm grip and God remember thee i thy need Sylvia needed no second word a place was made for her and in an instant more the rope was pulling against her hands till it seemed as though she was holding fire in her bare palms Never a one of them thought of letting go for an instant though when all was over many of their hands were raw and bleeding Some strong experienced fishermen passed a word along the line from time to time giving directions as to how it should be held according to varying occasions but few among the rest had breath or strength enough to speak The women and children that accompanied them ran on before breaking down the loose stone fences so as to obviate delay or hindrance they talked continually exhorting encouraging explaining From their many words and fragmentary sentences Sylvia learnt that the vessel was supposed to be a Newcastle smack sailing from London that had taken the dangerous inner channel to save time and had been caught in the storm which she was too crazy to withstand and that if by some daring contrivance of the fishermen who had first seen her the cable had not been got ashore she would have been cast upon the rocks before this and all on board perished It were dayleet then quoth one woman a could see their faces they were so near They were as pale as dead men an one was prayin down on his knees There was a king s officer aboard for I saw t gowd about him He d maybe come from these hom ard parts and be comin to see his own folk else it s no common for king s officers to sail in aught but king s ships Eh but it s gettin dark See there s t leeghts in t houses in t New Town T grass is crispin wi t white frost under out feet It ll be a hard tug round t point and then she ll be gettin into still waters One more great push and mighty strain and the danger was past the vessel or what remained of her was in the harbour among the lights and cheerful sounds of safety The fishermen sprang down the cliff to the quay side anxious to see the men whose lives they had saved the women weary and over excited began to cry Not Sylvia however her fount of tears had been exhausted earlier in the day her principal feeling was of gladness and high rejoicing that they were saved who had been so near to death not half an hour before She would have liked to have seen the men and shaken hands with them all round But instead she must go home and well would it be with her if she was in time for her husband s supper and escaped any notice of her absence So she separated herself from the groups of women who sate on the grass in the churchyard awaiting the return of such of their husbands as could resist the fascinations of the Monkshaven public houses As Sylvia went down the church steps she came upon one of the fishermen who had helped to tow the vessel into port There was seventeen men and boys aboard her and a navy lieutenant as had comed as passenger It were a good job as we could manage her Good neet to thee thou ll sleep all t sounder for havin lent a hand The street air felt hot and close after the sharp keen atmosphere of the heights above the decent shops and houses had all their shutters put up and were preparing for their early bed time Already lights shone here and there in the upper chambers and Sylvia scarcely met any one She went round up the passage from the quay side and in by the private door All was still the basins of bread and milk that she and her husband were in the habit of having for supper stood in the fender before the fire each with a plate upon them Nancy had gone to bed Phoebe dozed in the kitchen Philip was still in the ware room arranging goods and taking stock along with Coulson for Hester had gone home to her mother Sylvia was not willing to go and seek out Philip after the manner in which they had parted All the despondency of her life became present to her again as she sate down within her home She had forgotten it in her interest and excitement but now it came back again Still she was hungry and youthful and tired She took her basin up and was eating her supper when she heard a cry of her baby upstairs and ran away to attend to it When it had been fed and hushed away to sleep she went in to see her mother attracted by some unusual noise in her room She found missus Robson awake and restless and ailing dwelling much on what Philip had said in his anger against Sylvia It was really necessary for her daughter to remain with her so Sylvia stole out and went quickly down stairs to Philip now sitting tired and worn out and eating his supper with little or no appetite and told him she meant to pass the night with her mother His answer of acquiescence was so short and careless or so it seemed to her that she did not tell him any more of what she had done or seen that evening or even dwell upon any details of her mother s indisposition As soon as she had left the room Philip set down his half finished basin of bread and milk and sate long his face hidden in his folded arms The wick of the candle grew long and black and fell and sputtered and guttered he sate on unheeding either it or the pale gray fire that was dying out dead at last CHAPTER XXXIII AN APPARITION missus Robson was very poorly all night long Uneasy thoughts seemed to haunt and perplex her brain and she neither slept nor woke but was restless and uneasy in her talk and movements Sylvia lay down by her but got so little sleep that at length she preferred sitting in the easy chair by the bedside Here she dropped off to slumber in spite of herself the scene of the evening before seemed to be repeated the cries of the many people the heavy roar and dash of the threatening waves were repeated in her ears and something was said to her through all the conflicting noises what it was she could not catch though she strained to hear the hoarse murmur that in her dream she believed to convey a meaning of the utmost importance to her This dream that mysterious only half intelligible sound recurred whenever she dozed and her inability to hear the words uttered distressed her so much that at length she sate bolt upright resolved to sleep no more Her mother was talking in a half conscious way Philip s speech of the evening before was evidently running in her mind Sylvie if thou re not a good wife to him it ll just break my heart outright A woman should obey her husband and not go her own gait I never leave the house wi out telling father and getting his leave And then she began to cry pitifully and to say unconnected things till Sylvia to soothe her took her hand and promised never to leave the house without asking her husband s permission though in making this promise she felt as if she were sacrificing her last pleasure to her mother s wish for she knew well enough that Philip would always raise objections to the rambles which reminded her of her old free open air life But to comfort and cherish her mother she would have done anything yet this very morning that was dawning she must go and ask his permission for a simple errand or break her word She knew from experience that nothing quieted her mother so well as balm tea it might be that the herb really possessed some sedative power it might be only early faith and often repeated experience but it had always had a tranquillizing effect and more than once during the restless hours of the night missus Robson had asked for it but Sylvia s stock of last year s dead leaves was exhausted Still she knew where a plant of balm grew in the sheltered corner of Haytersbank Farm garden she knew that the tenants who had succeeded them in the occupation of the farm had had to leave it in consequence of a death and that the place was unoccupied and in the darkness she had planned that if she could leave her mother after the dawn came and she had attended to her baby she would walk quickly to the old garden and gather the tender sprigs which she was sure to find there Now she must go and ask Philip and till she held her baby to her breast she bitterly wished that she were free from the duties and chains of matrimony But the touch of its waxen fingers the hold of its little mouth made her relax into docility and gentleness She gave it back to Nancy to be dressed and softly opened the door of Philip s bed room Philip said she gently Philip He started up from dreams of her of her angry He saw her there rather pale with her night s watch and anxiety but looking meek and a little beseeching Mother has had such a bad night she fancied once as some balm tea would do her good it allays used to but my dried balm is all gone and I thought there d be sure to be some in t old garden at Haytersbank Feyther planted a bush just for mother wheere it allays came up early nigh t old elder tree and if yo d not mind I could run theere while she sleeps and be back again in an hour and it s not seven now Thou s not wear thyself out with running Sylvie said Philip eagerly I ll get up and go myself or perhaps continued he catching the shadow that was coming over her face thou d rather go thyself it s only that I m so afraid of thy tiring thyself It ll not tire me said Sylvia Afore I was married I was out often far farther than that afield to fetch up t kine before my breakfast Well go if thou will said Philip But get somewhat to eat first and don t hurry there s no need for that She had got her hat and shawl and was off before he had finished his last words The long High Street was almost empty of people at that early hour one side was entirely covered by the cool morning shadow which lay on the pavement and crept up the opposite houses till only the topmost story caught the rosy sunlight Up the hill road through the gap in the stone wall across the dewy fields Sylvia went by the very shortest path she knew She had only once been at Haytersbank since her wedding day On that occasion the place had seemed strangely and dissonantly changed by the numerous children who were diverting themselves before the open door and whose playthings and clothes strewed the house place and made it one busy scene of confusion and untidiness more like the Corneys kitchen in former times than her mother s orderly and quiet abode Those little children were fatherless now and the house was shut up awaiting the entry of some new tenant There were no shutters to shut the long low window was blinking in the rays of the morning sun the house and cow house doors were closed and no poultry wandered about the field in search of stray grains of corn or early worms It was a strange and unfamiliar silence and struck solemnly on Sylvia s mind Only a thrush in the old orchard down in the hollow out of sight whistled and gurgled with continual shrill melody Sylvia went slowly past the house and down the path leading to the wild deserted bit of garden She saw that the last tenants had had a pump sunk for them and resented the innovation as though the well she was passing could feel the insult Over it grew two hawthorn trees on the bent trunk of one of them she used to sit long ago the charm of the position being enhanced by the possible danger of falling into the well and being drowned The rusty unused chain was wound round the windlass the bucket was falling to pieces from dryness A lean cat came from some outhouse and mewed pitifully with hunger accompanying Sylvia to the garden as if glad of some human companionship yet refusing to allow itself to be touched Primroses grew in the sheltered places just as they formerly did and made the uncultivated ground seem less deserted than the garden where the last year s weeds were rotting away and cumbering the ground Sylvia forced her way through the berry bushes to the herb plot and plucked the tender leaves she had come to seek sighing a little all the time Then she retraced her steps paused softly before the house door and entered the porch and kissed the senseless wood She tried to tempt the poor gaunt cat into her arms meaning to carry it home and befriend it but it was scared by her endeavour and ran back to its home in the outhouse making a green path across the white dew of the meadow Then Sylvia began to hasten home thinking and remembering at the stile that led into the road she was brought short up Some one stood in the lane just on the other side of the gap his back was to the morning sun all she saw at first was the uniform of a naval officer so well known in Monkshaven in those days Sylvia went hurrying past him not looking again although her clothes almost brushed his as he stood there still She had not gone a yard no not half a yard when her heart leaped up and fell again dead within her as if she had been shot Sylvia he said in a voice tremulous with joy and passionate love Sylvia She looked round he had turned a little so that the light fell straight on his face It was bronzed and the lines were strengthened but it was the same face she had last seen in Haytersbank Gully three long years ago and had never thought to see in life again He was close to her and held out his fond arms she went fluttering towards their embrace as if drawn by the old fascination but when she felt them close round her she started away and cried out with a great pitiful shriek and put her hands up to her forehead as if trying to clear away some bewildering mist Then she looked at him once more a terrible story in her eyes if he could but have read it Twice she opened her stiff lips to speak and twice the words were overwhelmed by the surges of her misery which bore them back into the depths of her heart He thought that he had come upon her too suddenly and he attempted to soothe her with soft murmurs of love and to woo her to his outstretched hungry arms once more But when she saw this motion of his she made a gesture as though pushing him away and with an inarticulate moan of agony she put her hands to her head once more and turning away began to run blindly towards the town for protection For a minute or so he was stunned with surprise at her behaviour and then he thought it accounted for by the shock of his accost and that she needed time to understand the unexpected joy So he followed her swiftly ever keeping her in view but not trying to overtake her too speedily I have frightened my poor love he kept thinking And by this thought he tried to repress his impatience and check the speed he longed to use yet he was always so near behind that her quickened sense heard his well known footsteps following and a mad notion flashed across her brain that she would go to the wide full river and end the hopeless misery she felt enshrouding her There was a sure hiding place from all human reproach and heavy mortal woe beneath the rushing waters borne landwards by the morning tide No one can tell what changed her course perhaps the thought of her sucking child perhaps her mother perhaps an angel of God no one on earth knows but as she ran along the quay side she all at once turned up an entry and through an open door He following all the time came into a quiet dark parlour with a cloth and tea things on the table ready for breakfast the change from the bright sunny air out of doors to the deep shadow of this room made him think for the first moment that she had passed on and that no one was there and he stood for an instant baffled and hearing no sound but the beating of his own heart but an irrepressible sobbing gasp made him look round and there he saw her cowered behind the door her face covered tight up and sharp shudders going through her whole frame My love my darling said he going up to her and trying to raise her and to loosen her hands away from her face I ve been too sudden for thee it was thoughtless in me but I have so looked forward to this time and seeing thee come along the field and go past me but I should ha been more tender and careful of thee Nay let me have another look of thy sweet face All this he whispered in the old tones of manoeuvring love in that voice she had yearned and hungered to hear in life and had not heard for all her longing save in her dreams She tried to crouch more and more into the corner into the hidden shadow to sink into the ground out of sight Once more he spoke beseeching her to lift up her face to let him hear her speak But she only moaned Sylvia said he thinking he could change his tactics and pique her into speaking that he would make a pretence of suspicion and offence Sylvia one would think you weren t glad to see me back again at length I only came in late last night and my first thought on wakening was of you it has been ever since I left you Sylvia took her hands away from her face it was gray as the face of death her awful eyes were passionless in her despair Where have yo been she asked in slow hoarse tones as if her voice were half strangled within her Been said he a red light coming into his eyes as he bent his looks upon her now indeed a true and not an assumed suspicion entering his mind Been he repeated then coming a step nearer to her and taking her hand not tenderly this time but with a resolution to be satisfied Did not your cousin Hepburn I mean did not he tell you he saw the press gang seize me I gave him a message to you I bade you keep true to me as I would be to you Between every clause of this speech he paused and gasped for her answer but none came Her eyes dilated and held his steady gaze prisoner as with a magical charm neither could look away from the other s wild searching gaze When he had ended she was silent for a moment then she cried out shrill and fierce Philip No answer Wilder and shriller still Philip she cried He was in the distant ware room completing the last night s work before the regular shop hours began before breakfast also that his wife might not find him waiting and impatient He heard her cry it cut through doors and still air and great bales of woollen stuff he thought that she had hurt herself that her mother was worse that her baby was ill and he hastened to the spot whence the cry proceeded On opening the door that separated the shop from the sitting room he saw the back of a naval officer and his wife on the ground huddled up in a heap when she perceived him come in she dragged herself up by means of a chair groping like a blind person and came and stood facing him The officer turned fiercely round and would have come towards Philip who was so bewildered by the scene that even yet he did not understand who the stranger was did not perceive for an instant that he saw the realization of his greatest dread But Sylvia laid her hand on Kinraid s arm and assumed to herself the right of speech Philip did not know her voice it was so changed Philip she said this is Kinraid come back again to wed me He is alive he has niver been dead only taken by t press gang And he says yo saw it and knew it all t time Speak was it so Philip knew not what to say whither to turn under what refuge of words or acts to shelter Sylvia s influence was keeping Kinraid silent but he was rapidly passing beyond it Speak he cried loosening himself from Sylvia s light grasp and coming towards Philip with a threatening gesture Did I not bid you tell her how it was Did I not bid you say how I would be faithful to her and she was to be faithful to me Oh you damned scoundrel have you kept it from her all that time and let her think me dead or false Take that His closed fist was up to strike the man who hung his head with bitterest shame and miserable self reproach but Sylvia came swift between the blow and its victim Charley thou shan t strike him she said He is a damned scoundrel this was said in the hardest quietest tone but he is my husband Oh thou false heart exclaimed Kinraid turning sharp on her If ever I trusted woman I trusted you Sylvia Robson He made as though throwing her from him with a gesture of contempt that stung her to life Oh Charley she cried springing to him dunnot cut me to the quick have pity on me though he had none I did so love thee it was my very heart strings as gave way when they told me thou was drowned feyther and th Corneys and all iverybody Thy hat and t bit o ribbon I gave thee were found drenched and dripping wi sea water and I went mourning for thee all the day long dunnot turn away from me only hearken this once and then kill me dead and I ll bless yo and have niver been mysel since niver ceased to feel t sun grow dark and th air chill and dreary when I thought on t time when thou was alive I did my Charley my own love And I thought thou was dead for iver and I wished I were lying beside thee Oh Charley Philip theere where he stands could tell yo this was true Philip wasn t it so Would God I were dead moaned forth the unhappy guilty man But she had turned to Kinraid and was speaking again to him and neither of them heard or heeded him they were drawing closer and closer together she with her cheeks and eyes aflame talking eagerly And feyther was taken up and all for setting some free as t press gang had gotten by a foul trick and he were put i York prison and tried and hung hung Charley good kind feyther was hung on a gallows and mother lost her sense and grew silly in grief and we were like to be turned out on t wide world and poor mother dateless and I thought yo were dead oh I thought yo were dead I did oh Charley Charley By this time they were in each other s arms she with her head on his shoulder crying as if her heart would break Philip came forwards and took hold of her to pull her away but Charley held her tight mutely defying Philip Unconsciously she was Philip s protection in that hour of danger from a blow which might have been his death if strong will could have aided it to kill Sylvie said he grasping her tight Listen to me He didn t love yo as I did He had loved other women I yo yo alone He loved other girls before yo and had left off loving em I I wish God would free my heart from the pang but it will go on till I die whether yo love me or not And then where was I Oh that very night that he was taken I was a thinking on yo and on him and I might ha given yo his message but I heard them speaking of him as knew him well talking of his false fickle ways How was I to know he would keep true to thee It might be a sin in me I cannot say my heart and my sense are gone dead within me I know this I ve loved yo as no man but me ever loved before Have some pity and forgiveness on me if it s only because I ve been so tormented with my love He looked at her with feverish eager wistfulness it faded away into despair as she made no sign of having even heard his words He let go his hold of her and his arm fell loosely by his side I may die he said for my life is ended Sylvia spoke out Kinraid bold and fervent your marriage is no marriage You were tricked into it You are my wife not his I am your husband we plighted each other our troth See here is my half of the sixpence He pulled it out from his bosom tied by a black ribbon round his neck When they stripped me and searched me in th French prison I managed to keep this No lies can break the oath we swore to each other I can get your pretence of a marriage set aside I m in favour with my admiral and he ll do a deal for me and back me out Come with me your marriage shall be set aside and we ll be married again all square and above board Come away Leave that damned fellow to repent of the trick he played an honest sailor we ll be true whatever has come and gone Come Sylvia His arm was round her waist and he was drawing her towards the door his face all crimson with eagerness and hope Just then the baby cried Hark said she starting away from Kinraid baby s crying for me His child yes it is his child I d forgotten that forgotten all I ll make my vow now lest I lose mysel again I ll never forgive yon man nor live with him as his wife again All that s done and ended He s spoilt my life he s spoilt it for as long as iver I live on this earth but neither yo nor him shall spoil my soul It goes hard wi me Charley it does indeed I ll just give yo one kiss one little kiss and then so help me God I ll niver see nor hear till no not that not that is needed I ll niver see sure that s enough I ll never see yo again on this side heaven so help me God I m bound and tied but I ve sworn my oath to him as well as yo there s things I will do and there s things I won t Kiss me once more God help me he s gone CHAPTER XXXIV A RECKLESS RECRUIT She lay across a chair her arms helplessly stretched out her face unseen Every now and then a thrill ran through her body she was talking to herself all the time with incessant low incontinence of words Philip stood near her motionless he did not know whether she was conscious of his presence in fact he knew nothing but that he and she were sundered for ever he could only take in that one idea and it numbed all other thought Once more her baby cried for the comfort she alone could give She rose to her feet but staggered when she tried to walk her glazed eyes fell upon Philip as he instinctively made a step to hold her steady No light came into her eyes any more than if she had looked upon a perfect stranger not even was there the contraction of dislike Some other figure filled her mind and she saw him no more than she saw the inanimate table That way of looking at him withered him up more than any sign of aversion would have done He watched her laboriously climb the stairs and vanish out of sight and sat down with a sudden feeling of extreme bodily weakness The door of communication between the parlour and the shop was opened That was the first event of which Philip took note but Phoebe had come in unawares to him with the intention of removing the breakfast things on her return from market and seeing them unused and knowing that Sylvia had sate up all night with her mother she had gone back to the kitchen Philip had neither seen nor heard her Now Coulson came in amazed at Hepburn s non appearance in the shop Why Philip what s ado How ill yo look man exclaimed he thoroughly alarmed by Philip s ghastly appearance What s the matter I said Philip slowly gathering his thoughts Why should there be anything the matter His instinct quicker to act than his reason made him shrink from his misery being noticed much more made any subject for explanation or sympathy There may be nothing the matter wi thee said Coulson but thou s the look of a corpse on thy face I was afeared something was wrong for it s half past nine and thee so punctual He almost guarded Philip into the shop and kept furtively watching him and perplexing himself with Philip s odd strange ways Hester too observed the heavy broken down expression on Philip s ashen face and her heart ached for him but after that first glance which told her so much she avoided all appearance of noticing or watching Only a shadow brooded over her sweet calm face and once or twice she sighed to herself It was market day and people came in and out bringing their store of gossip from the country or the town from the farm or the quay side Among the pieces of news the rescue of the smack the night before furnished a large topic and by and by Philip heard a name that startled him into attention The landlady of a small public house much frequented by sailors was talking to Coulson There was a sailor aboard of her as knowed Kinraid by sight in Shields years ago and he called him by his name afore they were well out o t river And Kinraid was no ways set up for all his lieutenant s uniform and eh but they say he looks handsome in it but he tells m all about it how he was pressed aboard a man o war an for his good conduct were made a warrant officer boatswain or something All the people in the shop were listening now Philip alone seemed engrossed in folding up a piece of cloth so as to leave no possible chance of creases in it yet he lost not a syllable of the good woman s narration She pleased with the enlarged audience her tale had attracted went on with fresh vigour An there s a gallant captain one Sir Sidney Smith and he d a notion o goin smack into a French port an carryin off a vessel from right under their very noses an says he Which of yo British sailors ll go along with me to death or glory So Kinraid stands up like a man an I ll go with yo captain he says So they an some others as brave went off an did their work an choose whativer it was they did it famously but they got caught by them French an were clapped into prison i France for iver so long but at last one Philip Philip somethin he were a Frenchman I know helped em to escape in a fishin boat But they were welcomed by th whole British squadron as was i t Channel for t piece of daring they d done i cuttin out t ship from a French port an Captain Sir Sidney Smith was made an admiral an him as we used t call Charley Kinraid the specksioneer is made a lieutenant an a commissioned officer i t King s service and is come to great glory and slep in my house this very blessed night as is just past A murmur of applause and interest and rejoicing buzzed all around Philip All this was publicly known about Kinraid and how much more All Monkshaven might hear tomorrow nay to day of Philip s treachery to the hero of the hour how he had concealed his fate and supplanted him in his love Philip shrank from the burst of popular indignation which he knew must follow Any wrong done to one who stands on the pinnacle of the people s favour is resented by each individual as a personal injury and among a primitive set of country folk who recognize the wild passion in love as it exists untamed by the trammels of reason and self restraint any story of baulked affections or treachery in such matters spreads like wildfire Philip knew this quite well his doom of disgrace lay plain before him if only Kinraid spoke the word His head was bent down while he thus listened and reflected He half resolved on doing something he lifted up his head caught the reflection of his face in the little strip of glass on the opposite side in which the women might look at themselves in their contemplated purchases and quite resolved The sight he saw in the mirror was his own long sad pale face made plainer and grayer by the heavy pressure of the morning s events He saw his stooping figure his rounded shoulders with something like a feeling of disgust at his personal appearance as he remembered the square upright build of Kinraid his fine uniform with epaulette and sword belt his handsome brown face his dark eyes splendid with the fire of passion and indignation his white teeth gleaming out with the terrible smile of scorn The comparison drove Philip from passive hopelessness to active despair He went abruptly from the crowded shop into the empty parlour and on into the kitchen where he took up a piece of bread and heedless of Phoebe s look and words began to eat it before he even left the place for he needed the strength that food would give he needed it to carry him out of the sight and the knowledge of all who might hear what he had done and point their fingers at him He paused a moment in the parlour and then setting his teeth tight together he went upstairs First of all he went into the bit of a room opening out of theirs in which his baby slept He dearly loved the child and many a time would run in and play a while with it and in such gambols he and Sylvia had passed their happiest moments of wedded life The little Bella was having her morning slumber Nancy used to tell long afterwards how he knelt down by the side of her cot and was so strange she thought he must have prayed for all it was nigh upon eleven o clock and folk in their senses only said their prayers when they got up and when they went to bed Then he rose and stooped over and gave the child a long lingering soft fond kiss And on tip toe he passed away into the room where his aunt lay his aunt who had been so true a friend to him He was thankful to know that in her present state she was safe from the knowledge of what was past safe from the sound of the shame to come He had not meant to see Sylvia again he dreaded the look of her hatred her scorn but there outside her mother s bed she lay apparently asleep missus Robson too was sleeping her face towards the wall Philip could not help it he went to have one last look at his wife She was turned towards her mother her face averted from him he could see the tear stains the swollen eyelids the lips yet quivering he stooped down and bent to kiss the little hand that lay listless by her side As his hot breath neared that hand it was twitched away and a shiver ran through the whole prostrate body And then he knew that she was not asleep only worn out by her misery misery that he had caused He sighed heavily but he went away down stairs and away for ever Only as he entered the parlour his eyes caught on two silhouettes one of himself one of Sylvia done in the first month of their marriage by some wandering artist if so he could be called They were hanging against the wall in little oval wooden frames black profiles with the lights done in gold about as poor semblances of humanity as could be conceived but Philip went up and after looking for a minute or so at Sylvia s he took it down and buttoned his waistcoat over it It was the only thing he took away from his home He went down the entry on to the quay The river was there and waters they say have a luring power and a weird promise of rest in their perpetual monotony of sound But many people were there if such a temptation presented itself to Philip s mind the sight of his fellow townsmen perhaps of his acquaintances drove him up another entry the town is burrowed with such back into the High Street which he straightway crossed into a well known court out of which rough steps led to the summit of the hill and on to the fells and moors beyond He plunged and panted up this rough ascent From the top he could look down on the whole town lying below severed by the bright shining river into two parts To the right lay the sea shimmering and heaving there were the cluster of masts rising out of the little port the irregular roofs of the houses which of them thought he as he carried his eye along the quay side to the market place which of them was his and he singled it out in its unfamiliar aspect and saw the thin blue smoke rising from the kitchen chimney where even now Phoebe was cooking the household meal that he never more must share Up at that thought and away he knew not nor cared not whither He went through the ploughed fields where the corn was newly springing he came down upon the vast sunny sea and turned his back upon it with loathing he made his way inland to the high green pastures the short upland turf above which the larks hung poised at heaven s gate He strode along so straight and heedless of briar and bush that the wild black cattle ceased from grazing and looked after him with their great blank puzzled eyes He had passed all enclosures and stone fences now and was fairly on the desolate brown moors through the withered last year s ling and fern through the prickly gorse he tramped crushing down the tender shoots of this year s growth and heedless of the startled plover s cry goaded by the furies His only relief from thought from the remembrance of Sylvia s looks and words was in violent bodily action So he went on till evening shadows and ruddy evening lights came out upon the wild fells He had crossed roads and lanes with a bitter avoidance of men s tracks but now the strong instinct of self preservation came out and his aching limbs his weary heart giving great pants and beats for a time and then ceasing altogether till a mist swam and quivered before his aching eyes warned him that he must find some shelter and food or lie down to die He fell down now often stumbling over the slightest obstacle He had passed the cattle pastures he was among the black faced sheep and they too ceased nibbling and looked after him and somehow in his poor wandering imagination their silly faces turned to likenesses of Monkshaven people people who ought to be far far away Thou ll be belated on these fells if thou doesn t tak heed shouted some one Philip looked abroad to see whence the voice proceeded An old stiff legged shepherd in a smock frock was within a couple of hundred yards Philip did not answer but staggered and stumbled towards him Good lork said the man wheere hast ta been Thou s seen Oud Harry I think thou looks so scared Philip rallied himself and tried to speak up to the old standard of respectability but the effort was pitiful to see had any one been by who could have understood the pain it caused to restrain cries of bodily and mental agony I ve lost my way that s all Twould ha been enough too I m thinkin if I hadn t come out after t ewes There s t Three Griffins near at hand a sup o Hollands ll set thee to reeghts Philip followed faintly He could not see before him and was guided by the sound of footsteps rather than by the sight of the figure moving onwards He kept stumbling and he knew that the old shepherd swore at him but he also knew such curses proceeded from no ill will only from annoyance at the delay in going and seem after t ewes But had the man s words conveyed the utmost expression of hatred Philip would neither have wondered at them nor resented them They came into a wild mountain road unfenced from the fells A hundred yards off and there was a small public house with a broad ruddy oblong of firelight shining across the tract Theere said the old man Thee cannot well miss that A dunno tho thee bees sich a gawby So he went on and delivered Philip safely up to the landlord Here s a felly as a fund on t fell side just as one as if he were drunk but he s sober enough a reckon only summat s wrong i his head a m thinkin No said Philip sitting down on the first chair he came to I m right enough just fairly wearied out lost my way and he fainted There was a recruiting sergeant of marines sitting in the house place drinking He too like Philip had lost his way but was turning his blunder to account by telling all manner of wonderful stories to two or three rustics who had come in ready to drink on any pretence especially if they could get good liquor without paying for it The sergeant rose as Philip fell back and brought up his own mug of beer into which a noggin of gin had been put called in Yorkshire dog s nose He partly poured and partly spilt some of this beverage on Philip s face some drops went through the pale and parted lips and with a start the worn out man revived Bring him some victual landlord called out the recruiting sergeant I ll stand shot They brought some cold bacon and coarse oat cake The sergeant asked for pepper and salt minced the food fine and made it savoury and kept administering it by teaspoonfuls urging Philip to drink from time to time from his own cup of dog s nose A burning thirst which needed no stimulant from either pepper or salt took possession of Philip and he drank freely scarcely recognizing what he drank It took effect on one so habitually sober and he was soon in that state when the imagination works wildly and freely He saw the sergeant before him handsome and bright and active in his gay red uniform without a care as it seemed to Philip taking life lightly admired and respected everywhere because of his cloth If Philip were gay and brisk well dressed like him returning with martial glory to Monkshaven would not Sylvia love him once more Could not he win her heart He was brave by nature and the prospect of danger did not daunt him if ever it presented itself to his imagination He thought he was cautious in entering on the subject of enlistment with his new friend the sergeant but the latter was twenty times as cunning as he and knew by experience how to bait his hook Philip was older by some years than the regulation age but at that time of great demand for men the question of age was lightly entertained The sergeant was profuse in statements of the advantages presented to a man of education in his branch of the service how such a one was sure to rise in fact it would have seemed from the sergeant s account as though the difficulty consisted in remaining in the ranks Philip s dizzy head thought the subject over and over again each time with failing power of reason At length almost as it would seem by some sleight of hand he found the fatal shilling in his palm and had promised to go before the nearest magistrate to be sworn in as one of his Majesty s marines the next morning And after that he remembered nothing more He wakened up in a little truckle bed in the same room as the sergeant who lay sleeping the sleep of full contentment while gradually drop by drop the bitter recollections of the day before came filling up Philip s cup of agony He knew that he had received the bounty money and though he was aware that he had been partly tricked into it and had no hope no care indeed for any of the advantages so liberally promised him the night before yet he was resigned with utterly despondent passiveness to the fate to which he had pledged himself Anything was welcome that severed him from his former life that could make him forget it if that were possible and also welcome anything which increased the chances of death without the sinfulness of his own participation in the act He found in the dark recess of his mind the dead body of his fancy of the previous night that he might come home handsome and glorious to win the love that had never been his But he only sighed over it and put it aside out of his sight so full of despair was he He could eat no breakfast though the sergeant ordered of the best The latter kept watching his new recruit out of the corner of his eye expecting a remonstrance or dreading a sudden bolt But Philip walked with him the two or three miles in the most submissive silence never uttering a syllable of regret or repentance and before Justice Cholmley of Holm Fell Hall he was sworn into his Majesty s service under the name of Stephen Freeman With a new name he began a new life Alas the old life lives for ever CHAPTER XXXV THINGS UNUTTERABLE After Philip had passed out of the room Sylvia lay perfectly still from very exhaustion Her mother slept on happily unconscious of all the turmoil that had taken place yes happily though the heavy sleep was to end in death But of this her daughter knew nothing imagining that it was refreshing slumber instead of an ebbing of life Both mother and daughter lay motionless till Phoebe entered the room to tell Sylvia that dinner was on the table Then Sylvia sate up and put back her hair bewildered and uncertain as to what was to be done next how she should meet the husband to whom she had discarded all allegiance repudiated the solemn promise of love and obedience which she had vowed Phoebe came into the room with natural interest in the invalid scarcely older than herself How is t old lady asked she in a low voice Sylvia turned her head round to look her mother had never moved but was breathing in a loud uncomfortable manner that made her stoop over her to see the averted face more nearly Phoebe she cried come here She looks strange and odd her eyes are open but don t see me Phoebe Phoebe Sure enough she s in a bad way said Phoebe climbing stiffly on to the bed to have a nearer view Hold her head a little up t ease her breathin while I go for master he ll be for sendin for t doctor I ll be bound Sylvia took her mother s head and laid it fondly on her breast speaking to her and trying to rouse her but it was of no avail the hard stertorous breathing grew worse and worse Sylvia cried out for help Nancy came the baby in her arms They had been in several times before that morning and the child came smiling and crowing at its mother who was supporting her own dying parent Oh Nancy said Sylvia what is the matter with mother yo can see her face tell me quick Nancy set the baby on the bed for all reply and ran out of the room crying out Master master Come quick T old missus is a dying This appeared to be no news to Sylvia and yet the words came on her with a great shock but for all that she could not cry she was surprised herself at her own deadness of feeling Her baby crawled to her and she had to hold and guard both her mother and her child It seemed a long long time before any one came and then she heard muffled voices and a heavy tramp it was Phoebe leading the doctor upstairs and Nancy creeping in behind to hear his opinion He did not ask many questions and Phoebe replied more frequently to his inquiries than did Sylvia who looked into his face with a blank tearless speechless despair that gave him more pain than the sight of her dying mother The long decay of missus Robson s faculties and health of which he was well aware had in a certain manner prepared him for some such sudden termination of the life whose duration was hardly desirable although he gave several directions as to her treatment but the white pinched face the great dilated eye the slow comprehension of the younger woman struck him with alarm and he went on asking for various particulars more with a view of rousing Sylvia if even it were to tears than for any other purpose that the information thus obtained could answer You had best have pillows propped up behind her it will not be for long she does not know that you are holding her and it is only tiring you to no purpose Sylvia s terrible stare continued he put his advice into action and gently tried to loosen her clasp and tender hold This she resisted laying her cheek against her poor mother s unconscious face Where is Hepburn said he He ought to be here Phoebe looked at Nancy Nancy at Phoebe It was the latter who replied He s neither i t house nor i t shop A seed him go past t kitchen window better nor an hour ago but neither William Coulson or Hester Rose knows where he s gone to doctor Morgan s lips were puckered up into a whistle but he made no sound Give me baby he said suddenly Nancy had taken her up off the bed where she had been sitting encircled by her mother s arm The nursemaid gave her to the doctor He watched the mother s eye it followed her child and he was rejoiced He gave a little pinch to the baby s soft flesh and she cried out piteously again the same action the same result Sylvia laid her mother down and stretched out her arms for her child hushing it and moaning over it So far so good said doctor Morgan to himself But where is the husband He ought to be here He went down stairs to make inquiry for Philip that poor young creature about whose health he had never felt thoroughly satisfied since the fever after her confinement was in an anxious condition and with an inevitable shock awaiting her Her husband ought to be with her and supporting her to bear it doctor Morgan went into the shop Hester alone was there Coulson had gone to his comfortable dinner at his well ordered house with his common place wife If he had felt anxious about Philip s looks and strange disappearance he had also managed to account for them in some indifferent way Hester was alone with the shop boy few people came in during the universal Monkshaven dinner hour She was resting her head on her hand and puzzled and distressed about many things all that was implied by the proceedings of the evening before between Philip and Sylvia and that was confirmed by Philip s miserable looks and strange abstracted ways to day Oh how easy Hester would have found it to make him happy not merely how easy but what happiness it would have been to her to merge her every wish into the one great object of fulfiling his will To her an on looker the course of married life which should lead to perfect happiness seemed to plain Alas it is often so and the resisting forces which make all such harmony and delight impossible are not recognized by the bystanders hardly by the actors But if these resisting forces are only superficial or constitutional they are but the necessary discipline here and do not radically affect the love which will make all things right in heaven Some glimmering of this latter comforting truth shed its light on Hester s troubled thoughts from time to time But again how easy would it have been to her to tread the maze that led to Philip s happiness and how difficult it seemed to the wife he had chosen She was aroused by doctor Morgan s voice So both Coulson and Hepburn have left the shop to your care Hester I want Hepburn though his wife is in a very anxious state Where is he can you tell me Sylvia in an anxious state I ve not seen her to day but last night she looked as well as could be Ay ay but many a thing happens in four and twenty hours Her mother is dying may be dead by this time and her husband should be there with her Can t you send for him I don t know where he is said Hester He went off from here all on a sudden when there was all the market folks in t shop I thought he d maybe gone to John Foster s about th money for they was paying a deal in I ll send there and inquire No the messenger brought back word that he had not been seen at their bank all morning Further inquiries were made by the anxious Hester by the doctor by Coulson all they could learn was that Phoebe had seen him pass the kitchen window about eleven o clock when she was peeling the potatoes for dinner and two lads playing on the quay side thought they had seen him among a group of sailors but these latter as far as they could be identified had no knowledge of his appearance among them Before night the whole town was excited about his disappearance Before night Bell Robson had gone to her long home And Sylvia still lay quiet and tearless apparently more unmoved than any other creature by the events of the day and the strange vanishing of her husband The only thing she seemed to care for was her baby she held it tight in her arms and doctor Morgan bade them leave it there its touch might draw the desired tears into her weary sleepless eyes and charm the aching pain out of them They were afraid lest she should inquire for her husband whose non appearance at such a time of sorrow to his wife must they thought seem strange to her And night drew on while they were all in this state She had gone back to her own room without a word when they had desired her to do so caressing her child in her arms and sitting down on the first chair she came to with a heavy sigh as if even this slight bodily exertion had been too much for her They saw her eyes turn towards the door every time it was opened and they thought it was with anxious expectation of one who could not be found though many were seeking for him in all probable places When night came some one had to tell her of her husband s disappearance and doctor Morgan was the person who undertook this He came into her room about nine o clock her baby was sleeping in her arms she herself pale as death still silent and tearless though strangely watchful of gestures and sounds and probably cognizant of more than they imagined Well missus Hepburn said he as cheerfully as he could I should advise your going to bed early for I fancy your husband won t come home to night Some journey or other that perhaps Coulson can explain better than I can will most likely keep him away till to morrow It s very unfortunate that he should be away at such a sad time as this as I m sure he ll feel when he returns but we must make the best of it He watched her to see the effect of his words She sighed that was all He still remained a little while She lifted her head up a little and asked How long do yo think she was unconscious doctor Could she hear things think yo afore she fell into that strange kind o slumber I cannot tell said he shaking his head Was she breathing in that hard snoring kind of way when you left her this morning Yes I think so I cannot tell so much has happened When you came back to her after your breakfast I think you said she was in much the same position Yes and yet I may be telling yo lies if I could but think but it s my head as is aching so doctor I wish yo d go for I need being alone I m so mazed Good night then for you re a wise woman I see and mean to go to bed and have a good night with baby there But he went down to Phoebe and told her to go in from time to time and see how her mistress was He found Hester Rose and the old servant together both had been crying both were evidently in great trouble about the death and the mystery of the day Hester asked if she might go up and see Sylvia and the doctor gave his leave talking meanwhile with Phoebe over the kitchen fire Hester came down again without seeing Sylvia The door of the room was bolted and everything quiet inside Does she know where her husband is think you asked the doctor at this account of Hester s She s not anxious about him at any rate or else the shock of her mother s death has been too much for her We must hope for some change in the morning a good fit of crying or a fidget about her husband would be more natural Good night to you both and off he went Phoebe and Hester avoided looking at each other at these words Both were conscious of the probability of something having gone seriously wrong between the husband and wife Hester had the recollection of the previous night Phoebe the untasted breakfast of to day to go upon She spoke first A just wish he d come home to still folks tongues It need niver ha been known if t old lady hadn t died this day of all others It s such a thing for t shop t have one o t partners missin an no one for t know what s comed on him It niver happened i Fosters days that s a I know He ll maybe come back yet said Hester It s not so very late It were market day and a continued Phoebe just as if iverything mun go wrong together an a t country customers ll go back wi fine tale i their mouths as Measter Hepburn was strayed an missin just like a beast o some kind Hark isn t that a step said Hester suddenly as a footfall sounded in the now quiet street but it passed the door and the hope that had arisen on its approach fell as the sound died away He ll noane come to night said Phoebe who had been as eager a listener as Hester however Thou d best go thy ways home a shall stay up for it s not seemly for us a t go to our beds an a corpse in t house an Nancy as might ha watched is gone to her bed this hour past like a lazy boots as she is A can hear too if t measter does come home tho a ll be bound he wunnot choose wheere he is he ll be i bed by now for it s well on to eleven I ll let thee out by t shop door and stand by it till thou s close at home for it s ill for a young woman to be i t street so late So she held the door open and shaded the candle from the flickering outer air while Hester went to her home with a heavy heart Heavily and hopelessly did they all meet in the morning No news of Philip no change in Sylvia an unceasing flow of angling and conjecture and gossip radiating from the shop into the town Hester could have entreated Coulson on her knees to cease from repeating the details of a story of which every word touched on a raw place in her sensitive heart moreover when they talked together so eagerly she could not hear the coming footsteps on the pavement without Once some one hit very near the truth in a chance remark It seems strange she said how as one man turns up another just disappears Why it were but upo Tuesday as Kinraid come back as all his own folk had thought to be dead and next day here s Measter Hepburn as is gone no one knows wheere That s t way i this world replied Coulson a little sententiously This life is full o changes o one kind or another them that s dead is alive and as for poor Philip though he was alive he looked fitter to be dead when he came into t shop o Wednesday morning And how does she take it nodding to where Sylvia was supposed to be Oh she s not herself so to say She were just stunned by finding her mother was dying in her very arms when she thought as she were only sleeping yet she s never been able to cry a drop so that t sorrow s gone inwards on her brain and from all I can hear she doesn t rightly understand as her husband is missing T doctor says if she could but cry she d come to a juster comprehension of things And what do John and Jeremiah Foster say to it all They re down here many a time in t day to ask if he s come back or how she is for they made a deal on em both They re going t attend t funeral to morrow and have given orders as t shop is to be shut up in t morning To the surprise of every one Sylvia who had never left her room since the night of her mother s death and was supposed to be almost unconscious of all that was going on in the house declared her intention of following her mother to the grave No one could do more than remonstrate no one had sufficient authority to interfere with her doctor Morgan even thought that she might possibly be roused to tears by the occasion only he begged Hester to go with her that she might have the solace of some woman s company She went through the greater part of the ceremony in the same hard unmoved manner in which she had received everything for days past But on looking up once as they formed round the open grave she saw Kester in his Sunday clothes with a bit of new crape round his hat crying as if his heart would break over the coffin of his good kind mistress His evident distress the unexpected sight suddenly loosed the fountain of Sylvia s tears and her sobs grew so terrible that Hester feared she would not be able to remain until the end of the funeral But she struggled hard to stay till the last and then she made an effort to go round by the place where Kester stood Come and see me was all she could say for crying and Kester only nodded his head he could not speak a word CHAPTER XXXVI MYSTERIOUS TIDINGS That very evening Kester came humbly knocking at the kitchen door Phoebe opened it He asked to see Sylvia A know not if she ll see thee said Phoebe There s no makin her out sometimes she s for one thing sometimes she s for another She bid me come and see her said Kester Only this mornin at missus buryin she telled me to come So Phoebe went off to inform Sylvia that Kester was there and returned with the desire that he would walk into the parlour An instant after he was gone Phoebe heard him return and carefully shut the two doors of communication between the kitchen and sitting room Sylvia was in the latter when Kester came in holding her baby close to her indeed she seldom let it go now a days to any one else making Nancy s place quite a sinecure much to Phoebe s indignation Sylvia s face was shrunk and white and thin her lovely eyes alone retained the youthful almost childlike expression She went up to Kester and shook his horny hand she herself trembling all over Don t talk to me of her she said hastily I cannot stand it It s a blessing for her to be gone but oh She began to cry and then cheered herself up and swallowed down her sobs Kester she went on hastily Charley Kinraid isn t dead dost ta know He s alive and he were here o Tuesday no Monday was it I cannot tell but he were here A knowed as he weren t dead Every one is a speaking on it But a didn t know as thee d ha seen him A took comfort i thinkin as thou d ha been wi thy mother a t time as he were i t place Then he s gone said Sylvia Gone ay days past As far as a know he but stopped a neet A thought to mysel but yo may be sure a said nought to nobody he s heerd as our Sylvia were married and has put it in his pipe and ta en hissel off to smoke it Kester said Sylvia leaning forwards and whispering I saw him He was here Philip saw him Philip had known as he wasn t dead a this time Kester stood up suddenly By goom that chap has a deal t answer for A bright red spot was on each of Sylvia s white cheeks and for a minute or so neither of them spoke Then she went on still whispering out her words Kester I m more afeared than I dare tell any one can they ha met think yo T very thought turns me sick I told Philip my mind and took a vow again him but it would be awful to think on harm happening to him through Kinraid Yet he went out that morning and has niver been seen or heard on sin and Kinraid were just fell again him and as for that matter so was I but The red spot vanished as she faced her own imagination Kester spoke It s a thing as can be easy looked into What day an time were it when Philip left this house Tuesday the day she died I saw him in her room that morning between breakfast and dinner I could a most swear to it s being close after eleven I mind counting t clock It was that very morn as Kinraid were here A ll go an have a pint o beer at t King s Arms down on t quay side it were theere he put up at An a m pretty sure as he only stopped one night and left i t morning betimes But a ll go see Do said Sylvia and go out through t shop they re all watching and watching me to see how I take things and daren t let on about t fire as is burning up my heart Coulson is i t shop but he ll not notice thee like Phoebe By and by Kester came back It seemed as though Sylvia had never stirred she looked eagerly at him but did not speak He went away i Rob Mason s mail cart him as tak s t letters to Hartlepool T lieutenant as they ca him down at t King s Arms they re as proud on his uniform as if it had been a new painted sign to swing o er their doors t lieutenant had reckoned upo stayin longer wi em but he went out betimes o Tuesday morn an came back a ruffled up an paid his bill paid for his breakfast though he touched noane on it an went off i Rob postman s mail cart as starts reg lar at ten o clock Corneys has been theere askin for him an makin a piece o work as he niver went near em and they bees cousins Niver a one among em knows as he were here as far as a could mak out Thank yo Kester said Sylvia falling back in her chair as if all the energy that had kept her stiff and upright was gone now that her anxiety was relieved She was silent for a long time her eyes shut her cheek laid on her child s head Kester spoke next A think it s pretty clear as they n niver met But it s a t more wonder where thy husband s gone to Thee and him had words about it and thou telled him thy mind thou said Yes said Sylvia not moving I m afeared lest mother knows what I said to him there where she s gone to I am the tears filled her shut eyes and came softly overflowing down her cheeks and yet it were true what I said I cannot forgive him he s just spoilt my life and I m not one and twenty yet and he knowed how wretched how very wretched I were A word fra him would ha mended it a and Charley had bid him speak the word and give me his faithful love and Philip saw my heart ache day after day and niver let on as him I was mourning for was alive and had sent me word as he d keep true to me as I were to do to him A wish a d been theere a d ha felled him to t ground said Kester clenching his stiff hard hand with indignation Sylvia was silent again pale and weary she sate her eyes still shut Then she said Yet he were so good to mother and mother loved him so Oh Kester lifting herself up opening her great wistful eyes it s well for folks as can die they re spared a deal o misery Ay said he But there s folk as one ud like to keep fra shirkin their misery Think yo now as Philip is livin Sylvia shivered all over and hesitated before she replied I dunnot know I said such things he deserved em all Well well lass said Kester sorry that he had asked the question which was producing so much emotion of one kind or another Neither thee nor me can tell we can neither help nor hinder seein as he s ta en hissel off out on our sight we d best not think on him A ll try an tell thee some news if a can think on it wi my mind so full Thou knows Haytersbank folk ha flitted and t oud place is empty Yes said Sylvia with the indifference of one wearied out with feeling A only telled yo t account like for me bein at a loose end i Monkshaven My sister her as lived at Dale End an is a widow has comed int town to live an a m lodging wi her an jobbin about A m gettin pretty well to do an a m noane far t seek an a m going now only first a just wanted for t say as a m thy oldest friend a reckon and if a can do a turn for thee or go an errand like as a ve done to day or if it s any comfort to talk a bit to one who s known thy life from a babby why yo ve only t send for me an a d come if it were twenty mile A m lodgin at Peggy Dawson s t lath and plaster cottage at t right hand o t bridge a among t new houses as they re thinkin o buildin near t sea no one can miss it He stood up and shook hands with her As he did so he looked at her sleeping baby She s liker yo than him A think a ll say God bless her With the heavy sound of his out going footsteps baby awoke She ought before this time to have been asleep in her bed and the disturbance made her cry fretfully Hush thee darling hush thee murmured her mother there s no one left to love me but thee and I cannot stand thy weeping my pretty one Hush thee my babe hush thee She whispered soft in the little one s ear as she took her upstairs to bed About three weeks after the miserable date of Bell Robson s death and Philip s disappearance Hester Rose received a letter from him She knew the writing on the address well and it made her tremble so much that it was many minutes before she dared to open it and make herself acquainted with the facts it might disclose But she need not have feared there were no facts told unless the vague date of London might be something to learn Even that much might have been found out by the post mark only she had been too much taken by surprise to examine it It ran as follows DEAR HESTER Tell those whom it may concern that I have left Monkshaven for ever No one need trouble themselves about me I am provided for Please to make my humble apologies to my kind friends the Messrs Foster and to my partner William Coulson Please to accept of my love and to join the same to your mother Please to give my particular and respectful duty and kind love to my aunt Isabella Robson Her daughter Sylvia knows what I have always felt and shall always feel for her better than I can ever put into language so I send her no message God bless and keep my child You must all look on me as one dead as I am to you and maybe shall soon be in reality Your affectionate and obedient friend to command PHILIP HEPBURN P S Oh Hester for God s sake and mine look after my wife scratched out Sylvia and my child I think Jeremiah Foster will help you to be a friend to them This is the last solemn request of P H She is but very young Hester read this letter again and again till her heart caught the echo of its hopelessness and sank within her She put it in her pocket and reflected upon it all the day long as she served in the shop The customers found her as gentle but far more inattentive than usual She thought that in the evening she would go across the bridge and consult with the two good old brothers Foster But something occurred to put off the fulfilment of this plan That same morning Sylvia had preceded her with no one to consult because consultation would have required previous confidence and confidence would have necessitated such a confession about Kinraid as it was most difficult for Sylvia to make The poor young wife yet felt that some step must be taken by her and what it was to be she could not imagine She had no home to go to for as Philip was gone away she remained where she was only on sufferance she did not know what means of livelihood she had she was willing to work nay would be thankful to take up her old life of country labour but with her baby what could she do In this dilemma the recollection of the old man s kindly speech and offer of assistance made it is true half in joke at the end of her wedding visit came into her mind and she resolved to go and ask for some of the friendly counsel and assistance then offered It would be the first time of her going out since her mother s funeral and she dreaded the effort on that account More even than on that account did she shrink from going into the streets again She could not get over the impression that Kinraid must be lingering near and she distrusted herself so much that it was a positive terror to think of meeting him again She felt as though if she but caught a sight of him the glitter of his uniform or heard his well known voice in only a distant syllable of talk her heart would stop and she should die from very fright of what would come next Or rather so she felt and so she thought before she took her baby in her arms as Nancy gave it to her after putting on its out of door attire With it in her arms she was protected and the whole current of her thoughts was changed The infant was wailing and suffering with its teething and the mother s heart was so occupied in soothing and consoling her moaning child that the dangerous quay side and the bridge were passed almost before she was aware nor did she notice the eager curiosity and respectful attention of those she met who recognized her even through the heavy veil which formed part of the draping mourning provided for her by Hester and Coulson in the first unconscious days after her mother s death Though public opinion as yet reserved its verdict upon Philip s disappearance warned possibly by Kinraid s story against hasty decisions and judgments in such times as those of war and general disturbance yet every one agreed that no more pitiful fate could have befallen Philip s wife Marked out by her striking beauty as an object of admiring interest even in those days when she sate in girlhood s smiling peace by her mother at the Market Cross her father had lost his life in a popular cause and ignominious as the manner of his death might be he was looked upon as a martyr to his zeal in avenging the wrongs of his townsmen Sylvia had married amongst them too and her quiet daily life was well known to them and now her husband had been carried off from her side just on the very day when she needed his comfort most For the general opinion was that Philip had been carried off in seaport towns such occurrences were not uncommon in those days either by land crimps or water crimps So Sylvia was treated with silent reverence as one sorely afflicted by all the unheeded people she met in her faltering walk to Jeremiah Foster s She had calculated her time so as to fall in with him at his dinner hour even though it obliged her to go to his own house rather than to the bank where he and his brother spent all the business hours of the day Sylvia was so nearly exhausted by the length of her walk and the weight of her baby that all she could do when the door was opened was to totter into the nearest seat sit down and begin to cry In an instant kind hands were about her loosening her heavy cloak offering to relieve her of her child who clung to her all the more firmly and some one was pressing a glass of wine against her lips No sir I cannot take it wine allays gives me th headache if I might have just a drink o water Thank you ma am to the respectable looking old servant I m well enough now and perhaps sir I might speak a word with yo for it s that I ve come for It s a pity Sylvia Hepburn as thee didst not come to me at the bank for it s been a long toil for thee all this way in the heat with thy child But if there s aught I can do or say for thee thou hast but to name it I am sure Martha wilt thou relieve her of her child while she comes with me into the parlour But the wilful little Bella stoutly refused to go to any one and Sylvia was not willing to part with her tired though she was So the baby was carried into the parlour and much of her after life depended on this trivial fact Once installed in the easy chair and face to face with Jeremiah Sylvia did not know how to begin Jeremiah saw this and kindly gave her time to recover herself by pulling out his great gold watch and letting the seal dangle before the child s eyes almost within reach of the child s eager little fingers She favours you a deal said he at last More than her father he went on purposely introducing Philip s name so as to break the ice for he rightly conjectured she had come to speak to him about something connected with her husband Still Sylvia said nothing she was choking down tears and shyness and unwillingness to take as confidant a man of whom she knew so little on such slight ground as she now felt it to be as the little kindly speech with which she had been dismissed from that house the last time that she entered it It s no use keeping yo sir she broke out at last It s about Philip as I comed to speak Do yo know any thing whatsomever about him He niver had a chance o saying anything I know but maybe he s written Not a line my poor young woman said Jeremiah hastily putting an end to that vain idea Then he s either dead or gone away for iver she whispered I mun be both feyther and mother to my child Oh thee must not give it up replied he Many a one is carried off to the wars or to the tenders o men o war and then they turn out to be unfit for service and are sent home Philip ll come back before the year s out thee ll see that No he ll niver come back And I m not sure as I should iver wish him t come back if I could but know what was gone wi him Yo see sir though I were sore set again him I shouldn t like harm to happen him There is something behind all this that I do not understand Can thee tell me what it is I must sir if yo re to help me wi your counsel and I came up here to ask for it Another long pause during which Jeremiah made a feint of playing with the child who danced and shouted with tantalized impatience at not being able to obtain possession of the seal and at length stretched out her soft round little arms to go to the owner of the coveted possession Surprise at this action roused Sylvia and she made some comment upon it I niver knew her t go to any one afore I hope she ll not be troublesome to yo sir The old man who had often longed for a child of his own in days gone by was highly pleased by this mark of baby s confidence and almost forgot in trying to strengthen her regard by all the winning wiles in his power how her poor mother was still lingering over some painful story which she could not bring herself to tell I m afeared of speaking wrong again any one sir And mother were so fond o Philip but he kept something from me as would ha made me a different woman and some one else happen a different man I were troth plighted wi Kinraid the specksioneer him as was cousin to th Corneys o Moss Brow and comed back lieutenant i t navy last Tuesday three weeks after ivery one had thought him dead and gone these three years She paused Well said Jeremiah with interest although his attention appeared to be divided between the mother s story and the eager playfulness of the baby on his knee Philip knew he were alive he d seen him taken by t press gang and Charley had sent a message to me by Philip Her white face was reddening her eyes flashing at this point of her story And he niver told me a word on it not when he saw me like to break my heart in thinking as Kinraid were dead he kept it a to hissel and watched me cry and niver said a word to comfort me wi t truth It would ha been a great comfort sir only t have had his message if I d niver ha been to see him again But Philip niver let on to any one as I iver heared on that he d seen Charley that morning as t press gang took him Yo know about feyther s death and how friendless mother and me was left and so I married him for he were a good friend to us then and I were dazed like wi sorrow and could see naught else to do for mother He were allays very tender and good to her for sure Again a long pause of silent recollection broken by one or two deep sighs If I go on sir now I mun ask yo to promise as yo ll niver tell I do so need some one to tell me what I ought to do and I were led here like else I would ha died wi it all within my teeth Yo ll promise sir Jeremiah Foster looked in her face and seeing the wistful eager look he was touched almost against his judgment into giving the promise required she went on Upon a Tuesday morning three weeks ago I think tho for t matter o time it might ha been three years Kinraid come home come back for t claim me as his wife and I were wed to Philip I met him i t road at first and I couldn t tell him theere He followed me into t house Philip s house sir behind t shop and somehow I told him all how I were a wedded wife to another Then he up and said I d a false heart me false sir as had eaten my daily bread in bitterness and had wept t nights through all for sorrow and mourning for his death Then he said as Philip knowed all t time he were alive and coming back for me and I couldn t believe it and I called Philip and he come and a that Charley had said were true and yet I were Philip s wife So I took a mighty oath and I said as I d niver hold Philip to be my lawful husband again nor iver forgive him for t evil he d wrought us but hold him as a stranger and one as had done me a heavy wrong She stopped speaking her story seemed to her to end there But her listener said after a pause It were a cruel wrong I grant thee that but thy oath were a sin and thy words were evil my poor lass What happened next I don t justly remember she said wearily Kinraid went away and mother cried out and I went to her She were asleep I thought so I lay down by her to wish I were dead and to think on what would come on my child if I died and Philip came in softly and I made as if I were asleep and that s t very last as I ve iver seen or heared of him Jeremiah Foster groaned as she ended her story Then he pulled himself up and said in a cheerful tone of voice He ll come back Sylvia Hepburn He ll think better of it never fear I fear his coming back said she That s what I m feared on I would wish as I knew on his well doing i some other place but him and me can niver live together again Nay pleaded Jeremiah Thee art sorry what thee said thee were sore put about or thee wouldn t have said it He was trying to be a peace maker and to heal over conjugal differences but he did not go deep enough I m not sorry said she slowly I were too deeply wronged to be put about that would go off wi a night s sleep It s only the thought of mother she s dead and happy and knows nought of all this I trust that comes between me and hating Philip I m not sorry for what I said Jeremiah had never met with any one so frank and undisguised in expressions of wrong feeling and he scarcely knew what to say He looked extremely grieved and not a little shocked So pretty and delicate a young creature to use such strong relentless language She seemed to read his thoughts for she made answer to them I dare say you think I m very wicked sir not to be sorry Perhaps I am I can t think o that for remembering how I ve suffered and he knew how miserable I was and might ha cleared my misery away wi a word and he held his peace and now it s too late I m sick o men and their cruel deceitful ways I wish I were dead She was crying before she had ended this speech and seeing her tears the child began to cry too stretching out its little arms to go back to its mother The hard stony look on her face melted away into the softest tenderest love as she clasped the little one to her and tried to soothe its frightened sobs A bright thought came into the old man s mind He had been taking a complete dislike to her till her pretty way with her baby showed him that she had a heart of flesh within her Poor little one said he thy mother had need love thee for she s deprived thee of thy father s love Thou rt half way to being an orphan yet I cannot call thee one of the fatherless to whom God will be a father Thou rt a desolate babe thou may saint well cry thine earthly parents have forsaken thee and I know not if the Lord will take thee up Sylvia looked up at him affrighted holding her baby tighter to her she exclaimed Don t speak so sir it s cursing sir I haven t forsaken her Oh sir those are awful sayings Thee hast sworn never to forgive thy husband nor to live with him again Dost thee know that by the law of the land he may claim his child and then thou wilt have to forsake it or to be forsworn Poor little maiden continued he once more luring the baby to him with the temptation of the watch and chain Sylvia thought for a while before speaking Then she said I cannot tell what ways to take Whiles I think my head is crazed It were a cruel turn he did me It was I couldn t have thought him guilty of such baseness This acquiescence which was perfectly honest on Jeremiah s part almost took Sylvia by surprise Why might she not hate one who had been both cruel and base in his treatment of her And yet she recoiled from the application of such hard terms by another to Philip by a cool judging and indifferent person as she esteemed Jeremiah to be From some inscrutable turn in her thoughts she began to defend him or at least to palliate the harsh judgment which she herself had been the first to pronounce He were so tender to mother she were dearly fond on him he niver spared aught he could do for her else I would niver ha married him He was a good and kind hearted lad from the time he was fifteen And I never found him out in any falsehood no more did my brother But it were all the same as a lie said Sylvia swiftly changing her ground to leave me to think as Charley were dead when he knowed all t time he were alive It was It was a self seeking lie putting thee to pain to get his own ends And the end of it has been that he is driven forth like Cain I niver told him to go sir But thy words sent him forth Sylvia I cannot unsay them sir and I believe as I should say them again But she said this as one who rather hopes for a contradiction All Jeremiah replied however was Poor wee child in a pitiful tone addressed to the baby Sylvia s eyes filled with tears Oh sir I ll do anything as iver yo can tell me for her That s what I came for t ask yo I know I mun not stay theere and Philip gone away and I dunnot know what to do and I ll do aught only I must keep her wi me Whativer can I do sir Jeremiah thought it over for a minute or two Then he replied I must have time to think I must talk it over with brother John But you ve given me yo r word sir exclaimed she I have given thee my word never to tell any one of what has passed between thee and thy husband but I must take counsel with my brother as to what is to be done with thee and thy child now that thy husband has left the shop This was said so gravely as almost to be a reproach and he got up as a sign that the interview was ended He gave the baby back to its mother but not without a solemn blessing so solemn that to Sylvia s superstitious and excited mind it undid the terrors of what she had esteemed to be a curse The Lord bless thee and keep thee The Lord make His face to shine upon thee All the way down the hill side Sylvia kept kissing the child and whispering to its unconscious ears I ll love thee for both my treasure I will I ll hap thee round wi my love so as thou shall niver need a feyther s CHAPTER XXXVII BEREAVEMENT Hester had been prevented by her mother s indisposition from taking Philip s letter to the Fosters to hold a consultation with them over its contents Alice Rose was slowly failing and the long days which she had to spend alone told much upon her spirits and consequently upon her health All this came out in the conversation which ensued after reading Hepburn s letter in the little parlour at the bank on the day after Sylvia had had her confidential interview with Jeremiah Foster He was a true man of honour and never so much as alluded to her visit to him but what she had then told him influenced him very much in the formation of the project which he proposed to his brother and Hester He recommended her remaining where she was living still in the house behind the shop for he thought within himself that she might have exaggerated the effect of her words upon Philip that after all it might have been some cause totally disconnected with them which had blotted out her husband s place among the men of Monkshaven and that it would be so much easier for both to resume their natural relations both towards each other and towards the world if Sylvia remained where her husband had left her in an expectant attitude so to speak Jeremiah Foster questioned Hester straitly about her letter whether she had made known its contents to any one No not to any one Neither to her mother nor to William Coulson No to neither She looked at him as she replied to his inquiries and he looked at her each wondering if the other could be in the least aware that a conjugal quarrel might be at the root of the dilemma in which they were placed by Hepburn s disappearance But neither Hester who had witnessed the misunderstanding between the husband and wife on the evening before the morning on which Philip went away nor Jeremiah Foster who had learnt from Sylvia the true reason of her husband s disappearance gave the slightest reason to the other to think that they each supposed they had a clue to the reason of Hepburn s sudden departure What Jeremiah Foster after a night s consideration had to propose was this that Hester and her mother should come and occupy the house in the market place conjointly with Sylvia and her child Hester s interest in the shop was by this time acknowledged Jeremiah had made over to her so much of his share in the business that she had a right to be considered as a kind of partner and she had long been the superintendent of that department of goods which were exclusively devoted to women So her daily presence was requisite for more reasons than one Yet her mother s health and spirits were such as to render it unadvisable that the old woman should be too much left alone and Sylvia s devotion to her own mother seemed to point her out as the very person who could be a gentle and tender companion to Alice Rose during those hours when her own daughter would necessarily be engaged in the shop Many desirable objects seemed to be gained by this removal of Alice an occupation was provided for Sylvia which would detain her in the place where her husband had left her and where Jeremiah Foster fairly expected in spite of his letter he was likely to come back to find her and Alice Rose the early love of one of the brothers the old friend of the other would be well cared for and under her daughter s immediate supervision during the whole of the time that she was occupied in the shop Philip s share of the business augmented by the money which he had put in from the legacy of his old Cumberland uncle would bring in profits enough to support Sylvia and her child in ease and comfort until that time which they all anticipated when he should return from his mysterious wandering mysterious whether his going forth had been voluntary or involuntary Thus far was settled and Jeremiah Foster went to tell Sylvia of the plan She was too much a child too entirely unaccustomed to any independence of action to do anything but leave herself in his hands Her very confession made to him the day before when she sought his counsel seemed to place her at his disposal Otherwise she had had notions of the possibility of a free country life once more how provided for and arranged she hardly knew but Haytersbank was to let and Kester disengaged and it had just seemed possible that she might have to return to her early home and to her old life She knew that it would take much money to stock the farm again and that her hands were tied from much useful activity by the love and care she owed to her baby But still somehow she hoped and she fancied till Jeremiah Foster s measured words and carefully arranged plan made her silently relinquish her green breezy vision Hester too had her own private rebellion hushed into submission by her gentle piety If Sylvia had been able to make Philip happy Hester could have felt lovingly and almost gratefully towards her but Sylvia had failed in this Philip had been made unhappy and was driven forth a wanderer into the wide world never to come back And his last words to Hester the postscript of his letter containing the very pith of it was to ask her to take charge and care of the wife whose want of love towards him had uprooted him from the place where he was valued and honoured It cost Hester many a struggle and many a self reproach before she could make herself feel what she saw all along that in everything Philip treated her like a sister But even a sister might well be indignant if she saw her brother s love disregarded and slighted and his life embittered by the thoughtless conduct of a wife Still Hester fought against herself and for Philip s sake she sought to see the good in Sylvia and she strove to love her as well as to take care of her With the baby of course the case was different Without thought or struggle or reason every one loved the little girl Coulson and his buxom wife who were childless were never weary of making much of her Hester s happiest hours were spent with that little child Jeremiah Foster almost looked upon her as his own from the day when she honoured him by yielding to the temptation of the chain and seal and coming to his knee not a customer to the shop but knew the smiling child s sad history and many a country woman would save a rosy cheeked apple from out her store that autumn to bring it on next market day for Philip Hepburn s baby as had lost its father bless it Even stern Alice Rose was graciously inclined towards the little Bella and though her idea of the number of the elect was growing narrower and narrower every day she would have been loth to exclude the innocent little child that stroked her wrinkled cheeks so softly every night in return for her blessing from the few that should be saved Nay for the child s sake she relented towards the mother and strove to have Sylvia rescued from the many castaways with fervent prayer or as she phrased it wrestling with the Lord Alice had a sort of instinct that the little child so tenderly loved by so fondly loving the mother whose ewe lamb she was could not be even in heaven without yearning for the creature she had loved best on earth and the old woman believed that this was the principal reason for her prayers for Sylvia but unconsciously to herself Alice Rose was touched by the filial attentions she constantly received from the young mother whom she believed to be foredoomed to condemnation Sylvia rarely went to church or chapel nor did she read her Bible for though she spoke little of her ignorance and would fain for her child s sake have remedied it now it was too late she had lost what little fluency of reading she had ever had and could only make out her words with much spelling and difficulty So the taking her Bible in hand would have been a mere form though of this Alice Rose knew nothing No one knew much of what was passing in Sylvia she did not know herself Sometimes in the nights she would waken crying with a terrible sense of desolation every one who loved her or whom she had loved had vanished out of her life every one but her child who lay in her arms warm and soft But then Jeremiah Foster s words came upon her words that she had taken for cursing at the time and she would so gladly have had some clue by which to penetrate the darkness of the unknown region from whence both blessing and cursing came and to know if she had indeed done something which should cause her sin to be visited on that soft sweet innocent darling If any one would teach her to read If any one would explain to her the hard words she heard in church or chapel so that she might find out the meaning of sin and godliness words that had only passed over the surface of her mind till now For her child s sake she should like to do the will of God if she only knew what that was and how to be worked out in her daily life But there was no one she dared confess her ignorance to and ask information from Jeremiah Foster had spoken as if her child sweet little merry Bella with a loving word and a kiss for every one was to suffer heavily for the just and true words her wronged and indignant mother had spoken Alice always spoke as if there were no hope for her and blamed her nevertheless for not using the means of grace that it was not in her power to avail herself of And Hester that Sylvia would fain have loved for her uniform gentleness and patience with all around her seemed so cold in her unruffled and undemonstrative behaviour and moreover Sylvia felt that Hester blamed her perpetual silence regarding Philip s absence without knowing how bitter a cause Sylvia had for casting him off The only person who seemed to have pity upon her was Kester and his pity was shown in looks rather than words for when he came to see her which he did from time to time by a kind of mutual tacit consent they spoke but little of former days He was still lodging with his sister widow Dobson working at odd jobs some of which took him into the country for weeks at a time But on his returns to Monkshaven he was sure to come and see her and the little Bella indeed when his employment was in the immediate neighbourhood of the town he never allowed a week to pass away without a visit There was not much conversation between him and Sylvia at such times They skimmed over the surface of the small events in which both took an interest only now and then a sudden glance a checked speech told each that there were deeps not forgotten although they were never mentioned Twice Sylvia below her breath had asked Kester just as she was holding the door open for his departure if anything had ever been heard of Kinraid since his one night s visit to Monkshaven each time and there was an interval of some months between the inquiries the answer had been simply no To no one else would Sylvia ever have named his name But indeed she had not the chance had she wished it ever so much of asking any questions about him from any one likely to know The Corneys had left Moss Brow at Martinmas and gone many miles away towards Horncastle Bessy Corney it is true was married and left behind in the neighbourhood but with her Sylvia had never been intimate and what girlish friendship there might have been between them had cooled very much at the time of Kinraid s supposed death three years before One day before Christmas in this year seventeen ninety eight Sylvia was called into the shop by Coulson who with his assistant was busy undoing the bales of winter goods supplied to them from the West Riding and other places He was looking at a fine Irish poplin dress piece when Sylvia answered to his call Here do you know this again asked he in the cheerful tone of one sure of giving pleasure No have I iver seen it afore Not this but one for all t world like it She did not rouse up to much interest but looked at it as if trying to recollect where she could have seen its like My missus had one on at th party at John Foster s last March and yo admired it a deal And Philip he thought o nothing but how he could get yo just such another and he set a vast o folk agait for to meet wi its marrow and what he did just the very day afore he went away so mysterious was to write through Dawson Brothers o Wakefield to Dublin and order that one should be woven for yo Jemima had to cut a bit off hers for to give him t exact colour Sylvia did not say anything but that it was very pretty in a low voice and then she quickly left the shop much to Coulson s displeasure All the afternoon she was unusually quiet and depressed Alice Rose sitting helpless in her chair watched her with keen eyes At length after one of Sylvia s deep unconscious sighs the old woman spoke It s religion as must comfort thee child as it s done many a one afore thee How said Sylvia looking up startled to find herself an object of notice How The answer was not quite so ready as the precept had been Read thy Bible and thou wilt learn But I cannot read said Sylvia too desperate any longer to conceal her ignorance Not read and thee Philip s wife as was such a great scholar Of a surety the ways o this life are crooked There was our Hester as can read as well as any minister and Philip passes over her to go and choose a young lass as cannot read her Bible Was Philip and Hester Sylvia paused for though a new curiosity had dawned upon her she did not know how to word her question Many a time and oft have I seen Hester take comfort in her Bible when Philip was following after thee She knew where to go for consolation I d fain read said Sylvia humbly if anybody would learn me for perhaps it might do me good I m noane so happy Her eyes as she looked up at Alice s stern countenance were full of tears The old woman saw it and was touched although she did not immediately show her sympathy But she took her own time and made no reply The next day however she bade Sylvia come to her and then and there as if her pupil had been a little child she began to teach Sylvia to read the first chapter of Genesis for all other reading but the Scriptures was as vanity to her and she would not condescend to the weakness of other books Sylvia was now as ever slow at book learning but she was meek and desirous to be taught and her willingness in this respect pleased Alice and drew her singularly towards one who from being a pupil might become a convert All this time Sylvia never lost the curiosity that had been excited by the few words Alice had let drop about Hester and Philip and by degrees she approached the subject again and had the idea then started confirmed by Alice who had no scruple in using the past experience of her own of her daughter s or of any one s life as an instrument to prove the vanity of setting the heart on anything earthly This knowledge unsuspected before sank deep into Sylvia s thoughts and gave her a strange interest in Hester poor Hester whose life she had so crossed and blighted even by the very blighting of her own She gave Hester her own former passionate feelings for Kinraid and wondered how she herself should have felt towards any one who had come between her and him and wiled his love away When she remembered Hester s unfailing sweetness and kindness towards herself from the very first she could better bear the comparative coldness of her present behaviour She tried indeed hard to win back the favour she had lost but the very means she took were blunders and only made it seem to her as if she could never again do right in Hester s eyes For instance she begged her to accept and wear the pretty poplin gown which had been Philip s especial choice feeling within herself as if she should never wish to put it on and as if the best thing she could do with it was to offer it to Hester But Hester rejected the proffered gift with as much hardness of manner as she was capable of assuming and Sylvia had to carry it upstairs and lay it by for the little daughter who Hester said might perhaps learn to value things that her father had given especial thought to Yet Sylvia went on trying to win Hester to like her once more it was one of her great labours and learning to read from Hester s mother was another Alice indeed in her solemn way was becoming quite fond of Sylvia if she could not read or write she had a deftness and gentleness of motion a capacity for the household matters which fell into her department that had a great effect on the old woman and for her dear mother s sake Sylvia had a stock of patient love ready in her heart for all the aged and infirm that fell in her way She never thought of seeking them out as she knew that Hester did but then she looked up to Hester as some one very remarkable for her goodness If only she could have liked her Hester tried to do all she could for Sylvia Philip had told her to take care of his wife and child but she had the conviction that Sylvia had so materially failed in her duties as to have made her husband an exile from his home a penniless wanderer wifeless and childless in some strange country whose very aspect was friendless while the cause of all lived on in the comfortable home where he had placed her wanting for nothing an object of interest and regard to many friends with a lovely little child to give her joy for the present and hope for the future while he the poor outcast might even lie dead by the wayside How could Hester love Sylvia Yet they were frequent companions that ensuing spring Hester was not well and the doctors said that the constant occupation in the shop was too much for her and that she must for a time at least take daily walks into the country Sylvia used to beg to accompany her she and the little girl often went with Hester up the valley of the river to some of the nestling farms that were hidden in the more sheltered nooks for Hester was bidden to drink milk warm from the cow and to go into the familiar haunts about a farm was one of the few things in which Sylvia seemed to take much pleasure She would let little Bella toddle about while Hester sate and rested and she herself would beg to milk the cow destined to give the invalid her draught One May evening the three had been out on some such expedition the country side still looked gray and bare though the leaves were showing on the willow and blackthorn and sloe and by the tinkling runnels making hidden music along the copse side the pale delicate primrose buds were showing amid their fresh green crinkled leaves The larks had been singing all the afternoon but were now dropping down into their nests in the pasture fields the air had just the sharpness in it which goes along with a cloudless evening sky at that time of the year But Hester walked homewards slowly and languidly speaking no word Sylvia noticed this at first without venturing to speak for Hester was one who disliked having her ailments noticed But after a while Hester stood still in a sort of weary dreamy abstraction and Sylvia said to her I m afeared yo re sadly tired Maybe we ve been too far Hester almost started No said she it s only my headache which is worse to night It has been bad all day but since I came out it has felt just as if there were great guns booming till I could almost pray em to be quiet I am so weary o th sound She stepped out quickly towards home after she had said this as if she wished for neither pity nor comment on what she had said CHAPTER XXXVIII THE RECOGNITION Far away over sea and land over sunny sea again great guns were booming on that seventh of May seventeen ninety nine The Mediterranean came up with a long roar on a beach glittering white with snowy sand and the fragments of innumerable sea shells delicate and shining as porcelain Looking at that shore from the sea a long ridge of upland ground beginning from an inland depth stretched far away into the ocean on the right till it ended in a great mountainous bluff crowned with the white buildings of a convent sloping rapidly down into the blue water at its base In the clear eastern air the different characters of the foliage that clothed the sides of that sea washed mountain might be discerned from a long distance by the naked eye the silver gray of the olive trees near its summit the heavy green and bossy forms of the sycamores lower down broken here and there by a solitary terebinth or ilex tree of a deeper green and a wider spread till the eye fell below on the maritime plain edged with the white seaboard and the sandy hillocks with here and there feathery palm trees either isolated or in groups motionless and distinct against the hot purple air Look again a little to the left on the sea shore there are the white walls of a fortified town glittering in sunlight or black in shadow The fortifications themselves run out into the sea forming a port and a haven against the wild Levantine storms and a lighthouse rises out of the waves to guide mariners into safety Beyond this walled city and far away to the left still there is the same wide plain shut in by the distant rising ground till the upland circuit comes closing in to the north and the great white rocks meet the deep tideless ocean with its intensity of blue colour Above the sky is literally purple with heat and the pitiless light smites the gazer s weary eye as it comes back from the white shore Nor does the plain country in that land offer the refuge and rest of our own soft green The limestone rock underlies the vegetation and gives a glittering ashen hue to all the bare patches and even to the cultivated parts which are burnt up early in the year In spring time alone does the country look rich and fruitful then the corn fields of the plain show their capability of bearing some fifty some an hundred fold down by the brook Kishon flowing not far from the base of the mountainous promontory to the south there grow the broad green fig trees cool and fresh to look upon the orchards are full of glossy leaved cherry trees the tall amaryllis puts forth crimson and yellow glories in the fields rivalling the pomp of King Solomon the daisies and the hyacinths spread their myriad flowers the anemones scarlet as blood run hither and thither over the ground like dazzling flames of fire A spicy odour lingers in the heated air it comes from the multitude of aromatic flowers that blossom in the early spring Later on they will have withered and faded and the corn will have been gathered and the deep green of the eastern foliage will have assumed a kind of gray bleached tint Even now in May the hot sparkle of the everlasting sea the terribly clear outline of all objects whether near or distant the fierce sun right overhead the dazzling air around were inexpressibly wearying to the English eyes that kept their skilled watch day and night on the strongly fortified coast town that lay out a little to the northward of where the British ships were anchored They had kept up a flanking fire for many days in aid of those besieged in saint Jean d Acre and at intervals had listened impatient to the sound of the heavy siege guns or the sharper rattle of the French musketry In the morning on the seventh of May a man at the masthead of the Tigre sang out that he saw ships in the offing and in reply to the signal that was hastily run up he saw the distant vessels hoist friendly flags That May morning was a busy time The besieged Turks took heart of grace the French outside under the command of their great general made hasty preparations for a more vigorous assault than all many both vigorous and bloody that had gone before for the siege was now at its fifty first day in hopes of carrying the town by storm before the reinforcement coming by sea could arrive and Sir Sidney Smith aware of Buonaparte s desperate intention ordered all the men both sailors and marines that could be spared from the necessity of keeping up a continual flanking fire from the ships upon the French to land and assist the Turks and the British forces already there in the defence of the old historic city Lieutenant Kinraid who had shared his captain s daring adventure off the coast of France three years before who had been a prisoner with him and Westley Wright in the Temple at Paris and had escaped with them and through Sir Sidney s earnest recommendation been promoted from being a warrant officer to the rank of lieutenant received on this day the honour from his admiral of being appointed to an especial post of danger His heart was like a war horse and said Ha ha as the boat bounded over the waves that were to land him under the ancient machicolated walls where the Crusaders made their last stand in the Holy Land Not that Kinraid knew or cared one jot about those gallant knights of old all he knew was that the French under Boney were trying to take the town from the Turks and that his admiral said they must not and so they should not He and his men landed on that sandy shore and entered the town by the water port gate he was singing to himself his own country song Weel may the keel row the keel row C and his men with sailors aptitude for music caught up the air and joined in the burden with inarticulate sounds So with merry hearts they threaded the narrow streets of Acre hemmed in on either side by the white walls of Turkish houses with small grated openings high up above all chance of peeping intrusion Here and there they met an ample robed and turbaned Turk going along with as much haste as his stately self possession would allow But the majority of the male inhabitants were gathered together to defend the breach where the French guns thundered out far above the heads of the sailors They went along none the less merrily for the sound to Djezzar Pacha s garden where the old Turk sate on his carpet beneath the shade of a great terebinth tree listening to the interpreter who made known to him the meaning of the eager speeches of Sir Sidney Smith and the colonel of the marines As soon as the admiral saw the gallant sailors of H M S Tigre he interrupted the council of war without much ceremony and going to Kinraid he despatched them as before arranged to the North Ravelin showing them the way with rapid clear directions Out of respect to him they had kept silent while in the strange desolate garden but once more in the streets the old Newcastle song rose up again till the men were perforce silenced by the haste with which they went to the post of danger It was three o clock in the afternoon For many a day these very men had been swearing at the terrific heat at this hour even when at sea fanned by the soft breeze but now in the midst of hot smoke with former carnage tainting the air and with the rush and whizz of death perpetually whistling in their ears they were uncomplaining and light hearted Many an old joke and some new ones came brave and hearty on their cheerful voices even though the speaker was veiled from sight in great clouds of smoke cloven only by the bright flames of death A sudden message came as many of the crew of the Tigre as were under Lieutenant Kinraid s command were to go down to the Mole to assist the new reinforcements seen by the sailor from the masthead at day dawn under command of Hassan Bey to land at the Mole where Sir Sidney then was Off they went almost as bright and thoughtless as before though two of their number lay silent for ever at the North Ravelin silenced in that one little half hour And one went along with the rest swearing lustily at his ill luck in having his right arm broken but ready to do good business with his left They helped the Turkish troops to land more with good will than tenderness and then led by Sir Sidney they went under the shelter of English guns to the fatal breach so often assailed so gallantly defended but never so fiercely contested as on this burning afternoon The ruins of the massive wall that here had been broken down by the French were used by them as stepping stones to get on a level with the besieged and so to escape the heavy stones which the latter hurled down nay even the dead bodies of the morning s comrades were made into ghastly stairs When Djezzar Pacha heard that the British sailors were defending the breach headed by Sir Sidney Smith he left his station in the palace garden gathered up his robes in haste and hurried to the breach where with his own hands and with right hearty good will he pulled the sailors down from the post of danger saying that if he lost his English friends he lost all But little recked the crew of the Tigre of the one old man Pacha or otherwise who tried to hold them back from the fight they were up and at the French assailants clambering over the breach in an instant and so they went on as if it were some game at play instead of a deadly combat until Kinraid and his men were called off by Sir Sidney as the reinforcement of Turkish troops under Hassan Bey were now sufficient for the defence of that old breach in the walls which was no longer the principal object of the French attack for the besiegers had made a new and more formidable breach by their incessant fire knocking down whole streets of the city walls Fight your best Kinraid said Sir Sidney for there s Boney on yonder hill looking at you And sure enough on a rising ground called Richard Coeur de Lion s Mount there was a half circle of French generals on horseback all deferentially attending to the motions and apparently to the words of a little man in their centre at whose bidding the aide de camp galloped swift with messages to the more distant French camp The two ravelins which Kinraid and his men had to occupy for the purpose of sending a flanking fire upon the enemy were not ten yards from that enemy s van But at length there was a sudden rush of the French to that part of the wall where they imagined they could enter unopposed Surprised at this movement Kinraid ventured out of the shelter of the ravelin to ascertain the cause he safe and untouched during that long afternoon of carnage fell now under a stray musket shot and lay helpless and exposed upon the ground undiscerned by his men who were recalled to help in the hot reception which had been planned for the French who descending the city walls into the Pacha s garden were attacked with sabre and dagger and lay headless corpses under the flowering rose bushes and by the fountain side Kinraid lay beyond the ravelins many yards outside the city walls He was utterly helpless for the shot had broken his leg Dead bodies of Frenchmen lay strewn around him no Englishman had ventured out so far All the wounded men that he could see were French and many of these furious with pain gnashed their teeth at him and cursed him aloud till he thought that his best course was to assume the semblance of death for some among these men were still capable of dragging themselves up to him and by concentrating all their failing energies into one blow put him to a speedy end The outlying pickets of the French army were within easy rifle shot and his uniform although less conspicuous in colour than that of the marines by whose sides he had been fighting would make him a sure mark if he so much as moved his arm Yet how he longed to turn if ever so slightly so that the cruel slanting sun might not beat full into his aching eyes Fever too was coming upon him the pain in his leg was every moment growing more severe the terrible thirst of the wounded added to the heat and fatigue of the day made his lips and tongue feel baked and dry and his whole throat seemed parched and wooden Thoughts of other days of cool Greenland seas where ice abounded of grassy English homes began to make the past more real than the present With a great effort he brought his wandering senses back he knew where he was now and could weigh the chances of his life which were but small the unwonted tears came to his eyes as he thought of the newly made wife in her English home who might never know how he died thinking of her Suddenly he saw a party of English marines advance under shelter of the ravelin to pick up the wounded and bear them within the walls for surgical help They were so near he could see their faces could hear them speak yet he durst not make any sign to them when he lay within range of the French picket s fire For one moment he could not resist raising his head to give himself a chance for life before the unclean creatures that infest a camp came round in the darkness of the night to strip and insult the dead bodies and to put to death such as had yet the breath of life within them But the setting sun came full into his face and he saw nothing of what he longed to see He fell back in despair he lay there to die That strong clear sunbeam had wrought his salvation He had been recognized as men are recognized when they stand in the red glare of a house on fire the same despair of help of hopeless farewell to life stamped on their faces in blood red light One man left his fellows and came running forwards forwards in among the enemy s wounded within range of their guns he bent down over Kinraid he seemed to understand without a word he lifted him up carrying him like a child and with the vehement energy that is more from the force of will than the strength of body he bore him back to within the shelter of the ravelin not without many shots being aimed at them one of which hit Kinraid in the fleshy part of his arm Kinraid was racked with agony from his dangling broken leg and his very life seemed leaving him yet he remembered afterwards how the marine recalled his fellows and how in the pause before they returned his face became like one formerly known to the sick senses of Kinraid yet it was too like a dream too utterly improbable to be real Yet the few words this man said as he stood breathless and alone by the fainting Kinraid fitted in well with the belief conjured up by his personal appearance He panted out I niver thought you d ha kept true to her And then the others came up and while they were making a sling of their belts Kinraid fainted utterly away and the next time that he was fully conscious he was lying in his berth in the Tigre with the ship surgeon setting his leg After that he was too feverish for several days to collect his senses When he could first remember and form a judgment upon his recollections he called the man especially charged to attend upon him and bade him go and make inquiry in every possible manner for a marine named Philip Hepburn and when he was found to entreat him to come and see Kinraid The sailor was away the greater part of the day and returned unsuccessful in his search he had been from ship to ship hither and thither he had questioned all the marines he had met with no one knew anything of any Philip Hepburn Kinraid passed a miserably feverish night and when the doctor exclaimed the next morning at his retrogression he told him with some irritation of the ill success of his servant he accused the man of stupidity and wished fervently that he were able to go himself Partly to soothe him the doctor promised that he would undertake the search for Hepburn and he engaged faithfully to follow all Kinraid s eager directions not to be satisfied with men s careless words but to look over muster rolls and ships books He too brought the same answer however unwillingly given He had set out upon the search so confident of success that he felt doubly discomfited by failure However he had persuaded himself that the lieutenant had been partially delirious from the effects of his wound and the power of the sun shining down just where he lay There had indeed been slight symptoms of Kinraid s having received a sun stroke and the doctor dwelt largely on these in his endeavour to persuade his patient that it was his imagination which had endued a stranger with the lineaments of some former friend Kinraid threw his arms out of bed with impatience at all this plausible talk which was even more irritating than the fact that Hepburn was still undiscovered The man was no friend of mine I was like to have killed him when last I saw him He was a shopkeeper in a country town in England I had seen little enough of him but enough to make me able to swear to him anywhere even in a marine s uniform and in this sweltering country Faces once seen especially in excitement are apt to return upon the memory in cases of fever quoth the doctor sententiously The attendant sailor reinstalled to some complacency by the failure of another in the search in which he himself had been unsuccessful now put in his explanation Maybe it was a spirit It s not th first time as I ve heared of a spirit coming upon earth to save a man s life i time o need My father had an uncle a west country grazier He was a coming over Dartmoor in Devonshire one moonlight night with a power o money as he d got for his sheep at t fair It were stowed i leather bags under th seat o th gig It were a rough kind o road both as a road and in character for there d been many robberies there of late and th great rocks stood convenient for hiding places All at once father s uncle feels as if some one were sitting beside him on th empty seat and he turns his head and looks and there he sees his brother sitting his brother as had been dead twelve year and more So he turns his head back again eyes right and never say a word but wonders what it all means All of a sudden two fellows come out upo th white road from some black shadow and they looked and they let th gig go past father s uncle driving hard I ll warrant him But for all that he heard one say to t other By there s two on em Straight on he drove faster than ever till he saw th far lights of some town or other I forget its name though I ve heared it many a time and then he drew a long breath and turned his head to look at his brother and ask him how he d managed to come out of his grave i Barum churchyard and th seat was as empty as it had been when he set out and then he knew that it were a spirit come to help him against th men who thought to rob him and would likely enough ha murdered him Kinraid had kept quiet through this story But when the sailor began to draw the moral and to say And I think I may make bold to say sir as th marine who carried you out o th Frenchy s gun shot was just a spirit come to help you he exclaimed impatiently swearing a great oath as he did so It was no spirit I tell you and I was in my full senses It was a man named Philip Hepburn He said words to me or over me as none but himself would have said Yet we hated each other like poison and I can t make out why he should be there and putting himself in danger to save me But so it was and as you can t find him let me hear no more of your nonsense It was him and not my fancy doctor It was flesh and blood and not a spirit Jack So get along with you and leave me quiet All this time Stephen Freeman lay friendless sick and shattered on board the Theseus He had been about his duty close to some shells that were placed on her deck a gay young midshipman was thoughtlessly striving to get the fusee out of one of these by a mallet and spike nail that lay close at hand and a fearful explosion ensued in which the poor marine cleaning his bayonet near was shockingly burnt and disfigured the very skin of all the lower part of his face being utterly destroyed by gunpowder They said it was a mercy that his eyes were spared but he could hardly feel anything to be a mercy as he lay tossing in agony burnt by the explosion wounded by splinters and feeling that he was disabled for life if life itself were preserved Of all that suffered by that fearful accident and they were many none was so forsaken so hopeless so desolate as the Philip Hepburn about whom such anxious inquiries were being made at that very time CHAPTER XXXIX CONFIDENCES It was a little later on in that same summer that missus Brunton came to visit her sister Bessy Bessy was married to a tolerably well to do farmer who lived at an almost equal distance between Monkshaven and Hartswell but from old habit and convenience the latter was regarded as the Dawsons market town so Bessy seldom or never saw her old friends in Monkshaven But missus Brunton was far too flourishing a person not to speak out her wishes and have her own way She had no notion she said of coming such a long journey only to see Bessy and her husband and not to have a sight of her former acquaintances at Monkshaven She might have added that her new bonnet and cloak would be as good as lost if it was not displayed among those who knowing her as Molly Corney and being less fortunate in matrimony than she was would look upon it with wondering admiration if not with envy So one day farmer Dawson s market cart deposited missus Brunton in all her bravery at the shop in the market place over which Hepburn and Coulson s names still flourished in joint partnership After a few words of brisk recognition to Coulson and Hester missus Brunton passed on into the parlour and greeted Sylvia with boisterous heartiness It was now four years and more since the friends had met and each secretly wondered how they had ever come to be friends Sylvia had a country raw spiritless look to missus Brunton s eye Molly was loud and talkative and altogether distasteful to Sylvia trained in daily companionship with Hester to appreciate soft slow speech and grave thoughtful ways However they kept up the forms of their old friendship though their hearts had drifted far apart They sat hand in hand while each looked at the other with eyes inquisitive as to the changes which time had made Molly was the first to speak Well to be sure how thin and pale yo ve grown Sylvia Matrimony hasn t agreed wi yo as well as it s done wi me Brunton is allays saying yo know what a man he is for his joke that if he d ha known how many yards o silk I should ha ta en for a gown he d ha thought twice afore he d ha married me Why I ve gained a matter o thirty pound o flesh sin I were married Yo do look brave and hearty said Sylvia putting her sense of her companion s capacious size and high colour into the prettiest words she could Eh Sylvia but I know what it is said Molly shaking her head It s just because o that husband o thine as has gone and left thee thou s pining after him and he s not worth it Brunton said when he heared on it I mind he was smoking at t time and he took his pipe out of his mouth and shook out t ashes as grave as any judge The man says he as can desert a wife like Sylvia Robson as was deserves hanging That s what he says Eh Sylvia but speakin o hanging I was so grieved for yo when I heared of yo r poor feyther Such an end for a decent man to come to Many a one come an called on me o purpose to hear all I could tell em about him Please don t speak on it said Sylvia trembling all over Well poor creature I wunnot It is hard on thee I grant But to give t devil his due it were good i Hepburn to marry thee and so soon after there was a that talk about thy feyther Many a man would ha drawn back choose howiver far they d gone I m noane so sure about Charley Kinraid Eh Sylvia only think on his being alive after all I doubt if our Bessy would ha wed Frank Dawson if she d known as he wasn t drowned But it s as well she did for Dawson s a man o property and has getten twelve cows in his cow house beside three right down good horses and Kinraid were allays a fellow wi two strings to his bow I ve allays said and do maintain that he went on pretty strong wi yo Sylvie and I will say I think he cared more for yo than for our Bessy though it were only yesterday at e en she were standing out that he liked her better than yo Yo ll ha heared on his grand marriage No said Sylvia with eager painful curiosity No It was in all t papers I wonder as yo didn t see it Wait a minute I cut it out o t Gentleman s Magazine as Brunton bought o purpose and put it i my pocket book when I were a coming here I know I ve got it somewheere She took out her smart crimson pocket book and rummaged in the pocket until she produced a little crumpled bit of printed paper from which she read aloud On January the third at saint Mary Redcliffe Bristol Charles Kinraid esquire lieutenant Royal Navy to Miss Clarinda Jackson with a fortune of ten thousand l Theere said she triumphantly it s something as Brunton says to be cousin to that Would yo let me see it said Sylvia timidly missus Brunton graciously consented and Sylvia brought her newly acquired reading knowledge hitherto principally exercised on the Old Testament to bear on these words There was nothing wonderful in them nothing that she might not have expected and yet the surprise turned her giddy for a moment or two She never thought of seeing him again never But to think of his caring for another woman as much as he had done for her nay perhaps more The idea was irresistibly forced upon her that Philip would not have acted so it would have taken long years before he could have been induced to put another on the throne she had once occupied For the first time in her life she seemed to recognize the real nature of Philip s love But she said nothing but Thank yo when she gave the scrap of paper back to Molly Brunton And the latter continued giving her information about Kinraid s marriage He were down in t west Plymouth or somewheere when he met wi her She s no feyther he d been in t sugar baking business but from what Kinraid wrote to old Turner th uncle as brought him up at Cullercoats she s had t best of edications can play on t instrument and dance t shawl dance and Kinraid had all her money settled on her though she said she d rayther give it all to him which I must say being his cousin was very pretty on her He s left her now having to go off in t Tigre as is his ship to t Mediterranean seas and she s written to offer to come and see old Turner and make friends with his relations and Brunton is going to gi e me a crimson satin as soon as we know for certain when she s coming for we re sure to be asked out to Cullercoats I wonder if she s very pretty asked Sylvia faintly in the first pause in this torrent of talk Oh she s a perfect beauty as I understand There was a traveller as come to our shop as had been at York and knew some of her cousins theere that were in t grocery line her mother was a York lady and they said she was just a picture of a woman and iver so many gentlemen had been wantin to marry her but she just waited for Charley Kinraid yo see Well I hope they ll be happy I m sure I do said Sylvia That s just luck Some folks is happy i marriage and some isn t It s just luck and there s no forecasting it Men is such unaccountable animals there s no prophesyin upon em Who d ha thought of yo r husband him as was so slow and sure steady Philip as we lasses used to ca him makin a moonlight flittin and leavin yo to be a widow bewitched He didn t go at night said Sylvia taking the words moonlight flitting in their literal sense No Well I only said moonlight flittin just because it come uppermost and I knowed no better Tell me all about it Sylvie for I can t mak it out from what Bessy says Had he and yo had words but in course yo had At this moment Hester came into the room and Sylvia joyfully availed herself of the pretext for breaking off the conversation that had reached this painful and awkward point She detained Hester in the room for fear lest missus Brunton should repeat her inquiry as to how it all happened that Philip had gone away but the presence of a third person seemed as though it would be but little restraint upon the inquisitive Molly who repeatedly bore down upon the same questions till she nearly drove Sylvia distracted between her astonishment at the news of Kinraid s marriage her wish to be alone and quiet so as to realize the full meaning of that piece of intelligence her desire to retain Hester in the conversation her efforts to prevent Molly s recurrence to the circumstances of Philip s disappearance and the longing more vehement every minute for her visitor to go away and leave her in peace She became so disturbed with all these thoughts and feelings that she hardly knew what she was saying and assented or dissented to speeches without there being either any reason or truth in her words missus Brunton had arranged to remain with Sylvia while the horse rested and had no compunction about the length of her visit She expected to be asked to tea as Sylvia found out at last and this she felt would be the worst of all as Alice Rose was not one to tolerate the coarse careless talk of such a woman as missus Brunton without uplifting her voice in many a testimony against it Sylvia sate holding Hester s gown tight in order to prevent her leaving the room and trying to arrange her little plans so that too much discordance should not arise to the surface Just then the door opened and little Bella came in from the kitchen in all the pretty sturdy dignity of two years old Alice following her with careful steps and protecting outstretched arms a slow smile softening the sternness of her grave face for the child was the unconscious darling of the household and all eyes softened into love as they looked on her She made straight for her mother with something grasped in her little dimpled fist but half way across the room she seemed to have become suddenly aware of the presence of a stranger and she stopped short fixing her serious eyes full on missus Brunton as if to take in her appearance nay as if to penetrate down into her very real self and then stretching out her disengaged hand the baby spoke out the words that had been hovering about her mother s lips for an hour past Do away said Bella decisively What a perfect love said missus Brunton half in real admiration half in patronage As she spoke she got up and went towards the child as if to take her up Do away do away cried Bella in shrill affright at this movement Dunnot said Sylvia she s shy she doesn t know strangers But missus Brunton had grasped the struggling kicking child by this time and her reward for this was a vehement little slap in the face Yo naughty little spoilt thing said she setting Bella down in a hurry Yo deserve a good whipping yo do and if yo were mine yo should have it Sylvia had no need to stand up for the baby who had run to her arms and was soothing herself with sobbing on her mother s breast for Alice took up the defence The child said as plain as words could say go away and if thou wouldst follow thine own will instead of heeding her wish thou mun put up with the wilfulness of the old Adam of which it seems to me thee hast getten thy share at thirty as well as little Bella at two Thirty said missus Brunton now fairly affronted Thirty why Sylvia yo know I m but two years older than yo speak to that woman an tell her as I m only four and twenty Thirty indeed Molly s but four and twenty said Sylvia in a pacificatory tone Whether she be twenty or thirty or forty is alike to me said Alice I meant no harm I meant but for t say as her angry words to the child bespoke her to be one of the foolish I know not who she is nor what her age may be She s an old friend of mine said Sylvia She s missus Brunton now but when I knowed her she was Molly Corney Ay and yo were Sylvia Robson and as bonny and light hearted a lass as any in a t Riding though now yo re a poor widow bewitched left wi a child as I mustn t speak a word about an living wi folk as talk about t old Adam as if he wasn t dead and done wi long ago It s a change Sylvia as makes my heart ache for yo to think on them old days when yo were so thought on yo might have had any man as Brunton often says it were a great mistake as yo iver took up wi yon man as has run away But seven year ll soon be past fro t time he went off and yo ll only be six and twenty then and there ll be a chance of a better husband for yo after all so keep up yo r heart Sylvia Molly Brunton had put as much venom as she knew how into this speech meaning it as a vengeful payment for the supposition of her being thirty even more than for the reproof for her angry words about the child She thought that Alice Rose must be either mother or aunt to Philip from the serious cast of countenance that was remarkable in both and she rather exulted in the allusion to a happier second marriage for Sylvia with which she had concluded her speech It roused Alice however as effectually as if she had been really a blood relation to Philip but for a different reason She was not slow to detect the intentional offensiveness to herself in what had been said she was indignant at Sylvia for suffering the words spoken to pass unanswered but in truth they were too much in keeping with Molly Brunton s character to make as much impression on Sylvia as they did on a stranger and besides she felt as if the less reply Molly received the less likely would it be that she would go on in the same strain So she coaxed and chattered to her child and behaved like a little coward in trying to draw out of the conversation while at the same time listening attentively As for Sylvia Hepburn as was Sylvia Robson she knows my mind said Alice in grim indignation She s humbling herself now I trust and pray but she was light minded and full of vanity when Philip married her and it might ha been a lift towards her salvation in one way but it pleased the Lord to work in a different way and she mun wear her sackcloth and ashes in patience So I ll say naught more about her But for him as is absent as thee hast spoken on so lightly and reproachfully I d have thee to know he were one of a different kind to any thee ever knew I reckon If he were led away by a pretty face to slight one as was fitter for him and who had loved him as the apple of her eye it s him as is suffering for it inasmuch as he s a wanderer from his home and an outcast from wife and child To the surprise of all Molly s words of reply were cut short even when they were on her lips by Sylvia Pale fire eyed and excited with Philip s child on one arm and the other stretched out she said Noane can tell noane know No one shall speak a judgment twixt Philip and me He acted cruel and wrong by me But I ve said my words to him hissel and I m noane going to make any plaint to others only them as knows should judge And it s not fitting it s not almost sobbing to go on wi talk like this afore me The two for Hester who was aware that her presence had only been desired by Sylvia as a check to an unpleasant tete a tete conversation had slipped back to her business as soon as her mother came in the two looked with surprise at Sylvia her words her whole manner belonged to a phase of her character which seldom came uppermost and which had not been perceived by either of them before Alice Rose though astonished rather approved of Sylvia s speech it showed that she had more serious thought and feeling on the subject than the old woman had given her credit for her general silence respecting her husband s disappearance had led Alice to think that she was too childish to have received any deep impression from the event Molly Brunton gave vent to her opinion on Sylvia s speech in the following words Hoighty toighty That tells tales lass If yo treated steady Philip to many such looks an speeches as yo n given us now it s easy t see why he took hisself off Why Sylvia I niver saw it in yo when yo was a girl yo re grown into a regular little vixen theere wheere yo stand Indeed she did look defiant with the swift colour flushing her cheeks to crimson on its return and the fire in her eyes not yet died away But at Molly s jesting words she sank back into her usual look and manner only saying quietly It s for noane to say whether I m vixen or not as doesn t know th past things as is buried in my heart But I cannot hold them as my friends as go on talking on either my husband or me before my very face What he was I know and what I am I reckon he knows And now I ll go hurry tea for yo ll be needing it Molly The last clause of this speech was meant to make peace but Molly was in twenty minds as to whether she should accept the olive branch or not Her temper however was of that obtuse kind which is not easily ruffled her mind stagnant in itself enjoyed excitement from without and her appetite was invariably good so she stayed in spite of the inevitable tete a tete with Alice The latter however refused to be drawn into conversation again replying to missus Brunton s speeches with a curt yes or no when indeed she replied at all When all were gathered at tea Sylvia was quite calm again rather paler than usual and very attentive and subduced in her behaviour to Alice she would evidently fain have been silent but as Molly was her own especial guest that could not be so all her endeavours went towards steering the conversation away from any awkward points But each of the four let alone little Bella was thankful when the market cart drew up at the shop door that was to take missus Brunton back to her sister s house When she was fairly off Alice Rose opened her mouth in strong condemnation winding up with And if aught in my words gave thee cause for offence Sylvia it was because my heart rose within me at the kind of talk thee and she had been having about Philip and her evil and light minded counsel to thee about waiting seven years and then wedding another Hard as these words may seem when repeated there was something of a nearer approach to an apology in missus Rose s manner than Sylvia had ever seen in it before She was silent for a few moments then she said I ha often thought of telling yo and Hester special like when yo ve been so kind to my little Bella that Philip an me could niver come together again no not if he came home this very night She would have gone on speaking but Hester interrupted her with a low cry of dismay Alice said Hush thee Hester It s no business o thine Sylvia Hepburn thou rt speaking like a silly child No I m speaking like a woman like a woman as finds out she s been cheated by men as she trusted and as has no help for it I m noane going to say any more about it It s me as has been wronged and as has to bear it only I thought I d tell yo both this much that yo might know somewhat why he went away and how I said my last word about it So indeed it seemed To all questions and remonstrances from Alice Sylvia turned a deaf ear She averted her face from Hester s sad wistful looks only when they were parting for the night at the top of the little staircase she turned and putting her arms round Hester s neck she laid her head on her neck and whispered Poor Hester poor poor Hester if yo an he had but been married together what a deal o sorrow would ha been spared to us all Hester pushed her away as she finished these words looked searchingly into her face her eyes and then followed Sylvia into her room where Bella lay sleeping shut the door and almost knelt down at Sylvia s feet clasping her and hiding her face in the folds of the other s gown Sylvia Sylvia she murmured some one has told you I thought no one knew it s no sin it s done away with now indeed it is it was long ago before yo were married but I cannot forget It was a shame perhaps to have thought on it iver when he niver thought o me but I niver believed as any one could ha found it out I m just fit to sink into t ground what wi my sorrow and my shame Hester was stopped by her own rising sobs immediately she was in Sylvia s arms Sylvia was sitting on the ground holding her and soothing her with caresses and broken words I m allays saying t wrong things said she It seems as if I were all upset to day and indeed I am she added alluding to the news of Kinraid s marriage she had yet to think upon But it wasn t yo Hester it were nothing yo iver said or did or looked for that matter It were yo r mother as let it out Oh mother mother wailed out Hester I niver thought as any one but God would ha known that I had iver for a day thought on his being more to me than a brother Sylvia made no reply only went on stroking Hester s smooth brown hair off which her cap had fallen Sylvia was thinking how strange life was and how love seemed to go all at cross purposes and was losing herself in bewilderment at the mystery of the world she was almost startled when Hester rose up and taking Sylvia s hands in both of hers and looking solemnly at her said Sylvia yo know what has been my trouble and my shame and I m sure yo re sorry for me for I will humble myself to yo and own that for many months before yo were married I felt my disappointment like a heavy burden laid on me by day and by night but now I ask yo if yo ve any pity for me for what I went through or if yo ve any love for me because of yo r dead mother s love for me or because of any fellowship or daily breadliness between us two put the hard thoughts of Philip away from out yo r heart he may ha done yo wrong anyway yo think that he has I niver knew him aught but kind and good but if he comes back from wheriver in th wide world he s gone to and there s not a night but I pray God to keep him and send him safe back yo put away the memory of past injury and forgive it all and be what yo can be Sylvia if you ve a mind to just the kind good wife he ought to have I cannot yo know nothing about it Hester Tell me then pleaded Hester No said Sylvia after a moment s hesitation I d do a deal for yo I would but I daren t forgive Philip even if I could I took a great oath again him Ay yo may look shocked at me but it s him as yo ought for to be shocked at if yo knew all I said I d niver forgive him I shall keep to my word I think I d better pray for his death then said Hester hopelessly and almost bitterly loosing her hold of Sylvia s hands If it weren t for baby theere I could think as it were my death as ud be best Them as one thinks t most on forgets one soonest It was Kinraid to whom she was alluding but Hester did not understand her and after standing for a moment in silence she kissed her and left her for the night CHAPTER XL AN UNEXPECTED MESSENGER After this agitation and these partial confidences no more was said on the subject of Philip for many weeks They avoided even the slightest allusion to him and none of them knew how seldom or how often he might be present in the minds of the others One day the little Bella was unusually fractious with some slight childish indisposition and Sylvia was obliged to have recourse to a never failing piece of amusement namely to take the child into the shop when the number of new bright coloured articles was sure to beguile the little girl out of her fretfulness She was walking along the high terrace of the counter kept steady by her mother s hand when mister Dawson s market cart once more stopped before the door But it was not missus Brunton who alighted now it was a very smartly dressed very pretty young lady who put one dainty foot before the other with care as if descending from such a primitive vehicle were a new occurrence in her life Then she looked up at the names above the shop door and after ascertaining that this was indeed the place she desired to find she came in blushing Is missus Hepburn at home she asked of Hester whose position in the shop brought her forwards to receive the customers while Sylvia drew Bella out of sight behind some great bales of red flannel Can I see her the sweet south country voice went on still addressing Hester Sylvia heard the inquiry and came forwards with a little rustic awkwardness feeling both shy and curious Will yo please walk this way ma am said she leading her visitor back into her own dominion of the parlour and leaving Bella to Hester s willing care You don t know me said the pretty young lady joyously But I think you knew my husband I am missus Kinraid A sob of surprise rose to Sylvia s lips she choked it down however and tried to conceal any emotion she might feel in placing a chair for her visitor and trying to make her feel welcome although if the truth must be told Sylvia was wondering all the time why her visitor came and how soon she would go You knew Captain Kinraid did you not said the young lady with innocent inquiry to which Sylvia s lips formed the answer Yes but no clear sound issued therefrom But I know your husband knew the captain is he at home yet Can I speak to him I do so want to see him Sylvia was utterly bewildered missus Kinraid this pretty joyous prosperous little bird of a woman Philip Charley s wife what could they have in common what could they know of each other All she could say in answer to missus Kinraid s eager questions and still more eager looks was that her husband was from home had been long from home she did not know where he was she did not know when he would come back missus Kinraid s face fell a little partly from her own real disappointment partly out of sympathy with the hopeless indifferent tone of Sylvia s replies missus Dawson told me he had gone away rather suddenly a year ago but I thought he might be come home by now I am expecting the captain early next month Oh how I should have liked to see mister Hepburn and to thank him for saving the captain s life What do yo mean asked Sylvia stirred out of all assumed indifference The captain is that not Charley she could not use that familiar name to the pretty young wife before her yo r husband Yes you knew him didn t you when he used to be staying with mister Corney his uncle Yes I knew him but I don t understand Will yo please to tell me all about it ma am said Sylvia faintly I thought your husband would have told you all about it I hardly know where to begin You know my husband is a sailor Sylvia nodded assent listening greedily her heart beating thick all the time And he s now a Commander in the Royal Navy all earned by his own bravery Oh I am so proud of him So could Sylvia have been if she had been his wife as it was she thought how often she had felt sure that he would be a great man some day And he has been at the siege of Acre Sylvia looked perplexed at these strange words and missus Kinraid caught the look saint Jean d Acre you know though it s fine saying you know when I didn t know a bit about it myself till the captain s ship was ordered there though I was the head girl at Miss Dobbin s in the geography class Acre is a seaport town not far from Jaffa which is the modern name for Joppa where saint Paul went to long ago you ve read of that I m sure and Mount Carmel where the prophet Elijah was once all in Palestine you know only the Turks have got it now But I don t understand yet said Sylvia plaintively I daresay it s all very true about saint Paul but please ma am will yo tell me about yo r husband and mine have they met again Yes at Acre I tell you said missus Kinraid with pretty petulance The Turks held the town and the French wanted to take it and we that is the British Fleet wouldn t let them So Sir Sidney Smith a commodore and a great friend of the captain s landed in order to fight the French and the captain and many of the sailors landed with him and it was burning hot and the poor captain was wounded and lay a dying of pain and thirst within the enemy s that is the French fire so that they were ready to shoot any one of his own side who came near him They thought he was dead himself you see as he was very near and would have been too if your husband had not come out of shelter and taken him up in his arms or on his back I couldn t make out which and carried him safe within the walls It couldn t have been Philip said Sylvia dubiously But it was The captain says so and he s not a man to be mistaken I thought I d got his letter with me and I would have read you a part of it but I left it at missus Dawson s in my desk and I can t send it to you blushing as she remembered certain passages in which the captain wrote very much like a lover or else I would But you may be quite sure it was your husband that ventured into all that danger to save his old friend s life or the captain would not have said so But they weren t they weren t not to call great friends I wish I d got the letter here I can t think how I could be so stupid I think I can almost remember the very words though I ve read them over so often He says Just as I gave up all hope I saw one Philip Hepburn a man whom I had known at Monkshaven and whom I had some reason to remember well I m sure he says so remember well he saw me too and came at the risk of his life to where I lay I fully expected he would be shot down and I shut my eyes not to see the end of my last chance The shot rained about him and I think he was hit but he took me up and carried me under cover I m sure he says that I ve read it over so often and he goes on and says how he hunted for mister Hepburn all through the ships as soon as ever he could but he could hear nothing of him either alive or dead Don t go so white for pity s sake said she suddenly startled by Sylvia s blanching colour You see because he couldn t find him alive is no reason for giving him up as dead because his name wasn t to be found on any of the ships books so the captain thinks he must have been known by a different name to his real one Only he says he should like to have seen him to have thanked him and he says he would give a deal to know what has become of him and as I was staying two days at missus Dawson s I told them I must come over to Monkshaven if only for five minutes just to hear if your good husband was come home and to shake his hands that helped to save my own dear captain I don t think it could have been Philip reiterated Sylvia Why not asked her visitor you say you don t know where he is why mightn t he have been there where the captain says he was But he wasn t a sailor nor yet a soldier Oh but he was I think somewhere the captain calls him a marine that s neither one nor the other but a little of both He ll be coming home some day soon and then you ll see Alice Rose came in at this minute and missus Kinraid jumped to the conclusion that she was Sylvia s mother and in her overflowing gratitude and friendliness to all the family of him who had saved the captain she went forward and shook the old woman s hand in that pleasant confiding way that wins all hearts Here s your daughter ma am said she to the half astonished half pleased Alice I m missus Kinraid the wife of the captain that used to be in these parts and I m come to bring her news of her husband and she don t half believe me though it s all to his credit I m sure Alice looked so perplexed that Sylvia felt herself bound to explain She says he s either a soldier or a sailor and a long way off at some place named in t Bible Philip Hepburn led away to be a soldier said she who had once been a Quaker Yes and a very brave one too and one that it would do my heart good to look upon exclaimed missus Kinraid He s been saving my husband s life in the Holy Land where Jerusalem is you know Nay said Alice a little scornfully I can forgive Sylvia for not being over keen to credit thy news Her man of peace becoming a man of war and suffered to enter Jerusalem which is a heavenly and a typical city at this time while me as is one of the elect is obliged to go on dwelling in Monkshaven just like any other body Nay but said missus Kinraid gently seeing she was touching on delicate ground I did not say he had gone to Jerusalem but my husband saw him in those parts and he was doing his duty like a brave good man ay and more than his duty and you may take my word for it he ll be at home some day soon and all I beg is that you ll let the captain and me know for I m sure if we can we ll both come and pay our respects to him And I m very glad I ve seen you said she rising to go and putting out her hand to shake that of Sylvia for besides being Hepburn s wife I m pretty sure I ve heard the captain speak of you and if ever you come to Bristol I hope you ll come and see us on Clifton Downs She went away leaving Sylvia almost stunned by the new ideas presented to her Philip a soldier Philip in a battle risking his life Most strange of all Charley and Philip once more meeting together not as rivals or as foes but as saviour and saved Add to all this the conviction strengthened by every word that happy loving wife had uttered that Kinraid s old passionate love for herself had faded away and vanished utterly its very existence apparently blotted out of his memory She had torn up her love for him by the roots but she felt as if she could never forget that it had been Hester brought back Bella to her mother She had not liked to interrupt the conversation with the strange lady before and now she found her mother in an obvious state of excitement Sylvia quieter than usual That was Kinraid s wife Hester Him that was th specksioneer as made such a noise about t place at the time of Darley s death He s now a captain a navy captain according to what she says And she d fain have us believe that Philip is abiding in all manner of Scripture places places as has been long done away with but the similitude whereof is in the heavens where the elect shall one day see them And she says Philip is there and a soldier and that he saved her husband s life and is coming home soon I wonder what John and Jeremiah ll say to his soldiering then It ll noane be to their taste I m thinking This was all very unintelligible to Hester and she would dearly have liked to question Sylvia but Sylvia sate a little apart with Bella on her knee her cheek resting on her child s golden curls and her eyes fixed and almost trance like as if she were seeing things not present So Hester had to be content with asking her mother as many elucidatory questions as she could and after all did not gain a very clear idea of what had really been said by missus Kinraid as her mother was more full of the apparent injustice of Philip s being allowed the privilege of treading on holy ground if indeed that holy ground existed on this side heaven which she was inclined to dispute than to confine herself to the repetition of words or narration of facts Suddenly Sylvia roused herself to a sense of Hester s deep interest and balked inquiries and she went over the ground rapidly Yo r mother says right she is his wife And he s away fighting and got too near t French as was shooting and firing all round him and just then according to her story Philip saw him and went straight into t midst o t shots and fetched him out o danger That s what she says and upholds And why should it not be asked Hester her cheek flushing But Sylvia only shook her head and said I cannot tell It may be so But they d little cause to be friends and it seems all so strange Philip a soldier and them meeting theere after all Hester laid the story of Philip s bravery to her heart she fully believed in it Sylvia pondered it more deeply still the causes for her disbelief or at any rate for her wonder were unknown to Hester Many a time she sank to sleep with the picture of the event narrated by missus Kinraid as present to her mind as her imagination or experience could make it first one figure prominent then another Many a morning she wakened up her heart beating wildly why she knew not till she shuddered at the remembrance of the scenes that had passed in her dreams scenes that might be acted in reality that very day for Philip might come back and then And where was Philip all this time these many weeks these heavily passing months CHAPTER XLI THE BEDESMAN OF saint SEPULCHRE Philip lay long ill on board the hospital ship If his heart had been light he might have rallied sooner but he was so depressed he did not care to live His shattered jaw bone his burnt and blackened face his many injuries of body were torture to both his physical frame and his sick weary heart No more chance for him if indeed there ever had been any of returning gay and gallant and thus regaining his wife s love This had been his poor foolish vision in the first hour of his enlistment and the vain dream had recurred more than once in the feverish stage of excitement which the new scenes into which he had been hurried as a recruit had called forth But that was all over now He knew that it was the most unlikely thing in the world to have come to pass and yet those were happy days when he could think of it as barely possible Now all he could look forward to was disfigurement feebleness and the bare pittance that keeps pensioners from absolute want Those around him were kind enough to him in their fashion and attended to his bodily requirements but they had no notion of listening to any revelations of unhappiness if Philip had been the man to make confidences of that kind As it was he lay very still in his berth seldom asking for anything and always saying he was better when the ship surgeon came round with his daily inquiries But he did not care to rally and was rather sorry to find that his case was considered so interesting in a surgical point of view that he was likely to receive a good deal more than the average amount of attention Perhaps it was owing to this that he recovered at all The doctors said it was the heat that made him languid for that his wounds and burns were all doing well at last and by and by they told him they had ordered him home His pulse sank under the surgeon s finger at the mention of the word but he did not say a word He was too indifferent to life and the world to have a will otherwise they might have kept their pet patient a little longer where he was Slowly passing from ship to ship as occasion served resting here and there in garrison hospitals Philip at length reached Portsmouth on the evening of a September day in seventeen ninety nine The transport ship in which he was was loaded with wounded and invalided soldiers and sailors all who could manage it in any way struggled on deck to catch the first view of the white coasts of England One man lifted his arm took off his cap and feebly waved it aloft crying Old England for ever in a faint shrill voice and then burst into tears and sobbed aloud Others tried to pipe up Rule Britannia while more sate weak and motionless looking towards the shores that once not so long ago they never thought to see again Philip was one of these his place a little apart from the other men He was muffled up in a great military cloak that had been given him by one of his officers he felt the September breeze chill after his sojourn in a warmer climate and in his shattered state of health As the ship came in sight of Portsmouth harbour the signal flags ran up the ropes the beloved Union Jack floated triumphantly over all Return signals were made from the harbour on board all became bustle and preparation for landing while on shore there was the evident movement of expectation and men in uniform were seen pressing their way to the front as if to them belonged the right of reception They were the men from the barrack hospital that had been signalled for come down with ambulance litters and other marks of forethought for the sick and wounded who were returning to the country for which they had fought and suffered With a dash and a great rocking swing the vessel came up to her appointed place and was safely moored Philip sat still almost as if he had no part in the cries of welcome the bustling care the loud directions that cut the air around him and pierced his nerves through and through But one in authority gave the order and Philip disciplined to obedience rose to find his knapsack and leave the ship Passive as he seemed to be he had his likings for particular comrades there was one especially a man as different from Philip as well could be to whom the latter had always attached himself a merry fellow from Somersetshire who was almost always cheerful and bright though Philip had overheard the doctors say he would never be the man he was before he had that shot through the side This marine would often sit making his fellows laugh and laughing himself at his own good humoured jokes till so terrible a fit of coughing came on that those around him feared he would die in the paroxysm After one of these fits he had gasped out some words which led Philip to question him a little and it turned out that in the quiet little village of Potterne far inland nestled beneath the high stretches of Salisbury Plain he had a wife and a child a little girl just the same age even to a week as Philip s own little Bella It was this that drew Philip towards the man and this that made Philip wait and go ashore along with the poor consumptive marine The litters had moved off towards the hospital the sergeant in charge had given his words of command to the remaining invalids who tried to obey them to the best of their power falling into something like military order for their march but soon very soon the weakest broke step and lagged behind and felt as if the rough welcomes and rude expressions of sympathy from the crowd around were almost too much for them Philip and his companion were about midway when suddenly a young woman with a child in her arms forced herself through the people between the soldiers who kept pressing on either side and threw herself on the neck of Philip s friend Oh Jem she sobbed I ve walked all the road from Potterne I ve never stopped but for food and rest for Nelly and now I ve got you once again I ve got you once again bless God for it She did not seem to see the deadly change that had come over her husband since she parted with him a ruddy young labourer she had got him once again as she phrased it and that was enough for her she kissed his face his hands his very coat nor would she be repulsed from walking beside him and holding his hand while her little girl ran along scared by the voices and the strange faces and clinging to her mammy s gown Jem coughed poor fellow he coughed his churchyard cough and Philip bitterly envied him envied his life envied his approaching death for was he not wrapped round with that woman s tender love and is not such love stronger than death Philip had felt as if his own heart was grown numb and as though it had changed to a cold heavy stone But at the contrast of this man s lot to his own he felt that he had yet the power of suffering left to him The road they had to go was full of people kept off in some measure by the guard of soldiers All sorts of kindly speeches and many a curious question were addressed to the poor invalids as they walked along Philip s jaw and the lower part of his face were bandaged up his cap was slouched down he held his cloak about him and shivered within its folds They came to a standstill from some slight obstacle at the corner of a street Down the causeway of this street a naval officer with a lady on his arm was walking briskly with a step that told of health and a light heart He stayed his progress though when he saw the convoy of maimed and wounded men he said something of which Philip only caught the words same uniform for his sake to the young lady whose cheek blanched a little but whose eyes kindled Then leaving her for an instant he pressed forward he was close to Philip poor sad Philip absorbed in his own thoughts so absorbed that he noticed nothing till he heard a voice at his ear having the Northumbrian burr the Newcastle inflections which he knew of old and that were to him like the sick memory of a deadly illness and then he turned his muffled face to the speaker though he knew well enough who it was and averted his eyes after one sight of the handsome happy man the man whose life he had saved once and would save again at the risk of his own but whom for all that he prayed that he might never meet more on earth Here my fine fellow take this forcing a crown piece into Philip s hand I wish it were more I d give you a pound if I had it with me Philip muttered something and held out the coin to Captain Kinraid of course in vain nor was there time to urge it back upon the giver for the obstacle to their progress was suddenly removed the crowd pressed upon the captain and his wife the procession moved on and Philip along with it holding the piece in his hand and longing to throw it far away Indeed he was on the point of dropping it hoping to do so unperceived when he bethought him of giving it to Jem s wife the footsore woman limping happily along by her husband s side They thanked him and spoke in his praise more than he could well bear It was no credit to him to give that away which burned his fingers as long as he kept it Philip knew that the injuries he had received in the explosion on board the Theseus would oblige him to leave the service He also believed that they would entitle him to a pension But he had little interest in his future life he was without hope and in a depressed state of health He remained for some little time stationary and then went through all the forms of dismissal on account of wounds received in service and was turned out loose upon the world uncertain where to go indifferent as to what became of him It was fine warm October weather as he turned his back upon the coast and set off on his walk northwards Green leaves were yet upon the trees the hedges were one flush of foliage and the wild rough flavoured fruits of different kinds the fields were tawny with the uncleared off stubble or emerald green with the growth of the aftermath The roadside cottage gardens were gay with hollyhocks and Michaelmas daisies and marigolds and the bright panes of the windows glittered through a veil of China roses The war was a popular one and as a natural consequence soldiers and sailors were heroes everywhere Philip s long drooping form his arm hung in a sling his face scarred and blackened his jaw bound up with a black silk handkerchief these marks of active service were reverenced by the rustic cottagers as though they had been crowns and sceptres Many a hard handed labourer left his seat by the chimney corner and came to his door to have a look at one who had been fighting the French and pushed forward to have a grasp of the stranger s hand as he gave back the empty cup into the good wife s keeping for the kind homely women were ever ready with milk or homebrewed to slake the feverish traveller s thirst when he stopped at their doors and asked for a drink of water At the village public house he had had a welcome of a more interested character for the landlord knew full well that his circle of customers would be large that night if it was only known that he had within his doors a soldier or a sailor who had seen service The rustic politicians would gather round Philip and smoke and drink and then question and discuss till they were drouthy again and in their sturdy obtuse minds they set down the extra glass and the supernumerary pipe to the score of patriotism Altogether human nature turned its sunny side out to Philip just now and not before he needed the warmth of brotherly kindness to cheer his shivering soul Day after day he drifted northwards making but the slow progress of a feeble man and yet this short daily walk tired him so much that he longed for rest for the morning to come when he needed not to feel that in the course of an hour or two he must be up and away He was toiling on with this longing at his heart when he saw that he was drawing near a stately city with a great old cathedral in the centre keeping solemn guard This place might be yet two or three miles distant he was on a rising ground looking down upon it A labouring man passing by observed his pallid looks and his languid attitude and told him for his comfort that if he turned down a lane to the left a few steps farther on he would find himself at the Hospital of saint Sepulchre where bread and beer were given to all comers and where he might sit him down and rest awhile on the old stone benches within the shadow of the gateway Obeying these directions Philip came upon a building which dated from the time of Henry the Fifth Some knight who had fought in the French wars of that time and had survived his battles and come home to his old halls had been stirred up by his conscience or by what was equivalent in those days his confessor to build and endow a hospital for twelve decayed soldiers and a chapel wherein they were to attend the daily masses he ordained to be said till the end of all time which eternity lasted rather more than a century pretty well for an eternity bespoken by a man for his soul and the souls of those whom he had slain There was a large division of the quadrangular building set apart for the priest who was to say these masses and to watch over the well being of the bedesmen In process of years the origin and primary purpose of the hospital had been forgotten by all excepting the local antiquaries and the place itself came to be regarded as a very pleasant quaint set of almshouses and the warden s office he who should have said or sung his daily masses was now called the warden and read daily prayers and preached a sermon on Sundays an agreeable sinecure Another legacy of old Sir Simon Bray was that of a small croft of land the rent or profits of which were to go towards giving to all who asked for it a manchet of bread and a cup of good beer This beer was so Sir Simon ordained to be made after a certain receipt which he left in which ground ivy took the place of hops But the receipt as well as the masses was modernized according to the progress of time Philip stood under a great broad stone archway the back door into the warden s house was on the right side a kind of buttery hatch was placed by the porter s door on the opposite side After some consideration Philip knocked at the closed shutter and the signal seemed to be well understood He heard a movement within the hatch was drawn aside and his bread and beer were handed to him by a pleasant looking old man who proved himself not at all disinclined for conversation You may sit down on yonder bench said he Nay man sit i the sun for it s a chilly place this and then you can look through the grate and watch th old fellows toddling about in th quad Philip sat down where the warm October sun slanted upon him and looked through the iron railing at the peaceful sight A great square of velvet lawn intersected diagonally with broad flag paved walks the same kind of walk going all round the quadrangle low two storied brick houses tinted gray and yellow by age and in many places almost covered with vines Virginian creepers and monthly roses before each house a little plot of garden ground bright with flowers and evidently tended with the utmost care on the farther side the massive chapel here and there an old or infirm man sunning himself or leisurely doing a bit of gardening or talking to one of his comrades the place looked as if care and want and even sorrow were locked out and excluded by the ponderous gate through which Philip was gazing It s a nice enough place bean t it said the porter interpreting Philip s looks pretty accurately Leastways for them as likes it I ve got a bit weary on it myself it s so far from th world as a man may say not a decent public within a mile and a half where one can hear a bit o news of an evening I think I could make myself very content here replied Philip That s to say if one were easy in one s mind Ay ay my man That s it everywhere Why I don t think that I could enjoy myself not even at th White Hart where they give you as good a glass of ale for twopence as anywhere i th four kingdoms I couldn t to say flavour my ale even there if my old woman lay a dying which is a sign as it s the heart and not the ale as makes the drink Just then the warden s back door opened and out came the warden himself dressed in full clerical costume He was going into the neighbouring city but he stopped to speak to Philip the wounded soldier and all the more readily because his old faded uniform told the warden s experienced eye that he had belonged to the Marines I hope you enjoy the victual provided for you by the founder of saint Sepulchre said he kindly You look but poorly my good fellow and as if a slice of good cold meat would help your bread down Thank you sir said Philip I m not hungry only weary and glad of a draught of beer You ve been in the Marines I see Where have you been serving I was at the siege of Acre last May sir At Acre Were you indeed Then perhaps you know my boy Harry He was in the th It was my company said Philip warming up a little Looking back upon his soldier s life it seemed to him to have many charms because it was so full of small daily interests Then did you know my son Lieutenant Pennington It was he that gave me this cloak sir when they were sending me back to England I had been his servant for a short time before I was wounded by the explosion on board the Theseus and he said I should feel the cold of the voyage He s very kind and I ve heard say he promises to be a first rate officer You shall have a slice of roast beef whether you want it or not said the warden ringing the bell at his own back door I recognize the cloak now the young scamp How soon he has made it shabby though he continued taking up a corner where there was an immense tear not too well botched up And so you were on board the Theseus at the time of the explosion Bring some cold meat here for the good man or stay Come in with me and then you can tell missus Pennington and the young ladies all you know about Harry and the siege and the explosion So Philip was ushered into the warden s house and made to eat roast beef almost against his will and he was questioned and cross questioned by three eager ladies all at the same time as it seemed to him He had given all possible details on the subjects about which they were curious and was beginning to consider how he could best make his retreat when the younger Miss Pennington went up to her father who had all this time stood with his hat on holding his coat tails over his arms with his back to the fire He bent his ear down a very little to hear some whispered suggestion of his daughter s nodded his head and then went on questioning Philip with kindly inquisitiveness and patronage as the rich do question the poor And where are you going to now Philip did not answer directly He wondered in his own mind where he was going At length he said Northwards I believe But perhaps I shall never reach there Haven t you friends Aren t you going to them There was again a pause a cloud came over Philip s countenance He said No I m not going to my friends I don t know that I ve got any left They interpreted his looks and this speech to mean that he had either lost his friends by death or offended them by enlisting The warden went on I ask because we ve got a cottage vacant in the mead Old Dobson who was with General Wolfe at the taking of Quebec died a fortnight ago With such injuries as yours I fear you ll never be able to work again But we require strict testimonials as to character he added with as penetrating a look as he could summon up at Philip Philip looked unmoved either by the offer of the cottage or the illusion to the possibility of his character not being satisfactory He was grateful enough in reality but too heavy at heart to care very much what became of him The warden and his family who were accustomed to consider a settlement at saint Sepulchre s as the sum of all good to a worn out soldier were a little annoyed at Philip s cool way of receiving the proposition The warden went on to name the contingent advantages Besides the cottage you would have a load of wood for firing on All Saints on Christmas and on Candlemas days a blue gown and suit of clothes to match every Michaelmas and a shilling a day to keep yourself in all other things Your dinner you would have with the other men in hall The warden himself goes into hall every day and sees that everything is comfortable and says grace added the warden s lady I know I seem stupid said Philip almost humbly not to be more grateful for it s far beyond what I iver expected or thought for again and it s a great temptation for I m just worn out with fatigue Several times I ve thought I must lie down under a hedge and just die for very weariness But once I had a wife and a child up in the north he stopped And are they dead asked one of the young ladies in a soft sympathizing tone Her eyes met Philip s full of dumb woe He tried to speak he wanted to explain more fully yet not to reveal the truth Well said the warden thinking he perceived the real state of things what I propose is this You shall go into old Dobson s house at once as a kind of probationary bedesman I ll write to Harry and get your character from him Stephen Freeman I think you said your name was Before I can receive his reply you ll have been able to tell how you d like the kind of life and at any rate you ll have the rest you seem to require in the meantime You see I take Harry s having given you that cloak as a kind of character added he smiling kindly Of course you ll have to conform to rules just like all the rest chapel at eight dinner at twelve lights out at nine but I ll tell you the remainder of our regulations as we walk across quad to your new quarters And thus Philip almost in spite of himself became installed in a bedesman s house at saint Sepulchre CHAPTER XLII A FABLE AT FAULT Philip took possession of the two rooms which had belonged to the dead Sergeant Dobson They were furnished sufficiently for every comfort by the trustees of the hospital Some little fragments of ornament some small articles picked up in distant countries a few tattered books remained in the rooms as legacies from their former occupant At first the repose of the life and the place was inexpressibly grateful to Philip He had always shrunk from encountering strangers and displaying his blackened and scarred countenance to them even where such disfigurement was most regarded as a mark of honour In saint Sepulchre s he met none but the same set day after day and when he had once told the tale of how it happened and submitted to their gaze it was over for ever if he so minded The slight employment his garden gave him there was a kitchen garden behind each house as well as the flower plot in front and the daily arrangement of his parlour and chamber were at the beginning of his time of occupation as much bodily labour as he could manage There was something stately and utterly removed from all Philip s previous existence in the forms observed at every day s dinner when the twelve bedesmen met in the large quaint hall and the warden came in his college cap and gown to say the long Latin grace which wound up with something very like a prayer for the soul of Sir Simon Bray It took some time to get a reply to ship letters in those times when no one could exactly say where the fleet might be found And before doctor Pennington had received the excellent character of Stephen Freeman which his son gladly sent in answer to his father s inquiries Philip had become restless and uneasy in the midst of all this peace and comfort Sitting alone over his fire in the long winter evenings the scenes of his past life rose before him his childhood his aunt Robson s care of him his first going to Foster s shop in Monkshaven Haytersbank Farm and the spelling lessons in the bright warm kitchen there Kinraid s appearance the miserable night of the Corneys party the farewell he had witnessed on Monkshaven sands the press gang and all the long consequences of that act of concealment poor Daniel Robson s trial and execution his own marriage his child s birth and then he came to that last day at Monkshaven and he went over and over again the torturing details the looks of contempt and anger the words of loathing indignation till he almost brought himself out of his extreme sympathy with Sylvia to believe that he was indeed the wretch she had considered him to be He forgot his own excuses for having acted as he had done though these excuses had at one time seemed to him to wear the garb of reasons After long thought and bitter memory came some wonder What was Sylvia doing now Where was she What was his child like his child as well as hers And then he remembered the poor footsore wife and the little girl she carried in her arms that was just the age of Bella he wished he had noticed that child more that a clear vision of it might rise up when he wanted to picture Bella One night he had gone round this mill wheel circle of ideas till he was weary to the very marrow of his bones To shake off the monotonous impression he rose to look for a book amongst the old tattered volumes hoping that he might find something that would sufficiently lay hold of him to change the current of his thoughts There was an old volume of Peregrine Pickle a book of sermons half an army list of seventeen seventy four and the Seven Champions of Christendom Philip took up this last which he had never seen before In it he read how Sir Guy Earl of Warwick went to fight the Paynim in his own country and was away for seven long years and when he came back his own wife Phillis the countess in her castle did not know the poor travel worn hermit who came daily to seek his dole of bread at her hands along with many beggars and much poor But at last when he lay a dying in his cave in the rock he sent for her by a secret sign known but to them twain And she came with great speed for she knew it was her lord who had sent for her and they had many sweet and holy words together before he gave up the ghost his head lying on her bosom The old story known to most people from their childhood was all new and fresh to Philip He did not quite believe in the truth of it because the fictitious nature of the histories of some of the other Champions of Christendom was too patent But he could not help thinking that this one might be true and that Guy and Phillis might have been as real flesh and blood long long ago as he and Sylvia had even been The old room the quiet moonlit quadrangle into which the cross barred casement looked the quaint aspect of everything that he had seen for weeks and weeks all this predisposed Philip to dwell upon the story he had just been reading as a faithful legend of two lovers whose bones were long since dust He thought that if he could thus see Sylvia himself unknown unseen could live at her gates so to speak and gaze upon her and his child some day too when he lay a dying he might send for her and in soft words of mutual forgiveness breathe his life away in her arms Or perhaps and so he lost himself and from thinking passed on to dreaming All night long Guy and Phillis Sylvia and his child passed in and out of his visions it was impossible to make the fragments of his dreams cohere but the impression made upon him by them was not the less strong for this He felt as if he were called to Monkshaven wanted at Monkshaven and to Monkshaven he resolved to go although when his reason overtook his feeling he knew perfectly how unwise it was to leave a home of peace and tranquillity and surrounding friendliness to go to a place where nothing but want and wretchedness awaited him unless he made himself known and if he did a deeper want a more woeful wretchedness would in all probability be his portion In the small oblong of looking glass hung against the wall Philip caught the reflection of his own face and laughed scornfully at the sight The thin hair lay upon his temples in the flakes that betoken long ill health his eyes were the same as ever and they had always been considered the best feature in his face but they were sunk in their orbits and looked hollow and gloomy As for the lower part of his face blackened contracted drawn away from his teeth the outline entirely changed by the breakage of his jaw bone he was indeed a fool if he thought himself fit to go forth to win back that love which Sylvia had forsworn As a hermit and a beggar he must return to Monkshaven and fall perforce into the same position which Guy of Warwick had only assumed But still he should see his Phillis and might feast his sad hopeless eyes from time to time with the sight of his child His small pension of sixpence a day would keep him from absolute want of necessaries So that very day he went to the warden and told him he thought of giving up his share in the bequest of Sir Simon Bray Such a relinquishment had never occurred before in all the warden s experience and he was very much inclined to be offended I must say that for a man not to be satisfied as a bedesman of saint Sepulchre s argues a very wrong state of mind and a very ungrateful heart I m sure sir it s not from any ingratitude for I can hardly feel thankful to you and to Sir Simon and to madam and the young ladies and all my comrades in the hospital and I niver expect to be either so comfortable or so peaceful again but But What can you have to say against the place then Not but what there are always plenty of applicants for every vacancy only I thought I was doing a kindness to a man out of Harry s company And you ll not see Harry either he s got his leave in March I m very sorry I should like to have seen the lieutenant again But I cannot rest any longer so far away from people I once knew Ten to one they re dead or removed or something or other by this time and it ll serve you right if they are Mind no one can be chosen twice to be a bedesman of saint Sepulchre s The warden turned away and Philip uneasy at staying disheartened at leaving went to make his few preparations for setting out once more on his journey northwards He had to give notice of his change of residence to the local distributor of pensions and one or two farewells had to be taken with more than usual sadness at the necessity for Philip under his name of Stephen Freeman had attached some of the older bedesmen a good deal to him from his unselfishness his willingness to read to them and to render them many little services and perhaps as much as anything by his habitual silence which made him a convenient recipient of all their garrulousness So before the time for his departure came he had the opportunity of one more interview with the warden of a more friendly character than that in which he gave up his bedesmanship And so far it was well and Philip turned his back upon saint Sepulchre s with his sore heart partly healed by his four months residence there He was stronger too in body more capable of the day after day walks that were required of him He had saved some money from his allowance as bedesman and from his pension and might occasionally have taken an outside place on a coach had it not been that he shrank from the first look of every stranger upon his disfigured face Yet the gentle wistful eyes and the white and faultless teeth always did away with the first impression as soon as people became a little acquainted with his appearance It was February when Philip left saint Sepulchre s It was the first week in April when he began to recognize the familiar objects between York and Monkshaven And now he began to hang back and to question the wisdom of what he had done just as the warden had prophesied that he would The last night of his two hundred mile walk he slept at the little inn at which he had been enlisted nearly two years before It was by no intention of his that he rested at that identical place Night was drawing on and in making as he thought a short cut he had missed his way and was fain to seek shelter where he might find it But it brought him very straight face to face with his life at that time and ever since His mad wild hopes half the result of intoxication as he now knew all dead and gone the career then freshly opening shut up against him now his youthful strength and health changed into premature infirmity and the home and the love that should have opened wide its doors to console him for all why in two years Death might have been busy and taken away from him his last feeble chance of the faint happiness of seeing his beloved without being seen or known of her All that night and all the next day the fear of Sylvia s possible death overclouded his heart It was strange that he had hardly ever thought of this before so strange that now when the terror came it took possession of him and he could almost have sworn that she must be lying dead in Monkshaven churchyard Or was it little Bella that blooming lovely babe whom he was never to see again There was the tolling of mournful bells in the distant air to his disturbed fancy and the cry of the happy birds the plaintive bleating of the new dropped lambs were all omens of evil import to him As well as he could he found his way back to Monkshaven over the wild heights and moors he had crossed on that black day of misery why he should have chosen that path he could not tell it was as if he were led and had no free will of his own The soft clear evening was drawing on and his heart beat thick and then stopped only to start again with fresh violence There he was at the top of the long steep lane that was in some parts a literal staircase leading down from the hill top into the High Street through the very entry up which he had passed when he shrank away from his former and his then present life There he stood looking down once more at the numerous irregular roofs the many stacks of chimneys below him seeking out that which had once been his own dwelling who dwelt there now The yellower gleams grew narrower the evening shadows broader and Philip crept down the lane a weary woeful man At every gap in the close packed buildings he heard the merry music of a band the cheerful sound of excited voices Still he descended slowly scarcely wondering what it could be for it was not associated in his mind with the one pervading thought of Sylvia When he came to the angle of junction between the lane and the High Street he seemed plunged all at once into the very centre of the bustle and he drew himself up into a corner of deep shadow from whence he could look out upon the street A circus was making its grand entry into Monkshaven with all the pomp of colour and of noise that it could muster Trumpeters in parti coloured clothes rode first blaring out triumphant discord Next came a gold and scarlet chariot drawn by six piebald horses and the windings of this team through the tortuous narrow street were pretty enough to look upon In the chariot sate kings and queens heroes and heroines or what were meant for such all the little boys and girls running alongside of the chariot envied them but they themselves were very much tired and shivering with cold in their heroic pomp of classic clothing All this Philip might have seen did see in fact but heeded not one jot Almost opposite to him not ten yards apart standing on the raised step at the well known shop door was Sylvia holding a child a merry dancing child up in her arms to see the show She too Sylvia was laughing for pleasure and for sympathy with pleasure She held the little Bella aloft that the child might see the gaudy procession the better and the longer looking at it herself with red lips apart and white teeth glancing through then she turned to speak to some one behind her Coulson as Philip saw the moment afterwards his answer made her laugh once again Philip saw it all her bonny careless looks her pretty matronly form her evident ease of mind and prosperous outward circumstances The years that he had spent in gloomy sorrow amongst wild scenes on land or by sea his life in frequent peril of a bloody end had gone by with her like sunny days all the more sunny because he was not there So bitterly thought the poor disabled marine as weary and despairing he stood in the cold shadow and looked upon the home that should have been his haven the wife that should have welcomed him the child that should have been his comfort He had banished himself from his home his wife had forsworn him his child was blossoming into intelligence unwitting of any father Wife and child and home were all doing well without him what madness had tempted him thither an hour ago like a fanciful fool he had thought she might be dead dead with sad penitence for her cruel words at her heart with mournful wonder at the unaccounted for absence of her child s father preying on her spirits and in some measure causing the death he had apprehended But to look at her there where she stood it did not seem as if she had had an hour s painful thought in all her blooming life Ay go in to the warm hearth mother and child now the gay cavalcade has gone out of sight and the chill of night has succeeded to the sun s setting Husband and father steal out into the cold dark street and seek some poor cheap lodging where you may rest your weary bones and cheat your more weary heart into forgetfulness in sleep The pretty story of the Countess Phillis who mourned for her husband s absence so long is a fable of old times or rather say Earl Guy never wedded his wife knowing that one she loved better than him was alive all the time she had believed him to be dead CHAPTER XLIII THE UNKNOWN A few days before that on which Philip arrived at Monkshaven Kester had come to pay Sylvia a visit As the earliest friend she had and also as one who knew the real secrets of her life Sylvia always gave him the warm welcome the cordial words and the sweet looks in which the old man delighted He had a sort of delicacy of his own which kept him from going to see her too often even when he was stationary at Monkshaven but he looked forward to the times when he allowed himself this pleasure as a child at school looks forward to its holidays The time of his service at Haytersbank had on the whole been the happiest in all his long monotonous years of daily labour Sylvia s father had always treated him with the rough kindness of fellowship Sylvia s mother had never stinted him in his meat or grudged him his share of the best that was going and once when he was ill for a few days in the loft above the cow house she had made him possets and nursed him with the same tenderness which he remembered his mother showing to him when he was a little child but which he had never experienced since then He had known Sylvia herself as bud and sweet promise of blossom and just as she was opening into the full blown rose and if she had been happy and prosperous might have passed out of the narrow circle of Kester s interests one sorrow after another came down upon her pretty innocent head and Kester s period of service to Daniel Robson her father was tragically cut short All this made Sylvia the great centre of the faithful herdsman s affection and Bella who reminded him of what Sylvia was when first Kester knew her only occupied the second place in his heart although to the child he was much more demonstrative of his regard than to the mother He had dressed himself in his Sunday best and although it was only Thursday had forestalled his Saturday s shaving he had provided himself with a paper of humbugs for the child humbugs being the north country term for certain lumps of toffy well flavoured with peppermint and now he sat in the accustomed chair as near to the door as might be in Sylvia s presence coaxing the little one who was not quite sure of his identity to come to him by opening the paper parcel and letting its sweet contents be seen She s like thee and yet she favours her feyther said he and the moment he had uttered the incautious words he looked up to see how Sylvia had taken the unpremeditated unusual reference to her husband His stealthy glance did not meet her eye but though he thought she had coloured a little she did not seem offended as he had feared It was true that Bella had her father s grave thoughtful dark eyes instead of her mother s gray ones out of which the childlike expression of wonder would never entirely pass away And as Bella slowly and half distrustfully made her way towards the temptation offered her she looked at Kester with just her father s look Sylvia said nothing in direct reply Kester almost thought she could not have heard him But by and by she said Yo ll have heared how Kinraid who s a captain now and a grand officer has gone and got married Nay said Kester in genuine surprise He niver has for sure Ay but he has said Sylvia And I m sure I dunnot see why he shouldn t Well well said Kester not looking up at her for he caught the inflections in the tones of her voice He were a fine stirrin chap yon an he were allays for doin summut an when he fund as he couldn t ha one thing as he d set his mind on a reckon he thought he mun put up wi another It ud be no putting up said Sylvia She were staying at Bessy Dawson s and she come here to see me she s as pretty a young lady as yo d see on a summer s day and a real lady too wi a fortune She didn t speak two words wi out bringing in her husband s name the captain as she called him An she come to see thee said Kester cocking his eye at Sylvia with the old shrewd look That were summut queer weren t it Sylvia reddened a good deal He s too fause to have spoken to her on me in t old way as he used for t speak to me I were nought to her but Philip s wife An what t dickins had she to do wi Philip asked Kester in intense surprise and so absorbed in curiosity that he let the humbugs all fall out of the paper upon the floor and the little Bella sat down plump in the midst of treasures as great as those fabled to exist on Tom Tiddler s ground Sylvia was again silent but Kester knowing her well was sure that she was struggling to speak and bided his time without repeating his question She said and I think her tale were true though I cannot get to t rights on it think on it as I will as Philip saved her husband s life somewheere nearabouts to Jerusalem She would have it that t captain for I think I ll niver ca him Kinraid again was in a great battle and were near upon being shot by t French when Philip our Philip come up and went right into t fire o t guns and saved her husband s life And she spoke as if both she and t captain were more beholden to Philip than words could tell And she come to see me to try and get news on him It s a queer kind o story said Kester meditatively A should ha thought as Philip were more likely to ha gi en him a shove into t thick on it than t help him out o t scrape Nay said Sylvia suddenly looking straight at Kester yo re out theere Philip had a deal o good in him And I dunnot think as he d ha gone and married another woman so soon if he d been i Kinraid s place An yo ve niver heared on Philip sin he left asked Kester after a while Niver nought but what she told me And she said that t captain made inquiry for him right and left as soon after that happened as might be and could hear niver a word about him No one had seen him or knowed his name Yo niver heared of his goin for t be a soldier persevered Kester Niver I ve told yo once It were unlike Philip to think o such a thing But thou mun ha been thinkin on him at times i a these years Bad as he d behaved hissel he were t feyther o thy little un What did ta think he had been agait on when he left here I didn t know I were noane so keen a thinking on him at first I tried to put him out o my thoughts a together for it made me like mad to think how he d stood between me and that other But I d begun to wonder and to wonder about him and to think I should like to hear as he were doing well I reckon I thought he were i London wheere he d been that time afore yo know and had allays spoke as if he d enjoyed hissel tolerable and then Molly Brunton told me on t other one s marriage and somehow it gave me a shake in my heart and I began for to wish I hadn t said all them words i my passion and then that fine young lady come wi her story and I ve thought a deal on it since and my mind has come out clear Philip s dead and it were his spirit as come to t other s help in his time o need I ve heard feyther say as spirits cannot rest i their graves for trying to undo t wrongs they ve done i their bodies Them s my conclusions said Kester solemnly A was fain for to hear what were yo r judgments first but them s the conclusions I comed to as soon as I heard t tale Let alone that one thing said Sylvia he were a kind good man It were a big deal on a one thing though said Kester It just spoilt yo r life my poor lass an might ha gone near to spoilin Charley Kinraid s too Men takes a deal more nor women to spoil their lives said Sylvia bitterly Not a mak o men I reckon lass Philip s life were pretty well on for bein spoilt at after he left here and it were mebbe a good thing he got rid on it so soon I wish I d just had a few kind words wi him I do said Sylvia almost on the point of crying Come lass it s as ill moanin after what s past as it ud be for me t fill my eyes wi weepin after t humbugs as this little wench o thine has grubbed up whilst we n been talkin Why there s not one on em left She s a sad spoilt little puss said Sylvia holding out her arms to the child who ran into them and began patting her mother s cheeks and pulling at the soft brown curls tucked away beneath the matronly cap Mammy spoils her and Hester spoils her Granny Rose doesn t spoil me said the child with quick intelligent discrimination interrupting her mother s list No but Jeremiah Foster does above a bit He ll come in fro t Bank Kester and ask for her a most ivery day And he ll bring her things in his pocket and she s so fause she allays goes straight to peep in and then he shifts t apple or t toy into another Eh but she s a little fause one half devouring the child with her kisses And he comes and takes her a walk oftentimes and he goes as slow as if he were quite an old man to keep pace wi Bella s steps I often run upstairs and watch em out o t window he doesn t care to have me with em he s so fain t have t child all to hisself She s a bonny un for sure said Kester but not so pretty as thou was Sylvie A ve niver tell d thee what a come for tho and it s about time for me t be goin A m off to t Cheviots to morrow morn t fetch home some sheep as Jonas Blundell has purchased It ll be a job o better nor two months a reckon It ll be a nice time o year said Sylvia a little surprised at Kester s evident discouragement at the prospect of the journey or absence he had often been away from Monkshaven for a longer time without seeming to care so much about it Well yo see it s a bit hard upon me for t leave my sister she as is t widow woman wheere a put up when a m at home Things is main an dear four pound loaves is at sixteenpence an there s a deal o talk on a famine i t land an whaten a paid for my victual an t bed i t lean to helped t oud woman a bit an she s sadly down i t mouth for she cannot hear on a lodger for t tak my place for a she s moved o er to t other side o t bridge for t be nearer t new buildings an t grand new walk they re makin round t cliffs thinkin she d be likelier t pick up a labourer as would be glad on a bed near his work A d ha liked to ha set her agait wi a sponsible lodger afore a d ha left for she s just so soft hearted any scamp may put upon her if he nobbut gets houd on her blind side Can I help her said Sylvia in her eager way I should be so glad and I ve a deal of money by me Nay my lass said Kester thou munnot go off so fast it were just what I were feared on i tellin thee I ve left her a bit o money and I ll mak shift to send her more it s just a kind word t keep up her heart when I m gone as I want If thou d step in and see her fra time to time and cheer her up a bit wi talkin to her on me I d tak it very kind and I d go off wi a lighter heart Then I m sure I ll do it for yo Kester I niver justly feel like mysel when yo re away for I m lonesome enough at times She and I will talk a t better about yo for both on us grieving after yo So Kester took his leave his mind set at ease by Sylvia s promise to go and see his sister pretty often during his absence in the North But Sylvia s habits were changed since she as a girl at Haytersbank liked to spend half her time in the open air running out perpetually without anything on to scatter crumbs to the poultry or to take a piece of bread to the old cart horse to go up to the garden for a handful of herbs or to clamber to the highest point around to blow the horn which summoned her father and Kester home to dinner Living in a town where it was necessary to put on hat and cloak before going out into the street and then to walk in a steady and decorous fashion she had only cared to escape down to the freedom of the sea shore until Philip went away and after that time she had learnt so to fear observation as a deserted wife that nothing but Bella s health would have been a sufficient motive to take her out of doors And as she had told Kester the necessity of giving the little girl a daily walk was very much lightened by the great love and affection which Jeremiah Foster now bore to the child Ever since the day when the baby had come to his knee allured by the temptation of his watch he had apparently considered her as in some sort belonging to him and now he had almost come to think that he had a right to claim her as his companion in his walk back from the Bank to his early dinner where a high chair was always placed ready for the chance of her coming to share his meal On these occasions he generally brought her back to the shop door when he returned to his afternoon s work at the Bank Sometimes however he would leave word that she was to be sent for from his house in the New Town as his business at the Bank for that day was ended Then Sylvia was compelled to put on her things and fetch back her darling and excepting for this errand she seldom went out at all on week days About a fortnight after Kester s farewell call this need for her visit to Jeremiah Foster s arose and it seemed to Sylvia that there could not be a better opportunity of fulfilling her promise and going to see the widow Dobson whose cottage was on the other side of the river low down on the cliff side just at the bend and rush of the full stream into the open sea She set off pretty early in order to go there first She found the widow with her house place tidied up after the midday meal and busy knitting at the open door not looking at her rapid clicking needles but gazing at the rush and recession of the waves before her yet not seeing them either rather seeing days long past She started into active civility as soon as she recognized Sylvia who was to her as a great lady never having known Sylvia Robson in her wild childish days Widow Dobson was always a little scandalized at her brother Christopher s familiarity with missus Hepburn She dusted a chair which needed no dusting and placed it for Sylvia sitting down herself on a three legged stool to mark her sense of the difference in their conditions for there was another chair or two in the humble dwelling and then the two fell into talk first about Kester whom his sister would persist in calling Christopher as if his dignity as her elder brother was compromised by any familiar abbreviation and by and by she opened her heart a little more A could wish as a d learned write of hand said she for a ve that for to tell Christopher as might set his mind at ease But yo see if a wrote him a letter he couldn t read it so a just comfort mysel wi thinkin nobody need learn writin unless they n got friends as can read But a reckon he d ha been glad to hear as a ve getten a lodger Here she nodded her head in the direction of the door opening out of the house place into the lean to which Sylvia had observed on drawing near the cottage and the recollection of the mention of which by Kester had enabled her to identify widow Dobson s dwelling He s a bed yonder the latter continued dropping her voice He s a queer lookin tyke but a don t think as he s a bad un When did he come said Sylvia remembering Kester s account of his sister s character and feeling as though it behoved her as Kester s confidante on this head to give cautious and prudent advice Eh a matter of a s ennight ago A m noane good at mindin time he s paid me his rent twice but then he were keen to pay aforehand He d comed in one night an sate him down afore he could speak he were so done up he d been on tramp this many a day a reckon Can yo give me a bed says he panting like after a bit A chap as a met near here says as yo ve a lodging for t let Ay says a a ha that but yo mun pay me a shilling a week for t Then my mind misgive me for a thought he hadn t a shilling i t world an yet if he hadn t a should just ha gi en him t bed a t same a m not one as can turn a dog out if he comes t me wearied o his life So he outs wi a shillin an lays it down on t table bout a word A ll not trouble yo long says he A m one as is best out o t world he says Then a thought as a d been a bit hard upon him An says I A m a widow woman and one as has getten but few friends for yo see a were low about our Christopher s goin away north so a m forced like to speak hard to folk but a ve made mysel some stirabout for my supper and if yo d like t share an share about wi me it s but puttin a sup more watter to t and God s blessing ll be on t just as same as if t were meal So he ups wi his hand afore his e en and says not a word At last he says Missus says he can God s blessing be shared by a sinner one o t devil s children says he For the Scriptur says he s t father o lies So a were puzzled like an at length a says Thou mun ask t parson that a m but a poor faint hearted widow woman but a ve allays had God s blessing somehow now a bethink me an a ll share it wi thee as far as my will goes So he raxes his hand across t table an mutters summat as he grips mine A thought it were Scriptur as he said but a d needed a my strength just then for t lift t pot off t fire it were t first vittle a d tasted sin morn for t famine comes down like stones on t head o us poor folk an a a said were just Coom along chap an fa to an God s blessing be on him as eats most An sin that day him and me s been as thick as thieves only he s niver telled me nought of who he is or wheere he comes fra But a think he s one o them poor colliers as has getten brunt i t coal pits for t be sure his face is a black wi fire marks an o late days he s ta en t his bed an just lies there sighing for one can hear him plain as dayleet thro t bit partition wa As a proof of this a sigh almost a groan startled the two women at this very moment Poor fellow said Sylvia in a soft whisper There s more sore hearts i t world than one reckons for But after a while she bethought her again of Kester s account of his sister s softness and she thought that it behoved her to give some good advice So she added in a sterner harder tone Still yo say yo know nought about him and tramps is tramps a t world over and yo re a widow and it behoves yo to be careful I think I d just send him off as soon as he s a bit rested Yo say he s plenty o money Nay A never said that A know nought about it He pays me aforehand an he pays me down for whativer a ve getten for him but that s but little he s noane up t his vittle though a ve made him some broth as good as a could make em I wouldn t send him away till he was well again if I were yo but I think yo d be better rid on him said Sylvia It would be different if yo r brother were in Monkshaven As she spoke she rose to go Widow Dobson held her hand in hers for a minute then the humble woman said Yo ll noane be vexed wi me missus if a cannot find i my heart t turn him out till he wants to go hissel For a wouldn t like to vex yo for Christopher s sake but a know what it is for t feel for friendless folk an choose what may come on it I cannot send him away No said Sylvia Why should I be vexed it s no business o mine Only I should send him away if I was yo He might go lodge wheere there was men folk who know t ways o tramps and are up to them Into the sunshine went Sylvia In the cold shadow the miserable tramp lay sighing She did not know that she had been so near to him towards whom her heart was softening day by day CHAPTER XLIV FIRST WORDS It was the spring of eighteen hundred Old people yet can tell of the hard famine of that year The harvest of the autumn before had failed the war and the corn laws had brought the price of corn up to a famine rate and much of what came into the market was unsound and consequently unfit for food yet hungry creatures bought it eagerly and tried to cheat disease by mixing the damp sweet clammy flour with rice or potato meal Rich families denied themselves pastry and all unnecessary and luxurious uses of wheat in any shape the duty on hair powder was increased and all these palliatives were but as drops in the ocean of the great want of the people Philip in spite of himself recovered and grew stronger and as he grew stronger hunger took the place of loathing dislike to food But his money was all spent and what was his poor pension of sixpence a day in that terrible year of famine Many a summer s night he walked for hours and hours round the house which once was his which might be his now with all its homely blessed comforts could he but go and assert his right to it But to go with authority and in his poor maimed guise assert that right he had need be other than Philip Hepburn So he stood in the old shelter of the steep crooked lane opening on to the hill out of the market place and watched the soft fading of the summer s eve into night the closing of the once familiar shop the exit of good comfortable William Coulson going to his own home his own wife his comfortable plentiful supper Then Philip there were no police in those days and scarcely an old watchman in that primitive little town would go round on the shady sides of streets and quickly glancing about him cross the bridge looking on the quiet rippling stream the gray shimmer foretelling the coming dawn over the sea the black masts and rigging of the still vessels against the sky he could see with his wistful eager eyes the shape of the windows the window of the very room in which his wife and child slept unheeding of him the hungry broken hearted outcast He would go back to his lodging and softly lift the latch of the door still more softly but never without an unspoken grateful prayer pass by the poor sleeping woman who had given him a shelter and her share of God s blessing she who like him knew not the feeling of satisfied hunger and then he laid him down on the narrow pallet in the lean to and again gave Sylvia happy lessons in the kitchen at Haytersbank and the dead were alive and Charley Kinraid the specksioneer had never come to trouble the hopeful gentle peace For widow Dobson had never taken Sylvia s advice The tramp known to her by the name of Freeman that in which he received his pension lodged with her still and paid his meagre shilling in advance weekly A shilling was meagre in those hard days of scarcity A hungry man might easily eat the produce of a shilling in a day Widow Dobson pleaded this to Sylvia as an excuse for keeping her lodger on to a more calculating head it might have seemed a reason for sending him away Yo see missus said she apologetically to Sylvia one evening as the latter called upon the poor widow before going to fetch little Bella it was now too hot for the child to cross the bridge in the full heat of the summer sun and Jeremiah would take her up to her supper instead Yo see missus there s not a many as ud take him in for a shillin when it goes so little way or if they did they d take it out on him some other way an he s not getten much else a reckon He ca s me granny but a m vast mista en if he s ten year younger nor me but he s getten a fine appetite of his own choose how young he may be an a can see as he could eat a deal more nor he s getten money to buy an it s few as can mak victual go farther nor me Eh missus but yo may trust me a ll send him off when times is better but just now it would be sendin him to his death for a ha plenty and to spare thanks be to God an yo r bonny face So Sylvia had to be content with the knowledge that the money she gladly gave to Kester s sister went partly to feed the lodger who was neither labourer nor neighbour but only just a tramp who she feared was preying on the good old woman Still the cruel famine cut sharp enough to penetrate all hearts and Sylvia an hour after the conversation recorded above was much touched on her return from Jeremiah Foster s with the little merry chattering Bella at seeing the feeble steps of one whom she knew by description must be widow Dobson s lodger turn up from the newly cut road which was to lead to the terrace walk around the North Cliff a road which led to no dwelling but widow Dobson s Tramp and vagrant he might be in the eyes of the law but whatever his character Sylvia could see him before her in the soft dusk creeping along over the bridge often stopping to rest and hold by some support and then going on again towards the town to which she and happy little Bella were wending A thought came over her she had always fancied that this unknown man was some fierce vagabond and had dreaded lest in the lonely bit of road between widow Dobson s cottage and the peopled highway he should fall upon her and rob her if he learnt that she had money with her and several times she had gone away without leaving the little gift she had intended because she imagined that she had seen the door of the small chamber in the lean to open softly while she was there as if the occupant whom widow Dobson spoke of as never leaving the house before dusk excepting once a week were listening for the chink of the coin in her little leathern purse Now that she saw him walking before her with heavy languid steps this fear gave place to pity she remembered her mother s gentle superstition which had prevented her from ever sending the hungry empty away for fear lest she herself should come to need bread Lassie said she to little Bella who held a cake which Jeremiah s housekeeper had given her tight in her hand yon poor man theere is hungry will Bella give him her cake and mother will make her another to morrow twice as big For this consideration and with the feeling of satisfaction which a good supper not an hour ago gives even to the hungry stomach of a child of three years old Bella after some thought graciously assented to the sacrifice Sylvia stopped the cake in her hand and turned her back to the town and to the slow wayfarer in front Under the cover of her shawl she slipped a half crown deep into the crumb of the cake and then restoring it to little Bella she gave her her directions Mammy will carry Bella and when Bella goes past the poor man she shall give him the cake over mammy s shoulder Poor man is so hungry and Bella and mammy have plenty to eat and to spare The child s heart was touched by the idea of hunger and her little arm was outstretched ready for the moment her mother s hurried steps took her brushing past the startled trembling Philip Poor man eat this Bella not hungry They were the first words he had ever heard his child utter The echoes of them rang in his ears as he stood endeavouring to hide his disfigured face by looking over the parapet of the bridge down upon the stream running away towards the ocean into which his hot tears slowly fell unheeded by the weeper Then he changed the intention with which he had set out upon his nightly walk and turned back to his lodging Of course the case was different with Sylvia she would have forgotten the whole affair very speedily if it had not been for little Bella s frequent recurrence to the story of the hungry man which had touched her small sympathies with the sense of an intelligible misfortune She liked to act the dropping of the bun into the poor man s hand as she went past him and would take up any article near her in order to illustrate the gesture she had used One day she got hold of Hester s watch for this purpose as being of the same round shape as the cake and though Hester for whose benefit the child was repeating the story in her broken language for the third or fourth time tried to catch the watch as it was intended that she should she being the representative of the hungry man for the time being it went to the ground with a smash that frightened the little girl and she began to cry at the mischief she had done Don t cry Bella said Hester Niver play with watches again I didn t see thee at mine or I d ha stopped thee in time But I ll take it to old Darley s on th quay side and maybe he ll soon set it to rights again Only Bella must niver play with watches again Niver no more promised the little sobbing child And that evening Hester took her watch down to old Darley s This William Darley was the brother of the gardener at the rectory the uncle to the sailor who had been shot by the press gang years before and to his bed ridden sister He was a clever mechanician and his skill as a repairer of watches and chronometers was great among the sailors with whom he did a very irregular sort of traffic conducted often without much use of money but rather on the principle of barter they bringing him foreign coins and odd curiosities picked up on their travels in exchange for his services to their nautical instruments or their watches If he had ever had capital to extend his business he might have been a rich man but it is to be doubted whether he would have been as happy as he was now in his queer little habitation of two rooms the front one being both shop and workshop the other serving the double purpose of bedroom and museum The skill of this odd tempered shabby old man was sometimes sought by the jeweller who kept the more ostentatious shop in the High Street but before Darley would undertake any tickle piece of delicate workmanship for the other he sneered at his ignorance and taunted and abused him well Yet he had soft places in his heart and Hester Rose had found her way to one by her patient enduring kindness to his bed ridden niece He never snarled at her as he did at too many and on the few occasions when she had asked him to do anything for her he had seemed as if she were conferring the favour on him not he on her and only made the smallest possible charge She found him now sitting where he could catch the most light for his work spectacles on nose and microscope in hand He took her watch and examined it carefully without a word in reply to her Then he began to open it and take it to pieces in order to ascertain the nature of the mischief Suddenly he heard her catch her breath with a checked sound of surprise He looked at her from above his spectacles she was holding a watch in her hand which she had just taken up off the counter What s amiss wi thee now said Darley Hast ta niver seen a watch o that mak afore or is it them letters on t back as is so wonderful Yes it was those letters that interlaced old fashioned cipher That Z H that she knew of old stood for Zachary Hepburn Philip s father She knew how Philip valued this watch She remembered having seen it in his hands the very day before his disappearance when he was looking at the time in his annoyance at Sylvia s detention in her walk with baby Hester had no doubt that he had taken this watch as a matter of course away with him She felt sure that he would not part with this relic of his dead father on any slight necessity Where then was Philip by what chance of life or death had this his valued property found its way once more to Monkshaven Where did yo get this she asked in as quiet a manner as she could assume sick with eagerness as she was To no one else would Darley have answered such a question He made a mystery of most of his dealings not that he had anything to conceal but simply because he delighted in concealment He took it out of her hands looked at the number marked inside and the maker s name Natteau Gent York and then replied A man brought it me yesterday at nightfall for t sell it It s a matter o forty years old Natteau Gent has been dead and in his grave pretty nigh as long as that But he did his work well when he were alive and so I gave him as brought it for t sell about as much as it were worth i good coin A tried him first i t bartering line but he wouldn t bite like enough he wanted food many a one does now a days Who was he gasped Hester Bless t woman how should I know What was he like how old tell me My lass a ve summut else to do wi my eyes than go peering into men s faces i t dusk light But yo must have had light for t judge about the watch Eh how sharp we are A d a candle close to my nose But a didn t tak it up for to gaze int his face That wouldn t be manners to my thinking Hester was silent Then Darley s heart relented If yo re so set upo knowing who t fellow was a could mebbe put yo on his tracks How said Hester eagerly I do want to know I want to know very much and for a good reason Well then a ll tell yo He s a queer tyke that one is A ll be bound he were sore pressed for t brass yet he out s wi a good half crown all wrapped up i paper and he axes me t make a hole in it Says I It s marring good king s coin at after a ve made a hole in t it ll never pass current again So he mumbles and mumbles but for a that it must needs be done and he s left it here and is t call for t to morrow at e en Oh William Darley said Hester clasping her hands tight together Find out who he is where he is anything everything about him and I will so bless yo Darley looked at her sharply but with some signs of sympathy on his grave face My woman he said a could ha wished as you d niver seen t watch It s poor thankless work thinking too much on one o God s creatures But a ll do thy bidding he continued in a lighter and different tone A m a cute old badger when need be Come for thy watch in a couple o days and a ll tell yo all as a ve learnt So Hester went away her heart beating with the promise of knowing something about Philip how much how little in these first moments she dared not say even to herself Some sailor newly landed from distant seas might have become possessed of Philip s watch in far off latitudes in which case Philip would be dead That might be She tried to think that this was the most probable way of accounting for the watch She could be certain as to the positive identity of the watch being in William Darley s possession Again it might be that Philip himself was near at hand was here in this very place starving as too many were for insufficiency of means to buy the high priced food And then her heart burnt within her as she thought of the succulent comfortable meals which Sylvia provided every day nay three times a day for the household in the market place at the head of which Philip ought to have been but his place knew him not For Sylvia had inherited her mother s talent for housekeeping and on her in Alice s decrepitude and Hester s other occupations in the shop devolved the cares of due provision for the somewhat heterogeneous family And Sylvia Hester groaned in heart over the remembrance of Sylvia s words I can niver forgive him the wrong he did to me that night when Hester had come and clung to her making the sad shameful confession of her unreturned love What could ever bring these two together again Could Hester herself ignorant of the strange mystery of Sylvia s heart as those who are guided solely by obedience to principle must ever be of the clue to the actions of those who are led by the passionate ebb and flow of impulse Could Hester herself Oh how should she speak how should she act if Philip were near if Philip were sad and in miserable estate Her own misery at this contemplation of the case was too great to bear and she sought her usual refuge in the thought of some text some promise of Scripture which should strengthen her faith With God all things are possible said she repeating the words as though to lull her anxiety to rest Yes with God all things are possible But ofttimes He does his work with awful instruments There is a peacemaker whose name is Death CHAPTER XLV SAVED AND LOST Hester went out on the evening of the day after that on which the unknown owner of the half crown had appointed to call for it again at William Darley s She had schooled herself to believe that time and patience would serve her best Her plan was to obtain all the knowledge about Philip that she could in the first instance and then if circumstances allowed it as in all probability they would to let drop by drop of healing peacemaking words and thoughts fall on Sylvia s obdurate unforgiving heart So Hester put on her things and went out down towards the old quay side on that evening after the shop was closed Poor little Sylvia She was unforgiving but not obdurate to the full extent of what Hester believed Many a time since Philip went away had she unconsciously missed his protecting love when folks spoke shortly to her when Alice scolded her as one of the non elect when Hester s gentle gravity had something of severity in it when her own heart failed her as to whether her mother would have judged that she had done well could that mother have known all as possibly she did by this time Philip had never spoken otherwise than tenderly to her during the eighteen months of their married life except on the two occasions before recorded once when she referred to her dream of Kinraid s possible return and once again on the evening of the day before her discovery of his concealment of the secret of Kinraid s involuntary disappearance After she had learnt that Kinraid was married her heart had still more strongly turned to Philip she thought that he had judged rightly in what he had given as the excuse for his double dealing she was even more indignant at Kinraid s fickleness than she had any reason to be and she began to learn the value of such enduring love as Philip s had been lasting ever since the days when she first began to fancy what a man s love for a woman should be when she had first shrunk from the tone of tenderness he put into his especial term for her a girl of twelve Little lassie as he was wont to call her But across all this relenting came the shadow of her vow like the chill of a great cloud passing over a sunny plain How should she decide what would be her duty if he came again and once more called her wife She shrank from such a possibility with all the weakness and superstition of her nature and this it was which made her strengthen herself with the re utterance of unforgiving words and shun all recurrence to the subject on the rare occasion when Hester had tried to bring it back with a hope of softening the heart which to her appeared altogether hardened on this one point Now on this bright summer evening while Hester had gone down to the quay side Sylvia stood with her out of door things on in the parlour rather impatiently watching the sky full of hurrying clouds and flushing with the warm tints of the approaching sunset She could not leave Alice the old woman had grown so infirm that she was never left by her daughter and Sylvia at the same time yet Sylvia had to fetch her little girl from the New Town where she had been to her supper at Jeremiah Foster s Hester had said that she should not be away more than a quarter of an hour and Hester was generally so punctual that any failure of hers in this respect appeared almost in the light of an injury on those who had learnt to rely upon her Sylvia wanted to go and see widow Dobson and learn when Kester might be expected home His two months were long past and Sylvia had heard through the Fosters of some suitable and profitable employment for him of which she thought he would be glad to know as soon as possible It was now some time since she had been able to get so far as across the bridge and for aught she knew Kester might already be come back from his expedition to the Cheviots Kester was come back Scarce five minutes had elapsed after these thoughts had passed through her mind before his hasty hand lifted the latch of the kitchen door his hurried steps brought him face to face with her The smile of greeting was arrested on her lips by one look at him his eyes staring wide the expression on his face wild and yet pitiful That s reet said he seeing that her things were already on Thou re wanted sore Come along Oh dear God my child cried Sylvia clutching at the chair near her but recovering her eddying senses with the strong fact before her that whatever the terror was she was needed to combat it Ay thy child said Kester taking her almost roughly by the arm and drawing her away with him out through the open doors on to the quay side Tell me said Sylvia faintly is she dead She s safe now said Kester It s not her it s him as saved her as needs yo if iver husband needed a wife He who O Philip Philip is it yo at last Unheeding what spectators might see her movements she threw up her arms and staggered against the parapet of the bridge they were then crossing He Philip saved Bella Bella our little Bella as got her dinner by my side and went out wi Jeremiah as well as could be I cannot take it in tell me Kester She kept trembling so much in voice and in body that he saw she could not stir without danger of falling until she was calmed as it was her eyes became filmy from time to time and she drew her breath in great heavy pants leaning all the while against the wall of the bridge It were no illness Kester began T little un had gone for a walk wi Jeremiah Foster an he were drawn for to go round t edge o t cliff wheere they s makin t new walk reet o er t sea But it s but a bit on a pathway now an t one was too oud an t other too young for t see t water comin along wi great leaps it s allays for comin high up again t cliff an this

her to land She s noane t worse for her bath a ll be bound I mun go let me said Sylvia struggling with his detaining hand which he had laid upon her in the fear that she would slip down to the ground in a faint so ashen gray was her face Let me Bella I mun go see her He let go and she stood still suddenly feeling herself too weak to stir Now if you ll try a bit to be quiet a ll lead yo along but yo mun be a steady and brave lass I ll be aught if yo only let me see Bella said Sylvia humbly An yo niver ax at after him as saved her said Kester reproachfully I know it s Philip she whispered and yo said he wanted me so I know he s safe and Kester I think I m feared on him and I d like to gather courage afore seeing him and a look at Bella would give me courage It were a terrible time when I saw him last and I did say Niver think on what thou did say think on what thou will say to him now for he lies a dyin He were dashed again t cliff an bruised sore in his innards afore t men as come wi a boat could pick him up She did not speak she did not even tremble now she set her teeth together and holding tight by Kester she urged him on but when they came to the end of the bridge she seemed uncertain which way to turn This way said Kester He s been lodgin wi Sally this nine week an niver a one about t place as knowed him he s been i t wars an getten his face brunt And he was short o food moaned Sylvia and we had plenty and I tried to make yo r sister turn him out and send him away Oh will God iver forgive me Muttering to herself breaking her mutterings with sharp cries of pain Sylvia with Kester s help reached widow Dobson s house It was no longer a quiet lonely dwelling Several sailors stood about the door awaiting in silent anxiety for the verdict of the doctor who was even now examining Philip s injuries Two or three women stood talking eagerly in low voices in the doorway But when Sylvia drew near the men fell back and the women moved aside as though to allow her to pass all looking upon her with a certain amount of sympathy but perhaps with rather more of antagonistic wonder as to how she was taking it she who had been living in ease and comfort while her husband s shelter was little better than a hovel her husband s daily life a struggle with starvation for so much of the lodger at widow Dobson s was popularly known and any distrust of him as a stranger and a tramp was quite forgotten now Sylvia felt the hardness of their looks the hardness of their silence but it was as nothing to her If such things could have touched her at this moment she would not have stood still right in the midst of their averted hearts and murmured something to Kester He could not hear the words uttered by that hoarse choked voice until he had stooped down and brought his ear to the level of her mouth We d better wait for t doctors to come out she said again She stood by the door shivering all over almost facing the people in the road but with her face turned a little to the right so that they thought she was looking at the pathway on the cliff side a hundred yards or so distant below which the hungry waves still lashed themselves into high ascending spray while nearer to the cottage where their force was broken by the bar at the entrance to the river they came softly lapping up the shelving shore Sylvia saw nothing of all this though it was straight before her eyes She only saw a blurred mist she heard no sound of waters though it filled the ears of those around Instead she heard low whispers pronouncing Philip s earthly doom For the doctors were both agreed his internal injury was of a mortal kind although as the spine was severely injured above the seat of the fatal bruise he had no pain in the lower half of his body They had spoken in so low a tone that John Foster standing only a foot or so away had not been able to hear their words But Sylvia heard each syllable there where she stood outside shivering all over in the sultry summer evening She turned round to Kester I mun go to him Kester thou ll see that noane come in to us when t doctors come out She spoke in a soft calm voice and he not knowing what she had heard made some easy conditional promise Then those opposite to the cottage door fell back for they could see the grave doctors coming out and John Foster graver sadder still following them Without a word to them without a word even of inquiry which many outside thought and spoke of as strange white faced dry eyed Sylvia slipped into the house out of their sight And the waves kept lapping on the shelving shore The room inside was dark all except the little halo or circle of light made by a dip candle Widow Dobson had her back to the bed her bed on to which Philip had been borne in the hurry of terror as to whether he was alive or whether he was dead She was crying crying quietly but the tears down falling fast as with her back to the lowly bed she was gathering up the dripping clothes cut off from the poor maimed body by the doctors orders She only shook her head as she saw Sylvia spirit like steal in white noiseless and upborne from earth But noiseless as her step might be he heard he recognized and with a sigh he turned his poor disfigured face to the wall hiding it in the shadow He knew that she was by him that she had knelt down by his bed that she was kissing his hand over which the languor of approaching death was stealing But no one spoke At length he said his face still averted speaking with an effort Little lassie forgive me now I cannot live to see the morn There was no answer only a long miserable sigh and he felt her soft cheek laid upon his hand and the quiver that ran through her whole body I did thee a cruel wrong he said at length I see it now But I m a dying man I think that God will forgive me and I ve sinned against Him try lassie try my Sylvie will not thou forgive me He listened intently for a moment He heard through the open window the waves lapping on the shelving shore But there came no word from her only that same long shivering miserable sigh broke from her lips at length Child said he once more I ha made thee my idol and if I could live my life o er again I would love my God more and thee less and then I shouldn t ha sinned this sin against thee But speak one word of love to me one little word that I may know I have thy pardon Oh Philip Philip she moaned thus adjured Then she lifted her head and said Them were wicked wicked words as I said and a wicked vow as I vowed and Lord God Almighty has ta en me at my word I m sorely punished Philip I am indeed He pressed her hand he stroked her cheek But he asked for yet another word I did thee a wrong In my lying heart I forgot to do to thee as I would have had thee to do to me And I judged Kinraid in my heart Thou thought as he was faithless and fickle she answered quickly and so he were He were married to another woman not so many weeks at after thou went away Oh Philip Philip and now I have thee back and Dying was the word she would have said but first the dread of telling him what she believed he did not know and next her passionate sobs choked her I know said he once more stroking her cheek and soothing her with gentle caressing hand Little lassie he said after a while when she was quiet from very exhaustion I niver thought to be so happy again God is very merciful She lifted up her head and asked wildly Will He iver forgive me think yo I drove yo out fra yo r home and sent yo away to t wars wheere yo might ha getten yo r death and when yo come back poor and lone and weary I told her for t turn yo out for a I knew yo must be starving in these famine times I think I shall go about among them as gnash their teeth for iver while yo are wheere all tears are wiped away No said Philip turning round his face forgetful of himself in his desire to comfort her God pities us as a father pities his poor wandering children the nearer I come to death the clearer I see Him But you and me have done wrong to each other yet we can see now how we were led to it we can pity and forgive one another I m getting low and faint lassie but thou must remember this God knows more and is more forgiving than either you to me or me to you I think and do believe as we shall meet together before His face but then I shall ha learnt to love thee second to Him not first as I have done here upon the earth Then he was silent very still Sylvia knew widow Dobson had brought it in that there was some kind of medicine sent by the hopeless doctors lying upon the table hard by and she softly rose and poured it out and dropped it into the half open mouth Then she knelt down again holding the hand feebly stretched out to her and watching the faint light in the wistful loving eyes And in the stillness she heard the ceaseless waves lapping against the shelving shore Something like an hour before this time which was the deepest midnight of the summer s night Hester Rose had come hurrying up the road to where Kester and his sister sate outside the open door keeping their watch under the star lit sky all others having gone away one by one even John and Jeremiah Foster having returned to their own house where the little Bella lay sleeping a sound and healthy slumber after her perilous adventure Hester had heard but little from William Darley as to the owner of the watch and the half crown but he was chagrined at the failure of all his skilful interrogations to elicit the truth and promised her further information in a few days with all the more vehemence because he was unaccustomed to be baffled And Hester had again whispered to herself Patience Patience and had slowly returned back to her home to find that Sylvia had left it why she did not at once discover But growing uneasy as the advancing hours neither brought Sylvia nor little Bella to their home she had set out for Jeremiah Foster s as soon as she had seen her mother comfortably asleep in her bed and then she had learnt the whole story bit by bit as each person who spoke broke in upon the previous narration with some new particular But from no one did she clearly learn whether Sylvia was with her husband or not and so she came speeding along the road breathless to where Kester sate in wakeful mournful silence his sister s sleeping head lying on his shoulder the cottage door open both for air and that there might be help within call if needed and the dim slanting oblong of the interior light lying across the road Hester came panting up too agitated and breathless to ask how much was truth of the fatal hopeless tale which she had heard Kester looked at her without a word Through this solemn momentary silence the lapping of the ceaseless waves was heard as they came up close on the shelving shore He Philip said she Kester shook his head sadly And his wife Sylvia said Hester In there with him alone whispered Kester Hester turned away and wrung her hands together Oh Lord God Almighty said she was I not even worthy to bring them together at last And she went away slowly and heavily back to the side of her sleeping mother But Thy will be done was on her quivering lips before she lay down to her rest The soft gray dawn lightens the darkness of a midsummer night soon after two o clock Philip watched it come knowing that it was his last sight of day as we reckon days on earth He had been often near death as a soldier once or twice as when he rushed into fire to save Kinraid his chances of life had been as one to a hundred but yet he had had a chance But now there was the new feeling the last new feeling which we shall any of us experience in this world that death was not only close at hand but inevitable He felt its numbness stealing up him stealing up him But the head was clear the brain more than commonly active in producing vivid impressions It seemed but yesterday since he was a little boy at his mother s knee wishing with all the earnestness of his childish heart to be like Abraham who was called the friend of God or David who was said to be the man after God s own heart or saint John who was called the Beloved As very present seemed the day on which he made resolutions of trying to be like them it was in the spring and some one had brought in cowslips and the scent of those flowers was in his nostrils now as he lay a dying his life ended his battles fought his time for being good over and gone the opportunity once given in all eternity past All the temptations that had beset him rose clearly before him the scenes themselves stood up in their solid materialism he could have touched the places the people the thoughts the arguments that Satan had urged in behalf of sin were reproduced with the vividness of a present time And he knew that the thoughts were illusions the arguments false and hollow for in that hour came the perfect vision of the perfect truth he saw the way to escape which had come along with the temptation now the strong resolve of an ardent boyhood with all a life before it to show the world what a Christian might be and then the swift terrible now when his naked guilty soul shrank into the shadow of God s mercy seat out of the blaze of His anger against all those who act a lie His mind was wandering and he plucked it back Was this death in very deed He tried to grasp at the present the earthly present fading quick away He lay there on the bed on Sally Dobson s bed in the house place not on his accustomed pallet in the lean to He knew that much And the door was open into the still dusk night and through the open casement he could hear the lapping of the waves on the shelving shore could see the soft gray dawn over the sea he knew it was over the sea he saw what lay unseen behind the poor walls of the cottage And it was Sylvia who held his hand tight in her warm living grasp it was his wife whose arm was thrown around him whose sobbing sighs shook his numbed frame from time to time God bless and comfort my darling he said to himself She knows me now All will be right in heaven in the light of God s mercy And then he tried to remember all that he had ever read about God and all that the blessed Christ that bringeth glad tidings of great joy unto all people had said of the Father from whom He came Those sayings dropped like balm down upon his troubled heart and brain He remembered his mother and how she had loved him and he was going to a love wiser tenderer deeper than hers As he thought this he moved his hands as if to pray but Sylvia clenched her hold and he lay still praying all the same for her for his child and for himself Then he saw the sky redden with the first flush of dawn he heard Kester s long drawn sigh of weariness outside the open door He had seen widow Dobson pass through long before to keep the remainder of her watch on the bed in the lean to which had been his for many and many a sleepless and tearful night Those nights were over he should never see that poor chamber again though it was scarce two feet distant He began to lose all sense of the comparative duration of time it seemed as long since kind Sally Dobson had bent over him with soft lingering look before going into the humble sleeping room as long as it was since his boyhood when he stood by his mother dreaming of the life that should be his with the scent of the cowslips tempting him to be off to the woodlands where they grew Then there came a rush and an eddying through his brain his soul trying her wings for the long flight Again he was in the present he heard the waves lapping against the shelving shore once again And now his thoughts came back to Sylvia Once more he spoke aloud in a strange and terrible voice which was not his Every sound came with efforts that were new to him My wife Sylvie Once more forgive me all She sprang up she kissed his poor burnt lips she held him in her arms she moaned and said Oh wicked me forgive me me Philip Then he spoke and said Lord forgive us our trespasses as we forgive each other And after that the power of speech was conquered by the coming death He lay very still his consciousness fast fading away yet coming back in throbs so that he knew it was Sylvia who touched his lips with cordial and that it was Sylvia who murmured words of love in his ear He seemed to sleep at last and so he did a kind of sleep but the light of the red morning sun fell on his eyes and with one strong effort he rose up and turned so as once more to see his wife s pale face of misery In heaven he cried and a bright smile came on his face as he fell back on his pillow Not long after Hester came the little Bella scarce awake in her arms with the purpose of bringing his child to see him ere yet he passed away Hester had watched and prayed through the livelong night And now she found him dead and Sylvia tearless and almost unconscious lying by him her hand holding his her other thrown around him Kester poor old man was sobbing bitterly but she not at all Then Hester bore her child to her and Sylvia opened wide her miserable eyes and only stared as if all sense was gone from her But Bella suddenly rousing up at the sight of the poor scarred peaceful face cried out Poor man who was so hungry Is he not hungry now No said Hester softly The former things are passed away and he is gone where there is no more sorrow and no more pain But then she broke down into weeping and crying Sylvia sat up and looked at her Why do yo cry Hester she said Yo niver said that yo wouldn t forgive him as long as yo lived Yo niver broke the heart of him that loved yo and let him almost starve at yo r very door Oh Philip my Philip tender and true Then Hester came round and closed the sad half open eyes kissing the calm brow with a long farewell kiss As she did so her eye fell on a black ribbon round his neck She partly lifted it out to it was hung a half crown piece This is the piece he left at William Darley s to be bored said she not many days ago Bella had crept to her mother s arms as a known haven in this strange place and the touch of his child loosened the fountains of her tears She stretched out her hand for the black ribbon put it round her own neck after a while she said If I live very long and try hard to be very good all that time do yo think Hester as God will let me to him where he is Monkshaven is altered now into a rising bathing place Yet standing near the site of widow Dobson s house on a summer s night at the ebb of a spring tide you may hear the waves come lapping up the shelving shore with the same ceaseless ever recurrent sound as that which Philip listened to in the pauses between life and death And so it will be until there shall be no more sea But the memory of man fades away A few old people can still tell you the tradition of the man who died in a cottage somewhere about this spot died of starvation while his wife lived in hard hearted plenty not two good stone throws away This is the form into which popular feeling and ignorance of the real facts have moulded the story Not long since a lady went to the Public Baths a handsome stone building erected on the very site of widow Dobson s cottage and finding all the rooms engaged she sat down and had some talk with the bathing woman and as it chanced the conversation fell on Philip Hepburn and the legend of his fate I knew an old man when I was a girl said the bathing woman as could niver abide to hear t wife blamed He would say nothing again th husband he used to say as it were not fit for men to be judging that she had had her sore trial as well as Hepburn hisself The lady asked What became of the wife She was a pale sad woman allays dressed in black I can just remember her when I was a little child but she died before her daughter was well grown up and Miss Rose took t lassie as had always been like her own Miss Rose Hester Rose have yo niver heared of Hester Rose she as founded t alms houses for poor disabled sailors and soldiers on t Horncastle road There s a piece o stone in front to say that This building is erected in memory of P H and some folk will have it P H stands for t name o th man as was starved to death And the daughter One o th Fosters them as founded t Old Bank left her a vast o money and she were married to distant cousin of theirs and went off to settle in America many and
