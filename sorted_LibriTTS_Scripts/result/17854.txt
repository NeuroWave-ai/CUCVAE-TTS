none	none	Berry Found I THE HAMILTONS Fiction has said so much in regret of the old days when there were plantations and overseers and masters and slaves that it was good to come upon such a household as Berry Hamilton s if for no other reason than that it afforded a relief from the monotony of tiresome iteration The little cottage in which he lived with his wife Fannie who was housekeeper to the Oakleys and his son and daughter Joe and Kit sat back in the yard some hundred paces from the mansion of his employer It was somewhat in the manner of the old cabin in the quarters with which usage as well as tradition had made both master and servant familiar But unlike the cabin of the elder day it was a neatly furnished modern house the home of a typical good living negro For twenty years Berry Hamilton had been butler for Maurice Oakley He was one of the many slaves who upon their accession to freedom had not left the South but had wandered from place to place in their own beloved section waiting working and struggling to rise with its rehabilitated fortunes The first faint signs of recovery were being seen when he came to Maurice Oakley as a servant Through thick and thin he remained with him and when the final upward tendency of his employer began his fortunes had increased in like manner When having married Oakley bought the great house in which he now lived he left the little servant s cottage in the yard for as he said laughingly There is no telling when Berry will be following my example and be taking a wife unto himself His joking prophecy came true very soon Berry had long had a tenderness for Fannie the housekeeper As she retained her post under the new missus Oakley and as there was a cottage ready to his hand it promised to be cheaper and more convenient all around to get married Fannie was willing and so the matter was settled Fannie had never regretted her choice nor had Berry ever had cause to curse his utilitarian ideas The stream of years had flowed pleasantly and peacefully with them Their little sorrows had come but their joys had been many As time went on the little cottage grew in comfort It was replenished with things handed down from the house from time to time and with others bought from the pair s earnings Berry had time for his lodge and Fannie time to spare for her own house and garden Flowers bloomed in the little plot in front and behind it vegetables and greens testified to the housewife s industry Over the door of the little house a fine Virginia creeper bent and fell in graceful curves and a cluster of insistent morning glories clung in summer about its stalwart stock It was into this bower of peace and comfort that Joe and Kitty were born They brought a new sunlight into the house and a new joy to the

5970-54413-0000	train-other-500	A FAREWELL DINNER Maurice Oakley was not a man of sudden or violent enthusiasms Conservatism was the quality that had been the foundation of his fortunes
5970-54413-0001	train-other-500	at a time when the disruption of the country had involved most of the men of his region in ruin Without giving any one ground to charge him with
5970-54413-0002	train-other-500	being lukewarm or renegade to his cause he had yet so adroitly managed his affairs
none	none	 that when peace came he was able quickly to recover much of the ground lost during the war 
5970-54413-0003	train-other-500	With a rare genius for adapting himself to new conditions he accepted the changed order of things with a passive resignation but with a stern determination to make the most out of any good
5970-54413-0004	train-other-500	that might be in it It was a favourite remark of his that there must be some good in every system and it was the duty of the citizen to find out that good and make it pay
5970-54413-0005	train-other-500	He had done this His house his reputation his satisfaction were all evidences that he had succeeded A childless man
5970-54413-0006	train-other-500	he bestowed upon his younger brother Francis the enthusiasm he would have given to a son His wife shared with her husband this feeling for her brother in law and with him played
5970-54413-0007	train-other-500	the role of parent which had otherwise been denied her It was true that Francis Oakley was only a half brother to Maurice the son of a second
5970-54413-0008	train-other-500	and not too fortunate marriage but there was no halving of the love which the elder man had given to him from childhood up At the first intimation that Francis had artistic ability
5970-54413-0009	train-other-500	his brother had placed him under the best masters in America and later when the promise of his youth had begun to blossom he sent him to Paris although the expenditure just at that time
5970-54413-0010	train-other-500	demanded a sacrifice which might have been the ruin of Maurice s own career Francis s promise had never come to entire fulfilment He was always trembling on the verge of
5970-54413-0011	train-other-500	a great success without quite plunging into it Despite the joy which his presence gave his brother and sister in law most of his time was spent abroad where he could
5970-54413-0012	train-other-500	find just the atmosphere that suited his delicate artistic nature After a visit of two months he was about returning to Paris for a stay of five years
5970-54413-0013	train-other-500	At last he was going to apply himself steadily and try to be less the dilettante The company which Maurice Oakley
5970-54413-0014	train-other-500	brought together to say good bye to his brother on this occasion was drawn from the best that this fine old Southern town afforded There were colonels there at whose titles and the owners rights to them no one could laugh
5970-54413-0015	train-other-500	there were brilliant women there who had queened it in Richmond Baltimore Louisville and New Orleans and every Southern capital under the old regime and there were younger ones there of wit
5970-54413-0016	train-other-500	and beauty who were just beginning to hold their court For Francis was a great favourite both with men and women He was a handsome man tall slender and graceful
5970-54413-0017	train-other-500	He had the face and brow of a poet a pallid face framed in a mass of dark hair There was a touch of weakness in his mouth but this was shaded
5970-54413-0018	train-other-500	and half hidden by a full mustache that made much forgivable to beauty loving eyes It was generally conceded
5970-54413-0019	train-other-500	that missus Oakley was a hostess whose guests had no awkward half hour before dinner No praise could be higher than this
5970-54413-0020	train-other-500	and to night she had no need to exert herself to maintain this reputation Her brother in law was the life of the assembly he had wit and daring and about him there was
5970-54413-0021	train-other-500	just that hint of charming danger that made him irresistible to women The guests heard the dinner announced with surprise an unusual thing except in this house
5970-54413-0022	train-other-500	Both Maurice Oakley and his wife looked fondly at the artist as he went in with Claire Lessing He was talking animatedly to the girl
5970-54413-0023	train-other-500	having changed the general trend of the conversation to a manner and tone directed more particularly to her While she listened to him her face glowed
5970-54413-0024	train-other-500	and her eyes shone with a light that every man could not bring into them As Maurice and his wife followed him with their gaze the same thought was in their minds and it had not just come to them
5970-54413-0025	train-other-500	Why could not Francis marry Claire Lessing and settle in America instead of going back ever and again to that life in the Latin Quarter They did not believe that it was a bad life or a dissipated one
5970-54413-0026	train-other-500	but from the little that they had seen of it when they were in Paris it was at least a bit too free and unconventional for their traditions There were too temptations which must assail any man
5970-54413-0027	train-other-500	of Francis s looks and talents They had perfect faith in the strength of his manhood of course but could they have had their way
5970-54413-0028	train-other-500	it would have been their will to hedge him about so that no breath of evil invitation could have come nigh to him But this younger brother this half ward of theirs was an unruly member
5970-54413-0029	train-other-500	He talked and laughed rode and walked with Claire Lessing with the same free abandon the same show of uninterested good comradeship that
none	none	 he had used towards her 
5970-54413-0030	train-other-500	when they were boy and girl together There was not a shade more of warmth or self consciousness in his manner towards her than there had been fifteen years before In fact there was less
5970-54413-0031	train-other-500	for there had been a time when he was six and Claire three that Francis with a boldness that the lover of maturer years tries vainly to attain had announced to Claire that
5970-54413-0032	train-other-500	he was going to marry her But he had never renewed this declaration when it came time that it would carry weight with it They made a fine picture as they sat together to night
5970-54413-0033	train-other-500	One seeing them could hardly help thinking on the instant that they were made for each other Something in the woman s face in her expression perhaps supplied
5970-54413-0034	train-other-500	a palpable lack in the man The strength of her mouth and chin helped the weakness of his She was the sort of woman who if ever he came to a great moral crisis in his life
5970-54413-0035	train-other-500	would be able to save him if she were near And yet he was going away from her giving up the pearl that he had only to put out his hand to take
5970-54413-0036	train-other-500	Some of these thoughts were in the minds of the brother and sister now Five years does seem a long while Francis was saying
5970-54413-0037	train-other-500	but if a man accomplishes anything after all it seems only a short time to look back upon All time is short to look back upon
5970-54428-0055	train-other-500	time i
none	none	s short to look back upon 
5970-54413-0038	train-other-500	It is the looking forward to it that counts It does n t though with a man I suppose He s doing something all the while Yes a man is always doing something
5970-54413-0039	train-other-500	even if only waiting but waiting is such unheroic business That is the part that usually falls to a woman s lot
5970-54413-0040	train-other-500	I have no doubt that some dark eyed mademoiselle is waiting for you now Francis laughed and flushed hotly Claire noted the flush and wondered at it
5970-54413-0041	train-other-500	Had she indeed hit upon the real point Was that the reason that he was so anxious to get back to Paris The thought struck a chill through her gaiety She did not want to be suspicious
5970-54413-0042	train-other-500	but what was the cause of that tell tale flush He was not a man easily disconcerted then why so to night But her companion talked on with such innocent composure
5970-54413-0043	train-other-500	that she believed herself mistaken as to the reason for his momentary confusion Someone cried gayly across the table to her Oh Miss Claire
5970-54413-0044	train-other-500	you will not dare to talk with such little awe to our friend when he comes back with his ribbons and his medals Why we shall all have to bow to you Frank
none	none	 You re wronging me Esterton said Francis No foreign decoration could ever be to me as much as 
5970-54413-0045	train-other-500	the flower of approval from the fair women of my own State Hear cried the ladies Trust artists and poets to pay pretty compliments and this wily friend of mine
5970-54413-0046	train-other-500	pays his at my expense A good bit of generalship that Frank an old military man broke in Esterton opened the breach and you at once galloped in That s the highest art of war
5970-54413-0047	train-other-500	Claire was looking at her companion Had he meant the approval of the women or was it one woman that he cared for Had the speech had a hidden meaning for her
5970-54413-0048	train-other-500	She could never tell She could not understand this man who had been so much to her for so long and yet did not seem to know it
none	none	 who was full of romance and fire and passion and yet looked at her beauty with the eyes of a mere comrade She sighed as she rose with the rest of the women to leave the table 
5970-54413-0049	train-other-500	The men lingered over their cigars The wine was old and the stories new What more could they ask There was a strong glow in Francis Oakley s face
5970-54413-0050	train-other-500	and his laugh was frequent and ringing Some discussion came up which sent him running up to his room for a bit of evidence When he came down it was not to come directly to the dining room
5970-54413-0051	train-other-500	He paused in the hall and despatched a servant to bring his brother to him Maurice found him standing weakly against the railing of the stairs Something in his air impressed his brother strangely
5970-54413-0052	train-other-500	What is it Francis he questioned hurrying to him I have just discovered a considerable loss
none	none	 was the reply in a grieved voice If it is no worse than loss I am glad but what is it Every cent of money that I had to secure my letter of credit 
5970-54413-0053	train-other-500	is gone from my bureau What When did it disappear I went to my bureau to night for something and found the money gone then I remembered that
5970-54413-0054	train-other-500	when I opened it two days ago I must have left the key in the lock as I found it to night
none	none	 It s a bad business 
5970-54413-0055	train-other-500	but don t let s talk of it now Come
none	none	 let s go back to our guests 
5970-54413-0056	train-other-500	Don t look so cut up about it Frank old man
none	none	 It is n t as bad as it might be and you must n t show a gloomy face to night The younger man pulled himself together 
5970-54413-0057	train-other-500	and re entered the room with his brother In a few minutes his gaiety had apparently returned When they rejoined the ladies even their quick eyes could detect in his demeanour
5970-54413-0058	train-other-500	no trace of the annoying thing that had occurred His face did not change until with a wealth of fervent congratulations he had bade the last guest good bye
none	none	 Then he turned to his brother 
5970-54413-0059	train-other-500	When Leslie is in bed come into the library I will wait for you there he said and walked sadly away Poor foolish Frank mused his brother
none	none	 as if the loss could matter to him III THE THEFT Frank was very pale when his brother finally came to him at the appointed place He sat limply in his chair his eyes fixed upon the floor Come brace up now Frank and tell me about it At the sound of his brother s voice he started and looked up as though he had been dreaming I don t know what you ll think of me Maurice he said I have never before been guilty of such criminal carelessness Don t stop to accuse yourself Our only hope in this matter lies in prompt action Where was the money In the oak cabinet and lying in the bureau drawer Such a thing as a theft seemed so foreign to this place that I was never very particular about the box But I did not know until I went to it to night that the last time I had opened it I had forgotten to take the key out It all flashed over me in a second when I saw it shining there Even then I did n t suspect anything You don t know how I felt to open that cabinet and find all my money gone It s awful Don t worry How much was there in all Nine hundred and eighty six dollars most of which I am ashamed to say I had accepted from you You have no right to talk that way Frank you know I do not begrudge a cent you want I have never felt that my father did quite right in leaving me the bulk of the fortune but we won t discuss that now What I want you to understand though is that the money is yours as well as mine and you are always welcome to it The artist shook his head No Maurice he said I can accept no more from you I have already used up all my own money and too much of yours in this hopeless fight I don t suppose I was ever cut out for an artist or I d have done something really notable in this time and would not be a burden upon those who care for me No I ll give up going to Paris and find some work to do Frank Frank be silent This is nonsense Give up your art You shall not do it You shall go to Paris as usual Leslie and I have perfect faith in you You shall not give up on account of this misfortune What are the few paltry dollars to me or to you Nothing nothing I know It is n t the money it s the principle of the thing Principle be hanged You go back to Paris to morrow just as you had planned I do not ask it I command it The younger man looked up quickly Pardon me Frank for using those words and at such a time You know how near my heart your success lies and to hear you talk of giving it all up makes me forget myself Forgive me but you ll go back won t you You are too good Maurice said Frank impulsively and I will go back and I ll try to redeem myself There is no redeeming of yourself to do my dear boy all you have to do is to mature yourself We ll have a detective down and see what we can do in this matter Frank gave a scarcely perceptible start I do so hate such things he said and anyway what s the use They ll never find out where the stuff went to Oh you need not be troubled in this matter I know that such things must jar on your delicate nature But I am a plain hard headed business man and I can attend to it without distaste But I hate to shove everything unpleasant off on you It s what I ve been doing all my life Never mind that Now tell me who was the last person you remember in your room Oh Esterton was up there awhile before dinner But he was not alone two minutes Why he would be out of the question anyway Who else Hamilton was up yesterday Alone Yes for a while His boy Joe shaved me and Jack was up for a while brushing my clothes Then it lies between Jack and Joe Frank hesitated Neither one was left alone though Then only Hamilton and Esterton have been alone for any time in your room since you left the key in your cabinet Those are the only ones of whom I know anything What others went in during the day of course I know nothing about It could n t have been either Esterton or Hamilton Not Esterton no And Hamilton is beyond suspicion No servant is beyond suspicion I would trust Hamilton anywhere said Frank stoutly and with anything That s noble of you Frank and I would have done the same but we must remember that we are not in the old days now The negroes are becoming less faithful and less contented and more s the pity and a deal more ambitious although I have never had any unfaithfulness on the part of Hamilton to complain of before Then do not condemn him now I shall not condemn any one until I have proof positive of his guilt or such clear circumstantial evidence that my reason is satisfied I do not believe that you will ever have that against old Hamilton This spirit of trust does you credit Frank and I very much hope that you may be right But as soon as a negro like Hamilton learns the value of money and begins to earn it at the same time he begins to covet some easy and rapid way of securing it The old negro knew nothing of the value of money When he stole he stole hams and bacon and chickens These were his immediate necessities and the things he valued The present laughs at this tendency without knowing the cause The present negro resents the laugh and he has learned to value other things than those which satisfy his belly Frank looked bored But pardon me for boring you I know you want to go to bed Go and leave everything to me The young man reluctantly withdrew and Maurice went to the telephone and rung up the police station As Maurice had said he was a plain hard headed business man and it took very few words for him to put the Chief of Police in possession of the principal facts of the case A detective was detailed to take charge of the case and was started immediately so that he might be upon the ground as soon after the commission of the crime as possible When he came he insisted that if he was to do anything he must question the robbed man and search his room at once Oakley protested but the detective was adamant Even now the presence in the room of a man uninitiated into the mysteries of criminal methods might be destroying the last vestige of a really important clue The master of the house had no alternative save to yield Together they went to the artist s room A light shone out through the crack under the door I am sorry to disturb you again Frank but may we come in Who is with you The detective I did not know he was to come to night The chief thought it better All right in a moment There was a sound of moving around and in a short time the young fellow partly undressed opened the door To the detective s questions he answered in substance what he had told before He also brought out the cabinet It was a strong oak box uncarven but bound at the edges with brass The key was still in the lock where Frank had left it on discovering his loss They raised the lid The cabinet contained two compartments one for letters and a smaller one for jewels and trinkets When you opened this cabinet your money was gone Yes Were any of your papers touched No How about your jewels I have but few and they were elsewhere The detective examined the room carefully its approaches and the hall ways without He paused knowingly at a window that overlooked the flat top of a porch Do you ever leave this window open It is almost always so Is this porch on the front of the house No on the side What else is out that way Frank and Maurice looked at each other The younger man hesitated and put his hand to his head Maurice answered grimly My butler s cottage is on that side and a little way back Uh huh and your butler is I believe the Hamilton whom the young gentleman mentioned some time ago Yes Frank s face was really very white now The detective nodded again I think I have a clue he said simply I will be here again to morrow morning But I shall be gone said Frank You will hardly be needed anyway The artist gave a sigh of relief He hated to be involved in unpleasant things He went as far as the outer door with his brother and the detective As he bade the officer good night and hurried up the hall Frank put his hand to his head again with a convulsive gesture as if struck by a sudden pain Come come Frank you must take a drink now and go to bed said Oakley I am completely unnerved I know it and I am no less shocked than you But we ve got to face it like men They passed into the dining room where Maurice poured out some brandy for his brother and himself Who would have thought it he asked as he tossed his own down Not I I had hoped against hope up until the last that it would turn out to be a mistake Nothing angers me so much as being deceived by the man I have helped and trusted I should feel the sting of all this much less if the thief had come from the outside broken in and robbed me but this after all these years is too low Don t be hard on a man Maurice one never knows what prompts him to a deed And this evidence is all circumstantial It is plain enough for me You are entirely too kind hearted Frank But I see that this thing has worn you out You must not stand here talking Go to bed for you must be fresh for to morrow morning s journey to New York Frank Oakley turned away towards his room His face was haggard and he staggered as he walked His brother looked after him with a pitying and affectionate gaze Poor fellow he said he is so delicately constructed that he cannot stand such shocks as these and then he added To think of that black hound s treachery I ll give him all that the law sets down for him He found missus Oakley asleep when he reached the room but he awakened her to tell her the story She was horror struck It was hard to have to believe this awful thing of an old servant but she agreed with him that Hamilton must be made an example of when the time came Before that however he must not know that he was suspected They fell asleep he with thoughts of anger and revenge and she grieved and disappointed IV FROM A CLEAR SKY The inmates of the Oakley house had not been long in their beds before Hamilton was out of his and rousing his own little household You Joe he called to his son git up f om daih an come right hyeah You got to he p me befo you go to any shop dis mo nin You Kitty stir yo stumps miss I know yo ma s a dressin now Ef she ain t I bet I ll be aftah huh in a minute too You all layin roun snoozin w en you all des pint ly know dis is de mo nin Mistah Frank go way f om hyeah It was a cool Autumn morning fresh and dew washed The sun was just rising and a cool clear breeze was blowing across the land The blue smoke from the house where the fire was already going whirled fantastically over the roofs like a belated ghost It was just the morning to doze in comfort and so thought all of Berry s household except himself Loud was the complaining as they threw themselves out of bed They maintained that it was an altogether unearthly hour to get up Even missus Hamilton added her protest until she suddenly remembered what morning it was when she hurried into her clothes and set about getting the family s breakfast The good humour of all of them returned when they were seated about their table with some of the good things of the night before set out and the talk ran cheerily around I do declaih said Hamilton you all s as bad as dem white people was las night De way dey waded into dat food was a caution He chuckled with delight at the recollection I reckon dat s what dey come fu I was n t payin so much tention to what dey eat as to de way dem women was dressed Why Mis Jedge Hill was des mo n go geous Oh yes ma an Miss Lessing was n t no ways behin her put in Kitty Joe did not condescend to join in the conversation but contented himself with devouring the good things and aping the manners of the young men whom he knew had been among last night s guests Well I got to be goin said Berry rising There ll be early breakfas at de house dis mo nin so s Mistah Frank kin ketch de fus train He went out cheerily to his work No shadow of impending disaster depressed his spirits No cloud obscured his sky He was a simple easy man and he saw nothing in the manner of the people whom he served that morning at breakfast save a natural grief at parting from each other He did not even take the trouble to inquire who the strange white man was who hung about the place When it came time for the young man to leave with the privilege of an old servitor Berry went up to him to bid him good bye He held out his hand to him and with a glance at his brother Frank took it and shook it cordially Good bye Berry he said Maurice could hardly restrain his anger at the sight but his wife was moved to tears at her brother in law s generosity The last sight they saw as the carriage rolled away towards the station was Berry standing upon the steps waving a hearty farewell and god speed How could you do it Frank gasped his brother as soon as they had driven well out of hearing Hush Maurice said missus Oakley gently I think it was very noble of him Oh I felt sorry for the poor fellow was Frank s reply Promise me you won t be too hard on him Maurice Give him a little scare and let him go He s possibly buried the money anyhow I shall deal with him as he deserves The young man sighed and was silent the rest of the way Whether I fail or succeed you will always think well of me Maurice he said in parting and if I don t come up to your expectations well forgive me that s all His brother wrung his hand You will always come up to my expectations Frank he said Won t he Leslie He will always be our Frank our good generous hearted noble boy God bless him The young fellow bade them a hearty good bye and they knowing what his feelings must be spared him the prolonging of the strain They waited in the carriage and he waved to them as the train rolled out of the station He seems to be sad at going said missus Oakley Poor fellow the affair of last night has broken him up considerably but I ll make Berry pay for every pang of anxiety that my brother has suffered Don t be revengeful Maurice you know what brother Frank asked of you He is gone and will never know what happens so I may be as revengeful as I wish The detective was waiting on the lawn when Maurice Oakley returned They went immediately to the library Oakley walking with the firm hard tread of a man who is both exasperated and determined and the officer gliding along with the cat like step which is one of the attributes of his profession Well was the impatient man s question as soon as the door closed upon them I have some more information that may or may not be of importance Out with it maybe I can tell First let me ask if you had any reason to believe that your butler had any resources of his own say to the amount of three or four hundred dollars Certainly not I pay him thirty dollars a month and his wife fifteen dollars and with keeping up his lodges and the way he dresses that girl he can t save very much You know that he has money in the bank No Well he has Over eight hundred dollars What Berry It must be the pickings of years And yesterday it was increased by five hundred more The scoundrel How was your brother s money in bills It was in large bills and gold with some silver Berry s money was almost all in bills of a small denomination and silver A poor trick it could easily have been changed Not such a sum without exciting comment He may have gone to several places But he had only a day to do it in Then some one must have been his accomplice That remains to be proven Nothing remains to be proven Why it s as clear as day that the money he has is the result of a long series of peculations and that this last is the result of his first large theft That must be made clear to the law It shall be I should advise though no open proceedings against this servant until further evidence to establish his guilt is found If the evidence satisfies me it must be sufficient to satisfy any ordinary jury I demand his immediate arrest As you will sir Will you have him called here and question him or will you let me question him at once Yes Oakley struck the bell and Berry himself answered it You re just the man we want said Oakley shortly Berry looked astonished Shall I question him asked the officer or will you I will Berry you deposited five hundred dollars at the bank yesterday Well suh Mistah Oakley was the grinning reply ef you ain t de beatenes man to fin out things I evah seen The employer half rose from his chair His face was livid with anger But at a sign from the detective he strove to calm himself You had better let me talk to Berry mister Oakley said the officer Oakley nodded Berry was looking distressed and excited He seemed not to understand it at all Berry the officer pursued you admit having deposited five hundred dollars in the bank yesterday Sut ny Dey ain t no reason why I

whaih dat money come f om Whaih You stole it you thief from my brother Frank s room Stole it My Gawd Mistah Oakley you believed a thing lak dat aftah all de yeahs I been wid you You ve been stealing all along Why what shell I do said the servant helplessly I tell you Mistah Oakley ask Fannie She ll know how long I been a savin dis money I ll ask no one I think it would be better to call his wife Oakley Well call her but let this matter be done with soon Fannie was summoned and when the matter was explained to her first gave evidences of giving way to grief but when the detective began to question her she calmed herself and answered directly just as her husband had Well posted sneered Oakley Arrest that man Berry had begun to look more hopeful during Fannie s recital but now the ashen look came back into his face At the word arrest his wife collapsed utterly and sobbed on her husband s shoulder Send the woman away I won t go cried Fannie stoutly I ll stay right hyeah by my husband You sha n t drive me away f om him Berry turned to his employer You b lieve dat I stole f om dis house aftah all de yeahs I ve been in it aftah de caih I took of yo money an yo valybles aftah de way I

were bloodshot as he replied Den damn you damn you ef dat s all dese yeahs counted fu I wish I had a stoled it Oakley made a step forward and his man did likewise but the officer stepped between them Take that damned hound away or by God I ll do him violence The two men stood fiercely facing each other then the handcuffs were snapped on the servant s wrist No no shrieked Fannie you must n t you must n t Oh my Gawd he ain t no thief I ll go to Mis Oakley She nevah will believe it She sped from the room The commotion had called a crowd of curious servants into the hall Fannie hardly saw them as she dashed among them crying for her mistress In a moment she returned dragging missus Oakley by the hand Tell em oh tell em Miss Leslie dat you don t believe it Don t let em rest Berry Why Fannie I can t do anything It all seems perfectly plain and mister Oakley knows better than any of us you know Fannie her last hope gone flung herself on the floor crying O Gawd O Gawd he s gone fu sho Her husband bent over her the tears dropping from his eyes Nevah min Fannie he said nevah min Hit s boun to come out all right She raised her head and seizing his manacled hands pressed them to her breast wailing in a low monotone Gone gone They disengaged her hands and led Berry away Take her out said Oakley sternly to the servants and they lifted her up and carried her away in a sort of dumb stupor that was half a swoon They took her to her little cottage and laid her down until she could come to herself and the full horror of her situation burst upon her V THE JUSTICE OF MEN The arrest of Berry Hamilton on the charge preferred by his employer was the cause of unusual commotion in the town Both the accuser and the accused were well known to the citizens white and black Maurice Oakley as a solid man of business and Berry as an honest sensible negro and the pink of good servants The evening papers had a full story of the crime which closed by saying that the prisoner had amassed a considerable sum of money it was very likely from a long series of smaller peculations It seems a strange irony upon the force of right living that this man who had never been arrested before who had never even been suspected of wrong doing should find so few who even at the first telling doubted the story of his guilt Many people began to remember things that had looked particularly suspicious in his dealings Some others said I did n t think it of him There were only a few who dared to say I don t believe it of him The first act of his lodge The Tribe of Benjamin whose treasurer he was was to have his accounts audited when they should have been visiting him with comfort and they seemed personally grieved when his books were found to be straight The A M E church of which he had been an honest and active member hastened to disavow sympathy with him and to purge itself of contamination by turning him out His friends were afraid to visit him and were silent when his enemies gloated On every side one might have asked Where is charity and gone away empty In the black people of the town the strong influence of slavery was still operative and with one accord they turned away from one of their own kind upon whom had been set the ban of the white people s displeasure If they had sympathy they dared not show it Their own interests the safety of their own positions and firesides demanded that they stand aloof from the criminal Not then not now nor has it ever been true although it has been claimed that negroes either harbour or sympathise with the criminal of their kind They did not dare to do it before the sixties They do not dare to do it now They have brought down as a heritage from the days of their bondage both fear and disloyalty So Berry was unbefriended while the storm raged around him The cell where they had placed him was kind to him and he could not hear the envious and sneering comments that went on about him This was kind for the tongues of his enemies were not Tell me tell me said one you need n t tell me dat a bird kin fly so high dat he don have to come down some time An w en he do light honey my Lawd how he flop Mistah Rich Niggah said another He wanted to dress his wife an chillen lak white folks did he Well he foun out he foun out By de time de jedge git thoo wid him he won t be hol in his haid so high Wy dat gal o his n broke in old Isaac Brown indignantly w y she would n speak to my gal Minty when she met huh on de street I reckon she come down off n huh high hoss now The fact of the matter was that Minty Brown was no better than she should have been and did not deserve to be spoken to But none of this was taken into account either by the speaker or the hearers The man was down it was time to strike The women too joined their shrill voices to the general cry and were loud in their abuse of the Hamiltons and in disparagement of their high toned airs I knowed it I knowed it mumbled one old crone rolling her bleared and jealous eyes with glee W enevah you see niggahs gittin so high dat dey own folks ain good enough fu em look out W y la Aunt Chloe I knowed it too Dem people got so owdacious proud dat dey would n t walk up to de collection table no mo at chu ch but allus set an waited twell de basket was passed erroun Hit s de livin trufe an I s been seein it all long I ain t said nuffin but I knowed what uz gwine to happen Ol Chloe ain t lived all dese yeahs fu nuffin an ef she got de gif o secon sight t ain t fu huh to say The women suddenly became interested in this half assertion and the old hag seeing that she had made the desired impression lapsed into silence The whites were not neglecting to review and comment on the case also It had been long since so great a bit of wrong doing in a negro had given them cause for speculation and recrimination I tell you said old Horace Talbot who was noted for his kindliness towards people of colour I tell you I pity that darky more than I blame him Now here s my theory They were in the bar of the Continental Hotel and the old gentleman sipped his liquor as he talked It s just like this The North thought they were doing a great thing when they come down here and freed all the slaves They thought they were doing a great thing and I m not saying a word against them I give them the credit for having the courage of their convictions But I maintain that they were all wrong now in turning these people loose upon the country the way they did without knowledge of what the first principle of liberty was The natural result is that these people are irresponsible They are unacquainted with the ways of our higher civilisation and it ll take them a long time to learn You know Rome was n t built in a day I know Berry and I ve known him for a long while and a politer likelier darky than him you would have to go far to find And I have n t the least doubt in the world that he took that money absolutely without a thought of wrong sir absolutely He saw it He took it and to his mental process that was the end of it To him there was no injury inflicted on any one there was no crime committed His elemental reasoning was simply this This man has more money than I have here is some of his surplus I ll just take it Why gentlemen I maintain that that man took that money with the same innocence of purpose with which one of our servants a few years ago would have appropriated a stray ham I disagree with you entirely mister Talbot broke in mister Beachfield Davis who was a mighty hunter Make mine the same Jerry only add a little syrup I disagree with you It s simply total depravity that s all All niggers are alike and there s no use trying to do anything with them Look at that man Dodson of mine I had one of the finest young hounds in the State You know that white pup of mine mister Talbot that I bought from Hiram Gaskins Mighty fine breed Well I was spendin all my time and patience trainin that dog in the daytime At night I put him in that nigger s care to feed and bed Well do you know I came home the other night and found that black rascal gone I went out to see if the dog was properly bedded and by Jove the dog was gone too Then I got suspicious When a nigger and a dog go out together at night one draws certain conclusions I thought I had heard bayin way out towards the edge of the town So I stayed outside and watched In about an hour here came Dodson with a possum hung over his shoulder and my dog trottin at his heels He d been possum huntin with my hound with the finest hound in the State sir Now I appeal to you all gentlemen if that ain t total depravity what is total depravity Not total depravity Beachfield I maintain but the very irresponsibility of which I have spoken Why gentlemen I foresee the day when these people themselves shall come to us Southerners of their own accord and ask to be re enslaved until such time as they shall be fit for freedom Old Horace was nothing if not logical Well do you think there s any doubt of the darky s guilt asked Colonel Saunders hesitatingly He was the only man who had ever thought of such a possibility They turned on him as if he had been some strange unnatural animal Any doubt cried Old Horace Any doubt exclaimed mister Davis Any doubt almost shrieked the rest Why there can be no doubt Why Colonel what are you thinking of Tell us who has got the money if he has n t Tell us where on earth the nigger got the money he s been putting in the bank Doubt Why there is n t the least doubt about it Certainly certainly said the Colonel but I thought of course he might have saved it There are several of those people you know who do a little business and have bank accounts Yes but they are in some sort of business This man makes only thirty dollars a month Don t you see The Colonel saw or said he did And he did not answer what he might have answered that Berry had no rent and no board to pay His clothes came from his master and Kitty and Fannie looked to their mistress for the larger number of their supplies He did not call to their minds that Fannie herself made fifteen dollars a month and that for two years Joe had been supporting himself These things did not come up and as far as the opinion of the gentlemen assembled in the Continental bar went Berry was already proven guilty As for the prisoner himself after the first day when he had pleaded Not guilty and been bound over to the Grand Jury he had fallen into a sort of dazed calm that was like the stupor produced by a drug He took little heed of what went on around him The shock had been too sudden for him and it was as if his reason had been for the time unseated That it was not permanently overthrown was evidenced by his waking to the most acute pain and grief whenever Fannie came to him Then he would toss and moan and give vent to his sorrow in passionate complaints I did n t tech his money Fannie you know I did n t I wo ked fu every cent of dat money an I saved it myself Oh I ll nevah be able to git a job ag in Me in de lock up me aftah all dese yeahs Beyond this apparently his mind could not go That his detention was anything more than temporary never seemed to enter his mind That he would be convicted and sentenced was as far from possibility as the skies from the earth If he saw visions of a long sojourn in prison it was only as a nightmare half consciously experienced and which with the struggle must give way before the waking Fannie was utterly hopeless She had laid down whatever pride had been hers and gone to plead with Maurice Oakley for her husband s freedom and she had seen his hard set face She had gone upon her knees before his wife to cite Berry s long fidelity Oh Mis Oakley she cried ef he did steal de money we ve got enough saved to mek it good Let him go let him go Then you admit that he did steal missus Oakley had taken her up sharply Oh I did n t say dat I did n t mean dat That will do Fannie I understand perfectly You should have confessed that long ago But I ain t confessin I ain t He did n t You may go The stricken woman reeled out of her mistress s presence and missus Oakley told her husband that night with tears in her eyes how disappointed she was with Fannie that the woman had known it all along and had only just confessed It was just one more link in the chain that was surely and not too slowly forging itself about Berry Hamilton Of all the family Joe was the only one who burned with a fierce indignation He knew that his father was innocent and his very helplessness made a fever in his soul Dandy as he was he was loyal and when he saw his mother s tears and his sister s shame something rose within him that had it been given play might have made a man of him but being crushed died and rotted and in the compost it made all the evil of his nature flourished The looks and gibes of his fellow employees at the barber shop forced him to leave his work there Kit bowed with shame and grief dared not appear upon the streets where the girls who had envied her now hooted at her So the little family was shut in upon itself away from fellowship and sympathy Joe went seldom to see his father He was not heartless but the citadel of his long desired and much vaunted manhood trembled before the sight of his father s abject misery The lines came round his lips and lines too must have come round his heart Poor fellow he was too young for this forcing process and in the hot house of pain he only grew an acrid unripe cynic At the sitting of the Grand Jury Berry was indicted His trial followed soon and the town turned out to see it Some came to laugh and scoff but these his enemies were silenced by the spectacle of his grief In vain the lawyer whom he had secured showed that the evidence against him proved nothing In vain he produced proof of the slow accumulation of what the man had In vain he pleaded the man s former good name The judge and the jury saw otherwise Berry was convicted He was given ten years at hard labour He hardly looked as if he could live out one as he heard his sentence But Nature was kind and relieved him of the strain With a cry as if his heart were bursting he started up and fell forward on his face unconscious Some one a bit more brutal than the rest said It s five dollars fine every time a nigger faints but no one laughed There was something too portentous too tragic in the degradation of this man Maurice Oakley sat in the court room grim and relentless As soon as the trial was over he sent for Fannie who still kept the cottage in the yard You must go he said You can t stay here any longer I want none of your breed about me And Fannie bowed her head and went away from him in silence All the night long the women of the Hamilton household lay in bed and wept clinging to each other in their grief But Joe did not go to sleep Against all their entreaties he stayed up He put out the light and sat staring into the gloom with hard burning eyes VI OUTCASTS What particularly irritated Maurice Oakley was that Berry should to the very last keep up his claim of innocence He reiterated it to the very moment that the train which was bearing him away pulled out of the station There had seldom been seen such an example of criminal hardihood and Oakley was hardened thereby to greater severity in dealing with the convict s wife He began to urge her more strongly to move and she dispirited and humiliated by what had come to her looked vainly about for the way to satisfy his demands With her natural protector gone she felt more weak and helpless than she had thought it possible to feel It was hard enough to face the world But to have to ask something of it was almost more than she could bear With the conviction of her husband the last five hundred dollars had been confiscated as belonging to the stolen money but their former deposit remained untouched With this she had the means at her disposal to tide over their present days of misfortune It was not money she lacked but confidence Some inkling of the world s attitude towards her guiltless though she was reached her and made her afraid Her desperation however would not let her give way to fear so she set forth to look for another house Joe and Kit saw her go as if she were starting on an expedition into a strange country In all their lives they had known no home save the little cottage in Oakley s yard Here they had toddled as babies and played as children and been happy and care free There had been times when they had complained and wanted a home off by themselves like others whom they knew They had not failed either to draw unpleasant comparisons between their mode of life and the old plantation quarters system But now all this was forgotten and there were only grief and anxiety that they must leave the place and in such a way Fannie went out with little hope in her heart and a short while after she was gone Joe decided to follow her and make an attempt to get work I ll go an see what I kin do anyway Kit T ain t much use I reckon trying to get into a bahbah shop where they shave white folks because all the white folks are down on us I ll try one of the coloured shops This was something of a condescension for Berry Hamilton s son He had never yet shaved a black chin or put shears to what he termed naps and he was proud of it He thought though that after the training he had received from the superior Tonsorial Parlours where he had been employed he had but to ask for a place and he would be gladly accepted It is strange how all the foolish little vaunting things that a man says in days of prosperity wax a giant crop around him in the days of his adversity Berry Hamilton s son found this out almost as soon as he had applied at the first of the coloured shops for work Oh no suh said the proprietor I don t think we got anything fu you to do you re a white man s bahbah We don t shave nothin but niggahs hyeah an we shave em in de light o day an on de groun flo W y I hyeah you say dat you could n t git a paih of sheahs thoo a niggah s naps You ain t been practisin lately has you came from the back of the shop where a grinning negro was scraping a fellow s face Oh yes you re done with burr heads are you But burr heads are good enough fu you now I think the proprietor resumed that I hyeahed you say you was n t fond o grape pickin Well Josy my son I would n t begin it now specially as anothah kin o pickin seems to run in yo fambly Joe Hamilton never knew how he got out of that shop He only knew that he found himself upon the street outside the door tears of anger and shame in his eyes and the laughs and taunts of his tormentors still ringing in his ears It was cruel of course it was cruel It was brutal But only he knew how just it had been In his moments of pride he had said all those things half in fun and half in earnest and he began to wonder how he could have been so many kinds of a fool for so long without realising it He had not the heart to seek another shop for he knew that what would be known at one would be equally well known at all the rest The hardest thing that he had to bear was the knowledge that he had shut himself out of all the chances that he now desired He remembered with a pang the words of an old negro to whom he had once been impudent Nevah min boy nevah min you s bo n but you ain t daid It was too true He had not known then what would come He had never dreamed that anything so terrible could overtake him Even in his straits however desperation gave him a certain pluck He would try for something else for which his own tongue had not disqualified him With Joe to think was to do He went on to the Continental Hotel where there were almost always boys wanted to run the bells The clerk looked him over critically He was a bright spruce looking young fellow and the man liked his looks Well I guess we can take you on he said What s your name Joe was the laconic answer He was afraid to say more Well Joe you go over there and sit where you see those fellows in uniform and wait until I call the head bellman Young Hamilton went over and sat down on a bench which ran along the hotel corridor and where the bellmen were wont to stay during the day awaiting their calls A few of the blue coated Mercuries were there Upon Joe s advent they began to look askance at him and to talk among themselves He felt his face burning as he thought of what they must be saying Then he saw the head bellman talking to the clerk and looking in his direction He saw him shake his head and walk away He could have cursed him The clerk called to him I did n t know he said I did n t know that you were Berry Hamilton s boy Now I ve got nothing against you myself I don t hold you responsible for what your father did but I don t believe our boys would work with you I can t take you on Joe turned away to meet the grinning or contemptuous glances of the bellmen on the seat It would have been good to be able to hurl something among them But he was helpless He hastened out of the hotel feeling that every eye was upon him every finger pointing at him every tongue whispering There goes Joe Hamilton whose father went to the penitentiary the other day What should he do He could try no more He was proscribed and the letters of his ban were writ large throughout the town where all who ran might read For a while he wandered aimlessly about and then turned dejectedly homeward His mother had not yet come Did you get a job was Kit s first question No he answered bitterly no one wants me now No one wants you Why Joe they they don t think hard of us do they I don t know what they think of ma and you but they think hard of me all right Oh don t you worry it ll be all right when it blows over Yes when it all blows over but when ll that be Oh after a while when we can show em we re all right Some of the girl s cheery hopefulness had come back to her in the presence of her brother s dejection as a woman always forgets her own sorrow when some one she loves is grieving But she could not communicate any of her feeling to Joe who had been and seen and felt and now sat darkly waiting his mother s return Some presentiment seemed to tell him that armed as she was with money to pay for what she wanted and asking for nothing without price she would yet have no better tale to tell than he None of these forebodings visited the mind of Kit and as soon as her mother appeared on the threshold she ran to her crying Oh where are we going to live ma Fannie looked at her for a moment and then answered with a burst of tears Gawd knows child Gawd knows The girl stepped back astonished Why why and then with a rush of tenderness she threw her arms about her mother s neck Oh you re tired to death she said that s what s the matter with you Never mind about the house now I ve got some tea made for you and you just take a cup Fannie sat down and tried to drink her tea but she could not It stuck in her throat and the tears rolled down her face and fell into the shaking cup Joe looked on silently He had been out and he understood I ll go out to morrow and do some looking around for a house while you stay at home an rest ma Her mother looked up the maternal instinct for the protection of her daughter at once aroused Oh no not you Kitty she said Then for the first time Joe spoke You d just as well tell Kitty now ma for she s got to come across it anyhow What you know about it Whaih you been to I ve been out huntin work I ve been to Jones s bahbah shop an to the Continental Hotel His light brown face turned brick red with anger and shame at the memory of it I don t think I ll try any more Kitty was gazing with wide and saddening eyes at her mother Were they mean to you too ma she asked breathlessly Mean Oh Kitty Kitty you don t know what it was like It nigh killed me Thaih was plenty of houses an owned by people I ve knowed fu yeahs but not one of em wanted to rent to me Some of em made excuses bout one thing er t other but de res come right straight out an said dat we d give a neighbourhood a bad name ef we moved into it I ve almos tramped my laigs off I ve tried every decent place I could think of but nobody wants us The girl was standing with her hands clenched nervously before her It was almost more than she could understand Why we ain t done anything she said Even if they don t know any better than to believe that pa was guilty they know we ain t done anything I d like to cut the heart out of a few of em said Joe in his throat It ain t goin to do no good to look at it that a way Joe his mother replied I know hit s ha d but we got to do de bes we kin What are we goin to do cried the boy fiercely They won t let us work They won t let us live anywhaih Do they want us to live on the levee an steal like some of em do What are we goin to do echoed Kitty helplessly I d go out ef I thought I could find anythin to work at Don t you go anywhaih child It ud only be worse De niggah men dat ust to be bowin an scrapin to me an tekin off dey hats to me laughed in my face I met Minty an she slurred me right in de street Dey d do worse fu you In the midst of the conversation a knock came at the door It was a messenger from the House as they still called Oakley s home and he wanted them to be out of the cottage by the next afternoon as the new servants were coming and would want the rooms The message was so curt so hard and decisive that Fannie was startled out of her grief into immediate action Well we got to go she said rising wearily But where are we goin wailed Kitty in affright There s no place to go to We have n t got a house Where ll we go Out o town someplace as fur away from this damned hole as we kin git The boy spoke recklessly in his anger He had never sworn before his mother before She looked at him in horror Joe Joe she said you re mekin it wuss You re mekin it ha dah fu me to baih when you talk dat a way What you mean Whaih you think Gawd is Joe remained sullenly silent His mother s faith was too stalwart for his comprehension There was nothing like it in his own soul to interpret it We ll git de secon han dealah to tek ouah things to morrer an then we ll go away some place up No th maybe Let s go to New York said Joe New Yo k They had heard of New York as a place vague and far away a city that like Heaven to them had existed by faith alone All the days of their lives they had heard of it and it seemed to them the centre of all the glory all the wealth and all the freedom of the world New York It had an alluring sound Who would know them there Who would look down upon them It s a mighty long ways off fu me to be sta tin at dis time o life We want to go a long ways off I wonder what pa would think of it if he was here put in Kitty I guess he d think we was doin the best we could Well den Joe said his mother her voice trembling with emotion at the daring step they were about to take you set down an write a lettah to yo pa an tell him what we goin to do an to morrer to morrer we ll sta t Something akin to joy came into the boy s heart as he sat down to write the letter They had taunted him had they They had scoffed at him But he was going where they might never go and some day he would come back holding his head high and pay them sneer for sneer and jibe for jibe The same night the commission was given to the furniture dealer who would take charge of their things and sell them when and for what he could From his window the next morning Maurice Oakley watched the wagon emptying the house Then he saw Fannie come out and walk about her little garden followed by her children He saw her as she wiped her eyes and led the way to the side gate Well they re gone he said to his wife I wonder where they re going to live Oh some of their people will take them in replied missus Oakley languidly Despite the fact that his mother carried with her the rest of the money drawn from the bank Joe had suddenly stepped into the place of the man of the family He attended to all the details of their getting away with a promptness that made it seem untrue that he had never been more than thirty miles from his native town He was eager and excited As the train drew out of the station he did not look back upon the place which he hated but Fannie and her daughter let their eyes linger upon it until the last house the last chimney and the last spire faded from their sight and their tears fell and mingled as they were whirled away toward the unknown VII IN NEW YORK To the provincial coming to New York for the first time ignorant and unknown the city presents a notable mingling of the qualities of cheeriness and gloom If he have any eye at all for the beautiful he cannot help experiencing a thrill as he crosses the ferry over the river filled with plying craft and catches the first sight of the spires and buildings of New York If he have the right stuff in him a something will take possession of him that will grip him again every time he returns to the scene and will make him long and hunger for the place when he is away from it Later the lights in the busy streets will bewilder and entice him He will feel shy and helpless amid the hurrying crowds A new emotion will take his heart as the people hasten by him a feeling of loneliness almost of grief that with all of these souls about him he knows not one and not one of them cares for him After a while he will find a place and give a sigh of relief as he settles away from the city s sights behind his cosey blinds It is better here and the city is cruel and cold and unfeeling This he will feel perhaps for the first half hour and then he will be out in it all again He will be glad to strike elbows with the bustling mob and be happy at their indifference to him so that he may look at them and study them After it is all over after he has passed through the first pangs of strangeness and homesickness yes even after he has got beyond the stranger s enthusiasm for the metropolis the real fever of love for the place will begin to take hold upon him The subtle insidious wine of New York will begin to intoxicate him Then if he be wise he will go away any place yes he will even go over to Jersey But if he be a fool he will stay and stay on until the town becomes all in all to him until the very streets are his chums and certain buildings and corners his best friends Then he is hopeless and to live elsewhere would be death The Bowery will be his romance Broadway his lyric and the Park his pastoral the river and the glory of it all his epic and he will look down pityingly on all the rest of humanity It was the afternoon of a clear October day that the Hamiltons reached New York Fannie had some misgivings about crossing the ferry but once on the boat these gave way to speculations as to what they should find on the other side With the eagerness of youth to take in new impressions Joe and Kitty were more concerned with what they saw about them than with what their future would hold though they might well have stopped to ask some such questions In all the great city they knew absolutely no one and had no idea which way to go to find a stopping place They looked about them for some coloured face and finally saw one among the porters who were handling the baggage To Joe s inquiry he gave them an address and also proffered his advice as to the best way to reach the place He was exceedingly polite and he looked hard at Kitty They found the house to which they had been directed and were a good deal surprised at its apparent grandeur It was a four storied brick dwelling on Twenty seventh Street As they looked from the outside they were afraid that the price of staying in such a place would be too much for their pockets Inside the sight of the hard gaudily upholstered instalment plan furniture did not disillusion them and they continued to fear that they could never stop at this fine place But they found missus Jones the proprietress both gracious and willing to come to terms with them As missus Hamilton she began to be missus Hamilton now to the exclusion of Fannie would have described missus Jones she was a big yellow woman She had a broad good natured face and a tendency to run to bust Yes she said I think I could arrange to take you I could let you have two rooms and you could use my kitchen until you decided whether you wanted to take a flat or not I has the whole house myself and I keeps roomers But latah on I could fix things so s you could have the whole third floor ef you wanted to Most o my gent men s railroad gent men they is I guess it must a been mister Thomas that sent you up here He was a little bright man down at de deepo Yes that s him That s mister Thomas He s always lookin out to send some one here because he s been here three years hisself an he kin recommend my house It was a relief to the Hamiltons to find missus Jones so gracious and home like So the matter was settled and they took up their abode with her and sent for their baggage With the first pause in the rush that they had experienced since starting away from home missus Hamilton began to have time for reflection and their condition seemed to her much better as it was Of course it was hard to be away from home and among strangers but the arrangement had this advantage that no one knew them or could taunt them with their past trouble She was not sure that she was going to like New York It had a great name and was really a great place but the very bigness of it frightened her and made her feel alone for she knew that there could not be so many people together without a deal of wickedness She did not argue the complement of this that the amount of good would also be increased but this was because to her evil was the very present factor in her life Joe and Kit were differently affected by what they saw about them The boy was wild with enthusiasm and with a desire to be a part of all that the metropolis meant In the evening he saw the young fellows passing by dressed in their spruce clothes and he wondered with a sort of envy where they could be going Back home there had been no place much worth going to except church and one or two people s houses But these young fellows seemed to show by their manners that they were neither going to church nor a family visiting In the moment that he recognised this a revelation came to him the knowledge that his horizon had been very narrow and he felt angry that it was so Why should those fellows be different from him Why should they walk the streets so knowingly so independently when he knew not whither to turn his steps Well he was in New York and now he would learn Some day some greenhorn from the South should stand at a window and look out envying him as he passed red cravated patent leathered intent on some goal Was it not better after all that circumstances had forced them thither Had it not been so they might all have stayed home and stagnated Well thought he it s an ill wind that blows nobody good and somehow with a guilty under thought he forgot to feel the natural pity for his father toiling guiltless in the prison of his native State Whom the Gods wish to destroy they first make mad The first sign of the demoralisation of the provincial who comes to New York is his pride at his insensibility to certain impressions which used to influence him at home First he begins to scoff and there is no truth in his views nor depth in his laugh But by and by from mere pretending it becomes real He grows callous After that he goes to the devil very cheerfully No such radical emotions however troubled Kit s mind She too stood at the windows and looked down into the street There was a sort of complacent calm in the manner in which she viewed the girls hats and dresses Many of them were really pretty she told herself but for the most part they were not better than what she had had down home There was a sound quality in the girl s make up that helped her to see through the glamour of mere place and recognise worth for itself Or it may have been the critical faculty which is prominent in most women that kept her from thinking a five cent cheese cloth any better in New York than it was at home She had a certain self respect which made her value herself and her own traditions higher than her brother did his When later in the evening the porter who had been kind to them came in and was introduced as mister William Thomas young as she was she took his open admiration for her with more coolness than Joe exhibited when Thomas offered to show him something of the town some day or night mister Thomas was a loquacious little man with a confident air born of an intense admiration of himself He was the idol of a number of servant girls hearts and altogether a decidedly dashing back area way Don Juan I tell you Miss Kitty he burst forth a few minutes after being introduced they ain t no use talkin N Yawk ll give you a shakin up at you won t soon forget It s the only town on the face of the earth You kin bet your life they ain t no flies on N Yawk We git the best shows here we git the best concerts say now what s the use o my callin it all out we simply git the best of everything Great place said Joe wisely in what he thought was going to be quite a man of the world manner But he burned with shame the next minute because his voice sounded so weak and youthful Then too the oracle only said Yes to him and went on expatiating to Kitty on the glories of the metropolis D jever see the statue o Liberty Great thing the statue o Liberty I ll take you round some day An Cooney Island oh my now that s the place and talk about fun That s the place for me La Thomas missus Jones put in how you do run on Why the strangers ll think they ll be talked to death before they have time to breathe Oh I guess the folks understan me I m one

some music purty soon There s a fellah in the house at plays Rag time out o sight mister Thomas took the pail and went to the corner As he left the room missus Jones slapped her knee and laughed until her bust shook like jelly mister Thomas is a case sho she said but he likes you all an I m mighty glad of it fu he s mighty curious about the house when he don t like the roomers Joe felt distinctly flattered for he found their new acquaintance charming His mother was still a little doubtful and Kitty was sure she found the young man fresh He came in pretty soon with his beer and a half dozen crabs in a bag Thought I d bring home something to chew I always like to eat something with my beer missus Jones brought in the glasses and the young man filled one and turned to Kitty No thanks she said with a surprised look What don t you drink beer Oh come now you ll get out o that Kitty don t drink no beer broke in her mother with mild resentment I drinks it sometimes but she don t I reckon maybe de chillen better go to bed Joe felt as if the chillen had ruined all his hopes but Kitty rose The ingratiating N Yawker was aghast Oh let em stay said missus Jones heartily a little beer ain t goin to hurt em Why sakes I know my father gave me beer from the time I could drink it and I knows I ain t none the worse fu it They ll git out o that all right if they live in N Yawk said mister Thomas as he poured out a glass and handed it to Joe You neither Oh I drink it said the boy with an air but not looking at his mother Joe she cried to him you must ricollect you ain t at home What ud yo pa think Then she stopped suddenly and Joe gulped his beer and Kitty went to the piano to relieve her embarrassment Yes that s it Miss Kitty sing us something said the irrepressible Thomas an after while we ll have that fellah down that plays Rag time He s out o sight I tell you With the pretty shyness of girlhood Kitty sang one or two little songs in the simple manner she knew Her voice was full and rich It delighted mister Thomas I say that s singin now I tell you he cried You ought to have some o the new songs D jever hear Baby you got to leave I tell you that s a hot one I ll bring you some of em Why you could git a job on the stage easy with that voice o yourn I got a frien in one o the comp nies an I ll speak to him about you You ought to git mister Thomas to take you to the th atre some night He goes lots Why yes what s the matter with to morrer night There s a good coon show in town Out o sight Let s all go I ain t nevah been to nothin lak dat an I don t know said missus Hamilton Aw come I ll git the tickets an we ll all go Great singin you know What d you say The mother hesitated and Joe filled the breach We d all like to go he said Ma we ll go if you ain t too tired Tired Pshaw you ll furgit all about your tiredness when Smithkins gits on the stage Y ought to hear him sing I bin huntin fu wo k You d die laughing missus Hamilton made no further demur and the matter was closed Awhile later the Rag time man came down and gave them a sample of what they were to hear the next night mister Thomas and missus Jones two stepped and they sent a boy after some more beer Joe found it a very jolly evening but Kit s and the mother s hearts were heavy as they went up to bed Say said mister Thomas when they had gone that little girl s a peach you bet a little green I guess but she ll ripen in the sun VIII AN EVENING OUT Fannie Hamilton tired as she was sat long into the night with her little family discussing New York 
6051-54419-0000	train-other-500	its advantages and disadvantages its beauty and its ugliness its morality and immorality She had somewhat receded from her first position that it was better being here in the great strange city than being at home where the very streets shamed them
6051-54419-0001	train-other-500	She had not liked the way that their fellow lodger looked at Kitty It was bold to say the least She was not pleased either with their new acquaintance s familiarity And yet he had said no more than some stranger
6051-54419-0002	train-other-500	if there could be such a stranger would have said down home There was a difference however which she recognised Thomas was not the provincial who puts every one on a par with himself nor was he the metropolitan who complacently patronises the whole world
none	none	 He was trained out of the one and not up to the other The intermediate only succeeded in being offensive 
6051-54419-0003	train-other-500	missus Jones assurance as to her guest s fine qualities did not do all that might have been expected to reassure missus Hamilton in the face of the difficulties
none	none	 of the gentleman s manner 
6051-54419-0004	train-other-500	She could not however lay her finger on any particular point that would give her the reason for rejecting his friendly advances She got ready the next evening to go to the theatre with the rest mister Thomas at once possessed himself of Kitty
6051-54419-0005	train-other-500	and walked on ahead leaving Joe to accompany his mother and missus Jones an arrangement by the way not altogether to that young gentleman s taste
none	none	 A good many men bowed to Thomas in the street and they turned to look enviously after him 
6051-54419-0006	train-other-500	At the door of the theatre they had to run the gantlet of a dozen pairs of eyes
none	none	 Here too the party s guide seemed to be well known for some one said before they passed out of hearing 
6051-54419-0007	train-other-500	I wonder who that little light girl is that Thomas is with to night He s a hot one for you missus Hamilton had been in a theatre but once before in her life and Joe and Kit but a few times oftener
6051-54419-0008	train-other-500	On those occasions they had sat far up in the peanut gallery in the place reserved for people of colour This was not a pleasant cleanly nor beautiful locality and by contrast with it even the garishness of the cheap New York theatre seemed fine and glorious
6051-54419-0009	train-other-500	They had good seats in the first balcony and here their guide had shown his managerial ability again for he had found it impossible or said so to get all the seats together so that he and the girl were in the row in front and to one side of where the rest sat
6051-54419-0010	train-other-500	Kitty did not like the arrangement and innocently suggested that her brother take her seat while she went back to her mother
none	none	 But her escort overruled her objections easily and laughed at her so frankly that from very shame 
6051-54419-0011	train-other-500	she could not urge them again
none	none	 and they were soon forgotten in her wonder at the mystery and glamour that envelops the home of the drama There was something weird to her in the alternate spaces of light and shade 
6051-54419-0012	train-other-500	Without any feeling of its ugliness she looked at the curtain as at a door that should presently open between her and a house of wonders She looked at it with the fascination that one always experiences for what either brings near or withholds the unknown As for Joe
6051-54419-0013	train-other-500	he was not bothered by the mystery or the glamour of things But he had suddenly raised himself in his own estimation
none	none	 He had gazed steadily at a girl across the aisle until she had smiled in response 
6051-54419-0014	train-other-500	Of course he went hot and cold by turns and the sweat broke out on his brow but instantly he began to swell He had made a decided advance in knowledge and he swelled with the consciousness that already he was coming to be a man of the world
6051-54419-0015	train-other-500	He looked with a new feeling at the swaggering sporty young negroes His attitude towards them was not one of humble self depreciation any more Since last night he had grown and felt that he might that he would be like them and it put a sort of chuckling glee into his heart
none	none	 One might find it in him to feel sorry for this small souled warped being for he was so evidently the jest of Fate if it were not that he was so blissfully so conceitedly unconscious of his own nastiness 
6051-54419-0016	train-other-500	Down home he had shaved the wild young bucks of the town and while doing it drunk in eagerly their unguarded narrations of their gay exploits
none	none	 So he had started out with false ideals as to what was fine and manly He was afflicted by a sort of moral and mental astigmatism 
6051-54419-0017	train-other-500	that made him see everything wrong As he sat there to night he gave to all he saw a wrong value and upon it based his ignorant desires When the men of the orchestra filed in and began tuning their instruments
6051-54419-0018	train-other-500	it was the signal for an influx of loiterers from the door
none	none	 There were a large number of coloured people in the audience 
6051-54419-0019	train-other-500	and because members of their own race were giving the performance they seemed to take a proprietary interest in it all They discussed its merits and demerits as they walked down the aisle in much the same tone that the owners would have used had they been wondering whether the entertainment was going to please the people or not
none	none	 Finally the music struck up one of the numerous negro marches It was accompanied by the rhythmic patting of feet from all parts of the house 
6051-54419-0020	train-other-500	Then the curtain went up on a scene of beauty
none	none	 It purported to be a grove to which a party of picnickers the ladies and gentlemen of the chorus had come for a holiday and they were telling the audience all about it in crescendos 
6051-54419-0021	train-other-500	With the exception of one who looked like a faded kid glove the men discarded the grease paint but the women under their make ups ranged from pure white pale yellow
none	none	 and sickly greens to brick reds and slate grays They were dressed in costumes that were not primarily intended for picnic going 
6051-54419-0022	train-other-500	But they could sing and they did sing with their voices their bodies their souls
none	none	 They threw themselves into it because they enjoyed and felt what they were doing 
6051-54419-0023	train-other-500	and they gave almost a semblance of dignity to the tawdry music and inane words
none	none	 Kitty was enchanted The airily dressed women seemed to her like creatures from fairy land It is strange how the glare of the footlights succeeds in deceiving so many people who are able to see through other delusions The cheap dresses on the street had not fooled Kitty for an instant 
6051-54419-0024	train-other-500	but take the same cheese cloth put a little water starch into it and put it on the stage and she could see only chiffon She turned around and nodded delightedly at her brother but he did not see her He was lost transfixed
6051-54419-0025	train-other-500	His soul was floating on a sea of sense He had eyes and ears and thoughts only for the stage His nerves tingled and his hands twitched Only to know one of those radiant creatures to have her speak to him smile at him If ever a man was intoxicated Joe was
6051-54419-0026	train-other-500	missus Hamilton was divided between shame at the clothes of some of the women and delight with the music Her companion was busy pointing out who this and that actress was and giving jelly like appreciation to the doings on the stage
6051-54419-0027	train-other-500	mister Thomas was the only cool one in the party He was quietly taking stock of his young companion of her innocence and charm She was a pretty girl little and dainty but well developed for her age Her hair was very black and wavy
6051-54419-0028	train-other-500	and some strain of the South s chivalric blood which is so curiously mingled with the African in the veins of most coloured people had tinged her skin to an olive hue
none	none	 Are you enjoying yourself he leaned over and whispered to her 
6051-54419-0029	train-other-500	His voice was very confidential and his lips near her ear but she did not notice Oh yes she answered this is grand How I d like to be an actress and be up there Maybe you will some day Oh no I m not smart enough
6051-54419-0030	train-other-500	We ll see he said wisely I know a thing or two Between the first and second acts a number of Thomas s friends strolled up to where he sat and began talking
none	none	 and again Kitty s embarrassment took possession of her as they were introduced one by one 
6051-54419-0031	train-other-500	They treated her with a half courteous familiarity that made her blush Her mother was not pleased with the many acquaintances that her daughter was making
none	none	 and would have interfered had not missus Jones assured her that the men clustered about their host s seat were some of the best people in town 
6051-54419-0032	train-other-500	Joe looked at them hungrily but the man in front with his sister did not think it necessary to include the brother or the rest of the party in his miscellaneous introductions One brief bit of conversation which the mother overheard especially troubled her
6051-54419-0033	train-other-500	Not going out for a minute or two asked one of the men as he was turning away from Thomas
none	none	 No I don t think I ll go out to night You can have my share The fellow gave a horse laugh and replied Well you re doing a great piece of work Miss Hamilton 
6051-54419-0034	train-other-500	whenever you can keep old Bill from goin out an lushin between acts Say you got a good thing push it along The girl s mother half rose but she resumed her seat for the man was going away
6051-54419-0035	train-other-500	Her mind was not quiet again however until the people were all in their seats and the curtain had gone up on the second act At first she was surprised at the enthusiasm over just such dancing as she could see any day from the loafers on the street corners down home
6051-54419-0036	train-other-500	and then like a good sensible humble woman
none	none	 she came around to the idea that it was she who had always been wrong in putting too low a value on really worthy things 
6051-54419-0037	train-other-500	So she laughed and applauded with the rest all the while trying to quiet something that was tugging at her away down in her heart When the performance was over she forced her way to Kitty s side
6051-54419-0038	train-other-500	where she remained in spite of all Thomas s palpable efforts to get her away Finally he proposed that they all go to supper at one of the coloured cafes
none	none	 You ll see a lot o the show people he said No I reckon we d bettah go home said missus Hamilton decidedly De chillen ain t ust to stayin up all hours o nights an I ain t anxious fu em to git ust to it She was conscious of a growing dislike for this man who treated her daughter with such a proprietary air Joe winced again at de chillen Thomas bit his lip and mentally said things that are unfit for publication Aloud he said Mebbe Miss Kitty ud like to go an have a little lunch Oh no thank you said the girl I ve had a nice time and I don t care for a thing to eat Joe told himself that Kitty was the biggest fool that it had ever been his lot to meet and the disappointed suitor satisfied himself with the reflection that the girl was green yet but would get bravely over that He attempted to hold her hand as they parted at the parlour door but she drew her fingers out of his clasp and said Good night thank you as if he had been one of her mother s old friends Joe lingered a little longer Say that was out o sight he said Think so asked the other carelessly I d like to get out with you some time to see the town the boy went on eagerly All right we ll go some time So long So long Some time Was it true Would he really take him out and let him meet stage people Joe went to bed with his head in a whirl He slept little that night for thinking of his heart s desire IX HIS HEART S DESIRE Whatever else his visit to the theatre may have done for Joe it inspired him with a desire to go to work and earn money of his own to be independent both of parental help and control and so be able to spend as he pleased With this end in view he set out to hunt for work It was a pleasant contrast to his last similar quest and he felt it with joy He was treated everywhere he went with courtesy even when no situation was forthcoming Finally he came upon a man who was willing to try him for an afternoon From the moment the boy rightly considered himself engaged for he was master of his trade He began his work with heart elate Now he had within his grasp the possibility of being all that he wanted to be Now Thomas might take him out at any time and not be ashamed of him With Thomas the fact that Joe was working put the boy in an entirely new light He decided that now he might be worth cultivating For a week or two he had ignored him and proceeding upon the principle that if you give corn to the old hen she will cluck to her chicks had treated missus Hamilton with marked deference and kindness This had been without success as both the girl and her mother held themselves politely aloof from him He began to see that his hope of winning Kitty s affections lay not in courting the older woman but in making a friend of the boy So on a certain Saturday night when the Banner Club was to give one of its smokers he asked Joe to go with him Joe was glad to and they set out together Arrived Thomas left his companion for a few moments while he attended as he said to a little business What he really did was to seek out the proprietor of the club and some of its hangers on I say he said I ve got a friend with me to night He s got some dough on him He s fresh and young and easy Whew exclaimed the proprietor Yes he s a good thing but push it along kin o light at first he might get skittish Thomas let me fall on your bosom and weep said a young man who on account of his usual expression of innocent gloom was called Sadness This is what I ve been looking for for a month My hat was getting decidedly shabby Do you think he would stand for a touch on the first night of our acquaintance Don t you dare Do you want to frighten him off Make him believe that you ve got coin to burn and that it s an honour to be with you But you know he may expect a glimpse of the gold A smart man don t need to show nothin All he s got to do is to act Oh I ll act we ll all act Be slow to take a drink from him Thomas my boy you re an angel I recognise that more and more every day but bid me do anything else but that That I refuse it s against nature and Sadness looked more mournful than ever Trust old Sadness to do his part said the portly proprietor and Thomas went back to the lamb Nothin doin so early he said let s go an have a drink They went and Thomas ordered No no this is on me cried Joe trembling with joy Pshaw your money s counterfeit said his companion with fine generosity This is on me I say Jack what ll you have yourself As they stood at the bar the men began strolling up one by one Each in his turn was introduced to Joe They were very polite They treated him with a pale dignified high minded respect that menaced his pocket book and possessions The proprietor mister Turner asked him why he had never been in before He really seemed much hurt about it and on being told that Joe had only been in the city for a couple of weeks expressed emphatic surprise even disbelief and assured the rest that any one would have taken mister Hamilton for an old New Yorker Sadness was introduced last He bowed to Joe s Happy to know you mister Williams Better known as Sadness he said with an expression of deep gloom A distant relative of mine once had a great grief I have never recovered from it Joe was not quite sure how to take this but the others laughed and he joined them and then to cover his own embarrassment he did what he thought the only correct and manly thing to do he ordered a drink I don t know as I ought to said Sadness Oh come on his companions called out don t be stiff with a stranger Make him feel at home mister Hamilton will believe me when I say that I have no intention of being stiff but duty is duty I ve got to go down town to pay a bill and if I get too much aboard it would n t be safe walking around with money on me Aw shut up Sadness said Thomas My friend mister Hamilton ll feel hurt if you don t drink with him I cert n y will was Joe s opportune remark and he was pleased to see that it caused the reluctant one to yield They took a drink There was quite a line of them Joe asked the bartender what he would have The men warmed towards him They took several more drinks with him and he was happy Sadness put his arm about his shoulder and told him with tears in his eyes that he looked like a cousin of his that had died Aw shut up Sadness said some one else Be respectable Sadness turned his mournful eyes upon the speaker I won t he replied Being respectable is very nice as a diversion but it s tedious if done steadily Joe did not quite take this so he ordered another drink A group of young fellows came in and passed up the stairs Shearing another lamb said one of them significantly Well with that gang it will be well done Thomas and Joe left the crowd after a while and went to the upper floor where in a long brilliantly lighted room tables were set out for drinking parties At one end of the room was a piano and a man sat at it listlessly strumming some popular air The proprietor joined them pretty soon and steered them to a table opposite the door Just sit down here mister Hamilton he said and you can see everybody that comes in We have lots of nice people here on smoker nights especially after the shows are out and the girls come in Joe s heart gave a great leap and then settled as cold as lead Of course those girls would n t speak to him But his hopes rose as the proprietor went on talking to him and to no one else mister Turner always made a man feel as if he were of some consequence in the world and men a good deal older than Joe had been fooled by his manner He talked to one in a soft ingratiating way giving his whole attention apparently He tapped one confidentially on the shoulder as who should say My dear boy I have but two friends in the world and you are both of them Joe charmed and pleased kept his head well There is a great deal in heredity and his father had not been Maurice Oakley s butler for so many years for nothing The Banner Club was an institution for the lower education of negro youth It drew its pupils from every class of people and from every part of the country It was composed of all sorts and conditions of men educated and uneducated dishonest and less so of the good the bad and the unexposed Parasites came there to find victims politicians for votes reporters for news and artists of all kinds for colour and inspiration It was the place of assembly for a number of really bright men who after days of hard and often unrewarded work came there and drunk themselves drunk in each other s company and when they were drunk talked of the eternal verities The Banner was only one of a kind It stood to the stranger and the man and woman without connections for the whole social life It was a substitute poor it must be confessed to many youths for the home life which is so lacking among certain classes in New York Here the rounders congregated or came and spent the hours until it was time to go forth to bout or assignation Here too came sometimes the curious who wanted to see something of the other side of life Among these white visitors were not infrequent those who were young enough to be fascinated by the bizarre and those who were old enough to know that it was all in the game mister Skaggs of the New York Universe was one of the former class and a constant visitor he and a lady friend called Maudie who had a penchant for dancing to Rag time melodies as only the puffessor of such a club can play them Of course the place was a social cesspool generating a poisonous miasma and reeking with the stench of decayed and rotten moralities There is no defence to be made for it But what do you expect when false idealism and fevered ambition come face to face with catering cupidity It was into this atmosphere that Thomas had introduced the boy Joe and he sat there now by his side firing his mind by pointing out the different celebrities who came in and telling highly flavoured stories of their lives or doings Joe heard things that had never come within the range of his mind before Aw there s Skaggsy an Maudie Maudie s his girl y know an he s a reporter on the N Yawk Universe Fine fellow Skaggsy Maudie a portly voluptuous looking brunette left her escort and went directly to the space by the piano Here she was soon dancing with one of the coloured girls who had come in Skaggs started to sit down alone at a table but Thomas called him Come over here Skaggsy In the moment that it took the young man to reach them Joe wondered if he would ever reach that state when he could call that white man Skaggsy and the girl Maudie The new comer soon set all of that at ease I want you to know my friend mister Hamilton mister Skaggs Why how d ye do Hamilton I m glad to meet you Now look a here don t you let old Thomas here string you about me bein any old mister Skaggs I m Skaggsy to all of my friends I hope to count you among em It was such a supreme moment that Joe could not find words to answer so he called for another drink Not a bit of it said Skaggsy not a bit of it When I meet my friends I always reserve to myself the right of ordering the first drink Waiter this is on me What ll you have gentlemen They got their drinks and then Skaggsy leaned over confidentially and began talking I tell you Hamilton there ain t an ounce of prejudice in my body Do you believe it Joe said that he did Indeed Skaggsy struck one as being aggressively unprejudiced He went on You see a lot o fellows say to me What do you want to go down to that nigger club for That s what they call it nigger club But I say to em Gentlemen at that nigger club as you choose to call it I get more inspiration than I could get at any of the greater clubs in New York I ve often been invited to join some of the swell clubs here but I never do it By Jove I d rather come down here and fellowship right in with you fellows I like coloured people anyway It s natural You see my father had a big plantation and owned lots of slaves no offence of course but it was the custom of that time and I ve played with little darkies ever since I could remember It was the same old story that the white who associates with negroes from volition usually tells to explain his taste The truth about the young reporter was that he was born and reared on a Vermont farm where his early life was passed in fighting for his very subsistence But this never troubled Skaggsy He was a monumental liar and the saving quality about him was that he calmly believed his own lies while he was telling them so no one was hurt for the deceiver was as much a victim as the deceived The boys who knew him best used to say that when Skaggs got started on one of his debauches of lying the Recording Angel always put on an extra clerical force Now look at Maudie he went on would you believe it that she was of a fine rich family and that the coloured girl she s dancing with now used to be her servant She s just like me about that Absolutely no prejudice Joe was wide eyed with wonder and admiration and he could n t understand the amused expression on Thomas s face nor why he surreptitiously kicked him under the table Finally the reporter went his way and Joe s sponsor explained to him that he was not to take in what Skaggsy said and that there had n t been a word of truth in it He ended with Everybody knows Maudie and that coloured girl is Mamie Lacey and never worked for anybody in her life Skaggsy s a good fellah all right but he s the biggest liar in N Yawk The boy was distinctly shocked He was n t sure but Thomas was jealous of the attention the white man had shown him and wished to belittle it Anyway he did not thank him for destroying his romance About eleven o clock when the people began to drop in from the plays the master of ceremonies opened proceedings by saying that The free concert would now begin and he hoped that all present ladies included would act like gentlemen and not forget the waiter mister Meriweather will now favour us with the latest coon song entitled Come back to yo Baby Honey There was a patter of applause and a young negro came forward and in a strident music hall voice sung or rather recited with many gestures the ditty He could n t have been much older than Joe but already his face was hard with dissipation and foul knowledge He gave the song with all the rank suggestiveness that could be put into it Joe looked upon him as a hero He was followed by a little brown skinned fellow with an immature Vandyke beard and a lisp He sung his own composition and was funny how much funnier than he himself knew or intended may not even be hinted at Then while an instrumentalist who seemed to have a grudge against the piano was hammering out the opening bars of a march Joe s attention was attracted by a woman entering the room and from that moment he heard no more of the concert Even when the master of ceremonies announced with an air that by special request he himself would sing Answer the request was his own he did not draw the attention of the boy away from the yellow skinned divinity who sat at a near table drinking whiskey straight She was a small girl with fluffy dark hair and good features A tiny foot peeped out from beneath her rattling silk skirts She was a good looking young woman and daintily made though her face was no longer youthful and one might have wished that with her complexion she had not run to silk waists in magenta Joe however saw no fault in her She was altogether lovely to him and his delight was the more poignant as he recognised in her one of the girls he had seen on the stage a couple of weeks ago That being true nothing could keep her from being glorious in his eyes not even the grease paint which adhered in unneat patches to her face nor her taste for whiskey in its unreformed state He gazed at her in ecstasy until Thomas turning to see what had attracted him said with a laugh Oh it s Hattie Sterling Want to meet her Again the young fellow was dumb Just then Hattie also noticed his intent look and nodded and beckoned to Thomas Come on he said rising Oh she did n t ask for me cried Joe tremulous and eager His companion went away laughing Who s your young friend asked Hattie A fellah from the South Bring him over here Joe could hardly believe in his own good luck and his head which was getting a bit weak was near collapsing when his divinity asked him what he d have He began to protest until she told the waiter with an air of authority to make it a little skey Then she asked him for a cigarette and began talking to him in a pleasant soothing way between puffs When the drinks came she said to Thomas Now old man you ve been awfully nice but when you get your little drink you run away like a good little boy You re superfluous Thomas answered Well I like that but obediently gulped his whiskey and withdrew while Joe laughed until the master of ceremonies stood up and looked sternly at him The concert had long been over and the room was less crowded when Thomas sauntered back to the pair Well good night he said Guess you can find your way home mister Hamilton and he gave Joe a long wink Goo night said Joe woozily I be a ri Goo night Make it another skey was Hattie s farewell remark It was late the next morning when Joe got home He had a headache and a sense of triumph that not even his illness and his mother s reproof could subdue He had promised Hattie to come often to the club X A VISITOR FROM HOME missus Hamilton began to question very seriously whether she had done the best thing in coming to New York as she saw her son staying away more and more and growing always farther away from her and his sister Had she known how and where he spent his evenings she would have had even greater cause to question the wisdom of their trip 
6051-54421-0000	train-other-500	She knew that although he worked he never had any money for the house and she foresaw the time when the little they had would no longer suffice for Kitty and her Realising this she herself set out to find something to do
6051-54421-0001	train-other-500	It was a hard matter for wherever she went seeking employment it was always for her and her daughter
none	none	 for the more she saw of missus Jones the less she thought it well to leave the girl under her influence missus Hamilton was not a keen woman but she had a mother s intuitions and she saw a subtle change in her daughter 
6051-54421-0002	train-other-500	At first the girl grew wistful and then impatient and rebellious She complained that Joe was away from them so much enjoying himself while she had to be housed up like a prisoner She had receded from her dignified position
none	none	 and twice of an evening had gone out for a car ride with Thomas 
6051-54421-0003	train-other-500	but as that gentleman never included the mother in his invitation she decided that her daughter should go no more and she begged Joe to take his sister out sometimes instead
6051-54421-0004	train-other-500	He demurred at first for he now numbered among his city acquirements a fine contempt for his woman relatives Finally however he consented and took Kit once to the theatre
none	none	 and once for a ride Each time he left her in the care of Thomas as soon as they were out of the house while he went to find or to wait for his dear Hattie But his mother did not know all this and Kit did not tell her 
6051-54421-0005	train-other-500	The quick poison of the unreal life about her had already begun to affect her character She had grown secretive and sly The innocent longing which in a burst of enthusiasm she had expressed that first night at the theatre was growing into a real ambition with her
6051-54421-0006	train-other-500	and she dropped the simple old songs she knew to practise the detestable coon ditties which the stage demanded She showed no particular pleasure when her mother found the sort of place they wanted but went to work with her in sullen silence
6051-54421-0007	train-other-500	missus Hamilton could not understand it all and many a night she wept and prayed over the change in this child of her heart There were times when she felt that there was nothing left to work or fight for The letters from Berry in prison became fewer and fewer
6051-54421-0008	train-other-500	He was sinking into the dull dead routine of his life Her own letters to him fell off It was hard getting the children to write
none	none	 They did not want to be bothered and she could not write for herself 
6051-54421-0009	train-other-500	So in the weeks and months that followed she drifted farther away from her children and husband and all the traditions of her life After Joe s first night at the Banner Club he had kept his promise to Hattie Sterling and had gone often to meet her
6051-54421-0010	train-other-500	She had taught him much because it was to her advantage to do so His greenness had dropped from him like a garment
none	none	 but no amount of sophistication could make him deem the woman less perfect 
6051-54421-0011	train-other-500	He knew that she was much older than he but he only took this fact as an additional sign of his prowess in having won her
6051-54421-0012	train-other-500	He was proud of himself when he went behind the scenes at the theatre or waited for her at the stage door and bore her off under the admiring eyes of a crowd of gapers And Hattie She liked him in a half contemptuous half amused way
none	none	 He was a good looking boy and made money enough as she expressed it to show her a good time 
6051-54421-0013	train-other-500	so she was willing to overlook his weakness and his callow vanity Look here she said to him one day I guess you ll have to be moving There s a young lady been inquiring for you to day and I won t stand for that
none	none	 He looked at her startled for a moment until he saw the laughter in her eyes Then he caught her and kissed her What re you givin me he said It s a straight tip that s what 
6051-54421-0014	train-other-500	Who is it It s a girl named Minty Brown from your home His face turned brick red with fear and shame Minty Brown he stammered Had that girl told all and undone him
6051-54421-0015	train-other-500	But Hattie was going on about her work and evidently knew nothing Oh you need n t pretend you don t know her she went on banteringly
none	none	 She says you were great friends down South so I ve invited her to supper She wants to see you 
6051-54421-0016	train-other-500	To supper he thought Was she mocking him Was she restraining her scorn of him only to make his humiliation the greater after a while
none	none	 He looked at her but there was no suspicion of malice in her face and he took hope Well I d like to see old Minty he said It s been many a long day since I ve seen her All that afternoon after going to the barber shop 
6051-54421-0017	train-other-500	Joe was driven by a tempest of conflicting emotions If Minty Brown had not told his story why not Would she yet tell and if she did what would happen He tortured himself by questioning if Hattie would cast him off
6051-54421-0018	train-other-500	At the very thought his hand trembled and the man in the chair asked him if he had n t been drinking When he met Minty in the evening however the first glance at her reassured him Her face was wreathed in smiles as she came forward and held out her hand
6051-54421-0019	train-other-500	Well well Joe Hamilton she exclaimed if I ain t right down glad to see you How are you I m middlin Minty How s yourself
none	none	 He was so happy that he could n t let go her hand 
6051-54421-0020	train-other-500	An jes look at the boy Ef he ain t got the impidence to be waihin a mustache too You must a been lettin the cats lick yo upper lip
none	none	 Did n t expect to see me in New York did you 
6051-54421-0021	train-other-500	No indeed What you doin here
none	none	 Oh I got a gent man friend what s a porter an his run s been changed so that he comes hyeah an he told me if I wanted to come he d bring me thoo fur a visit so you see hyeah I am 
6051-54421-0022	train-other-500	I allus was mighty anxious to see this hyeah town But tell me how s Kit an yo ma They re both right well
none	none	 He had forgotten them and their scorn of Minty Whaih do you live I m comin roun to see em 
6051-54421-0023	train-other-500	He hesitated for a moment He knew how his mother if not Kit would receive her and yet he dared not anger this woman who had his fate in the hollow of her hand She saw his hesitation and spoke up
none	none	 Oh that s all right Let by gones be by gones You know I ain t the kin o person that holds a grudge ag in anybody That s right Minty that s right he said and gave her his mother s address 
6051-54421-0024	train-other-500	Then he hastened home to prepare the way for Minty s coming
none	none	 Joe had no doubt but that his mother would see the matter quite as he saw it and be willing to temporise with Minty 
6051-54421-0025	train-other-500	but he had reckoned without his host missus Hamilton might make certain concessions to strangers on the score of expediency but she absolutely refused to yield one iota of her dignity to one whom she had known so long as an inferior
6051-54421-0026	train-other-500	But don t you see what she can do for us ma She knows people that I know and she can ruin me with them I ain t never bowed my haid to Minty Brown
none	none	 an I ain t a goin to do it now was his mother s only reply Oh ma Kitty put in you don t want to get talked about up here do you We d jes as well be talked about fu somep n we did n t do as fu somep n we did do an it would n be long befo we d come to dat if we made frien s wid dat Brown gal 
6051-54421-0027	train-other-500	I ain t a goin to do it I m ashamed o you Kitty fu wantin me to
none	none	 The girl began to cry while her brother walked the floor angrily 
6051-54421-0028	train-other-500	You ll see what ll happen he cried you ll see Fannie looked at her son and she seemed to see him more clearly than she had ever seen him before his foppery his meanness his cowardice Well she answered with a sigh
none	none	 it can t be no wuss den what s already happened You ll see you ll see the boy reiterated Minty Brown allowed no wind of thought to cool the fire of her determination 
6051-54421-0029	train-other-500	She left Hattie Sterling s soon after Joe and he was still walking the floor and uttering dire forebodings when she rang the bell below and asked for the Hamiltons missus Jones ushered her into her fearfully upholstered parlour
6051-54421-0030	train-other-500	and then puffed up stairs to tell her lodgers that there was a friend there from the South who wanted to see them
none	none	 Tell huh said missus Hamilton dat dey ain t no one hyeah wants to see huh 
6051-54421-0031	train-other-500	No no Kitty broke in
none	none	 Heish said her mother I m goin to boss you a little while yit Why I don t understan you Mis Hamilton puffed missus Jones She s a nice lookin lady an she said she knowed you at home All you got to do is to tell dat ooman jes what I say Minty Brown downstairs had heard the little colloquy 
6051-54421-0032	train-other-500	and perceiving that something was amiss had come to the stairs to listen Now her voice striving hard to be condescending and sweet but growing harsh with anger floated up from below
none	none	 Oh nevah min lady I ain t anxious to see em I jest called out o pity but I reckon dey shamed to see me cause de ol man s in penitentiary 
6051-54421-0033	train-other-500	an dey was run out o town missus Jones gasped and then turned and went hastily downstairs Kit burst out crying afresh and Joe walked the floor muttering beneath his breath while the mother sat grimly watching the outcome
6051-54421-0034	train-other-500	Finally they heard missus Jones step once more on the stairs She came in without knocking and her manner was distinctly unpleasant Mis Hamilton she said I ve had a talk with the lady downstairs an she s tol me everything
none	none	 I d be glad if you d let me have my rooms as soon as possible So you goin to put me out on de wo d of a stranger 
6051-54421-0035	train-other-500	I m kin o sorry but everybody in the house heard what Mis Brown said

6051-54421-0036	train-other-500	I reckon all dat kin be splained
none	none	 Yes but I don t know that anybody kin splain your daughter allus being with mister Thomas who ain t even divo ced from his wife 
6051-54421-0037	train-other-500	She flashed a vindictive glance at the girl who turned deadly pale and dropped her head in her hands You daih to say dat Mis Jones you dat fust interduced my gal to dat man and got huh to go out wid him
none	none	 I reckon you d bettah go now And missus Jones looked at Fannie s face and obeyed As soon as the woman s back was turned Joe burst out There there see what you ve done with your damned foolishness Fannie turned on him like a tigress Don t you cuss hyeah befo me I ain t nevah brung you up to it an I won t stan it Go to dem whaih you larned it an whaih de wo ds soun sweet The boy started to speak but she checked him Don t you daih to cuss ag in or befo Gawd dey ll be somep n fu one o dis fambly to be rottin in jail fu The boy was cowed by his mother s manner He was gathering his few belongings in a bundle I ain t goin to cuss he said sullenly I m goin out o your way Oh go on she said go on It s been a long time sence you been my son You on yo way to hell an you is been fu lo dese many days 
6051-54421-0038	train-other-500	Joe got out of the house as soon as possible He did not speak to Kit nor look at his mother He felt like a cur because he knew deep down in his heart that he had only been waiting for some excuse to take this step
6051-54421-0039	train-other-500	As he slammed the door behind him his mother flung herself down by Kit s side and mingled her tears with her daughter s But Kit did not raise her head
none	none	 Dey ain t nothin lef but you now Kit 
6051-54421-0040	train-other-500	but the girl did not speak she only shook with hard sobs Then her mother raised her head and almost screamed My Gawd not you Kit The girl rose and then dropped unconscious in her mother s arms
none	none	 Joe took his clothes to a lodging house that he knew of and then went to the club to drink himself up to the point of going to see Hattie after the show XI BROKEN HOPES What Joe Hamilton lacked more than anything else in the world was some one to kick him Many a man who might have lived decently and become a fairly respectable citizen has gone to the dogs for the want of some one to administer a good resounding kick at the right time It is corrective and clarifying Joe needed especially its clarifying property for though he knew himself a cur he went away from his mother s house feeling himself somehow aggrieved and the feeling grew upon him the more he thought of it His mother had ruined his chance in life and he could never hold up his head again Yes he had heard that several of the fellows at the club had shady reputations but surely to be the son of a thief or a supposed thief was not like being the criminal himself At the Banner he took a seat by himself and ordering a cocktail sat glowering at the few other lonely members who had happened to drop in There were not many of them and the contagion of unsociability had taken possession of the house The people sat scattered around at different tables perfectly unmindful of the bartender who cursed them under his breath for not getting together Joe s mind was filled with bitter thoughts How long had he been away from home he asked himself Nearly a year Nearly a year passed in New York and he had come to be what he so much desired a part of its fast life and now in a moment an old woman s stubbornness had destroyed all that he had builded What would Thomas say when he heard it What would the other fellows think And Hattie It was plain that she would never notice him again He had no doubt but that the malice of Minty Brown would prompt her to seek out all of his friends and make the story known Why had he not tried to placate her by disavowing sympathy with his mother He would have had no compunction about doing so but he had thought of it too late He sat brooding over his trouble until the bartender called with respectful sarcasm to ask if he wanted to lease the glass he had He gave back a silly laugh gulped the rest of the liquor down and was ordering another when Sadness came in He came up directly to Joe and sat down beside him mister Hamilton says Make it two Jack he said with easy familiarity Well what s the matter old man You re looking glum I feel glum The divine Hattie has n t been cutting any capers has she The dear old girl has n t been getting hysterical at her age Let us hope not Joe glared at him Why in the devil should this fellow be so sadly gay when he was weighted down with sorrow and shame and disgust Come come now Hamilton if you re sore because I invited myself to take a drink with you I ll withdraw the order I know the heroic thing to say is that I ll pay for the drinks myself but I can t screw my courage up to the point of doing so unnatural a thing Young Hamilton hastened to protest Oh I know you fellows now well enough to know how many drinks to pay for It ain t that Well then out with it What is it Have n t been up to anything have you The desire came to Joe to tell this man the whole truth just what was the matter and so to relieve his heart On the impulse he did If he had expected much from Sadness he was disappointed for not a muscle of the man s face changed during the entire recital When it was over he looked at his companion critically through a wreath of smoke Then he said For a fellow who has had for a full year the advantage of the education of the New York clubs you are strangely young Let me see you are nineteen or twenty now yes Well that perhaps accounts for it It s a pity you were n t born older It s a pity most men are n t They would n t have to take so much time and lose so many good things learning Now mister Hamilton let me tell you and you will pardon me for it that you are a fool Your case is n t half as bad as that of nine tenths of the fellows that hang around here Now for instance my father was hung Joe started and gave a gasp of horror Oh yes but it was done with a very good rope and by the best citizens of Texas so it seems that I really ought to be very grateful to them for the distinction they conferred upon my family but I am not I am ungratefully sad A man must be very high or very low to take the sensible view of life that keeps him from being sad I must confess that I have aspired to the depths without ever being fully able to reach them Now look around a bit See that little girl over there That s Viola Two years ago she wrenched up an iron stool from the floor of a lunch room and killed another woman with it She s nineteen just about your age by the way Well she had friends with a certain amount of pull She got out of it and no one thinks the worse of Viola You see Hamilton in this life we are all suffering from fever and no one edges away from the other because he finds him a little warm It s dangerous when you re not used to it but once you go through the parching process you become inoculated against further contagion Now there s Barney over there as decent a fellow as I know but he has been indicted twice for pocket picking A half dozen fellows whom you meet here every night have killed their man Others have done worse things for which you respect them less Poor Wallace who is just coming in and who looks like a jaunty ragpicker came here about six months ago with about two thousand dollars the proceeds from the sale of a house his father had left him He ll sleep in one of the club chairs to night and not from choice He spent his two thousand learning But after all it was a good investment It was like buying an annuity He begins to know already how to live on others as they have lived on him The plucked bird s beak is sharpened for other s feathers From now on Wallace will live eat drink and sleep at the expense of others and will forget to mourn his lost money He will go on this way until broken and useless the poor house or the potter s field gets him Oh it s a fine rich life my lad I know you ll like it I said you would the first time I saw you It has plenty of stir in it and a man never gets lonesome Only the rich are lonesome It s only the independent who depend upon others Sadness laughed a peculiar laugh and there was a look in his terribly bright eyes that made Joe creep If he could only have understood all that the man was saying to him he might even yet have turned back But he did n t He ordered another drink The only effect that the talk of Sadness had upon him was to make him feel wonderfully in it It gave him a false bravery and he mentally told himself that now he would not be afraid to face Hattie He put out his hand to Sadness with a knowing look Thanks Sadness he said you ve helped me lots Sadness brushed the proffered hand away and sprung up You lie he cried I have n t I was only fool enough to try and he turned hastily away from the table Joe looked surprised at first and then laughed at his friend s retreating form Poor old fellow he said drunk again Must have had something before he came in There was not a lie in all that Sadness had said either as to their crime or their condition He belonged to a peculiar class one that grows larger and larger each year in New York and which has imitators in every large city in this country It is a set which lives like the leech upon the blood of others that draws its life from the veins of foolish men and immoral women that prides itself upon its well dressed idleness and has no shame in its voluntary pauperism Each member of the class knows every other his methods and his limitations and their loyalty one to another makes of them a great hulking fashionably uniformed fraternity of indolence Some play the races a few months of the year others quite as intermittently gamble at shoestring politics and waver from party to party as time or their interests seem to dictate But mostly they are like the lilies of the field It was into this set that Sadness had sarcastically invited Joe and Joe felt honoured He found that all of his former feelings had been silly and quite out of place that all he had learned in his earlier years was false It was very plain to him now that to want a good reputation was the sign of unpardonable immaturity and that dishonour was the only real thing worth while It made him feel better He was just rising bravely to swagger out to the theatre when Minty Brown came in with one of the club men he knew He bowed and smiled but she appeared not to notice him at first and when she did she nudged her companion and laughed Suddenly his little courage began to ooze out and he knew what she must be saying to the fellow at her side for he looked over at him and grinned Where now was the philosophy of Sadness Evidently Minty had not been brought under its educating influences and thought about the whole matter in the old ignorant way He began to think of it too Somehow old teachings and old traditions have an annoying way of coming back upon us in the critical moments of life although one has long ago recognised how much truer and better some newer ways of thinking are But Joe would not allow Minty to shatter his dreams by bringing up these old notions She must be instructed He rose and went over to her table Why Minty he said offering his hand you ain t mad at me are you Go on away f om hyeah she said angrily I don t want none o thievin Berry Hamilton s fambly to speak to me Why you were all right this evening Yes but jest out o pity an you was nice cause you was afraid I d tell on you Go on now Go on now said Minty s young man and he looked menacing Joe what little self respect he had gone slunk out of the room and needed several whiskeys in a neighbouring saloon to give him courage to go to the theatre and wait for Hattie who was playing in vaudeville houses pending the opening of her company The closing act was just over when he reached the stage door He was there but a short time when Hattie tripped out and took his arm Her face was bright and smiling and there was no suggestion of disgust in the dancing eyes she turned up to him Evidently she had not heard but the thought gave him no particular pleasure as it left him in suspense as to how she would act when she should hear Let s go somewhere and get some supper she said I m as hungry as I can be What are you looking so cut up about Oh I ain t feelin so very good I hope you ain t lettin that long tongued Brown woman bother your head are you His heart seemed to stand still She did know then Do you know all about it Why of course I do You might know she d come to me first with her story And you still keep on speaking to me Now look here Joe if you ve been drinking I ll forgive you if you ain t you go on and leave me Say what do you take me for Do you think I d throw down a friend because somebody else talked about him Well you don t know Hat Sterling When Minty told me that story she was back in my dressing room and I sent her out o there a flying and with a tongue lashing that she won t forget for a month o Sundays I reckon that was the reason she jumped on me so hard at the club He chuckled He had taken heart again All that Sadness had said was true after all and people thought no less of him His joy was unbounded So she jumped on you hard did she The cat Oh she did n t say a thing to me Well Joe it s just like this I ain t an angel you know that but I do try to be square and whenever I find a friend of mine down on his luck in his pocket book or his feelings why I give him my flipper Why old chap I believe I like you better for the stiff upper lip you ve been keeping under all this Why Hattie he broke out unable any longer to control himself you re you re Oh I m just plain Hat Sterling who won t throw down her friends Now come on and get something to eat If that thing is at the club we ll go there and show her just how much her talk amounted to She thinks she s the whole game but I can spot her and then show her that she ain t one two three When they reached the Banner they found Minty still there She tried on the two the same tactics that she had employed so successfully upon Joe alone She nudged her companion and tittered But she had another person to deal with Hattie Sterling stared at her coldly and indifferently and passed on by her to a seat Joe proceeded to order supper and other things in the nonchalant way that the woman had enjoined upon him Minty began to feel distinctly uncomfortable but it was her business not to be beaten She laughed outright Hattie did not seem to hear her She was beckoning Sadness to her side He came and sat down Now look here she said you can t have any supper because you have n t reached the stage of magnificent hunger to make a meal palatable to you You ve got so used to being nearly starved that a meal don t taste good to you under any other circumstances You re in on the drinks though Your thirst is always available Jack she called down the long room to the bartender make it three Lean over here I want to talk to you See that woman over there by the wall No not that one the big light woman with Griggs Well she s come here with a story trying to throw Joe down and I want you to help me do her Oh that s the one that upset our young friend is it said Sadness turning his mournful eyes upon Minty That s her So you know about it do you Yes and I ll help do her She must n t touch one of the fraternity you know He kept his eyes fixed upon the outsider until she squirmed She could not at all understand this serious conversation directed at her She wondered if she had gone too far and if they contemplated putting her out It made her uneasy Now this same Miss Sterling had the faculty of attracting a good deal of attention when she wished to She brought it into play to night and in ten minutes aided by Sadness she had a crowd of jolly people about her table When as she would have expressed it everything was going fat she suddenly paused and turning her eyes full upon Minty said in a voice loud enough for all to hear Say boys you ve heard that story about Joe have n t you They had Well that s the one that told it she s come here to try to throw him and me down Is she going to do it Well I guess not was the rousing reply and every face turned towards the now frightened Minty She rose hastily and getting her skirts together fled from the room followed more leisurely by the crestfallen Griggs Hattie s laugh and Thank you fellows followed her out Matters were less easy for Joe s mother and sister than they were for him A week or more after this Kitty found him and told him that Minty s story had reached their employers and that they were out of work You see Joe she said sadly we ve took a flat since we moved from Mis Jones and we had to furnish it We ve got one lodger a race horse man an he s mighty nice to ma an me but that ain t enough Now we ve got to do something Joe was so smitten with sorrow that he gave her a dollar and promised to speak about the matter to a friend of his He did speak about it to Hattie You ve told me once or twice that your sister could sing Bring her down here to me and if she can do anything I ll get her a place on the stage was Hattie s answer When Kitty heard it she was radiant but her mother only shook her head and said De las hope de las hope XII ALL THE WORLD S A STAGE Kitty proved herself Joe s sister by falling desperately in love with Hattie Sterling the first time they met The actress was very gracious to her and called her child in a pretty patronising way and patted her on the cheek It s a shame that Joe has n t brought you around before We ve been good friends for quite some time He told me you an him was right good friends Already Joe took on a new importance in his sister s eyes He must be quite a man she thought to be the friend of such a person as Miss Sterling So you think you want to go on the stage do you Yes m I thought it might be right nice for me if I could Joe go out and get some beer for us and then I ll hear your sister sing Miss Sterling talked as if she were a manager and had only to snap her fingers to be obeyed When Joe came back with the beer Kitty drank a glass She did not like it but she would not offend her hostess After this she sang and Miss Sterling applauded her generously although the young girl s nervousness kept her from doing her best The encouragement helped her and she did better as she became more at home Why child you ve got a good voice And Joe you ve been keeping her shut up all this time You ought to be ashamed of yourself The young man had little to say He had brought Kitty almost under a protest because he had no confidence in her ability and thought that his girl would disillusion her It did not please him now to find his sister so fully under the limelight and himself up stage Kitty was quite in a flutter of delight not so much with the idea of working as with the glamour of the work she might be allowed to do I tell you now Hattie Sterling pursued throwing a brightly stockinged foot upon a chair your voice is too good for the chorus Gi me a cigarette Joe Have one Kitty I m goin to call you Kitty It s nice and homelike and then we ve got to be great chums you know Kitty unwilling to refuse anything from the sorceress took her cigarette and lighted it but a few puffs set her off coughing Tut tut Kitty child don t do it if you ain t used to it You ll learn soon enough Joe wanted to kick his sister for having tried so delicate an art and failed for he had not yet lost all of his awe of Hattie Now what I was going to say the lady resumed after several contemplative puffs is that you ll have to begin in the chorus any way and work your way up It would n t take long for you with your looks and voice to put one of the up and ups out o the business Only hope it won t be me I ve had people I ve helped try to do it often enough She gave a laugh that had just a touch of bitterness in it for she began to recognise that although she had been on the stage only a short time she was no longer the all conquering Hattie Sterling in the first freshness of her youth Oh I would n t want to push anybody out Kit expostulated Oh never mind you ll soon get bravely over that feeling and even if you did n t it would n t matter much The thing has to happen Somebody s got to go down We don t last long in this life it soon wears us out and when we re worn out and sung out danced out and played out the manager has no further use for us so he reduces us to the ranks or kicks us out entirely Joe here thought it time for him to put in a word Get out Hat he said contemptuously you re good for a dozen years yet She did n t deign to notice him save so far as a sniff goes Don t you let what I say scare you though Kitty You ve got a good chance and maybe you ll have more sense than I ve got and at least save money while you re in it But let s get off that It makes me sick All you ve got to do is to come to the opera house to morrow and I ll introduce you to the manager He s a fool but I think we can make him do something for you Oh thank you I ll be around to morrow sure Better come about ten o clock There s a rehearsal to morrow and you ll find him there Of course he ll be pretty rough he always is at rehearsals but he ll take to you if he thinks there s anything in you and he can get it out Kitty felt herself dismissed and rose to go Joe did not rise I ll see you later Kit he said I ain t goin just yet Say he added when his sister was gone you re a hot one What do you want to give her all that con for She ll never get in Joe said Hattie don t you get awful tired of being a jackass Sometimes I want to kiss you and sometimes I feel as if I had to kick you I ll compromise with you now by letting you bring me some more beer This got all stale while your sister was here I saw she did n t like it and so I would n t drink any more for fear she d try to keep up with me Kit is a good deal of a jay yet Joe remarked wisely Oh yes this world is full of jays Lots of em have seen enough to make em wise but they re still jays and don t know it That s the worst of it They go around thinking they re it when they ain t even in the game Go on and get the beer And Joe went feeling vaguely that he had been sat upon Kit flew home with joyous heart to tell her mother of her good prospects She burst into the room crying Oh ma ma Miss Hattie thinks I ll do to go on the stage Ain t it grand She did not meet with the expected warmth of response from her mother I do know as it ll be so gran F om what I see of dem stage people dey don t seem to mount to much De way dem gals shows demse ves is right down bad to me Is you goin to dress lak dem we seen dat night Kit hung her head

must n t feel that away ma I m doin it to help you I do want no sich help I d ruther starve Kit did not reply but there was no yielding in her manner Kit her mother went on dey s somep n I ain t nevah tol you dat I m goin to tell you now Mistah Gibson ust to come to Mis Jones s lots to see me befo we moved hyeah an he s been talkin bout a good many things to me She hesitated He say dat I ain t

he s gone an ef yo go befo Gawd I ll tell Tawm Gibson yes The mother looked up to see just what effect her plea would have on her daughter She hoped that what she said would have the desired result But the girl turned around from fixing her neck ribbon before the glass her face radiant Why it ll be splendid He s such a nice man an race horse men most always have money Why don t you marry him ma Then I d feel that you was safe an settled an that you would n t be lonesome when the show was out of town You want me to ma y him an desert yo po pa I guess what he says is right ma I don t reckon we

chillen s gone Po Be y po Be y Ef you evah do come out Gawd he p you to baih what you ll fin And missus Hamilton rose and tottered from the room as if the old age she anticipated had already come upon her Kit stood looking after her fear and grief in her eyes Poor ma she said an poor pa But I know an I know it s for the best On the next morning she was up early and practising hard for her interview with the managing star of Martin s Blackbirds When she arrived at the theatre Hattie Sterling met her with frank friendliness I m glad you came early Kitty she remarked for maybe you can get a chance to talk with Martin before he begins rehearsal and gets all worked up He ll be a little less like a bear then But even if you don t see him before then wait and don t get scared if he tries to bluff you His bark is a good deal worse than his bite When mister Martin came in that morning he had other ideas than that of seeing applicants for places His show must begin in two weeks and it was advertised to be larger and better than ever before when really nothing at all had been done for it The promise of this advertisement must be fulfilled mister Martin was late and was out of humour with every one else on account of it He came in hurried fierce and important Mornin mister Smith mornin missus Jones Ha ladies and gentlemen all here He shot every word out of his mouth as if the after taste of it were unpleasant to him He walked among the chorus like an angry king among his vassals and his glance was a flash of insolent fire From his head to his feet he was the very epitome of self sufficient brutal conceit Kitty trembled as she noted the hush that fell on the people at his entrance She felt like rushing out of the room She could never face this terrible man She trembled more as she found his eyes fixed upon her Who s that he asked disregarding her as if she had been a stick or a stone Well don t snap her head off It s a girl friend of mine that wants a place said Hattie She was the only one who would brave Martin Humph Let her wait I ain t got no time to hear any one now Get yourselves in line you all who are on to that first chorus while I m getting into my sweat shirt He disappeared behind a screen whence he emerged arrayed or only half arrayed in a thick absorbing shirt and a thin pair of woollen trousers Then the work began The man was indefatigable He was like the spirit of energy He was in every place about the stage at once leading the chorus showing them steps twisting some awkward girl into shape shouting gesticulating abusing the pianist Now now he would shout the left foot on that beat Bah bah stop You walk like a lot of tin soldiers Are your joints rusty Do you want oil Look here Taylor if I did n t know you I d take you for a truck Pick up your feet open your mouths and move move move Oh and he would drop his head in despair And to think that I ve got to do something with these things in two weeks two weeks Then he would turn to them again with a sudden reaccession of eagerness Now at it again at it again Hold that note hold it Now whirl and on the left foot Stop that music stop it Miss Coster you ll learn that step in about a thousand years and I ve got nine hundred and ninety nine years and fifty weeks less time than that to spare Come here and try that step with me Don t be afraid to move Step like a chicken on a hot griddle And some blushing girl would come forward and go through the step alone before all the rest Kitty contemplated the scene with a mind equally divided between fear and anger What should she do if he should so speak to her Like the others no doubt smile sheepishly and obey him But she did not like to believe it She felt that the independence which she had known from babyhood would assert itself and that she would talk back to him even as Hattie Sterling did She felt scared and discouraged but every now and then her friend smiled encouragingly upon her across the ranks of moving singers Finally however her thoughts were broken in upon by hearing mister Martin cry Oh quit quit and go rest yourselves you ancient pieces of hickory and let me forget you for a minute before I go crazy Where s that new girl now Kitty rose and went toward him trembling so that she could hardly walk What can you do I can sing very faintly Well if that s the voice you re going to sing in there won t be many that ll know whether it s good or bad Well let s hear something Do you know any of these And he ran over the titles of several songs She knew some of them and he selected one Try this Here Tom play it for her It was an ordeal for the girl to go through She had never sung before at anything more formidable than a church concert where only her immediate acquaintances and townspeople were present Now to sing before all these strange people themselves singers made her feel faint and awkward But the courage of desperation came to her and she struck into the song At the first her voice wavered and threatened to fail her It must not She choked back her fright and forced the music from her lips When she was done she was startled to hear Martin burst into a raucous laugh Such humiliation She had failed and instead of telling her he was bringing her to shame before the whole company The tears came into her eyes and she was about giving way when she caught a reassuring nod and smile from Hattie Sterling and seized on this as a last hope Haw haw haw laughed Martin haw haw haw The little one was scared see She was scared d you understand But did you see the grit she went at it with Just took the bit in her teeth and got away Haw haw haw Now that s what I like If all you girls had that spirit we could do something in two weeks Try another one girl Kitty s heart had suddenly grown light She sang the second one better because something within her was singing Good said Martin but he immediately returned to his cold manner You watch these girls close and see what they do and to morrow be prepared to go into line and move as well as sing He immediately turned his attention from her to the chorus but no slight that he could inflict upon her now could take away the sweet truth that she was engaged and to morrow would begin work She wished she could go over and embrace Hattie Sterling She thought kindly of Joe and promised herself to give him a present out of her first month s earnings On the first night of the show pretty little Kitty Hamilton was pointed out as a girl who would n t be in the chorus long The mother who was soon to be missus Gibson sat in the balcony a grieved pained look on her face Joe was in a front row with some of the rest of the gang He took many drinks between the acts because he was proud mister Thomas was there He also was proud and after the performance he waited for Kitty at the stage door and went forward to meet her as she came out The look she gave him stopped him and he let her pass without a word Who d a thought he mused that the kid had that much nerve Well if they don t want to find out things what do they come to N Yawk for It ain t nobody s old Sunday school picnic Guess I got out easy anyhow Hattie Sterling took Joe home in a hansom Say she said if you come this way for me again it s all over see Your little sister s a comer and I ve got to hustle to keep up with her Joe growled and fell asleep in his chair One must needs have a strong head or a strong will when one is the brother of a celebrity and would celebrate the distinguished one s success XIII THE OAKLEYS A year after the arrest of Berry Hamilton and at a time when New York had shown to the eyes of his family so many strange new sights there were few changes to be noted in the condition of affairs at the Oakley place Maurice Oakley was perhaps a shade more distrustful of his servants and consequently more testy with them missus Oakley was the same acquiescent woman with unbounded faith in her husband s wisdom and judgment With complacent minds both went their ways drank their wine and said their prayers and wished that brother Frank s five years were past They had letters from him now and then never very cheerful in tone but always breathing the deepest love and gratitude to them His brother found deep cause for congratulation in the tone of these epistles Frank is getting down to work he would cry exultantly He is past the first buoyant enthusiasm of youth Ah Leslie when a man begins to be serious then he begins to be something And her only answer would be I wonder Maurice if Claire Lessing will wait for him The two had frequent questions to answer as to Frank s doing and prospects and they had always bright things to say of him even when his letters gave them no such warrant Their love for him made them read large between the lines and all they read was good Between Maurice and his brother no word of the guilty servant ever passed They each avoided it as an unpleasant subject Frank had never asked and his brother had never proffered aught of the outcome of the case missus Oakley had once suggested it Brother ought to know she said that Berry is being properly punished By no means replied her husband You know that it would only hurt him He shall never know if I have to tell him You are right Maurice you are always right We must shield Frank from the pain it would cause him Poor fellow he is so sensitive Their hearts were still steadfastly fixed upon the union of this younger brother with Claire Lessing She had lately come into a fortune and there was nothing now to prevent it They would have written Frank to urge it but they both believed that to try to woo him away from his art was but to make him more wayward That any woman could have power enough to take him away from this jealous mistress they very much doubted But they could hope and hope made them eager to open every letter that bore the French postmark Always it might contain news that he was coming home or that he had made a great success or better some inquiry after Claire A long time they had waited but found no such tidings in the letters from Paris At last as Maurice Oakley sat in his library one day the servant brought him a letter more bulky in weight and appearance than any he had yet received His eyes glistened with pleasure as he read the postmark A letter from Frank he said joyfully and an important one I ll wager He smiled as he weighed it in his hand and caressed it missus Oakley was out shopping and as he knew how deep her interest was he hesitated to break the seal before she returned He curbed his natural desire and laid the heavy envelope down on the desk But he could not deny himself the pleasure of speculating as to its contents It was such a large interesting looking package What might it not contain It simply reeked of possibilities Had any one banteringly told Maurice Oakley that he had such a deep vein of sentiment he would have denied it with scorn and laughter But here he found himself sitting with the letter in his hand and weaving stories as to its contents First now it might be a notice that Frank had received the badge of the Legion of Honour No no that was too big and he laughed aloud at his own folly wondering the next minute with half shame why he laughed for did he after all believe anything was too big for that brother of his Well let him begin anyway away down Let him say for instance that the letter told of the completion and sale of a great picture Frank had sold small ones He would be glad of this for his brother had written him several times of things that were a doing but not yet of anything that was done Or better yet let the letter say that some picture long finished but of which the artist s pride and anxiety had forbidden him to speak had made a glowing success the success it deserved This sounded well and seemed not at all beyond the bounds of possibility It was an alluring vision He saw the picture already It was a scene from life true in detail to the point of very minuteness and yet with something spiritual in it that lifted it above the mere copy of the commonplace At the Salon it would be hung on the line and people would stand before it admiring its workmanship and asking who the artist was He drew on his memory of old reading In his mind s eye he saw Frank unconscious of his own power or too modest to admit it stand unknown among the crowds around his picture waiting for and dreading their criticisms He saw the light leap to his eyes as he heard their words of praise He saw the straightening of his narrow shoulders when he was forced to admit that he was the painter of the work Then the windows of Paris were filled with his portraits The papers were full of his praise and brave men and fair women met together to do him homage Fair women yes and Frank would look upon them all and see reflected in them but a tithe of the glory of one woman and that woman Claire Lessing He roused himself and laughed again as he tapped the magic envelope My fancies go on and conquer the world for my brother he muttered He will follow their flight one day and do it himself The letter drew his eyes back to it It seemed to invite him to beg him even No I will not do it I will wait until Leslie comes She will be as glad to hear the good news as I am His dreams were taking the shape of reality in his mind and he was believing all that he wanted to believe He turned to look at a picture painted by Frank which hung over the mantel He dwelt lovingly upon it seeing in it the touch of a genius Surely he said this new picture cannot be greater than that though it shall hang where kings can see it and this only graces the library of my poor house It has the feeling of a woman s soul with the strength of a man s heart When Frank and Claire marry I shall give it back to them It is too great a treasure for a clod like me Heigho why will women be so long a shopping He glanced again at the letter and his hand went out involuntarily towards it He fondled it smiling Ah Lady Leslie I ve a mind to open it to punish you for staying so long He essayed to be playful but he knew that he was trying to make a compromise with himself because his eagerness grew stronger than his gallantry He laid the letter down and picked it up again He studied the postmark over and over He got up and walked to the window and back again and then began fumbling in his pockets for his knife No he did not want it yes he did He would just cut the envelope and make believe he had read it to pique his wife but he would not read it Yes that was it He found the knife and slit the paper His fingers trembled as he touched the sheets that protruded Why would not Leslie come Did she not know that he was waiting for her She ought to have known that there was a letter from Paris to day for it had been a month since they had had one There was a sound of footsteps without He sprang up crying I ve been waiting so long for you A servant opened the door to bring him a message Oakley dismissed him angrily What did he want to go down to the Continental for to drink and talk politics to a lot of muddle pated fools when he had a brother in Paris who was an artist and a letter from him lay unread in his hand His patience and his temper were going Leslie was careless and unfeeling She ought to come he was tired of waiting A carriage rolled up the driveway and he dropped the letter guiltily as if it were not his own He would only say that he had grown tired of waiting and started to read it But it was only missus Davis s footman leaving a note for Leslie about some charity He went back to the letter Well it was his Leslie had forfeited her right to see it as soon as he It might be mean but it was not dishonest No he would not read it now but he would take it out and show her that he had exercised his self control in spite of her shortcomings He laid it on the desk once more It leered at him He might just open the sheets enough to see the lines that began it and read no further Yes he would do that Leslie could not feel hurt at such a little thing The first line had only Dear Brother Dear Brother Why not the second That could not hold much more The second line held him and the third and the fourth and as he read on unmindful now of what Leslie might think or feel his face turned from the ruddy glow of pleasant anxiety to the pallor of grief and terror He was not half way through it when missus Oakley s voice in the hall announced her coming He did not hear her He sat staring at the page before him his lips apart and his eyes staring Then with a cry that echoed through the house crumpling the sheets in his hand he fell forward fainting to the floor just as his wife rushed into the room What is it she cried Maurice Maurice He lay on the floor staring up at the ceiling the letter clutched in his hands She ran to him and lifted up his head but he gave no sign of life Already the servants were crowding to the door She bade one of them to hasten for a doctor others to bring water and brandy and the rest to be gone As soon as she was alone she loosed the crumpled sheets from his hand for she felt that this must have been the cause of her husband s strange attack Without a thought of wrong for they had no secrets from each other she glanced at the opening lines Then she forgot the unconscious man at her feet and read the letter through to the end The letter was in Frank s neat hand a little shaken perhaps by nervousness DEAR BROTHER it ran I know you will grieve at receiving this and I wish that I might bear your grief for you but I cannot though I have as heavy a burden as this can bring to you Mine would have been lighter to day perhaps had you been more straightforward with me I am not blaming you however for I know that my hypocrisy made you believe me possessed of a really soft heart and you thought to spare me Until yesterday when in a letter from Esterton he casually mentioned the matter I did not know that Berry was in prison else this letter would have been written sooner I have been wanting to write it for so long and yet have been too great a coward to do so I know that you will be disappointed in me and just what that disappointment will cost you I know but you must hear the truth I shall never see your face again or I should not dare to tell it even now You will remember that I begged you to be easy on your servant You thought it was only my kindness of heart It was not I had a deeper reason I knew where the money had gone and dared not tell Berry is as innocent as yourself and I well it is a story and let me tell it to you You have had so much confidence in me and I hate to tell you that it was all misplaced I have no doubt that I should not be doing it now but that I have drunken absinthe enough to give me the emotional point of view which I shall regret to morrow I do not mean that I am drunk I can think clearly and write clearly but my emotions are extremely active Do you remember Claire s saying at the table that night of the farewell dinner that some dark eyed mademoiselle was waiting for me She did not know how truly she spoke though I fancy she saw how I flushed when she said it for I was already in love madly so I need not describe her I need say nothing about her for I know that nothing I say can ever persuade you to forgive her for taking me from you This has gone on since I first came here and I dared not tell you for I saw whither your eyes had turned I loved this girl and she both inspired and hindered my work Perhaps I would have been successful had I not met her perhaps not I love her too well to marry her and make of our devotion a stale prosy thing of duty and compulsion When a man does not marry a woman he must keep her better than he would a wife It costs All that you gave me went to make her happy Then when I was about leaving you the catastrophe came I wanted much to carry back to her I gambled to make more I would surprise her Luck was against me Night after night I lost Then just before the dinner I woke from my frenzy to find all that I had was gone I would have asked you for more and you would have given it but that strange ridiculous something which we misname Southern honour that honour which strains at a gnat and swallows a camel withheld me and I preferred to do worse So I lied to you The money from my cabinet was not stolen save by myself I am a liar and a thief but your eyes shall never tell me so Tell the truth and have Berry released I can stand it Write me but one letter to tell me of this Do not plead with me do not forgive me do not seek to find me for from this time I shall be as one who has perished from the earth I shall be no more Your brother FRANK By the time the servants came they found missus Oakley as white as her lord But with firm hands and compressed lips she ministered to his needs pending the doctor s arrival She bathed his face and temples chafed his hands and forced the brandy between his lips Finally he stirred and his hands gripped The letter he gasped Yes dear I have it I have it Give it to me he cried She handed it to him He seized it and thrust it into his breast Did did you read it Yes I did not know Oh my God I did not intend that you should see it I wanted the secret for my own I wanted to carry it to my grave with me Oh Frank Frank Frank Never mind Maurice It is as if you alone knew it It is not I say it is not He turned upon his face and began to weep passionately not like a man but like a child whose last toy has been broken Oh my God he moaned my brother my brother Sh dearie think it s it s Frank That s it that s it that s what I can t forget It s Frank Frank my brother Suddenly he sat up and his eyes stared straight into hers Leslie no one must ever know what is in this letter he said calmly No one shall Maurice come let us burn it Burn it No no he cried clutching at his breast It must not be burned What burn my brother s secret No no I must carry it with me carry it with me to the grave But Maurice I must carry it with me She saw that he was overwrought and so did not argue with him When the doctor came he found Maurice Oakley in bed but better The medical man diagnosed the case and decided that he had received some severe shock He feared too for his heart for the patient constantly held his hands pressed against his bosom In vain the doctor pleaded he would not take them down and when the wife added her word the physician gave up and after prescribing left much puzzled in mind It s a strange case he said there s something more than the nervous shock that makes him clutch his chest like that and yet I have never noticed signs of heart trouble in Oakley Oh well business worry will produce anything in anybody It was soon common talk about the town about Maurice Oakley s attack In the seclusion of his chamber he was saying to his wife Ah Leslie you and I will keep the secret No one shall ever know Yes dear but but what of Berry What of Berry he cried starting up excitedly What is Berry to Frank What is that nigger to my brother What are his sufferings to the honour of my family and name Never mind Maurice never mind you are right It must never be known I say if Berry has to rot in jail So they wrote a lie to Frank and buried the secret in their breasts and Oakley wore its visible form upon his heart XIV FRANKENSTEIN

5808_54425_000009_000007	train-clean-100	He was so ready to go down that it needed but a gentle push to start him and once started there was nothing within him to hold him back from the depths For his will was as flabby as his conscience and his pride which stands to some men for conscience had no definite aim or direction 
5808_54425_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Hattie Sterling had given him both his greatest impulse for evil and for good 
5808_54425_000010_000001	train-clean-100	She had at first given him his gentle push but when she saw that his collapse would lose her a faithful and useful slave she had sought to check his course 
5808_54425_000010_000002	train-clean-100	Her threat of the severance of their relations had held him up for a little time and she began to believe that he was safe again

5808_54425_000010_000005	train-clean-100	She kept her promise and threw him over 
5808_54425_000010_000006	train-clean-100	Then he became a hanger on at the clubs a genteel loafer

5808_54425_000010_000008	train-clean-100	He did not work and yet he lived and ate and was proud of his degradation 
none	none	But he soon tired of being separated from Hattie and straightened up again 
5808_54425_000010_000010	train-clean-100	After some demur she received him upon his former footing 
5808_54425_000010_000011	train-clean-100	It was only for a few months 
5808_54425_000010_000012	train-clean-100	He fell again 
5808_54425_000010_000013	train-clean-100	For almost four years this had happened intermittently 
5808_54425_000010_000014	train-clean-100	Finally he took a turn for the better that endured so long that Hattie Sterling again gave him her faith 
none	none	Then the woman made her mistake 
5808_54425_000010_000016	train-clean-100	She warmed to him 
5808_54425_000010_000017	train-clean-100	She showed him that she was proud of him 
5808_54425_000010_000018	train-clean-100	He went forth at once to celebrate his victory 
5808_54425_000010_000019	train-clean-100	He did not return to her for three days 
5808_54425_000010_000020	train-clean-100	Then he was battered unkempt and thick of speech 
5808_54425_000011_000000	train-clean-100	She looked at him in silent contempt for a while as he sat nursing his aching head 
none	none	Well you re a beauty she said finally with cutting scorn
5808_54425_000012_000001	train-clean-100	 You ought to be put under a glass case and placed on exhibition 
5808_54425_000013_000000	train-clean-100	He groaned and his head sunk lower 
none	none	A drunken man is always disarmed 
5808_54425_000014_000000	train-clean-100	His helplessness instead of inspiring her with pity inflamed her with an unfeeling anger that burst forth in a volume of taunts 
none	none	You re the thing I ve given up all my chances for you a miserable drunken jay without a jay s decency No one had ever looked at you until I picked you up and you ve been strutting around ever since showing off because I was kind to you and now this is the way you pay me back 
5808_54425_000015_000002	train-clean-100	Drunk half the time and half drunk the rest 
5808_54425_000015_000003	train-clean-100	Well you know what I told you the last time you got loaded 
5808_54425_000015_000004	train-clean-100	I mean it too 
none	none	You re not the only star in sight see She laughed meanly and began to sing You ll have to find another baby now 
5808_54425_000017_000000	train-clean-100	For the first time he looked up and his eyes were full of tears tears both of grief and intoxication 
5808_54425_000017_000001	train-clean-100	There was an expression of a whipped dog on his face 
none	none	Do Ha ie do he pleaded stretching out his hands to her 
5808_54425_000019_000000	train-clean-100	Her eyes blazed back at him but she sang on insolently tauntingly 
5808_54425_000020_000000	train-clean-100	The very inanity of the man disgusted her and on a sudden impulse she sprang up and struck him full in the face with the flat of her hand 
5808_54425_000020_000001	train-clean-100	He was too weak to resist the blow and tumbling from the chair fell limply to the floor where he lay at her feet alternately weeping aloud and quivering with drunken hiccoughing sobs 
none	none	Get up she cried get up and get out o here You sha n t lay around my house He had already begun to fall into a drunken sleep but she shook him got him to his feet and pushed him outside the door
5808_54425_000022_000001	train-clean-100	 Now go you drunken dog and never put your foot inside this house again 
none	none	He stood outside swaying dizzily upon his feet and looking back with dazed eyes at the door then he muttered Pu me out wi you Pu me out damn you Well I ki you See f I don t and he half walked half fell down the street 
5808_54425_000024_000000	train-clean-100	Sadness and Skaggsy were together at the club that night 
5808_54425_000024_000001	train-clean-100	Five years had not changed the latter as to wealth or position or inclination and he was still a frequent visitor at the Banner 
5808_54425_000024_000002	train-clean-100	He always came in alone now for Maudie had gone the way of all the half world and reached depths to which mister Skaggs s job prevented him from following her 
5808_54425_000024_000003	train-clean-100	However he mourned truly for his lost companion and to night he was in a particularly pensive mood 
5808_54425_000025_000000	train-clean-100	Some one was playing rag time on the piano and the dancers were wheeling in time to the music 
5808_54425_000025_000001	train-clean-100	Skaggsy looked at them regretfully as he sipped his liquor 
5808_54425_000025_000002	train-clean-100	It made him think of Maudie 
5808_54425_000025_000003	train-clean-100	He sighed and turned away 
5808_54425_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 I tell you Sadness he said impulsively dancing is the poetry of motion 
5808_54425_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes replied Sadness and dancing in rag time is the dialect poetry 
5808_54425_000028_000000	train-clean-100	The reporter did not like this 
5808_54425_000028_000001	train-clean-100	It savoured of flippancy and he was about entering upon a discussion to prove that Sadness had no soul when Joe with blood shot eyes and dishevelled clothes staggered in and reeled towards them 
5808_54425_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Drunk again said Sadness 
none	none	Really it s a waste of time for Joe to sober up 
5808_54425_000029_000002	train-clean-100	Hullo there as the young man brought up against him take a seat He put him in a chair at the table 
5808_54425_000029_000003	train-clean-100	 Been lushin a bit eh 
none	none	Gi me some n drink
5808_54425_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh a hair of the dog

5808_54425_000031_000002	train-clean-100	Here Jack 
5808_54425_000032_000000	train-clean-100	They drank and then as if the whiskey had done him good Joe sat up in his chair 
5808_54425_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Ha ie s throwed me down 
5808_54425_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 Lucky dog 
5808_54425_000034_000001	train-clean-100	You might have known it would have happened sooner or later Better sooner than never 
5808_54425_000035_000000	train-clean-100	Skaggs smoked in silence and looked at Joe 
none	none	I m goin to kill her
5808_54425_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 I would n t if I were you 
none	none	Take old Sadness s advice and thank your stars that you re rid of her
5808_54425_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 I m goin to kill her He paused and looked at them drowsily 
none	none	Then bracing himself up again he broke out suddenly Say d ever tell y bout the ol man 
5808_54425_000038_000002	train-clean-100	He never stole that money 
none	none	Know he di n He threatened to fall asleep now but the reporter was all alert He scented a story
5808_54425_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 By Jove he exclaimed did you hear that 
5808_54425_000040_000001	train-clean-100	Bet the chap stole it himself and s letting the old man suffer for it 
5808_54425_000040_000002	train-clean-100	Great story ain t it Come come wake up here 
none	none	Three more Jack 
5808_54425_000040_000004	train-clean-100	What about your father 
none	none	Father Who s father Oh do bother me What
5808_54425_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Here here tell us about your father and the money 
5808_54425_000042_000001	train-clean-100	If he did n t steal it who did 
5808_54425_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 who did 
none	none	Who did Tha s it who did Ol man di n steal it know he di n Oh let him alone Skaggsy he don t know what he s saying
5808_54425_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes he does a drunken man tells the truth 
5808_54425_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 In some cases said Sadness 
none	none	Oh let me alone man I ve been trying for years to get a big sensation for my paper and if this story is one I m a made man The drink seemed to revive the young man again and by bits Skaggs was able to pick out of him the story of his father s arrest and conviction At its close he relapsed into stupidity murmuring She throwed me down
5808_54425_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 Well sneered Sadness you see drunken men tell the truth and you don t seem to get much guilt out of our young friend 
none	none	You re disappointed are n t you I confess I am disappointed but I ve got an idea just the same
5808_54425_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh you have 
5808_54425_000051_000001	train-clean-100	Well don t handle it carelessly it might go off And Sadness rose 
5808_54425_000051_000002	train-clean-100	The reporter sat thinking for a time and then followed him leaving Joe in a drunken sleep at the table 
5808_54425_000051_000003	train-clean-100	There he lay for more than two hours 
5808_54425_000051_000004	train-clean-100	When he finally awoke he started up as if some determination had come to him in his sleep 
5808_54425_000051_000005	train-clean-100	A part of the helplessness of his intoxication had gone but his first act was to call for more whiskey 
5808_54425_000051_000006	train-clean-100	This he gulped down and followed with another and another 
5808_54425_000051_000007	train-clean-100	For a while he stood still brooding silently his red eyes blinking at the light 
5808_54425_000051_000008	train-clean-100	Then he turned abruptly and left the club 
5808_54425_000052_000000	train-clean-100	It was very late when he reached Hattie s door but he opened it with his latch key as he had been used to do 
5808_54425_000052_000001	train-clean-100	He stopped to help himself to a glass of brandy as he had so often done before 
none	none	Then he went directly to her room 
5808_54425_000052_000003	train-clean-100	She was a light sleeper and his step awakened her 
5808_54425_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 Who is it she cried in affright 
none	none	It s me His voice was steadier now but grim What do you want Did n t I tell you never to come here again Get out or I ll have you taken out 
5808_54425_000056_000000	train-clean-100	She sprang up in bed glaring angrily at him 
none	none	His hands twitched nervously as if her will were conquering him and he were uneasy but 
5808_54425_000068_000011	train-clean-100	he held her 
none	none	eye with his own
5808_54425_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 You put me out to night he said 
5808_54425_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes and I m going to do it again 
none	none	You re drunk 
5808_54425_000060_000000	train-clean-100	She started to rise but he took a step towards her and she paused 
5808_54425_000060_000001	train-clean-100	He looked as she had never seen him look before 
5808_54425_000060_000002	train-clean-100	His face was ashen and his eyes like fire and blood 
none	none	She quailed beneath the look 
5808_54425_000060_000004	train-clean-100	He took another step towards her 
5808_54425_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 You put me out to night he repeated like a dog 
5808_54425_000062_000000	train-clean-100	His step was steady and his tone was clear menacingly clear 
5808_54425_000062_000001	train-clean-100	She shrank back from him back to the wall 
5808_54425_000062_000002	train-clean-100	Still his hands twitched and his eye held her 
5808_54425_000062_000003	train-clean-100	Still he crept slowly towards her his lips working and his hands moving convulsively 
5808_54425_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 Joe Joe she said hoarsely what s the matter 
5808_54425_000063_000001	train-clean-100	Oh don t look at me like that 
5808_54425_000064_000000	train-clean-100	The gown had fallen away from her breast and showed the convulsive fluttering of her heart 
5808_54425_000065_000000	train-clean-100	He broke into a laugh a dry murderous laugh and his hands sought each other while the fingers twitched over one another like coiling serpents 
5808_54425_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 You put me out you you and you made me what I am The realisation of what he was of his foulness and degradation seemed just to have come to him fully 
5808_54425_000066_000001	train-clean-100	 You made me what I am and then you sent me away You let me come back and now you put me out 
5808_54425_000067_000000	train-clean-100	She gazed at him fascinated 
5808_54425_000067_000001	train-clean-100	She tried to scream and she could not 
5808_54425_000067_000002	train-clean-100	This was not Joe 
5808_54425_000067_000003	train-clean-100	This was not the boy that she had turned and twisted about her little finger 
5808_54425_000067_000004	train-clean-100	This was a terrible terrible man or a monster 
5808_54425_000068_000000	train-clean-100	He moved a step nearer her 
5808_54425_000068_000001	train-clean-100	His eyes fell to her throat 
5808_54425_000068_000002	train-clean-100	For an instant she lost their steady glare and then she found her voice 
5808_54425_000068_000003	train-clean-100	The scream was checked as it began 
5808_54425_000068_000004	train-clean-100	His fingers had closed over her throat just where the gown had left it temptingly bare 
5808_54425_000068_000005	train-clean-100	They gave it the caress of death She struggled 
5808_54425_000068_000006	train-clean-100	They held her 
5808_54425_000068_000007	train-clean-100	Her eyes prayed to his 
5808_54425_000068_000008	train-clean-100	But his were the fire of hell 
5808_54425_000068_000009	train-clean-100	She fell back upon her pillow in silence 
5808_54425_000068_000010	train-clean-100	He had not uttered a word 
none	none	He held her 
5808_54425_000068_000012	train-clean-100	Finally he flung her from him like a rag and sank into a chair 
none	none	And there the officers found him when Hattie Sterling s disappearance had become a strange thing XV DEAR DAMNED DELIGHTFUL TOWN When Joe was taken there was no spirit or feeling left in him He moved mechanically as if without sense or volition The first impression he gave was that of a man over acting insanity But this was soon removed by the very indifference with which he met everything concerned with his crime From the very first he made no effort to exonerate or to vindicate himself He talked little and only in a dry stupefied way He was as one whose soul is dead and perhaps it was for all the little soul of him had been wrapped up in the body of this one woman and the stroke that took her life had killed him too The men who examined him were irritated beyond measure There was nothing for them to exercise their ingenuity upon He left them nothing to search for Their most damning question he answered with an apathy that showed absolutely no interest in the matter It was as if some one whom he did not care about had committed a crime and he had been called to testify The only thing which he noticed or seemed to have any affection for was a little pet dog which had been hers and which they sometimes allowed to be with him after the life sentence had been passed upon him and when he was awaiting removal He would sit for hours with the little animal in his lap caressing it dumbly There was a mute sorrow in the eyes of both man and dog and they seemed to take comfort in each other s presence There was no need of any sign between them They had both loved her had they not So they understood Sadness saw him and came back to the Banner torn and unnerved by the sight I saw him he said with a shudder and it ll take more whiskey than Jack can give me in a year to wash the memory of him out of me Why man it shocked me all through It s a pity they did n t send him to the chair It could n t have done him much harm and would have been a real mercy And so Sadness and all the club with a muttered Poor devil dismissed him He was gone Why should they worry Only one more who had got into the whirlpool enjoyed the sensation for a moment and then swept dizzily down There were indeed some who for an earnest hour sermonised about it and said Here is another example of the pernicious influence of the city on untrained negroes Oh is there no way to keep these people from rushing away from the small villages and country districts of the South up to the cities where they cannot battle with the terrible force of a strange and unusual environment Is there no way to prove to them that woollen shirted brown jeaned simplicity is infinitely better than broad clothed degradation They wanted to preach to these people that good agriculture is better than bad art that it was better and nobler for them to sing to God across the Southern fields than to dance for rowdies in the Northern halls They wanted to dare to say that the South has its faults no one condones them and its disadvantages but that even what they suffered from these was better than what awaited them in the great alleys of New York Down there the bodies were restrained and they chafed but here the soul would fester and they would be content This was but for an hour for even while they exclaimed they knew that there was no way and that the stream of young negro life would continue to flow up from the South dashing itself against the hard necessities of the city and breaking like waves against a rock that until the gods grew tired of their cruel sport there must still be sacrifices to false ideals and unreal ambitions There was one heart though that neither dismissed Joe with gratuitous pity nor sermonised about him The mother heart had only room for grief and pain Already it had borne its share It had known sorrow for a lost husband tears at the neglect and brutality of a new companion shame for a daughter s sake and it had seemed already filled to overflowing And yet the fates had put in this one other burden until it seemed it must burst with the weight of it To Fannie Hamilton s mind now all her boy s shortcomings became as naught He was not her wayward erring criminal son She only remembered that he was her son and wept for him as such She forgot his curses while her memory went back to the sweetness of his baby prattle and the soft words of his tenderer youth Until the last she clung to him holding him guiltless and to her thought they took to prison not Joe Hamilton a convicted criminal but Joey Joey her boy her firstborn a martyr The pretty Miss Kitty Hamilton was less deeply impressed The arrest and subsequent conviction of her brother was quite a blow She felt the shame of it keenly and some of the grief To her coming as it did just at a time when the company was being strengthened and she more importantly featured than ever it was decidedly inopportune for no one could help connecting her name with the affair For a long time she and her brother had scarcely been upon speaking terms During Joe s frequent lapses from industry he had been prone to touch his sister for the wherewithal to supply his various wants When finally she grew tired and refused to be touched he rebuked her for withholding that which save for his help she would never have been able to make This went on until they were almost entirely estranged He was wont to say that now his sister was up in the world she had got the big head and she to retort that her brother wanted to use her for a soft thing From the time that she went on the stage she had begun to live her own life a life in which the chief aim was the possession of good clothes and the ability to attract the attention which she had learned to crave The greatest sign of interest she showed in her brother s affair was at first to offer her mother money to secure a lawyer But when Joe confessed all she consoled herself with the reflection that perhaps it was for the best and kept her money in her pocket with a sense of satisfaction She was getting to be so very much more Joe s sister She did not go to see her brother She was afraid it might make her nervous while she was in the city and she went on the road with her company before he was taken away Miss Kitty Hamilton had to be very careful about her nerves and her health She had had experiences and her voice was not as good as it used to be and her beauty had to be aided by cosmetics So she went away from New York and only read of all that happened when some one called her attention to it in the papers Berry Hamilton in his Southern prison knew nothing of all this for no letters had passed between him and his family for more than two years The very cruelty of destiny defeated itself in this and was kind XVI SKAGGS S THEORY There was perhaps more depth to mister Skaggs than most people gave him credit for having However it may be when he got an idea into his head whether it were insane or otherwise he had a decidedly tenacious way of holding to it Sadness had been disposed to laugh at him when he announced that Joe s drunken story of his father s troubles had given him an idea But it was nevertheless true and that idea had stayed with him clear through the exciting events that followed on that fatal night He thought and dreamed of it until he had made a working theory Then one day with a boldness that he seldom assumed when in the sacred Presence he walked into the office and laid his plans before the editor They talked together for some time and the editor seemed hard to convince It would be a big thing for the paper he said if it only panned out but it is such a rattle brained harum scarum thing No one under the sun would have thought of it but you Skaggs Oh it s bound to pan out I see the thing as clear as day There s no getting around it Yes it looks plausible but so does all fiction You re taking a chance You re losing time If it fails But if it succeeds Well go and bring back a story If you don t look out It s against my better judgment anyway Remember I told you that Skaggs shot out of the office and within an hour and a half had boarded a fast train for the South It is almost a question whether Skaggs had a theory or whether he had told himself a pretty story and as usual believed it The editor was right No one else would have thought of the wild thing that was in the reporter s mind The detective had not thought of it five years before nor had Maurice Oakley and his friends had an inkling and here was one of the New York Universe s young men going miles to prove his idea about something that did not at all concern him When Skaggs reached the town which had been the home of the Hamiltons he went at once to the Continental Hotel He had as yet formulated no plan of immediate action and with a fool s or a genius belief in his destiny he sat down to await the turn of events His first move would be to get acquainted with some of his neighbours This was no difficult matter as the bar of the Continental was still the gathering place of some of the city s choice spirits of the old regime Thither he went and his convivial cheerfulness soon placed him on terms of equality with many of his kind He insinuated that he was looking around for business prospects This proved his open sesame Five years had not changed the Continental frequenters much and Skaggs s intention immediately brought Beachfield Davis down upon him with the remark If a man wants to go into business business for a gentleman suh Gad there s no finer or better paying business in the world than breeding blooded dogs that is if you get a man of experience to go in with you Dogs dogs drivelled old Horace Talbot Beachfield s always talking about dogs I remember the night we were all discussing that Hamilton nigger s arrest Beachfield said it was a sign of total depravity because his man hunted possums with his hound The old man laughed inanely The hotel whiskey was getting on his nerves The reporter opened his eyes and his ears He had stumbled upon something at any rate What was it about some nigger s arrest sir he asked respectfully Oh it was n t anything much Only an old and trusted servant robbed his master and my theory But you will remember mister Talbot broke in Davis that I proved your theory to be wrong and cited a conclusive instance Yes a possum hunting dog I am really anxious to hear about the robbery though It seems such an unusual thing for a negro to steal a great amount Just so and that was part of my theory Now It s an old story and a long one mister Skaggs and one of merely local repute interjected Colonel Saunders I don t think it could possibly interest you who are familiar with the records of the really great crimes that take place in a city such as New York Those things do interest me very much though I am something of a psychologist and I often find the smallest and most insignificant appearing details pregnant with suggestion Won t you let me hear the story Colonel Why yes though there s little in it save that I am one of the few men who have come to believe that the negro Berry Hamilton is not the guilty party Nonsense nonsense said Talbot of course Berry was guilty but as I said before I don t blame him The negroes Total depravity said Davis Now look at my dog If you will retire with me to the further table I will give you whatever of the facts I can call to mind As unobtrusively as they could they drew apart from the others and seated themselves at a more secluded table leaving Talbot and Davis wrangling as of old over their theories When the glasses were filled and the pipes going the Colonel began his story interlarding it frequently with comments of his own Now in the first place mister Skaggs he said when the tale was done I am lawyer enough to see for myself how weak the evidence was upon which the negro was convicted and later events have done much to confirm me in the opinion that he was innocent Later events Yes The Colonel leaned across the table and his voice fell to a whisper Four years ago a great change took place in Maurice Oakley It happened in the space of a day and no one knows the cause of it From a social companionable man he became a recluse shunning visitors and dreading society From an open hearted unsuspicious neighbour he became secretive and distrustful of his own friends From an active business man he has become a retired brooder He sees no one if he can help it He writes no letters and receives none not even from his brother it is said And all of this came about in the space of twenty four hours But what was the beginning of it No one knows save that one day he had some sort of nervous attack By the time the doctor was called he was better but he kept clutching his hand over his heart Naturally the physician wanted to examine him there but the very suggestion of it seemed to throw him into a frenzy and his wife too begged the doctor an old friend of the family to desist Maurice Oakley had been as sound as a dollar and no one of the family had had any tendency to heart affection It is strange Strange it is but I have my theory His actions are like those of a man guarding a secret Sh His negro laundress says that there is an inside pocket in his undershirts An inside pocket Yes And for what Skaggs was trembling with eagerness The Colonel dropped his voice lower We can only speculate he said but as I have said I have my theory Oakley was a just man and in punishing his old servant for the supposed robbery it is plain that he acted from principle But he is also a proud man and would hate to confess that he had been in the wrong So I believed that the cause of his first shock was the finding of the money that he supposed gone Unwilling to admit this error he lets the misapprehension go on and it is the money which he carries in his secret pocket with a morbid fear of its discovery that has made him dismiss his servants leave his business and refuse to see his friends A very natural conclusion Colonel and I must say that I believe you It is strange that others have not seen as you have seen and brought the matter to light Well you see mister Skaggs none are so dull as the people who think they think I can safely say that there is not another man in this town who has lighted upon the real solution of this matter though it has been openly talked of for so long But as for bringing it to light no one would think of doing that It would be sure to hurt Oakley s feelings and he is of one of our best families Ah yes perfectly right Skaggs had got all that he wanted much more in fact than he had expected The Colonel held him for a while yet to enlarge upon the views that he had expressed When the reporter finally left him it was with a cheery Good night Colonel If I were a criminal I should be afraid of that analytical mind of yours He went upstairs chuckling The old fool he cried as he flung himself into a chair I ve got it I ve got it Maurice Oakley must see me and then what He sat down to think out what he should do to morrow Again with his fine disregard of ways and means he determined to trust to luck and as he expressed it brace old Oakley Accordingly he went about nine o clock the next morning to Oakley s house A gray haired sad eyed woman inquired his errand I want to see mister Oakley he said You cannot see him mister Oakley is not well and does not see visitors But I must see him madam I am here upon business of importance You can tell me just as well as him I am his wife and transact all of his business I can tell no one but the master of the house himself You cannot see him It is against his orders Very well replied Skaggs descending one step it is his loss not mine I have tried to do my duty and failed Simply tell him that I came from Paris Paris cried a querulous voice behind the woman s back Leslie why do you keep the gentleman at the door Let him come in at once missus Oakley stepped from the door and Skaggs went in Had he seen Oakley before he would have been shocked at the change in his appearance but as it was the nervous white haired man who stood shiftily before him told him nothing of an eating secret long carried The man s face was gray and haggard and deep lines were cut under his staring fish like eyes His hair tumbled in white masses over his pallid forehead and his lips twitched as he talked You re from Paris sir from Paris he said Come in come in His motions were nervous and erratic Skaggs followed him into the library and the wife disappeared in another direction It would have been hard to recognise in the Oakley of the present the man of a few years before The strong frame had gone away to bone and nothing of his old power sat on either brow or chin He was as a man who trembled on the brink of insanity His guilty secret had been too much for him and Skaggs s own fingers twitched as he saw his host s hands seek the breast of his jacket every other moment It is there the secret is hidden he said to himself and whatever it is I must have it But how how I can t knock the man down and rob him in his own house But Oakley himself proceeded to give him his first cue You you perhaps have a message from my brother my brother who is in Paris I have not heard from him for some time Skaggs s mind worked quickly He remembered the Colonel s story Evidently the brother had something to do with the secret Now or never he thought So he said boldly Yes I have a message from your brother The man sprung up clutching again at his breast You have you have Give it to me After four years he sends me a message Give it to me The reporter looked steadily at the man He knew that he was in his power that his very eagerness would prove traitor to his discretion Your brother bade me to say to you that you have a terrible secret that you bear it in your breast there there I am his messenger He bids you to give it to me Oakley had shrunken back as if he had been struck No no he gasped no no I have no secret The reporter moved nearer him The old man shrunk against the wall his lips working convulsively and his hand tearing at his breast as Skaggs drew nearer He attempted to shriek but his voice was husky and broke off in a gasping whisper Give it to me as your brother commands No no no It is not his secret it is mine I must carry it here always do you hear I must carry it till I die Go away Go away Skaggs seized him Oakley struggled weakly but he had no strength The reporter s hand sought the secret pocket He felt a paper beneath his fingers Oakley gasped hoarsely as he drew it forth Then raising his voice gave one agonised cry and sank to the floor frothing at the mouth At the cry rapid footsteps were heard in the hallway and missus Oakley threw open the door What is the matter she cried My message has somewhat upset your husband was the cool answer But his breast is open Your hand has been in his bosom You have taken something from him Give it to me or I shall call for help Skaggs had not reckoned on this but his wits came to the rescue You dare not call for help he said or the world will know She wrung her hands helplessly crying Oh give it to me give it to me We ve never done you any harm But you ve harmed some one else that is enough He moved towards the door but she sprang in front of him with the fierceness of a tigress protecting her young She attacked him with teeth and nails She was pallid with fury and it was all he could do to protect himself and yet not injure her Finally when her anger had taken her strength he succeeded in getting out He flew down the hall way and out of the front door the woman s screams following him He did not pause to read the precious letter until he was safe in his room at the Continental Hotel Then he sprang to his feet crying Thank God thank God I was right and the Universe shall have a sensation The brother is the thief and Berry Hamilton is an innocent man Hurrah Now who is it that has come on a wild goose chase Who is it that ought to handle his idea carefully Heigho Saunders my man the drinks ll be on you and old Skaggsy will have done some good in the world XVII A YELLOW JOURNAL 
5970-54428-0000	train-other-500	mister Skaggs had no qualms of conscience about the manner in which he had come by the damaging evidence against Maurice Oakley It was enough for him that he had it
5970-54428-0001	train-other-500	A corporation he argued had no soul and therefore no conscience How much less then should so small a part of a great corporation as himself
5970-54428-0002	train-other-500	be expected to have them He had his story It was vivid interesting dramatic It meant the favour of his editor
5970-54428-0003	train-other-500	a big thing for the Universe and a fatter lining for his own pocket He sat down to put his discovery on paper before he attempted anything else
5970-54428-0004	train-other-500	although the impulse to celebrate was very strong within him He told his story well with an eye to every one of its salient points
5970-54428-0005	train-other-500	He sent an alleged picture of Berry Hamilton as he had appeared at the time of his arrest He sent a picture of the Oakley home and of the cottage where the servant and his family
5970-54428-0006	train-other-500	had been so happy There was a strong pen picture of the man Oakley grown haggard and morose from carrying his guilty secret of his confusion when confronted with the
5970-54428-0007	train-other-500	supposed knowledge of it The old Southern city was described and the opinions of its residents in regard to the case given It was there
5970-54428-0008	train-other-500	clear interesting and strong One could see it all as if every phase of it were being enacted before one s eyes Skaggs surpassed himself
5970-54428-0009	train-other-500	When the editor first got hold of it he said Huh over the opening lines a few short sentences
5970-54428-0010	train-other-500	that instantly pricked the attention awake He read on with increasing interest This is good stuff he said at the last page
5970-54428-0011	train-other-500	Here s a chance for the Universe to look into the methods of Southern court proceedings
none	none	 Here s a chance for a spread 
5970-54428-0012	train-other-500	The Universe had always claimed to be the friend of all poor and oppressed humanity and every once in a while it did something to substantiate its claim
5970-54428-0013	train-other-500	whereupon it stood off and said to the public Look you what we have done and behold how great we are the friend of the people The Universe was yellow
5970-54428-0014	train-other-500	It was very so But it had power and keenness and energy It never lost an opportunity to crow and if one was not forthcoming it made one
5970-54428-0015	train-other-500	In this way it managed to do a considerable amount of good and its yellowness became forgivable even commendable In Skaggs s story the editor saw
5970-54428-0016	train-other-500	an opportunity for one of its periodical philanthropies He seized upon it With headlines that took half a page and with cuts authentic and otherwise
5970-54428-0017	train-other-500	the tale was told and the people of New York were greeted next morning with the announcement of A Burning Shame A Poor and Innocent Negro made to Suffer for a Rich Man s Crime
none	none	 Great Expose by the Universe 
5970-54428-0018	train-other-500	A Universe Reporter To the Rescue The Whole Thing to Be Aired that the People may Know
5970-54428-0019	train-other-500	Then Skaggs received a telegram that made him leap for joy He was to do it He was to go to the capital of the State He was to beard the Governor in his den
5970-54428-0020	train-other-500	and he with the force of a great paper behind him was to demand for the people the release of an innocent man Then there would be another write up and much glory for him and more shekels
5970-54428-0021	train-other-500	In an hour after he had received his telegram he was on his way to the Southern capital Meanwhile in the house of Maurice Oakley there were sad times
5970-54428-0022	train-other-500	From the moment that the master of the house had fallen to the floor in impotent fear and madness there had been no peace within his doors At first his wife had tried to control him alone
5970-54428-0023	train-other-500	and had humoured the wild babblings with which he woke from his swoon But these changed to shrieks and cries and curses
5970-54428-0024	train-other-500	and she was forced to throw open the doors so long closed and call in help The neighbours and her old friends went to her assistance and what the reporter s story had not done
5970-54428-0025	train-other-500	the ravings of the man accomplished for with a show of matchless cunning he continually clutched at his breast laughed and babbled his secret openly
5970-54428-0026	train-other-500	Even then they would have smothered it in silence for the honour of one of their best families but too many ears had heard and then came the yellow journal
5970-54428-0027	train-other-500	bearing all the news in emblazoned headlines Colonel Saunders was distinctly hurt to think that his confidence had been imposed on and that
5970-54428-0028	train-other-500	he had been instrumental in bringing shame upon a Southern name To think suh he said generally to the usual assembly of choice spirits to think of that
5970-54428-0029	train-other-500	man s being a reporter suh a common ordinary reporter and that I sat and talked to him as if he were a gentleman
none	none	 You re not to be blamed Colonel 
5970-54428-0030	train-other-500	said old Horace Talbot You ve done no more than any other gentleman would have done
none	none	 The trouble is that the average Northerner 
5970-54428-0031	train-other-500	has no sense of honour suh no sense of honour If this particular man had had he would have kept still and everything would have gone on smooth and quiet
5970-54428-0032	train-other-500	Instead of that a distinguished family is brought to shame and for what To give a nigger a few more years of freedom when likely as not
5970-54428-0033	train-other-500	he don t want it and Berry Hamilton s life in prison has proved nearer the ideal reached by slavery than anything he has found since emancipation Why suhs
5970-54428-0034	train-other-500	I fancy I see him leaving his prison with tears of regret in his eyes Old Horace was inanely eloquent for an hour over his pet theory
5970-54428-0035	train-other-500	But there were some in the town who thought differently about the matter and it was their opinions and murmurings that backed up Skaggs and made it easier for him when at the capital
5970-54428-0036	train-other-500	he came into contact with the official red tape He was told that there were certain forms of procedure and certain times for certain things but he hammered persistently away
5970-54428-0037	train-other-500	the murmurings behind him grew louder while from his sanctum the editor of the Universe thundered away against oppression and high handed tyranny Other papers took it up
5970-54428-0038	train-other-500	and asked why this man should be despoiled of his liberty any longer And when it was replied that the man had been convicted and that the wheels of justice could not be stopped or turned back
5970-54428-0039	train-other-500	by the letter of a romantic artist or the ravings of a madman there was a mighty outcry against the farce of justice that had been played out in this man s case
5970-54428-0040	train-other-500	The trial was reviewed the evidence again brought up and examined The dignity of the State was threatened At this time the State
none	none	 did the one thing necessary 
5970-54428-0041	train-other-500	to save its tottering reputation It would not surrender but it capitulated and Berry Hamilton was pardoned
5970-54428-0042	train-other-500	Berry heard the news with surprise and a half bitter joy He had long ago lost hope that justice would ever be done to him He marvelled at the word
none	none	 that was brought to him now 
5970-54428-0043	train-other-500	and he could not understand the strange cordiality of the young white man who met him at the warden s office Five years of prison life had made a different man of him
5970-54428-0044	train-other-500	He no longer looked to receive kindness from his fellows and he blinked at it
none	none	 as he blinked at the unwonted 
5970-54428-0045	train-other-500	brightness of the sun The lines about his mouth where the smiles used to gather had changed and grown stern with the hopelessness of years
5970-54428-0046	train-other-500	His lips drooped pathetically and hard treatment had given his eyes a lowering look His hair
5970-54428-0047	train-other-500	that had hardly shown a white streak was as white as Maurice Oakley s own His erstwhile quick wits were dulled and imbruted
5970-54428-0048	train-other-500	He had lived like an ox working without inspiration or reward and he came forth like an ox from his stall
5970-54428-0049	train-other-500	All the higher part of him he had left behind dropping it off day after day through the wearisome years He had
5970-54428-0050	train-other-500	put behind him the Berry Hamilton that laughed and joked and sang and believed for even his faith
none	none	 had become only a numbed fancy This is a very happy occasion mister Hamilton said Skaggs 
5970-54428-0051	train-other-500	shaking his hand heartily Berry did not answer What had this slim glib young man to do with him What had any white man
5970-54428-0052	train-other-500	to do with him after what he had suffered at their hands You know you are to go New York with me To New Yawk
none	none	 What fu 
5970-54428-0053	train-other-500	Skaggs did not tell him that now that the Universe had done its work it demanded the right to crow to its heart s satisfaction He said only
5970-54428-0054	train-other-500	You want to see your wife of course Berry had forgotten Fannie and for the first time his heart thrilled within him at the thought of seeing her again
none	none	 I ain t hyeahed f om my people fu a long time I did n t know what had 
5970-54428-0056	train-other-500	become of em How s Kit an Joe
none	none	 They re all right was the reply Skaggs could n t tell him 
5970-54428-0057	train-other-500	in this the first hour of his freedom Let him have time to drink the sweetness of that all in There would be time afterwards to taste all of the bitterness
5970-54428-0058	train-other-500	Once in New York he found that people wished to see him some fools some philanthropists and a great many reporters
5970-54428-0059	train-other-500	He had to be photographed all this before he could seek those whom he longed to see They printed his picture as he was before he went to prison
5970-54428-0060	train-other-500	and as he was now a sort of before and after taking comment and in the morning that it all appeared when the Universe spread itself
5970-54428-0061	train-other-500	to tell the public what it had done and how it had done it they gave him his wife s address It would be better they thought for her to tell him herself
5970-54428-0062	train-other-500	all that happened No one of them was brave enough to stand to look in his eyes when he asked for his son and daughter and they shifted their responsibility
5970-54428-0063	train-other-500	by pretending to themselves that they were doing it for his own good
none	none	 that the blow would fall more gently upon him coming from her 
5970-54428-0064	train-other-500	who had been his wife Berry took the address and inquired his way timidly hesitatingly but with a swelling heart to the door of the flat
none	none	 where Fannie lived XVIII WHAT BERRY FOUND Had not Berry s years of prison life made him forget what little he knew of reading he might have read the name Gibson on the door plate where they told him to ring for his wife But he knew nothing of what awaited him as he confidently pulled the bell Fannie herself came to the door The news the papers held had not escaped her but she had suffered in silence hoping that Berry might be spared the pain of finding her Now he stood before her and she knew him at a glance in spite of his haggard countenance Fannie he said holding out his arms to her and all of the pain and pathos of long yearning was in his voice don t you know me She shrank away from him back in the hall way Yes yes Be y I knows you Come in She led him through the passage way and into her room he following with a sudden sinking at his heart This was not the reception he had expected from Fannie When they were within the room he turned and held out his arms to her again but she did not notice them Why is you shamed o me he asked brokenly Shamed No Oh Be y and she sank into a chair and began rocking to and fro in her helpless grief What s de mattah Fannie Ain t you glad to see me Yes yes but you don t know nothin do you Dey lef me to tell you Lef you to tell me What s de mattah Is Joe or Kit daid Tell me No not daid Kit dances on de stage fu a livin an Be y she ain t de gal she ust to be Joe Joe Joe he s in pen tentiary fu killin a ooman Berry started forward with a cry My Gawd my Gawd my little gal my boy Dat ain t all she went on dully as if reciting a rote lesson I ain t yo wife no mo I s ma ied ag in Oh Be y Be y don t look at me lak dat I could n t he p it Kit an Joe lef me an dey said de pen tentiary divo ced you an me an dat you d nevah come out nohow Don t look at me lak dat Be y You ain t my wife no mo Hit s a lie a damn lie You is my wife I s a innocent man No pen tentiay kin tek you erway f om me Hit s enough what dey ve done to my chillen He rushed forward and seized her by the arm Dey sha n t do no mo by Gawd dey sha n t I say His voice had risen to a fierce roar like that of a hurt beast and he shook her by the arm as he spoke Oh don t Be y don t you hu t me I could n t he p it He glared at her for a moment and then the real force of the situation came full upon him and he bowed his head in his hands and wept like a child The great sobs came up and stuck in his throat She crept up to him fearfully and laid her hand on his head Don t cry Be y she said I done wrong but I loves you yit He seized her in his arms and held her tightly until he could control himself Then he asked weakly Well what am I goin to do I do know Be y ceptin dat you ll have to leave me I won t I ll never leave you again he replied doggedly But Be y you mus You ll only mek it ha der on me an Gibson ll beat me ag in Ag in She hung her head Yes He gripped himself hard Why cain t you come on off wid me Fannie You was mine fus I could n t He would fin me anywhaih I went to Let him fin you You ll be wid me an we ll settle it him an me I want to but oh I can t I can t she wailed Please go now Be y befo he gits home He s mad anyhow cause you re out Berry looked at her hard and then said in a dry voice An so I got to go an leave you to him Yes you mus I m his n now He turned to the door murmuring My wife gone Kit a nobody an Joe little Joe a murderer an then I I ust to pray to Gawd an call him Ouah Fathah He laughed hoarsely It sounded like nothing Fannie had ever heard before Don t Be y don t say dat Maybe we don t un erstan Her faith still hung by a slender thread but his had given way in that moment No we don t un erstan he laughed as he went out of the door We don t un erstan He staggered down the steps blinded by his emotions and set his face towards the little lodging that he had taken temporarily There seemed nothing left in life for him to do Yet he knew that he must work to live although the effort seemed hardly worth while He remembered now that the Universe had offered him the under janitorship in its building He would go and take it and some day perhaps He was not quite sure what the perhaps meant But as his mind grew clearer he came to know for a sullen fierce anger was smouldering in his heart against the man who through lies had stolen his wife from him It was anger that came slowly but gained in fierceness as it grew Yes that was it he would kill Gibson It was no worse than his present state Then it would be father and son murderers They would hang him or send him back to prison Neither would be hard now He laughed to himself And this was what they had let him out of prison for To find out all this Why had they not left him there to die in ignorance What had he to do with all these people who gave him sympathy What did he want of their sympathy Could they give him back one tithe of what he had lost Could they restore to him his wife or his son or his daughter his quiet happiness or his simple faith He went to work for the Universe but night after night armed he patrolled the sidewalk in front of Fannie s house He did not know Gibson but he wanted to see them together Then he would strike His vigils kept him from his bed but he went to the next morning s work with no weariness The hope of revenge sustained him and he took a savage joy in the thought that he should be the dispenser of justice to at least one of those who had wounded him Finally he grew impatient and determined to wait no longer but to seek his enemy in his own house He approached the place cautiously and went up the steps His hand touched the bell pull He staggered back Oh my Gawd he said There was crape on Fannie s bell His head went round and he held to the door for support Then he turned the knob and the door opened He went noiselessly in At the door of Fannie s room he halted sick with fear He knocked a step sounded within and his wife s face looked out upon him He could have screamed aloud with relief It ain t you he whispered huskily No it s him He was killed in a fight at the race track Some o his frinds are settin up Come in He went in a wild strange feeling surging at his heart She showed him into the death chamber As he stood and looked down upon the face of his enemy still cold and terrible in death the recognition of how near he had come to crime swept over him and all his dead faith sprang into new life in a glorious resurrection He stood with clasped hands and no word passed his lips But his heart was crying Thank God thank God this man s blood is not on my hands The gamblers who were sitting up with the dead wondered who the old fool was who looked at their silent comrade and then raised his eyes as if in prayer When Gibson was laid away there were no formalities between Berry and his wife they simply went back to each other New York held nothing for them now but sad memories Kit was on the road and the father could not bear to see his son so they turned their faces southward back to the only place they could call home Surely the people could not be cruel to them now and even if they were they felt that after what they had endured no wound had power to give them pain Leslie Oakley heard of their coming and with her own hands re opened and refurnished the little cottage in the yard for them There the white haired woman begged them to spend the rest of their days and be in peace and comfort It was the only amend she could make As much to satisfy her as to settle themselves they took the cottage and many a night thereafter they sat together with clasped hands listening to the shrieks of the madman across the yard and thinking of what he had brought to them and to himself It was not a happy life but it was all that was left to them and they took it up without complaint for they knew they were powerless against some Will infinitely stronger than their own End of Project Gutenberg s The Sport of the Gods by
