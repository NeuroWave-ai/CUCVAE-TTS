THE DEAD fifty four VII WARNING APPARITIONS seventy two I THE POWER OF THE DEAD TO RETURN TO EARTH Though there is no period at which the ancients do not seem to have believed in a future life continual confusion prevails when they come to picture the existence led by man in the other world as we see from the sixth book of the AEneid Combined with the elaborate mythology of Greece we are confronted with the primitive belief of Italy and doubtless of Greece too a belief supported by all the religious rites in connection with the dead that the spirits of the departed lived on in the tomb with the body As cremation gradually superseded burial the idea took shape that the soul might have an existence of its own altogether independent of the body and a place of abode was assigned to it in a hole in the centre of the earth where it lived on in eternity with other souls This latter view seems to have become the official theory at least in Italy in classical days In the gloomy horrible Etruscan religion the shades were supposed to be in charge of the Conductor of the Dead a repulsive figure always represented with wings and long matted hair and a hammer whose appearance was afterwards imitated in the dress of the man who removed the dead from the arena Surely something may be said for Gaston Boissier s suggestion that Dante s Tuscan blood may account to some extent for the gruesome imagery of the Inferno Cicero one tells us that it was generally believed that the dead lived on beneath the earth and special provision was made for them in every Latin town in the mundus a deep trench which was dug before the pomerium was traced and regarded as the particular entrance to the lower world for the dead of the town in question The trench was vaulted over so that it might correspond more or less with the sky a gap being left in the vault which was closed with the stone of the departed the lapis manalis Corn was thrown into the trench which was filled up with earth and an altar erected over it On three solemn days in the year August twenty five October five and November eight the trench was opened and the stone removed the dead thus once more having free access to the world above where the usual offerings were made to them two These provisions clearly show an official belief that death did not create an impassable barrier between the dead and the living The spirits of the departed still belonged to the city of their birth and took an interest in their old home They could even return to it on the days when the trench of the gods of gloom lies open and the very jaws of hell yawn wide three Their rights must be respected if evil was to be averted from the State In fact the dead were gods with altars of their own four and Cornelia the mother of the Gracchi could write to her sons You will make offerings to me and invoke your parent as a god five Their cult was closely connected with that of the Lares the gods of the hearth which symbolized a fixed abode in contrast with the early nomad life Indeed there is practically no distinction between the Lares and the Manes the souls of the good dead But the dead had their own festival the Dies Parentales held from the thirteenth to the twenty first of February in Rome six and in Greece the Genesia celebrated on the fifth of Boedromion towards the end of September about which we know very little seven There is nothing more characteristic of paganism than the passionate longing of the average man to perpetuate his memory after death in the world round which all his hopes and aspirations clung Cicero uses it as an argument for immortality eight Many men left large sums to found colleges to celebrate their memories and feast at their tombs on stated occasions nine Lucian laughs at this custom when he represents the soul of the ordinary man in the next world as a mere bodiless shade that vanishes at a touch like smoke It subsists on the libations and offerings it receives from the living and those who have no friends or relatives on earth are starving and famished ten Violators of tombs were threatened with the curse of dying the last of their race a curse which Macaulay with his intense family affection considered the most awful that could be devised by man and the fact that the tombs were built by the high road so that the dead might be cheered by the greeting of the passer by lends an additional touch of sadness to a walk among the crumbling ruins that line the Latin or the Appian Way outside Rome to day No one of the moderns has caught the pagan feeling towards death better than Giosue Carducci a true spiritual descendant of the great Romans of old if ever there was one He tells how one glorious June day he was sitting in school listening to the priest outraging the verb amo when his eyes wandered to the window and lighted on a cherry tree red with fruit and then strayed away to the hills and the sky and the distant curve of the sea shore All Nature was teeming with life and he felt an answering thrill when suddenly as if from the very fountains of being within him there welled up a consciousness of death and with it the formless nothing and a vision of himself lying cold motionless dumb in the black earth while above him the birds sang the trees rustled in the wind the rivers ran on in their course and the living revelled in the warm sun bathed in its divine light This first vision of death often haunted him in later years eleven and one realizes that such must often have been the feelings of the Romans and still more often of the Greeks for the joy of the Greek in life was far greater than that of the Roman Peace was the only boon that death could bring to a pagan and Pax tecum aeterna is among the commonest of the inscriptions The life beyond the grave was at best an unreal and joyless copy of an earthly existence and Achilles told Odysseus that he would rather be the serf of a poor man upon earth than Achilles among the shades When we come to inquire into the appearance of ghosts revisiting the glimpses of the moon we find as we should expect that they are a vague unsubstantial copy of their former selves on earth In Homer twelve the shade of Patroclus which visited Achilles in a vision as he slept by the sea shore looks exactly as Patroclus had looked on earth even down to the clothes Hadrian s famous animula vagula blandula gives the same idea and it would be difficult to imagine a disembodied spirit which retains its personality and returns to earth again except as a kind of immaterial likeness of its earthly self We often hear of the extreme pallor of ghosts which was doubtless due to their being bloodless and to the pallor of death itself Propertius conceived of them as skeletons thirteen but the unsubstantial shadowy aspect is by far the commonest and best harmonizes with the life they were supposed to lead Hitherto we have been dealing with the spirits of the dead who have been duly buried and are at rest making their appearance among men only at stated intervals regulated by the religion of the State The lot of the dead who have not been vouchsafed the trifling boon of a handful of earth cast upon their bones was very different They had not yet been admitted to the world below and were forced to wander for a hundred years before they might enter Charon s boat AEneas beheld them on the banks of the Styx stretching out their hands ripae ulterioris amore The shade of Patroclus describes its hapless state to Achilles as does that of Elpenor to Odysseus when they meet in the lower world It is not surprising that the ancients attached the highest importance to the duty of burying the dead and that Pausanias blames Lysander for not burying the bodies of Philocles and the four thousand slain at AEgospotami seeing that the Athenians even buried the Persian dead after Marathon fourteen The spirits of the unburied were usually held to be bound more or less to the spot where their bodies lay and to be able to enter into communication with the living with comparative ease even if they did not actually haunt them They were in fact evil spirits which had to be propitiated and honoured in special rites Their appearances among the living were not regulated by religion They wandered at will over the earth belonging neither to this world nor to the next restless and malignant unable to escape from the trammels of mortal life in the joys of which they had no part Thus in the Phaedo fifteen we read of souls prowling about tombs and sepulchres near which as they tell us are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which have not departed pure These must be the souls not of the good but of the evil which are compelled to wander about such places in payment of the penalty of their former evil way of life Apuleius sixteen classifies the spirits of the departed for us The Manes are the good people not to be feared so long as their rites are duly performed as we have already seen Lemures are disembodied spirits while Larvae are the ghosts that haunt houses Apuleius however is wholly uncritical and the distinction between Larvae and Lemures is certainly not borne out by facts The Larvae had distinct attributes and were thought to cause epilepsy or madness They were generally treated more or less as a joke seventeen and are spoken of much as we speak of a bogey They appear to have been entrusted with the torturing of the dead as we see from the saying Only the Larvae war with the dead eighteen In Seneca s Apocolocyntosis nineteen when the question of the deification of the late Emperor Claudius is laid before a meeting of the gods Father Janus gives it as his opinion that no more mortals should be treated in this way and that anyone who contrary to this decree shall hereafter be made addressed or painted as a god should be delivered over to the Larvae and flogged at the next games Larva also means a skeleton and Trimalchio following the Egyptian custom has one brought in and placed on the table during his famous feast It is as one would expect of silver and the millionaire freedman points the usual moral Let us eat drink and be merry for to morrow we die twenty The Larvae were regular characters in the Atellane farces at Rome where they performed various danses macabres Can these possibly be the prototypes of the Dances of Death so popular in the Middle Ages We find something very similar on the well known silver cups discovered at Bosco Reale though Death itself does not seem to have been represented in this way Some of the designs in the medieval series would certainly have appealed to the average bourgeois Roman of the Trimalchio type e g Les Trois Vifs et les Trois Morts the three men riding gaily out hunting and meeting their own skeletons Such crude contrasts are just what one would expect to find at Pompeii Lemures and Larvae are often confused but Lemures is the regular word for the dead not at rest the Lemuri or spirits of the churchyard of some parts of modern Italy They were evil spirits propitiated in early days with blood Hence the first gladiatorial games were given in connection with funerals Both in Greece and in Rome there were special festivals for appeasing these restless spirits Originally they were of a public character for murder was common in primitive times and such spirits would be numerous as is proved by the festival lasting three days In Athens the Nemesia were held during Anthesterion February March As in Rome the days were unlucky Temples were closed and business was suspended for the dead were abroad In the morning the doors were smeared with pitch and those in the house chewed whitethorn to keep off the evil spirits On the last day of the festival offerings were made to Hermes and the dead were formally bidden to depart twenty one Ovid describes the Lemuria or Lemuralia twenty two They took place in May which was consequently regarded as an unlucky month for marriages and is still so regarded almost as universally in England to day as it was in Rome during the principate of Augustus The name of the festival Ovid derives from Remus as the ghost of his murdered brother was said to have appeared to Romulus in his sleep and to have demanded burial Hence the institution of the Lemuria The head of the family walked through the house with bare feet at dead of night making the mystic sign with his first and fourth fingers extended the other fingers being turned inwards and the thumb crossed over them in case he might run against an unsubstantial spirit as he moved noiselessly along This is the sign of le corna held to be infallible against the Evil Eye in modern Italy After solemnly washing his hands he places black beans in his mouth and throws others over his shoulders saying With these beans do I redeem me and mine He repeats this ceremony nine times without looking round and the spirits are thought to follow unseen and pick up the beans Then he purifies himself once more and clashes brass and bids the demons leave his house When he has repeated nine times Manes exite paterni he looks round and the ceremony is over and the restless ghosts have been duly laid for a year Lamiae haunted rooms which had to be fumigated with sulphur while some mystic rites were performed with eggs before they could be expelled The dead not yet at rest were divided into three classes those who had died before their time the Greek aoroi who had to wander till the span of their natural life was completed twenty three those who had met with violent deaths the Greek biaiothanatoi and the unburied the Greek ataphoi In the Hymn to Hecate to whom they were especially attached they are represented as following in her train and taking part in her nightly revels in human shape The lot of the murdered is no better and executed criminals belong to the same class Spirits of this kind were supposed to haunt the place where their bodies lay Hence they were regarded as demons and were frequently entrusted with the carrying out of the strange curses which have been found in their tombs or in wells where a man had been drowned or even in the sea written on leaden tablets often from right to left or in queer characters so as to be illegible with another tablet fastened over them by means of a nail symbolizing the binding effect it was hoped they would have the Defixiones to give them their Latin name which are very numerous among the inscriptions So real was the belief in these curses that the elder Pliny says that everyone is afraid of being placed under evil spells twenty four and they are frequently referred to in antiquity FOOTNOTES Footnote one Tusc Disp i sixteen Footnote two Ov Fast

nineteen II THE BELIEF IN GHOSTS IN GREECE AND ROME Ghost stories play a very subordinate part in classical literature as is only to be expected The religion of the hard headed practical Roman was essentially formal and consisted largely in the exact performance of an elaborate ritual His relations with the dead were regulated with a care that might satisfy the most litigious of ghosts and once a man had carried out his part of the bargain he did not trouble his head further about his deceased ancestors so long as he felt that they in their turn were not neglecting his interests Yet the average man in Rome was glad to free himself from burdensome and expensive duties towards the dead that had come down to him from past generations and the ingenuity of the lawyers soon devised a system of sham sales by which this could be successfully and honourably accomplished twenty five Greek religion it is true found expression to a large extent in mythology but the sanity of the Greek genius in its best days kept it free from excessive superstition Not till the invasion of the West by the cults of the East do we find ghosts and spirits at all common in literature The belief in apparitions existed however at all times even among educated people The younger Pliny for instance writes to ask his friend Sura for his opinion as to whether ghosts have a real existence with a form of their own and are of divine origin or whether they are merely empty air owing their definite shape to our superstitious fears We must not forget that Suetonius whose superstition has become proverbial was a friend of Pliny and wrote to him on one occasion begging him to procure the postponement of a case in which he was engaged as he had been frightened by a dream Though Pliny certainly did not possess his friend s amazing credulity he takes the request with becoming seriousness and promises to do his best but he adds that the real question is whether Suetonius s dreams are usually true or not He then relates how he himself once had a vision of his mother in law of all people appearing to him and begging him to abandon a case he had undertaken In spite of this awful warning he persevered however and it was well that he did so for the case proved the beginning of his successful career at the Bar twenty six His uncle the elder Pliny seems to have placed more faith in his dreams and wrote his account of the German wars entirely because he dreamt that Drusus appeared to him and implored him to preserve his name from oblivion twenty seven The Plinies were undoubtedly two of the ablest and most enlightened men of their time and the belief in the value of dreams is certainly not extinct among us yet If we possess Artemidorus s book on the subject for the ancient world we have also the Smorfia of to day so dear to the heart of the lotto playing Neapolitan which assigns a special number to every conceivable subject that can possibly occur in a dream not excluding u murtu che parl the dead man that speaks for the guidance of the believing gambler in selecting the numbers he is to play for the week Plutarch placed great faith in ghosts and visions In his Life of Dion twenty eight he notes the singular fact that both Dion and Brutus were warned of their approaching deaths by a frightful spectre It has been maintained he adds that no man in his senses ever saw a ghost that these are the delusive visions of women and children or of men whose intellects are impaired by some physical infirmity and who believe that their diseased imaginations are of divine origin But if Dion and Brutus men of strong and philosophic minds whose understandings were not affected by any constitutional infirmity if such men could place so much faith in the appearance of spectres as to give an account of them to their friends I see no reason why we should depart from the opinion of the ancients that men had their evil genii who disturbed them with fears and distressed their virtues In the opening of the Philopseudus Lucian asks what it is that makes men so fond of a lie and comments on their delight in romancing themselves which is only equalled by the earnest attention with which they receive other people s efforts in the same direction Tychiades goes on to describe his visit to Eucrates a distinguished philosopher who was ill in bed With him were a Stoic a Peripatetic a Pythagorean a Platonist and a doctor who began to tell stories so absurd and abounding in such monstrous superstition that he ended by leaving them in disgust None of us have of course ever been present at similar gatherings where after starting with the inevitable Glamis mystery everybody in the room has set to work to outdo his neighbour in marvellous yarns drawing on his imagination for additional material and like Eucrates being ready to stake the lives of his children on his veracity Another scoffer was Democritus of Abdera who was so firmly convinced of the non existence of ghosts that he took up his abode in a tomb and lived there night and day for a long time Classical ghosts seem to have affected black rather than white as their favourite colour Among the features of the gruesome entertainments with which Domitian loved to terrify his Senators were handsome boys who appeared naked with their bodies painted black like ghosts and performed a wild dance twenty nine On the following day one of them was generally sent as a present to each Senator Some boys in the neighbourhood wished to shake Democritus s unbelief so they dressed themselves in black with masks like skulls upon their heads and danced round the tomb where he lived But to their annoyance he only put his head out and told them to go away and stop playing the fool The Greek and Roman stories hardly come up to the standards required by the Society for Psychical Research They are purely popular and the ghost is regarded as the deceased person permitted or condemned by the powers of the lower world to hold communication with survivors on earth Naturally they were never submitted to critical inquiry and there is no foreshadowing of any of the modern theories that the phenomenon if caused by the deceased is not necessarily the deceased though it may be an indication that some kind of force is being exercised after death which is in some way connected with a person previously known on earth or that the apparitions may be purely local or due entirely to subjective hallucination on the part of the person beholding them Strangely enough we rarely find any of those interesting cases everywhere so well attested of people appearing just about the time of their death to friends or relatives to whom they are particularly attached or with whom they have made a compact that they will appear should they die first if it is possible The classical instance of this is the well known story of Lord Brougham who while taking a warm bath in Sweden saw a school friend whom he had not met for many years but with whom he had long ago committed the folly of drawing up an agreement written with our blood to the effect that whichever of us died first should appear to the other and thus solve any doubts we had entertained of the life after death There are however a number of stories of the passing of souls which are curiously like some of those collected by the Society for Psychical Research in the Fourth Book of Gregory the Great s Dialogues Another noticeable difference is that apparitions in most well authenticated modern ghost stories are of a comforting character whereas those in the ancient world are nearly all the reverse This difference we may attribute to the entire change in the aspect of the future life which we owe to modern Christianity As we have seen there was little that was comforting in the life after death as conceived by the old pagan religions while in medieval times the horrors of hell were painted in the most lurid colours and were emphasized more than the joys of heaven FOOTNOTES Footnote twenty five Cic Murena twenty seven Footnote twenty six Ep i eighteen Footnote twenty seven Ibid three five four Footnote twenty eight Chap II Footnote twenty nine Dio Cass Domitian nine III STORIES OF HAUNTING In a letter to Sura thirty the younger Pliny gives us what may be taken as a prototype of all later haunted house stories At one time in Athens there was a roomy old house where nobody could be induced to live In the dead of night the sound of clanking chains would be heard distant at first proceeding doubtless from the garden behind or the inner court of the house then gradually drawing nearer and nearer till at last there appeared the figure of an old man with a long beard thin and emaciated with chains on his hands and feet The house was finally abandoned and advertised to be let or sold at an absurdly low price The philosopher Athenodorus read the notice on his arrival in Athens but the smallness of the sum asked aroused his suspicions However as soon as he heard the story he took the house He had his bed placed in the front court close to the main door dismissed his slaves and prepared to pass the night there reading and writing in order to prevent his thoughts from wandering to the ghost He worked on for some time without anything happening but at last the clanking of chains was heard in the distance Athenodorus did not raise his eyes or stop his work but kept his attention fixed and listened The sounds gradually drew nearer and finally entered the room where he was sitting Then he turned round and saw the apparition It beckoned him to follow but he signed to it to wait and went on with his work Not till it came and clanked its chains over his very head would he take up a lamp and follow it The figure moved slowly forward seemingly weighed down with its heavy chains until it reached an open space in the courtyard There it vanished Athenodorus marked the spot with leaves and grass and on the next day the ground was dug up in the presence of a magistrate when the skeleton of a man with some rusty chains was discovered The remains were buried with all ceremony and the apparition was no more seen Lucian tells the same story in the Philopseudus with some ridiculous additions thoroughly in keeping with the surroundings An almost exactly similar story has been preserved by Robert Wodrow the indefatigable collector in a notebook which he appears to have intended to be the foundation of a scientific collection of marvellous tales Wodrow died early in the eighteenth century Gilbert Rule the founder and first Principal of Edinburgh University once reached a desolate inn in a lonely spot on the Grampians The inn was full and they were obliged to make him up a bed in a house near by that had been vacant for thirty years He walked some time in the room says Wodrow thirty one and committed himself to God s protection and went to bed There were two candles left on the table and these he put out There was a large bright fire remaining He had not been long in bed till the room door is opened and an apparition in shape of a country tradesman came in and opened the curtains without speaking a word mister Rule was resolved to do nothing till it should speak or attack him but lay still with full composure committing himself to the Divine protection and conduct The apparition went to the table lighted the two candles brought them to the bedside and made some steps toward the door looking still to the bed as if he would have mister Rule rising and following mister Rule still lay still till he should see his way further cleared Then the apparition who the whole time spoke none took an effectual way to raise the doctor He carried back the candles to the table and went to the fire and with the tongs took down the kindled coals and laid them on the deal chamber floor The doctor then thought it time to rise and put on his clothes in the time of which the spectre laid up the coals again in the chimney and going to the table lifted the candles and went to the door opened it still looking to the Principal as he would have him following the candles which he now thinking there was something extraordinary in the case after looking to God for direction inclined to do The apparition went down some steps with the candles and carried them into a long trance at the end of which there was a stair which carried down to a low room This the spectre went down and stooped and set down the lights on the lowest step of the stair and straight disappears The learned Principal continues Burton whose courage and coolness deserve the highest commendation lighted himself back to bed with the candles and took the remainder of his rest undisturbed Being a man of great sagacity on ruminating over his adventure he informed the Sheriff of the county that he was much of the mind there was murder in the case The stone whereon the candles were placed was raised and there the plain remains of a human body were found and bones to the conviction of all It was supposed to be an old affair however and no traces could be got of the murderer Rule undertook the functions of the detective and pressed into the service the influence of his own profession He preached a great sermon on the occasion to which all the neighbouring people were summoned and behold in the time of his sermon an old man near eighty years was awakened and fell a weeping and before the whole company acknowledged that at the building of that house he was the murderer The main features of the story have changed very little in the course of ages except in the important point of the conviction of the murderer which would have been effected in a very different way in a Greek story Doubtless a similar tale could be found in the folk lore of almost any nation Plutarch thirty two relates how in his native city of Chaeronaea a certain Damon had been murdered in some baths Ghosts continued to haunt the spot ever afterwards and mysterious groans were heard so that at last the doors were walled up And to this very day he continues those who live in the neighbourhood imagine that they see strange sights and are terrified with cries of sorrow It is quite clear from Plautus that ghost stories even if not taken very seriously aroused a wide spread interest in the average Roman of his day just as they do in the average Briton of our own They were doubtless discussed in a half joking way The apparitions were generally believed to frighten people just as they are at present though the well authenticated stories of such occurrences would seem to show that genuine ghosts or whatever one likes to call them have the power of paralyzing fear In the Mostellaria thirty three Plautus uses a ghost as a recognized piece of supernatural machinery The regulation father of Roman comedy has gone away on a journey and in the meantime the son has as usual almost reached the end of his father s fortune The father comes back unexpectedly and the son turns in despair to his faithful slave Tranio for help Tranio is equal to the occasion and undertakes to frighten the inconvenient parent away again He gives an account of an apparition that has been seen and has announced that it is the ghost of a stranger from over seas who has been dead for six years Here must I dwell it had declared for the gods of the lower world will not receive me seeing that I died before my time My host murdered me his guest villain that he was for the gold that I carried and secretly buried me without funeral rites in this house Be gone hence therefore for it is accursed and unholy ground This story is enough for the father He takes the advice and does not return till Tranio and his dutiful son are quite ready for him Great battlefields are everywhere believed to be haunted Tacitus thirty four relates how when Titus was besieging Jerusalem armies were seen fighting in the sky and at a much later date after a great battle against Attila and the Huns under the walls of Rome the ghosts of the dead fought for three days and three nights and the clash of their arms was distinctly heard thirty five Marathon is no exception to the rule Pausanias thirty six says that any night you may hear horses neighing and men fighting there To go on purpose to see the sight never brought good to any man but with him who unwittingly lights upon it the spirits are not angry He adds that the people of Marathon worship the men who fell in the battle as heroes and who could be more worthy of such honour than they The battle itself was not without its marvellous side Epizelus the Athenian used to relate how a huge hoplite whose beard over shadowed all his shield stood over against him in the thick of the fight The apparition passed him by and killed the man next him but Epizelus came out of the battle blind and remained so for the rest of his life thirty seven Plutarch thirty eight also relates of a place in Boeotia where a battle had been fought that there is a stream running by and that people imagine that they hear panting horses in the roaring waters But the strangest account of the habitual haunting of great battlefields is to be found in Philostratus s Heroica which represents the spirits of the Homeric heroes as still closely connected with Troy and its neighbourhood How far the stories are based on local tradition it is impossible to say they are told by a vine dresser who declares that he lives under the protection of Protesilaus At one time he was in danger of being violently ousted from all his property when the ghost of Protesilaus appeared to the would be despoiler in a vision and struck him blind The great man was so terrified at this event that he carried his depredations no further and the vine dresser has since continued to cultivate what remained of his property under the protection of the hero with whom he lives on most intimate terms Protesilaus often appears to him while he is at work and has long talks with him and he keeps off wild beasts and disease from the land Not only Protesilaus but also his men and in fact virtually all of the giants of the mighty bone and bold emprise who fought round Troy can be seen on the plain at night clad like warriors with nodding plumes The inhabitants are keenly interested in these apparitions and well they may be as so much depends upon them If the heroes are covered with dust a drought is impending if with sweat they foreshadow rain Blood upon their arms means a plague but if they show themselves without any distinguishing mark all will be well Though the heroes are dead they cannot be insulted with impunity Ajax was popularly believed owing to the form taken by his madness to be especially responsible for any misfortune that might befall flocks and herds On one occasion some shepherds who had had bad luck with their cattle surrounded his tomb and abused him bringing up all the weak points in his earthly career recorded by Homer At last they went too far for his patience and a terrible voice was heard in the tomb and the clash of armour The offenders fled in terror but came to no harm On another occasion some strangers were playing at draughts near his shrine when Ajax appeared and begged them to stop as the game reminded him of Palamedes Hector was a far more dangerous person Maximus of Tyre thirty nine says that the people of Ilium often see him bounding over the plain at dead of night in flashing armour a truly Homeric picture Maximus cannot indeed boast of having seen Hector though he also has had his visions vouchsafed him He had seen Castor and Pollux like twin stars above his ship steering it through a storm AEsculapius also he has seen not in a dream by Hercules but with his waking eyes But to return to Hector Philostratus says that one day an unfortunate boy insulted him in the same way in which the shepherds had treated Ajax Homer however did not satisfy this boy and as a parting shaft he declared that the statue in Ilium did not really represent Hector but Achilles Nothing happened immediately but not long afterwards while the boy was driving a team of ponies Hector appeared in the form of a warrior in a brook which was as a rule so small as not even to have a name He was heard shouting in a foreign tongue as he pursued the boy in the stream finally overtaking and drowning him with his ponies The bodies were never afterwards recovered Philostratus gives us a quantity of details about the Homeric heroes which the vine dresser has picked up in his talks with Protesilaus Most of the heroes can be easily recognized Achilles for instance enters into conversation with various people and goes out hunting He can be recognized by his height and his beauty and his bright armour and as he rushes past he is usually accompanied by a whirlwind Greek podarkes dios even after death Then we hear the story of the White Isle Helen and Achilles fell in love with one another though they had never met the one hidden in Egypt the other fighting before Troy There was no place near Troy suited for their eternal life together so Thetis appealed to Poseidon to give them an island home of their own Poseidon consented and the White Isle rose up in the Black Sea near the mouth of the Danube There Achilles and Helen the manliest of men and the most feminine of women first met and first embraced and Poseidon himself and Amphitrite and all the Nereids and as many river gods and spirits as dwell near the Euxine and Maeotis came to the wedding The island is thickly covered with white trees and with elms which grow in regular order round the shrine and on it there dwell certain white birds fragrant of the salt sea which Achilles is said to have tamed to his will so that they keep the glades cool fanning them with their wings and scattering spray as they fly along the ground scarce rising above it To men sailing over the broad bosom of the sea the island is holy when they disembark for it lies like a hospitable home to their ships But neither those who sail thither nor the Greeks and barbarians living round the Black Sea may build a house upon it and all who anchor and sacrifice there must go on board at sunset No man may pass the night upon the isle and no woman may even land there If the wind is favourable ships must sail away if not they must put out and anchor in the bay and sleep on board For at night men say that Achilles and Helen drink together and sing of each other s love and of the war and of Homer Now that his battles are over Achilles cultivates the gift of song he had received from Calliope Their voices ring out clear and godlike over the water and the sailors sit trembling with emotion as they listen Those who had anchored there declared that they had heard the neighing of horses and the clash of arms and shouts such as are raised in battle Maximus of Tyre forty also describes the island and tells how sailors have often seen a fair haired youth dancing a war dance in golden armour upon it and how once when one of them unwittingly slept there Achilles woke him and took him to his tent and entertained him Patroclus poured the wine and Achilles played the lyre while Thetis herself is said to have been present with a choir of other deities If they anchor to the north or the south of the island and a breeze springs up that makes the harbours dangerous Achilles warns them and bids them change their anchorage and avoid the wind Sailors relate how when they first behold the island they embrace each other and burst into tears of joy Then they put in and kiss the land and go to the temple to pray and to sacrifice to Achilles Victims stand ready of their own accord at the altar according to the size of the ship and the number of those on board Pausanias also mentions the White Isle forty one On one occasion Leonymus while leading the people of Croton against the Italian Locrians attacked the spot where he was informed that Ajax Oileus on whom the people of Locris had called for help was posted in the van According to Conon forty two who by the way calls the hero Autoleon when the people of Croton went to war they also left a vacant space for Ajax in the forefront of their line However this may be Leonymus was wounded in the breast and as the wound refused to heal and weakened him considerably he applied to Delphi for advice The god told him to sail to the White Isle where Ajax would heal him of his wound Thither therefore he went and was duly healed On his return he described what he had seen how that Achilles was now married to Helen and it was Leonymus who told Stesichorus that his blindness was due to Helen s wrath and thus induced him to write the Palinode Achilles himself is once said to have appeared to a trader who frequently visited the island They talked of Troy and then the hero gave him wine and bade him sail away and fetch him a certain Trojan maiden who was the slave of a citizen of Ilium The trader was surprised at the request and ventured to ask why he wanted a Trojan slave Achilles replied that it was because she was of the same race as Hector and his ancestors and of the blood of the sons of Priam and Dardanus The trader thought that Achilles was in love with the girl whom he duly brought with him on his next visit to the island Achilles thanked him and bade him keep her on board the ship doubtless because women were not allowed to land In the evening he was entertained by Achilles and Helen and his host gave him a large sum of money promising to make him his guest friend and to bring luck to his ship and his business At daybreak Achilles dismissed him telling him to leave the girl on the shore When they had gone about a furlong from the island a horrible cry from the maiden reached their ears and they saw Achilles tearing her to pieces rending her limb from limb In this brutal savage it is impossible to recognize Homer s chivalrous hero who sacrificed the success of a ten years war fought originally for the recovery of one woman to his grief at the loss of another and has thus made it possible to describe the Iliad as the greatest love poem ever written One cannot help feeling that Pindar s Isle of the Blest whither he was brought by Thetis whose mother s prayer had moved the Heart of Zeus to dwell with Cadmus and Peleus is Achilles true home or the isle of the heroes of all time described by Carducci where King Lear sits telling OEdipus of his sufferings and Cordelia calls to Antigone Come my Greek sister We will sing of peace to our fathers Helen and Iseult silent and thoughtful roam under the shade of the myrtles while the setting sun kisses their golden hair with its reddening rays Helen gazes across the sea but King Mark opens his arms to Iseult and the fair head sinks on the mighty beard Clytemnestra stands by the shore with the Queen of Scots They bathe their white arms in the waves but the waves recoil swollen with red blood while the wailing of the hapless women echoes along the rocky strand Among these heroic souls Shelley alone of modern poets that Titan spirit in a maiden s form may find a place according to Carducci caught up by Sophocles from the living embrace of Thetis forty three FOOTNOTES Footnote thirty Ep vii twenty seven Footnote

that it was possible to call up the souls of the dead by means of spells was almost universal in antiquity We know that even Saul who had himself cut off those that had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land disguised himself and went with two others to consult the witch of En dor that she called up the spirit of Samuel at his request that Samuel asked Saul Why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up and then prophesied his ruin and death at the hands of the Philistines at Mount Gilboa We find frequent references to the practice in classical literature The elder Pliny forty four gives us the interesting information that spirits refuse to obey people afflicted with freckles There were always certain spots hallowed by tradition as particularly favourable to intercourse with the dead or even as being actual entrances to the lower world For instance at Heraclea in Pontus there was a famous Greek psychomanteion or place where the souls of the dead could be conjured up and consulted as Hercules was believed to have dragged Cerberus up to earth here Other places supposed to be connected with this myth had a similar legend attached to them as also did all places where Pluto was thought to have carried off Persephone Thus we hear of entrances to Hades at Eleusis forty five at Colonus forty six at Enna in Sicily forty seven and finally at the lovely pool of Cyane up the Anapus River near Syracuse one of the few streams in which the papyrus still flourishes forty eight Lakes and seas also were frequently believed to be entrances to Hades forty nine The existence of sulphurous fumes easily gave rise to a belief that certain places were in direct communication with the lower world This was the case at Cumae where AEneas consulted the Sybil and at Colonus while at Hierapolis in Phrygia there was a famous Plutonium which could only be safely approached by the priests of Cybele fifty It was situated under a temple of Apollo a real entrance to Hades and it is doubtless to this that Cicero refers when he speaks of the deadly Plutonia he had seen in Asia fifty one These Plutonia or Charonia are in fact places where mephitic vapours exist like the Grotto del Cane and other spots in the neighbourhood of Naples and Pozzuoli The priests must either have become used to the fumes or have learnt some means of counteracting them otherwise their lives can hardly have been more pleasant than that of the unfortunate dog which used to be exhibited in the Naples grotto though the control of these very realistic entrances to the kingdom of Pluto must have been a very profitable business well worth a little personal inconvenience Others are mentioned by Strabo at Magnesia and Myus fifty two and there was one at Cyllene in Arcadia In addition to these there were numerous special temples or places where the souls of the dead which were universally thought to possess a knowledge of the future could be called up and consulted e g the temple at Phigalia in Arcadia used by Pausanias the Spartan commander fifty three or the Greek nekyomanteion the oracle of the dead by the River Acheron in Threspotia to which Periander the famous tyrant of Corinth had recourse fifty four and it was here according to Pausanias that Orpheus went down to the lower world in search of Eurydice Lucian fifty five tells us that it was only with Pluto s permission that the dead could return to life and they were invariably accompanied by Mercury Consequently both these gods were regularly invoked in the prayers and spells used on such occasions Only the souls of those recently dead were as a rule called up for it was naturally held that they would feel greater interest in the world they had just left and in the friends and relations still alive to whom they were really attached Not that it was impossible to evoke the ghosts of those long dead if it was desired Even Orpheus and Cecrops were not beyond reach of call and Apollonius of Tyana claimed to have raised the shade of Achilles fifty six All oracles were originally sacred to Persephone and Pluto and relied largely on necromancy a snake being the emblem of prophetic power Hence when Apollo the god of light claimed possession of the oracles as the conqueror of darkness the snake was twined round his tripod as an emblem and his priestess was called Pythia When Alexander set up his famous oracle as described by Lucian the first step taken in establishing its reputation was the finding of a live snake in an egg in a lake The find had of course been previously arranged by Alexander and his confederates We still possess accounts of the working of these oracles of the dead especially of the one connected with the Lake of Avernus near Naples Cicero fifty seven describes how from this lake shades the spirits of the dead are summoned in the dense gloom of the mouth of Acheron with salt blood and Strabo quotes the early Greek historian Ephorus as relating how even in his day the priests that raise the dead from Avernus live in underground dwellings communicating with each other by subterranean passages through which they led those who wished to consult the oracle hidden in the bowels of the earth Not far from the lake of Avernus says Maximus of Tyre was an oracular cave which took its name from the calling up of the dead Those who came to consult the oracle after repeating the sacred formula and offering libations and slaying victims called upon the spirit of the friend or relation they wished to consult Then it appeared an unsubstantial shade difficult both to see and to recognize yet endowed with a human voice and skilled in prophecy When it had answered the questions put to it it vanished One is at once struck with the similarity of this account to those of the spiritualistic seances of the famous Eusapia in the same part of the world not so very long ago In most cases those consulting the oracle would probably be satisfied with hearing the voice of the dead man or with a vision of him in sleep so that some knowledge of ventriloquism or power of hypnotism or suggestion would often be ample stock in trade for those in charge This consulting of the dead must have been very common in antiquity Both Plato fifty eight and Euripides fifty nine mention it and the belief that the dead have a knowledge of the future which seems to be ingrained in human nature gave these oracles great power Thus Cicero tells sixty us that Appius often consulted soul oracles psychomantia and also mentions a man having recourse to one when his son was seriously ill sixty one The poets have of course made free use of this supposed prophetic power of the dead The shade of Polydorus for instance speaks the prologue of the Hecuba while the appearance of the dead Creusa in the AEneid is known to everyone In the Persae AEschylus makes the shade of Darius ignorant of all that has happened since his death and is thus able to introduce his famous description of the battle of Salamis but Darius nevertheless possesses a knowledge of the future and can therefore give us an equally vivid account of the battle of Plataea which had not yet taken place The shade of Clytemnestra in the Eumenides however does not prophesy Pliny mentions the belief that the dead had prophetic powers but declares that they could not always be relied on as the following instance proves sixty two During the Sicilian war Gabienus the bravest man in Caesar s fleet was captured by Sextus Pompeius and beheaded by his orders For a whole day the corpse lay upon the shore the head almost severed from the body Then towards evening a large crowd assembled attracted by his groans and prayers and he begged Sextus Pompeius either to come to him himself or to send some of his friends for he had returned from the dead and had something to tell him Pompeius sent friends and Gabienus informed them that Pompeius s cause found favour with the gods below and was the right cause and that he was bidden to announce that all would end as he wished To prove the truth of what he said he announced that he would die immediately as he actually did This knowledge of the future by the dead is to be found in more than one well authenticated modern ghost story where the apparition would seem to have manifested itself for the express purpose of warning those whom it has loved on earth of approaching danger We may take for instance the story sixty three where a wife who is lying in bed with her husband suddenly sees a gentleman dressed in full naval uniform sitting on the bed She was too astonished for fear and waked her husband who for a second or two lay looking in intense astonishment at the intruder then lifting himself a little he shouted What on earth are you doing here sir Meanwhile the form slowly drawing himself into an upright position now said in a commanding yet reproachful voice Willie Willie and then vanished Her husband got up unlocked the door and searched the house but found nothing On his return he informed his wife that the form was that of his father whom she had never seen He had left the navy before this son was born and the son had therefore only seen his father in uniform a very few times It afterwards came out that her husband was about to engage in some speculations which had he done so would have proved his ruin but fortunately this vision of his father made such an impression on him that he abandoned the idea altogether Lucan sixty four describes how Sextus Pompeius went to consult Erichtho one of the famous Thessalian witches as to the prospects of his father s success against Caesar during the campaign that ended in the disastrous defeat at Pharsalia It is decided that a dead man must be called back to life and Erichtho goes out to where a recent skirmish has taken place and chooses the body of a man whose throat had been cut which was lying there unburied She drags it back to her cave and fills its breast with warm blood She has chosen a man recently dead because his words are more likely to be clear and distinct which might not be the case with one long accustomed to the world below She then washes it uses various magic herbs and potions and prays to the gods of the lower world At last she sees the shade of the man whose lifeless body lies stretched before her standing close by and gazing upon the limbs it had left and the hated bonds of its former prison Furious at the delay and the slow working of her spells she seizes a live serpent and lashes the corpse with it Even the last boon of death the power of dying is denied the poor wretch Slowly the life returns to the body and Erichtho promises that if the man speaks the truth she will bury him so effectually that no spells will ever be able to call him back to life again He is weak and faint like a dying man but finally tells her all she wishes to know and dies once again She fulfills her promise and burns the body using every kind of magic spell to make it impossible for anyone to trouble the shade again Indeed it seems to have been unusual to summon a shade from the lower world more than once except in the case of very famous persons This kind of magic was nearly always carried on at night Statius sixty five has also given us a long and characteristically elaborate account of the calling up of the shade of Laius by Eteocles and Tiresias Apuleius sixty six in his truly astounding account of Thessaly in his day gives a detailed description of the process of calling back a corpse to life The prophet then took a certain herb and laid it thrice upon the mouth of the dead man placing another upon the breast Then turning himself to the east with a silent prayer for the help of the holy sun he drew the attention of the audience to the great miracle he was performing Gradually the breast of the corpse began to swell in the act of breathing the arteries to pulsate and the body to be filled with life Finally the dead man sat up and asked why he had been brought back to life and not left in peace One is reminded of the dead man being carried out to burial who meets Dionysus in Hades in Aristophanes Frogs and expresses the wish that he may be struck alive again if he does what is requested of him If ghosts are often represented as all loath to leave the body that they love they are generally quite as loath to return to it when once they have left it though whether it is the process of returning or the continuance of a life which they have left that is distasteful to them is not very clear The painfulness of the process of restoration to life after drowning seems to favour the former explanation These cases of resurrection are of course quite different from ordinary necromancy the summoning of the shade of a dead man from the world below in order to ask its advice with the help of a professional diviner As religious faith decayed and the superstitions of the East and the belief in magic gained ground necromancy became more and more common Even Cicero charges Vatinius sixty seven with evoking the souls of the dead and with being in the habit of sacrificing the entrails of boys to the Manes Tacitus mentions a young man trying to raise the dead by means of incantations sixty eight while Pliny sixty nine speaks of necromancy as a recognized branch of magic and Origen classes it among the crimes of the magicians in his own day After murdering his mother Nero often declared that he was troubled by her spirit and by the lashes and blazing torches of the Furies seventy One would imagine that the similarity of his crime and his punishment to those of Orestes would have been singularly gratifying to a man of Nero s theatrical temperament yet we are informed that he often tried to call up her ghost and lay it with the help of magic rites Nero however took particular pleasure in raising the spirits of the dead according to the Elder Pliny seventy one who adds that not even the charms of his own singing and acting had greater attractions for him Caracalla besides his bodily illnesses was obviously insane and often troubled with delusions imagining that he was being driven out by his father and also by his brother Geta whom he had murdered in his mother s arms and that they pursued him with drawn swords in their hands At last as a desperate resource he endeavoured to find a cure by means of necromancy and called up among others the shade of his father Septimius Severus as well as that of Commodus But they all refused to speak to him with the exception of Commodus and it was even rumoured that the shade of Severus was accompanied by that of the murdered Geta though it had not been evoked by Caracalla Nor had Commodus any comfort for him He only terrified the suffering Emperor the more by his ominous words seventy two Philostratus seventy three has described for us a famous interview which Apollonius of Tyana maintained that he had had with the shade of Achilles The philosopher related that it was not by digging a trench nor by shedding the blood of rams like Odysseus that he raised the ghost of Achilles but by prayers such as the Indians are said to make to their heroes In his prayer to Achilles he said that unlike most men he did not believe that the great warrior was dead any more than his master Pythagoras had done and he begged him to show himself Then there was a slight earthquake shock and a beautiful youth stood before him nine feet in height wearing a Thessalian cloak He did not look like a boaster as some men had thought him and his expression if grim was not unpleasant No words could describe his beauty which surpassed anything imaginable Meanwhile he had grown to be twenty feet high and his beauty increased in proportion His hair he had never cut Apollonius was allowed to ask him five questions and accordingly asked for information on five of the most knotty points in the history of the Trojan War whether Helen was really in Troy why Homer never mentions Palamedes et cetera Achilles answered him fully and correctly in each instance Then suddenly the cock crew and like Hamlet s father he vanished from Apollonius s sight

V VISIONS OF THE DEAD IN SLEEP In most of the Greek and Roman stories that survive the wraiths of the dead are represented as revisiting their friends on earth in sleep These instances I have not as a rule troubled to collect for they cannot strictly be classed as ghost stories but since the influence of the dead was generally considered to be exercised in this way I shall give a few stories which seem particularly striking That it was widely believed that the dead could return at night to those whom they loved is proved by the touching inscription in which a wife begs that her husband may sometimes be allowed to revisit her in sleep and that she may soon join him The most interesting passage that has come down to us dealing with the whole question of the power of the dead to appear to those whom they love in dreams is undoubtedly Quintilian s Tenth Declamation The fact that the greatest teacher of rhetoric of his day actually chose it as a subject for one of his model speeches shows how important a part it must have played in the feelings of educated Romans of the time The story is as follows A mother was plunged in grief at the loss of her favourite son when on the night of the funeral which had been long delayed at her earnest request the boy appeared to her in a vision and remained with her all night kissing her and fondling her as if he were alive He did not leave her till daybreak All that survives of a son says Quintilian will remain in close communion with his mother when he dies In her unselfishness she begs her son not to withhold the comfort which he has brought to her from his father But the father when he hears the story does not at all relish the idea of a visit from his son s ghost and is in fact terrified at the prospect He says nothing to the mother who had moved the gods of the world above no less than those of the world below by the violence of her grief and the importunity of her prayers but at once sends for a sorcerer As soon as he arrives the sorcerer is taken to the family tomb which has its place in the city of the dead that stretches along the highway from the town gate The magic spell is wound about the grave and the urn is finally sealed with the dread words until at last the hapless boy has become in very truth a lifeless shade Finally we are told the sorcerer threw himself upon the urn itself and breathed his spells into the very bones and ashes This at least he admitted as he looked up The spirit resists Spells are not enough We must close the grave completely and bind the stones together with iron His suggestions are carried out and at last he declares that all has been accomplished successfully Now he is really dead He cannot appear or come out This night will prove the truth of my words The boy never afterwards appeared either to his mother or to anyone else The mother is beside herself with grief Her son s spirit which had successfully baffled the gods of the lower world in its desire to visit her is now thanks to these foreign spells dashing itself against the top of the grave unable to understand the weight that has been placed upon it to keep it from escaping Not only do the spells shut the boy in he might possibly have broken through these but the iron bands and solid fastenings have once again brought him face to face with death This very realistic if rather material picture of a human soul mewed up for ever in the grave gives us a clear idea of the popular belief in Rome about the future life and enables us to realize the full meaning of the inscription Sit tibi terra levis May the earth press lightly upon thee which is so common upon Roman tombs as often to be abbreviated to S T T L The speech is supposed to be delivered in an action for cruelty seventy four brought by the wife against her husband and in the course of it the father is spoken of as a parricide for what he has done He defends himself by saying that he took the steps which are the cause of the action for his wife s peace of mind To this plea it is answered that the ghost of a son could never frighten a mother though other spirits if unknown to her might conceivably do so In the course of the speech we are told that the spirit when freed from the body bathes itself in fire and makes for its home among the stars where other fates await it Then it remembers the body in which it once dwelt Hence the dead return to visit those who once were dear to them on earth and become oracles and give us timely warnings and are conscious of the victims we offer them and welcome the honours paid them at their tombs The Declamation ends like most Roman speeches with an appeal in this case to the sorcerer and the husband to remove the spells especially to the sorcerer who has power to torture the gods above and the spirits of the dead who by the terror of his midnight cries can move the deepest caves can shake the very foundations of the earth You are able both to call up the spirits that serve you and to act as their cruel and ruthless gaoler Listen for once to a mother s prayers and let them soften your heart Then we have the story of Thrasyllus as told by Apuleius seventy five which is thoroughly modern in its romantic tone He was in love with the wife of his friend Tlepolemus whom he treacherously murdered while out hunting His crime is not discovered and he begins to press his suit for her hand to her parents almost immediately The widow s grief is heart rending She refuses food and altogether neglects herself hoping that the gods will hear her prayer and allow her to rejoin her husband At last however she is persuaded by her parents at Thrasyllus s instance to give ordinary care to her own health But she passes her days before the likeness of the deceased which she has had made in the image of that of the god Liber paying it divine honours and finding her one comfort in thus fomenting her own sufferings When she hears of Thrasyllus s suit she rejects it with scorn and horror and then at night her dead husband appears to her and describes exactly what happened and begs her to avenge him She requires no urging and almost immediately decides on the course that her vengeance shall take She has Thrasyllus informed that she cannot come to any definite decision till her year of mourning is over Meanwhile however she consents to receive his visits at night and promises to arrange for her old nurse to let him in Overjoyed at his success Thrasyllus comes at the hour appointed and is duly admitted by the old nurse The house is in complete darkness but he is given a cup of wine and left to himself The wine has been drugged however and he sinks into a deep slumber Then Tlepolemus s widow comes and triumphs over her enemy who has fallen so easily into her hands She will not kill him as he killed her husband Neither the peace of death nor the joy of life shall be yours she exclaims You shall wander like a restless shade between Orcus and the light of day The blood of your eyes I shall offer up at the tomb of my beloved Tlepolemus and with them I shall propitiate his blessed spirit At these words she takes a pin from her hair and blinds him Then she rushes through the streets with a sword in her hand to frighten anyone who might try to stop her to her husband s tomb where after telling all her story she slays herself Thither Thrasyllus followed her declaring that he dedicated himself to the Manes of his own free will He carefully shut the tomb upon himself and starved himself to death This is by far the best of the stories in which we find a vision of the dead in sleep playing an important part but there is also the well known tale of the Byzantine maiden Cleonice seventy six She was of high birth but had the misfortune to attract the attention of the Spartan Pausanias who was in command of the united Greek fleet at the Hellespont after the battle of Plataea Like many Spartans when first brought into contact with real luxury after his frugal upbringing at home he completely lost his mental balance and grew intoxicated with the splendour of his position endeavouring to imitate the Persians in their manners and even aspiring it is said to become tyrant of the whole of Greece Cleonice was brutally torn from her parents and brought to his room at night He was asleep at the time and being awakened by the noise he imagined that someone had broken into his room with the object of murdering him and snatched up a sword and killed her After this her ghost appeared to him every night bidding him go to the fate which pride and lust prepare He is said to have visited a temple at Heraclea where he had her spirit called up and implored her pardon She duly appeared and told him that he would soon be delivered from all his troubles after his return to Sparta an ambiguous way of prophesying his death which occurred soon afterwards She was certainly avenged in the manner of it Before leaving these stories of visions of the dead we must not omit to mention that charming poem of Virgil s younger days the Culex The Gnat Just as the first sketch of Macaulay s famous character of William III is said to be contained in a Cambridge prize essay on the subject so the Culex contains the first draft of some of the greatest passages in Virgil s later works the beautiful description of the charms of country life in the Georgics for instance and the account of Tartarus in the sixth book of the AEneid The story is slight as was usually the case in these little epics where the purple patches are more important than the plot A shepherd falls asleep in the shade by a cool fountain just as he would do in Southern Italy to day for his rest after the midday meal Suddenly a snake the horrors of which are described with a vividness that is truly Virgilian appears upon the scene and prepares to strike the shepherd A passing gnat the hero of the poem sees the danger and wakes the shepherd by stinging him in the eye He springs up angrily brushes it off with his hand and dashes it lifeless to the ground Then to his horror he sees the snake and promptly kills it with the branch of a tree While he lies asleep that night the ghost of the gnat appears to him in a dream and bitterly reproaches him for the cruel death with which it has been rewarded for its heroic services Charon has now claimed it for his own It goes on to give a lurid description of the horrors of Tartarus and contrasts its hard lot with that of the shepherd When he wakes the shepherd is filled with remorse for his conduct and is also perhaps afraid of being continually haunted by the ghost of his tiny benefactor He therefore sets to work to raise a mound in honour of the gnat facing it with marble Round it he plants all kinds of flowers especially violets and roses the flowers usually offered to the dead and cuts on a marble slab the following inscription Little gnat the shepherd dedicates to thee thy meed of a tomb in return for the life thou gavest him seventy seven There is also an interesting story of Pindar told by Pausanias seventy eight In his old age the great poet dreamt that Persephone appeared to him and told him that she alone of all the goddesses had not been celebrated in song by him but that he should pay the debt when he came to her Shortly after this he died There was however a relation of his a woman then far advanced in years who had practised the singing of most of his hymns To her Pindar appeared in a dream and sang the hymn to Proserpine which she wrote down from memory when she awoke I have included one or two stories of apparitions in dreams among those in the next section as they seemed to be more in place there FOOTNOTES Footnote seventy four Malae

dearly appeared to him after she had been dead for twenty days He had given her a splendid funeral and had burnt everything she possessed with her One day as he was sitting quietly reading the Phaedo she suddenly appeared to him to the terror of his son As soon as he saw her he embraced her tearfully a fact which seems to show that she was of a more substantial build than the large majority of ghosts of the ancient world but she strictly forbade him to make any sound whatever She then explained that she had come to upbraid the unfortunate man for having neglected to burn one of her golden slippers with her at the funeral It had fallen behind the chest she explained and had been forgotten and not placed upon the pyre with the other While they were talking a confounded little Maltese puppy suddenly began to bark from under the bed when she vanished But the slipper was found exactly where she had described and was duly burnt on the following day The story is refreshingly human This question of dress seems to have been a not infrequent source of anxiety to deceased ladies in the ancient world Periander eighty the tyrant of Corinth on one occasion wished to consult his wife s spirit upon a very important matter but she replied as she had doubtless often done when alive that she would not answer his questions till she had some decent clothes to wear Periander waited for a great festival when he knew that all the women of Corinth would be assembled in their best and then gave orders that they should one and all strip themselves He burnt the clothes on a huge pyre in his wife s honour and one can imagine his satisfaction at feeling that he had at last settled the question for ever He applied to his wife once more with a clear conscience when she gave him an unmistakable sign that she was speaking the truth and answered his questions as he desired That small household matters may weigh heavily upon a woman s conscience even nowadays is shown by the following interesting story which may well be compared with the foregoing eighty one In July eighteen thirty eight a Catholic priest who had gone to Perth to take charge of a mission was called upon by a Presbyterian woman For many weeks past she explained she had been anxious to see a priest A woman lately dead whom she knew very slightly had appeared to her during the night for several nights urging her to go to a priest and ask him to pay three shillings and tenpence to a person not specified The priest made inquiries and learnt that the deceased had acted as washerwoman and followed the regiment At last after careful search he found a grocer with whom she had dealt and on being asked whether a female of the name owed him anything the grocer turned up his books and informed him that she owed him three shillings and tenpence He paid the sum Subsequently the Presbyterian woman came to him saying that she was no more troubled The spirits of the worst of the Roman Emperors were as we should expect especially restless Pliny eighty two tells us how Fannius who was engaged upon a Life of Nero was warned by him of his approaching death He was lying on his couch at dead of night with a writing desk in front of him when Nero came and sat down by his side took up the first book he had written on his evil deeds and read it through to the end and so on with the second and the third Then he vanished Fannius was terrified for he thought the vision implied that he would never get beyond the third book of his work and this actually proved to be the case Nero in fact had a romantic charm about him in spite of or perhaps because of the wild recklessness of his life and he possessed the redeeming feature of artistic taste Like Francis I of France or our own Charles II he was irresistible with the ladies and must have been the darling of all the housemaids of Rome People long refused to believe in his death and for many years it was confidently affirmed that he would appear again His ghost was long believed to walk in Rome and the church of Santa Maria del Popolo is said to have been built as late as ten ninety nine by Pope Paschalis II on the site of the tombs of the Domitii where Nero was buried near the modern Porta del Popolo where the Via Flaminia entered the city in order to lay his restless shade Caligula also appeared shortly after his death and frequently disturbed the keepers of the Lamian Gardens for his body had been hastily buried there without due ceremony Not till his sisters who really loved him in spite of his many faults had returned from exile were the funeral rites properly performed after which his ghost gave no more trouble eighty three On the night of the day of Galba s murder the Emperor Otho was heard groaning in his room by his attendants They rushed in and found him lying in front of his bed endeavouring to propitiate Galba s ghost by whom he declared that he saw himself being driven out and expelled eighty four Otho was a strange mixture of superstition and scepticism for when he started on his last fatal expedition he treated the unfavourable omens with contempt By this time however he may have become desperate Moreover irreligious people are notoriously superstitious and at this period it would be very difficult to say just where religion ended and superstition began We have one or two ghost stories connected with early Greek mythology Cillas the charioteer of Pelops though Troezenius gives his name as Sphaerus died on the way to Pisa and appeared to Pelops by night begging that he might be duly buried Pelops took pity on him and burnt eighty five his body with all ceremony raised a huge mound in his honour and built a chapel to the Cillean Apollo near it He also named a town after him Strabo even says that there was a mound in Cillas honour at Crisa in the Troad This dutiful attention did not go unrewarded Cillas appeared to Pelops again and thanked him for all he had done and to Cillas also he is said to have owed the information by which he was able to overthrow OEnomaus in the famous chariot race which won him the hand of Hippodamia Pelops shameless ingratitude to OEnomaus s charioteer Myrtilus who had removed the pin of his master s chariot and thus caused his defeat and death in order to help Pelops on the promise of the half of the kingdom is hardly in accordance with his treatment of Cillas though it is thoroughly Greek However on the theory that a man who betrays one master will probably betray another especially if he is to be rewarded for his treachery with as much as half a kingdom Pelops was right in considering that Myrtilus was best out of the way and he can hardly have foreseen the curse that was to fall upon his family in consequence With this story we may compare the well known tale of the poet Simonides who found an unknown corpse on the shore and honoured it with burial eighty six Soon afterwards he happened to be on the point of starting on a voyage when the man whom he had buried appeared to him in a dream and warned him on no account to go by the ship he had chosen as it would undoubtedly be wrecked Impressed by the vision the poet remained behind and the ship went down soon afterwards with all on board Simonides expressed his gratitude in a poem describing the event and in several epigrams Libanius even goes so far as to place the scene of the event at Tarentum where he was preparing to take ship for Sicily The tale is probably mythical It belongs to a group of stories of the grateful dead which have been the subject of an interesting book recently published by the Folk Lore Society eighty seven mister Gerould doubts whether it really belongs to the cycle as it is nearly two centuries earlier even in Cicero s version than any other yet discovered but it certainly inspired Chaucer in his Nun s Priest s Tale and it may well have influenced other later versions The Jewish version is closer to the Simonides story than any of the others and I will quote it in mister Gerould s words eighty eight The son of a rich merchant of Jerusalem sets off after his father s death to see the world At Stamboul he finds hanging in chains the body of a Jew which the Sultan has commanded to be left there till his company religionists shall have repaid the sum that the man is suspected of having stolen from his royal master The hero pays this sum and has the corpse buried Later during a storm at sea he is saved by a stone on which he is brought to land whence he is carried by an eagle back to Jerusalem There a white clad man appears to him explaining that he is the ghost of the dead and that he has already appeared as stone and eagle The spirit further promises the hero a reward for his good deed in the present and in the future life This is one of the simplest forms in which the story appears It is generally found compounded with some other similar tale but the main facts are that a man buries a corpse found on the sea shore from philanthropic motives Later he is met by the ghost of the dead man who in many cases promises him help on condition of receiving in return half of whatever he gets The hero obtains a wife or some other reward and when called upon is ready to fulfil his bargain as to sharing his possessions eighty nine not excepting the wife Some of the characteristics of the tale are to be found in the story of Pelops and Cillas related above which mister Gerould does not mention Pausanias ninety has a story of one of Ulysses crew Ulysses ship was driven about by the winds from one city to another in Sicily and Italy and in the course of these wanderings it touched at Tecmessa Here one of the sailors got drunk and ravished a maiden and was stoned to death in consequence by the indignant people of the town Ulysses did not trouble about what had occurred and sailed away Soon however the ghost of the murdered man became a source of serious annoyance to the people of the place killing the inhabitants of the town regardless of age and sex Finally matters came to such a pass that the town was abandoned But the Pythian priestess bade the people return to Tecmessa and appease the hero by building him a temple and precinct of his own and giving him every year the fairest maiden of the town to wife They took this advice and there was no more trouble from the ghost It chanced however that Euthymus came to Tecmessa just when the people were paying the dead sailor the annual honours Learning how matters stood he asked to be allowed to go into the temple and see the maiden At their meeting he was first touched with pity and then immediately fell desperately in love with her The girl swore to be his if he would save her Euthymus put on his armour and awaited the attack of the monster He had the best of the fight and the ghost driven from its home plunged into the sea The wedding was of course celebrated with great splendour and nothing more was heard of the spirit of the drunken sailor The story is obviously to be classed with that of Ariadne The god fearing AElian seeks to show that Providence watches over a good man and brings his murderers to justice by a story taken from Chrysippus ninety one A traveller put up at an inn in Megara wearing a belt full of gold The innkeeper discovered that he had the money about him and murdered him at night having arranged to carry his body outside the gates in a dung cart But meanwhile the murdered man appeared to a citizen of the town and told him what had happened The man was impressed by the vision Investigations were made and the murderer was caught exactly where the ghost had indicated and was duly punished This is one of the very few stories in which the apparition is seen at or near the moment of death as is the case in the vast majority of the well authenticated cases collected during recent years Aristeas of Proconesus a man of high birth died quite suddenly in a fulling establishment in his native town ninety two The owner locked the building and went to inform his relatives when a man from Cyzicus hearing the news denied it saying that Aristeas had met him on the way thither and talked to him and when the relatives came prepared to remove the body they found no Aristeas either alive or dead Altogether he seems to have been a remarkable person He disappeared for seven years and then appeared in Proconesus and wrote an epic poem called Arimispea which was well known in Herodotus s day Two hundred and forty years later he was seen again this time at Metapontum and bade the citizens build a shrine to Apollo and near it erect a statue to himself as Apollo would come to them alone of the Italian Greeks and he would be seen following in the form of a raven The townsmen were troubled at the apparition and consulted the Delphic oracle which confirmed all that Aristeas had said and Apollo received his temple and Aristeas his statue in the market place Apollonius ninety three tells virtually the same story except that in his version Aristeas was seen giving a lesson in literature by a number of persons in Sicily at the very hour he died in Proconesus He says that Aristeas appeared at intervals for a number of years after his death The elder Pliny ninety four also speaks of Aristeas saying that at Proconesus his soul was seen to leave his body in the form of a raven though he regards the tale as in all probability a fabrication The doctor in Lucian s Philopseudus c twenty six declares that he knew a man who rose from the dead twenty days after he was buried and that he attended him after his resurrection But when asked how it was the body did not decompose or the man die of hunger he has no answer to give Dio Cassius ninety five describes how when Nero wished to cut a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth blood spurted up in front of those who first touched the earth groans and cries were heard and a number of ghosts appeared Not till Nero took a pickaxe and began to work himself to encourage the men was any real progress made Pliny ninety six quotes an interesting account from Hermotimus of Clazomenae of a man whose soul was in the habit of leaving his body and wandering abroad as was proved by the fact that he would often describe events which had happened at a distance and could only be known to an actual eyewitness His body meanwhile lay like that of a man in a trance or half dead One day however some enemies of his took the body while in this state and burnt it thus to use Pliny s phrase leaving the soul no sheath ninety seven to which it could return No one can help being struck by the bald and meagre character of these stories as a whole They possess few of the qualities we expect to find in a good modern ghost story None of them can equal in pathetic beauty many of those to be found in Myers s Human Personality Take for example the story of the lady ninety eight who was waked in the night by the sound of moaning and sobbing as of someone in great distress of mind Finding nothing in her room she went and looked out of the landing window and there on the grass was a very beautiful young girl in a kneeling posture before a soldier in a General s uniform clasping her hands together and entreating for pardon but alas he only waived her away from him The story proved to be true The youngest daughter of the old and distinguished family to which the house had belonged had had an illegitimate child Her parents and relations refused to have anything more to do with her and she died broken hearted The lady who relates the story saw the features so clearly on this occasion that she afterwards recognized the soldier s portrait some six months later when calling at a friend s house and exclaimed Why look There is the General as soon as she noticed it One really beautiful ghost story has however come down to us ninety nine Phlegon of Tralles was a freedman of the Emperor Hadrian His work is not of great merit The following is a favourable specimen of his stories A monstrous child was born in AEtolia after the death of its father Polycrates At a public meeting where it was proposed to do away with it the father suddenly appeared and begged that the child might be given him An attempt was made to seize the father but he snatched up the child tore it to pieces and devoured all but the head When it was proposed to consult the Delphic oracle on the matter the head prophesied to the crowd from where it lay on the ground Then comes the following story The early part is missing but Erwin Rohde in an interesting article one hundred has cleared up all the essential details Proclus s treatises on Plato s Republic are complete only in the Vatican manuscripts Of these Mai only published fragments one hundred one but an English theologian Alexander Morus took notes from the manuscript when it was in Florence and quoted from it in a commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews one hundred two One of the treatises is called Greek pos dei noein eisienai kai exienai psuchen apo somatos The ending in Phlegon one hundred three proves that the story was given in the form of a letter and we learn that the scene was laid at Amphipolis on the Strymon and that the account was sent by Hipparchus in a letter to Arrhidaeus half brother of Alexander the Great the events occurring during the reign of Philip II of Macedon Proclus says that his information is derived from letters some written by Hipparchus others by Arrhidaeus Philinnion was the daughter of Demostratus and Charito She had been married to Craterus Alexander s famous General but had died six months after her marriage As we learn that she was desperately in love with Machates a foreign friend from Pella who had come to see Demostratus the misery of her position may possibly have caused her death But her love conquered death itself and she returned to life again six months after she had died and lived with Machates visiting him for several nights One day an old nurse went to the guest chamber and as the lamp was burning she saw a woman sitting by Machates Scarcely able to contain herself at this extraordinary occurrence she ran to the girl s mother calling Charito Demostratus and bade them get up and go with her to their daughter for by the grace of the gods she had appeared alive and was with the stranger in the guest chamber On hearing this extraordinary story Charito was at first overcome by it and by the nurse s excitement but she soon recovered herself and burst into tears at the mention of her daughter telling the old woman she was out of her senses and ordering her out of the room The nurse was indignant at this treatment and boldly declared that she was not out of her senses but that Charito was unwilling to see her daughter because she was afraid At last Charito consented to go to the door of the guest chamber but as it was now quite two hours since she had heard the news she arrived too late and found them both asleep The mother bent over the woman s figure and thought she recognized her daughter s features and clothes Not feeling sure as it was dark she decided to keep quiet for the present meaning to get up early and catch the woman If she failed she would ask Machates for a full explanation as he would never tell her a lie in a case so important So she left the room without saying anything But early on the following morning either because the gods so willed it or because she was moved by some divine impulse the woman went away without being observed When she came to him Charito was angry with the young man in consequence and clung to his knees and conjured him to speak the truth and hide nothing from her At first he was greatly distressed and could hardly be brought to admit that the girl s name was Philinnion Then he described her first coming and the violence of her passion and told how she had said that she was there without her parents knowledge The better to establish the truth of his story he opened a coffer and took out the things she had left behind her a ring of gold which she had given him and a belt which she had left on the previous night When Charito beheld all these convincing proofs she uttered a piercing cry and rent her clothes and her cloak and tore her coif from her head and began to mourn for her daughter afresh in the midst of her friends Machates was deeply distressed on seeing what had happened and how they were all mourning as if for her second funeral He begged them to be comforted and promised them that they should see her if she appeared Charito yielded but bade him be careful how he fulfilled his promise When night fell and the hour drew near at which Philinnion usually appeared they were on the watch for her She came as was her custom and sat down upon the bed Machates made no pretence for he was genuinely anxious to sift the matter to the bottom and secretly sent some slaves to call her parents He himself could hardly believe that the woman who came to him so regularly at the same hour was really dead and when she ate and drank with him he began to suspect what had been suggested to him namely that some grave robbers had violated the tomb and sold the clothes and the gold ornaments to her father Demostratus and Charito hastened to come at once and when they saw her they were at first speechless with amazement Then with cries of joy they threw themselves upon their daughter But Philinnion remained cold Father and mother she said cruel indeed have ye been in that ye grudged my living with the stranger for three days in my father s house for it brought harm to no one But ye shall pay for your meddling with sorrow I must return to the place appointed for me though I came not hither without the will of Heaven With these words she fell down dead and her body lay stretched upon the bed Her parents threw themselves upon her and the house was filled with confusion and sorrow for the blow was heavy indeed but the event was strange and soon became known throughout the town and finally reached my ears During the night I kept back the crowds that gathered round the house taking care that there should be no disturbance as the news spread At early dawn the theatre was full After a long discussion it was decided that we should go and open the tomb to see whether the body was still on the bier or whether we should find the place empty for the woman had hardly been dead six months When we opened the vault where all her family was buried the bodies were seen lying on the other biers but on the one where Philinnion had been placed we found only the iron ring which had belonged to her lover and the gilt drinking cup Machates had given her on the first day In utter amazement we went straight to Demostratus s house to see whether the body was still there We beheld it lying on the ground and then went in a large crowd to the place of assembly for the whole event was of great importance and absolutely past belief Great was the confusion and no one could tell what to do when Hyllus who is not only considered the best diviner among us but is also a great authority on the interpretation of the flight of birds and is generally well versed in his art got up and said that the woman must be buried outside the boundaries of the city for it was unlawful that she should be laid to rest within them and that Hermes Chthonius and the Eumenides should be propitiated and that all pollution would thus be removed He ordered the temples to be re consecrated and the usual rites to be performed in honour of the gods below As for the King in this affair he privately told me to sacrifice to Hermes and to Zeus Xenius and to Ares and to perform these duties with the utmost care We have done as he suggested The stranger Machates who was visited by the ghost has committed suicide in despair Now if you think it right that I should give the King an account of all this let me know and I will send some of those who gave me the various details The story is particularly interesting as the source of Goethe s Braut von Korinth In Goethe s poem the girl is a Christian while her lover is a pagan Their parents are friends and they have been betrothed in their youth He comes to stay with her parents knowing nothing of her death when she appears to him As in the Greek story her body is material though cold and bloodless and he thinks her still alive He takes her in his arms and kisses her back to life and love breathing his own passion into her Then the mother surprises them and the daughter upbraids her for her cruelty but begs that she and her lover may be buried together as he must pay for the life he has given her with his own FOOTNOTES Footnote seventy nine Philops twenty seven Footnote eighty Herod v ninety two Footnote eighty one Human Personality ii three hundred forty eight Footnote eighty two Ep v five

3618-178097-0000	train-other-500	As we should expect there are a number of instances of warning apparitions in antiquity and it is interesting to note that the majority of these are gigantic women endowed with a gift of prophecy
none	none	 Thus the younger Pliny one hundred four tells us how Quintus Curtius Rufus 
3618-178097-0001	train-other-500	who was on the staff of the Governor of Africa was walking one day in a colonnade after sunset when a gigantic woman appeared before him She announced that she was Africa and was able to predict the future and told him that he would go to Rome
3618-178097-0002	train-other-500	hold office there return to the province with the highest authority and there die Her prophecy was fulfilled to the letter
none	none	 and as he landed in Africa for the last time 
3618-178097-0003	train-other-500	the same figure is reported to have met him So again at the time of the conspiracy of Callippus Dion was meditating one evening before the porch of his house when he turned round and saw a gigantic female figure in the form of a Fury
none	none	 at the end of the corridor sweeping the floor with a broom The vision terrified him and soon afterwards his only son committed suicide and he himself was murdered by the conspirators one hundred five A similar dramatic story is related of Drusus during his German campaigns one hundred six While engaged in operations against the Alemanni he was preparing to cross the Elbe when a gigantic woman barred the way exclaiming 
3618-178097-0004	train-other-500	Insatiate Drusus whither wilt thou go Thou art not fated to see all things Depart hence for the end of thy life and of thy deeds is at hand Drusus was much troubled by this warning and
3618-178097-0005	train-other-500	instantly obeyed the words of the apparition but he died before reaching the Rhine We meet with the same phenomenon again in Dio Cassius among the prodigies preceding the death of Macrinus when
3618-178097-0006	train-other-500	a dreadful gigantic woman seen of several declared that all that had happened was as nothing compared with what they were soon to endure a prophecy which was amply fulfilled by the reign of Heliogabalus
3618-178097-0007	train-other-500	But the most gigantic of all these gigantic women was as we should only expect from his marvellous power of seeing ghosts
none	none	 the one who appeared to Eucrates in the Philopseudus one hundred seven Eucrates has seen over a thousand ghosts in his time and is now quite used to them 
3618-178097-0008	train-other-500	though at first he found them rather upsetting but he had been given a ring and a charm by an Arab which enabled him to deal with anything supernatural that came in his way The ring was made from the iron of a cross on which a criminal had been executed
none	none	 and doubtless had the same value in Eucrates eyes that a piece of the rope 
3618-178097-0009	train-other-500	with which a man has been hung possesses in the eyes of a gambler to day On this particular occasion he had left his men at work in the vineyard and was resting quietly at midday when his dog began to bark
3618-178097-0010	train-other-500	At first he thought it was only a favourite boy of his indulging in a little hunting with some friends but on looking up he saw in front of him a woman at least three hundred feet high with a sword thirty feet long
3618-178097-0011	train-other-500	Her lower extremities were like those of a dragon and snakes were coiling round her neck and shoulders
none	none	 Eucrates was not in the least alarmed but turned the seal of his ring 
3618-178097-0012	train-other-500	when a vast chasm opened in the earth into which she disappeared This seems rather to have astonished Eucrates but he plucked up courage caught hold of a tree that stood near the edge and looked over
none	none	 when he saw all the lower world lying spread before him 
3618-178097-0013	train-other-500	including the mead of asphodel where the shades of the blessed were reclining at ease with their friends and relations arranged according to clans and tribes Among these he recognized his own father dressed in the clothes in which he was buried
3618-178097-0014	train-other-500	and it must have been comforting to the son to have such good evidence that his parent was safely installed in the Elysian Fields In a few moments the chasm closed
none	none	 Dio Cassius one hundred eight relates how Trajan was saved in the great earthquake that destroyed 
3618-178097-0015	train-other-500	nearly the whole of Antioch by a phantom which appeared to him suddenly and warned him to leave his house by the window
none	none	 A similar story is told of the poet Simonides 
3618-178097-0016	train-other-500	who was warned by a spectre that his house was going to fall and thus enabled to make his escape in time I will include here a couple of stories which if they cannot exactly be classed as stories of warning apparitions are interesting in themselves
3618-178097-0017	train-other-500	and may at least be considered as ghost stories
none	none	 Pliny the Younger one hundred nine tells us how a slave of his named Marcus 
3618-178097-0018	train-other-500	imagined that he saw someone cutting his hair during the night When he awoke
none	none	 the vision proved to have been a true one 
3618-178097-0019	train-other-500	for his hair lay all round him Soon afterwards the same thing happened again His brother who slept with him saw nothing but Marcus declared that two people came in by the windows dressed in white and after cutting his hair disappeared
3618-178097-0020	train-other-500	Nothing astonishing happened adds Pliny except that I was not prosecuted as I undoubtedly should have been had Domitian lived for this happened during his principate Perhaps the cutting of my slave s hair was a sign of my approaching doom
3618-178097-0021	train-other-500	for accused people cut their hair as a sign of mourning One may be allowed to wonder whether after all a fondness for practical joking is not even older than the age of the younger Pliny
3618-178097-0022	train-other-500	This story like nearly every other that we have come across has a parallel in the Philopseudus Indeed Lucian seems to have covered almost the whole field of the marvellous as understood at that time in his determination to turn it into ridicule in that amusing dialogue
none	none	 In this case we are told of a little statue of AEsculapius which stood in the house of the narrator of the story and at the feet of which a number of pence had been placed as offerings while other coins some of them silver were fastened to the thighs with wax 
3618-178097-0024	train-other-500	There were also silver plates which had been vowed or offered by those who had been cured of fever by the god The offerings and tablets are just such as might be found in a Catholic church in the South of Europe to day but the coins in our more practical modern world
none	none	 would have found their way into the coffers of the church One would like to know what was the ultimate destination of these particular coins whether they were to be sent as contributions to one of the temples of AEsculapius which were the centre of the medical world at this period 
3618-178097-0026	train-other-500	and had elaborate hospitals attached to them about which we learn so much from Aristides In this case they were merely a source of temptation to an unfortunate Libyan groom who stole them one night intending to make his escape
3618-178097-0027	train-other-500	But he had not studied the habits of the statue which we are told habitually got down from its pedestal every night and in this case such was the power of the god that he kept the man wandering about all night unable to leave the court
none	none	 where he was found with the money in the morning and soundly flogged 
3618-178097-0028	train-other-500	The god however considered that he had been let off much too easily and he was mysteriously flogged every night as the weals upon him showed till he ultimately died of the punishment
none	none	 AElian one hundred ten has a charming story of Philemon the comic poet 
3618-178097-0029	train-other-500	He was still apparently in the full vigour of his powers when he had a vision of nine maidens
none	none	 leaving his house in the Piraeus 
3618-178097-0030	train-other-500	and bidding him farewell When he awoke
none	none	 he told his slave the story and set to work to finish a play 
3618-178097-0031	train-other-500	with which he was then busy After completing it to his satisfaction
none	none	 he wrapped himself in his cloak and lay down upon his bed His slave came in and thinking he was asleep went to wake him when he found that he was dead AElian challenges the unbelieving Epicureans to deny that the nine maidens were the nine Muses leaving a house which was so soon to be polluted by death 
3618-178097-0033	train-other-500	Many stories naturally gather round the great struggle for the final mastery of the Roman world which ended in the overthrow of the Republic Shakespeare has made us familiar with the fate of the poet Cinna
3618-178097-0034	train-other-500	who was actually mistaken for one of the conspirators against Caesar and murdered by the crowd He dreamt on the night before he met his death that Caesar invited him to supper and when he refused the invitation took him by the hand
3618-178097-0035	train-other-500	and forced him down into a deep dark abyss which he entered with the utmost horror But there is a story connected with the crossing of the Rubicon by Caesar
none	none	 that certainly deserves to be better known than it is one hundred eleven It is only fitting that an event 
3618-178097-0036	train-other-500	fraught with such momentous consequences should have a supernatural setting of some kind and Suetonius relates that while Caesar was still hesitating whether he should declare himself an enemy of his country by
3618-178097-0037	train-other-500	crossing the little river that bounded his province at the head of an army a man of heroic size and beauty suddenly appeared playing upon a reed pipe Some of the troops several trumpeters among them ran up to listen
3618-178097-0038	train-other-500	when the man seized a trumpet blew a loud blast upon it and began to cross the Rubicon
none	none	 Caesar at once decided to advance 
3618-178097-0039	train-other-500	and the men followed him with redoubled enthusiasm after what they had just seen It is to Plutarch that we owe the famous story of the apparition that visited Brutus in his tent
none	none	 the night before the battle of Philippi 
3618-178097-0040	train-other-500	and again during the battle Shakespeare represents it to be Caesar s ghost but has otherwise strictly followed Plutarch
none	none	 It would be absurd to give the scene in any other words than Shakespeare s one hundred twelve BRUTUS 
3618-178097-0041	train-other-500	How ill this taper burns Ha who comes here
none	none	 I think it is the weakness of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous apparition It comes upon me Art thou any thing Art thou some god some angel or some devil That mak saint my blood cold and my hair to stare Speak to me what thou art GHOST Thy evil spirit Brutus 
3618-178097-0043	train-other-500	BRUTUS Why
none	none	 com saint thou GHOST To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi 
3618-178097-0042	train-other-500	BRUTUS Well then I shall see thee again GHOST Ay
none	none	 at Philippi BRUTUS Why I will see thee at Philippi then 
3618-178097-0044	train-other-500	Now I have taken heart thou vanishest Ill spirit
none	none	 I would hold more talk with thee But it had already disappeared only to meet Brutus again on the fatal day that followed FOOTNOTES Footnote one hundred four Ep vii twenty seven Footnote one
