none	none	xxiv forty four Although we speak of the Bible as one Book because it tells one world wide story yet this one Book is made up of many books of a whole library of books in fact Illustration BROKEN BITS OF CLAY BOOKS IN THE CUNEIFORM LANGUAGE BELONGING TO THE TIME WHEN MOSES WROTE THE FIRST WORDS OF GENESIS Go into a library look at the well stocked shelves Here is a volume of history here a book of beautiful poetry here a life of a great and noble warrior This book was written only last year this one appeared many years before you were born Just so is it with the books of the Bible For more than a thousand years God was calling the best and wisest men of the Jewish nation to write for His Book Some of the authors were rich and learned many were humble and poor Kings wrote for it a shepherd boy a captive lad who had been carried away as a slave into a strange land a great leader a humble fruit gatherer a hated tax collector a tent maker many poor fishermen God found work for them all There are sixty six books in the Bible written by at least forty different authors Books on history collections of sacred songs lives of good men and women stirring appeals to the sinful God chose the men best fitted to write each part He called them to His work He spoke to their hearts He put His Spirit into their minds In these days those who read God s Word often forget what old old writings the first books in the Bible are and how everything has changed since they were written Seeing the words so clearly printed on fine white paper readers do not stop to think that they have come down to us from the days when the greatest nations in the world wrote their best books on lumps of clay or on rough brittle paper made from brown reeds So these Bible readers grow impatient and because they cannot understand everything all at once some are even foolish enough to give up reading the Old Testament altogether But the things that are hard to understand are only hard because we are still so ignorant Whenever any new discovery about the ancient times has been made it has always shown us how exactly true the Bible is Some years ago just at the time when the doubts and carpings were at their worst when those people who did not trust God even declared that many of the cities and kings mentioned in the Old Testament had never existed at all a wonderful thing happened God allowed the old cities themselves to be brought to light once more Deep under the earth they were found with their beautiful palaces libraries full of books and long picture galleries lined from end to end with stone and marble slabs on which were cut portraits of the very kings whose existence the people were beginning to doubt This is how it happened The Bible does not describe things as they really were said some people In Old Testament times for instance the nations were very rough and ignorant as for Moses who is supposed to have written the first books of the Bible it is most doubtful whether he ever learned to read and write at all But Moses was brought up in Egypt and the Egyptians were very learned the Bible says so answered others The man who wrote those words in the Bible may have made a mistake It is true that the ruins of old Egyptian temples and palaces are covered with strange figures and signs but who can say now whether they mean anything or not Those who trusted in God s Word could not answer these questions but just at this time God allowed the first great discovery to be made for the moment had at last come when all thoughtful men and women needed to be able to settle these questions for themselves In the year seventeen ninety nine a French officer who was in Egypt with Napoleon s army discovered the Rosetta Stone You may see this stone in the British Museum It is a great block of black marble On the smooth side cut deeply in the stone are a number of lines of ancient writing Many stones covered with ancient writing had been found before but this one is different from all the rest The lines at the top of the stone are in the strange old Egyptian picture writing which learned men have agreed to call Hieroglyphic that is writing in pictures This was a very special kind of writing in ancient Egypt and generally kept for important occasions The lines in the middle give the same words but in the ordinary handwriting used for correspondence in ancient Egypt and last of all is found a translation of the Egyptian words written in ancient Greek This old kind of Greek is not spoken in daily life by any people to day but many learned men can read and write it with ease so that you see by the help of the Greek translation the Rosetta Stone became a key for discovering the meaning of both kinds of ancient Egyptian letters Thus by the help of the Rosetta Stone and after years of patient labour the long dead language could be read once more Egypt the land into which Joseph was sold where the Israelites became a nation and Moses was born and educated How great a joy to read the words carved on temple walls or in palace halls and to find with each word read how exactly the Egypt of ancient days is described in the Bible The dress the people wore the food they ate the way they spoke to their kings the description of their funerals the very name of their famous river and the words they used to describe the plants insects and cattle of Egypt all these are found in the Bible and are proofs of the care with which Moses wrote of the land of his birth But other nations besides the Egyptians are mentioned in the Bible and about them also grave doubts arose Almost all the Old Testament prophets cried out against the wickedness of Assyria and Babylon and foretold the awful punishment which God would bring upon them for their pride and cruelty unless they repented They did not repent destruction came upon them their very names were forgotten and their cities as utterly lost to the world as though they had never existed Nineveh Babylon There were such cities once perhaps but as for the kings of whom the Bible speaks Sennacherib who came up against Jerusalem and was driven back through the prayers of God s servants Isaiah and King Hezekiah two Kings xviii nineteen Nebuchadnezzar who carried Daniel away into Babylon Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia Esther well if they ever lived at all they were certainly not the kind of kings spoken of in the Old Testament But it all happened so long ago that we cannot expect to understand much about it now Illustration EGYPTIAN SCRIBES AT WORK A CASES FOR HOLDING WRITING MATERIALS NOTICE SPARE PEN PLACED BEHIND THE CLERK S EAR So the questioners settled the matter in their own minds but God had the answer to their questions all ready for them He put into the hearts of some brave men the idea of going out to the desolate plains empty and void and waste Nahum ii ten the plains that had once been the rich empires of Assyria and Babylon and there to search patiently for some trace of the splendid cities of old Very wonderful is the story of how these searchers found them Nineveh had been lying buried under huge mounds of rubbish for more than two thousand years Now just at the time when her testimony was needed the ruined halls of her majestic palaces were once more brought to the light of day What had been the names of these grim kings of old whose stern faced figures were sculptured on the walls Could any among them be the fierce Assyrian kings mentioned in the Bible If only the strange wedge shaped letters that covered every vacant space on the stone slabs could be read what a message from the past they would reveal Once again clever men set to work and persevered until the strange letters were deciphered and the palace walls gave up their secrets Here was King Sennacherib here Tiglath pileser two Kings xv twenty nine here Esarhaddon two Kings xix thirty

none	none	Oh how wonderful to look at the old time portraits which had been drawn from the men themselves Well although the Egyptians and Assyrians prove to have been great nations in the time of Moses they had no communication with each other except in war time they spoke different languages wrote in altogether different styles and had very different ideas about everything Nations kept to themselves in those days What the Bible says of their intercourse must be wrong This all the clever people were quite sure about but once again God showed them their mistake Twenty five years ago an Egyptian peasant woman was walking among the ruins of an ancient Egyptian city a city built before the time of Moses Bright yellow sand had drifted over the broken columns and painted pavements of what had once been the palace of a great king But the peasant woman did not care for that Was there anything hidden in the sand that she could sell This was all her thought Suddenly her foot struck against something hard in the sand She looked down Could it be a stone No it was not a stone but a queer oblong lump or tablet of clay hardened into a brick and covered with strange marks that looked like writing She wondered at it for with all her findings in the ruins she had never come upon anything like this before She showed the tablet to her friends and they dug down deep in the sand and found whole sackfuls of baked clay tablets But when the dealer in curiosities saw the lumps of baked clay he shook his head and would give very little money for them After a while some of the bricks were taken to Paris and London These tablets could not have been found in Egypt decided the learned professors they are either imitations or they were found somewhere else These are clay letters and must have been written in Assyria or Babylonia No Egyptian could have understood a word of them Yet the tablets had been found in Egypt and had been read by the king of Egypt s scribes for the peasant woman had all unknowingly discovered what remained of the Foreign Office belonging to the old Egyptian nation and thus we see that the Egyptians of Moses time could read and write foreign languages as easily as we can to day read and write French or German CHAPTER II THE SECRET OF ITS GREATNESS Illustration drop cap G The Great Pyramid God always chooses the right kind of people to do His work Not only so He always gives to those whom He chooses just the sort of life which will best prepare them for the work He will one day call them to do That is why God put it into the heart of Pharaoh s daughter to bring up Moses as her own son in the Egyptian palace The most important part of Moses training was that his heart should be right with God and therefore he was allowed to remain with his Hebrew parents during his early years There he learned to love and serve the one true God Without that knowledge no education can make a man or woman fit to be a blessing to the world But after this God gave him another training The man who should be called to write the first words of God s Book would need a very special education Most likely some of the Children of Israel could read and write for we know there were plenty of books and good schools in Moses time but they certainly did not make such good scholars as the Egyptians And the child grew and she his mother brought him unto Pharaoh s daughter and he became her son Exodus ii ten In those few words the Bible shows us the Egyptian side of Moses education And a very thorough education it must have been for the Egyptians were the most highly cultured people in the world in those days and we know that Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians Acts vii twenty two The Egypt of Moses time was very different from the Egypt of to day Among all the great nations it held the first place for the people of Egypt were more clever and rich their gardens more beautiful their cornfields and orchards more fruitful than those of the dwellers in any other land Again of all the peoples in the world the Egyptians were looked upon at that time as the most religious From one end to another the land was full of temples many of them so huge in size and so magnificent with carvings and paintings that even their poor ruins the great columns shattered or fallen the enormous walls tottering and broken are still the wonder of the world Every great city had its schools and colleges Clever men devoted their whole lives to teaching in these colleges and to writing learned books just as they do in the cities of Europe and America to day These men were called scribes that is writers Moses a boy brought up in the royal palace would have the best and most learned scribes for his teachers A fragment of an old Egyptian book describing the duties of a lad in the scribes school has been found It tells how the schoolmaster wakes the boys very early in the morning The books are already in the hands of thy companions he cries put on thy garments call for thy sandals If the lad does not make haste he is severely punished if he is not attentive in school the master speaks to him very seriously indeed Let thy mouth read the book in thy hand and take advice from those who know more than thou dost He has to write many copies and as he gets he learns to compose business letters to his master before he is fourteen he is most likely a clerk in a government office and must continue his studies at the same time The letters and copies of a schoolboy who lived three thousand years ago have been discovered How many bad marks did his teacher give him do you think when he had to correct that carelessly written capital Illustration Schoolboy s copy from ancient Egypt Notice the teacher s corrections So great a respect had the Egyptians for writing that they used to say The great god Thoth invented letters no human being could have given anything so wonderful and useful to the world Arithmetic geometry astronomy drawing an Egyptian lad was supposed to study all these and as we have seen those lads who were trained for work in the Foreign Office had to learn other languages as well they had also to read and write cuneiform the name given to the strange wedge shaped letters of Assyria and Babylonia All the letters from the people of Canaan to the Egyptian king and his Foreign Office were written in cuneiform Chinese is supposed to be the most difficult language to learn in our day but the ancient cuneiform was certainly quite as complicated as Chinese The cuneiform had no real alphabet only signs There were five hundred simple signs and nearly as many compound signs so that the student had to begin with a thousand different signs to memorize Yes boys had their troubles even in those days Now as Moses grew older and learned more he must often have felt very thoughtful and sad So many books so many ideas so many stories of cruel gods and evil spirits where was the truth to be found No one seemed to remember the One True God the God of his fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob Very likely a Babylonian book written in cuneiform and pretending to describe the Creation of the world and the story of the Ark and the great Flood found its way into Egypt Many copies of this book existed in Moses day part of a later copy was found a short time ago in the ruins of the library of a great Assyrian king and is now to be seen in the British Museum A strange book it is The words were not written remember but pricked down on a large flat tablet of clay If Moses read such a book as this it must have troubled and puzzled him very much For it is a heathen book in which the beautiful clear story of the Creation of the world is all darkened and spoilt The Babylonian who wrote the book and the Assyrians who copied it were all descended from Noah and therefore some dim remembrance of God s dealings with the world still lingered in their hearts but as the time passed they had grown farther from the truth That is why the oldest copies of these books are always the best the heathen had not had time to separate themselves so completely from God In the old old days they said there were not so many gods as there are now and some of the most learned heathen even believed that in the beginning there was but one God Afterwards many others sprang up they declared In the beginning God created the Heaven and the earth Genesis i one Oh how far the nations had wandered already from the greatest deepest truth which the world can know How sad to think that horrible nightmare stories of evil spirits and cruel gods should have come between men s souls and the loving Father and Creator of all Yes it was time indeed that the first words of the Bible should be written and that a stream of pure truth should begin to flow through the world But Moses had much to do for God before he could write one word of his part of the Bible We know how his life of learning and splendour came to a sudden end he fled from Egypt and became a shepherd in the land of Midian and there in Midian God called him to the great work of leading the Children of Israel out of Egypt towards the Promised Land Terrible troubles had come upon God s people in the land of Goshen one For the most selfish and cruel Pharaoh who ever reigned over Egypt had determined to treat the people who had come to live in Egypt at the invitation of a former Pharaoh just as though they were captives taken in battle Many of the old ruins in Egypt are covered with writings describing his cruelties He killed all who rebelled against him and condemned whole nations to wear out their lives by working for him in the gold mines or granite quarries or by making endless stores of bricks he cared for no man s life if only he could be called the richest king in the world And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities Pithom and Raamses Exodus i

none	none	that is store cities In Egypt many store cities were needed because corn was more plentiful there than in any other country Pithom where was Pithom So people were asking a few years ago and because there was no answer to that question they began to doubt Had there ever been such a city But in the year eighteen eighty four the earth gave up another of its secrets the ruins of Pithom were found buried deep in the dust and the remains of great store houses built of rough bricks mixed with chopped straw Exodus v and stamped with the name of the cruel Pharaoh Ramesis the Second were laid bare once more two What a pity some readers had not waited a little longer before doubting the truth of the Bible And the Lord said unto Moses Write thou these words Exodus xxxiv twenty seven So it was at last that God called Moses to begin the great work of writing the Bible just as He had called him to lead the people out of Egypt just as by His Spirit He calls men and women to do His work to day How did Moses write the first words of the Bible What kind of letters and what language did he use These are great questions We know at least that he could have his choice between two or three different kinds of letters and materials Perhaps he wrote the first words of the Bible on rolls of papyrus paper with a soft reed pen in the manner of the Egyptian scribes Hundreds of these rolls have been found in Egypt poems histories novels hymns to the Egyptian gods and some of these writings are at least as old as the time of Moses The Egyptian climate is so fine and dry and the Egyptians stored the rolls so carefully in the tombs of their kings that the fragile papyrus that is reed paper has not rotted away as would have been the case in any other country Certainly in after years the Jews used the same shaped books as the Egyptians Indeed the Jews Bible that is the Old Testament was still called a roll of a book in the days of Jeremiah Jeremiah xxxvi two Or perhaps Moses wrote on tablets of clay like those used by the great empires of Babylon and Assyria and by the people of Canaan Clay was cheap enough all one had to do was to mould moist clay into a smooth tablet and then to prick words on it with a metal pen The prophet Jeremiah mentions this kind of book also Jeremiah xvii one Most likely however Moses wrote on parchment made from the skins of sheep and goats The Children of Israel kept large flocks and could supply him with as many skins as he wanted And in what language did he write Perhaps even the very first words were written in Hebrew we know that in later times the prophets and historians of the Jews wrote in Hebrew But we must remember that languages alter as years pass on The Hebrew of Moses time could only have been an ancient kind of Hebrew very different from the Hebrew of to day Does this surprise you Why you and I could hardly read one word of the English written in England even a thousand years ago About the middle of the last century a German missionary found a large carved stone in that part of Palestine which used to be called Moab This wonderful stone which is black and shaped something like a tombstone is covered with writing It is called The Moabite Stone and was set up by Mesha king of Moab two Kings iii four The writing on it is neither Egyptian nor cuneiform but a very ancient kind of Hebrew Illustration First words of Kin Mesha s writing on the Moabite Stone Moses most likely used letters like these Of course this does not take us back actually to the days of Moses but still it is so old that Moses may well have used the same kind of writing We have seen that most nations in those old times had their books and we know that each nation had always one book that it valued more than the rest This was the book that told the people about their religion and the gods in whom they believed In most of these books some grains of truth were found All the nations of the world are but one great family you know and even the most ignorant people were not without some knowledge The heathen nations of Moses time therefore remembered dimly some of God s dealings with the world they were so blinded by their heathen worship that no atom of fresh light could reach them and little by little they drifted further into the darkness But though tiny fragments of truth are to be found in their books not one word is to be traced in any book of the most precious truth of all until God revealed it to His servant Moses This makes our Bible so wonderful and different from all other books it is a revelation that is something which comes to us from God and which we could never have known without His help From first to last the Bible is written to teach us about Christ Throughout the whole of the Old Testament Christ is referred to as the coming Saviour or Messiah which you know is the Hebrew word for Christ Christ is to bruise the serpent s head Genesis iii fifteen In Him all the nations of the earth are to be blessed Genesis xxii eighteen He is the Star that shall come out of Jacob Numbers xxiv seventeen When the Lamb of the Passover was killed and the people taught they could only escape from death through the sprinkled blood this was a type or picture of Salvation through the Blood of Jesus When at last the Saviour came the Jews rejected Him and would not accept Him as the Messiah Then He said to them Had ye believed Moses ye would have believed Me for he wrote of Me John v forty six one The Egyptians spelt Goshen Kosem An old writing says The country is not cultivated but left as a pasture for cattle because of the stranger two Some of these bricks are in the British Museum CHAPTER III MOSES AND HIS WRITINGS Illustration drop cap W Clay letter tablet of Moses time We now begin to understand a little of the very beginning of God s Book of the times in which it was written the materials used by its first author and the different kinds of writing from which he had to choose but we must go a step farther How much did Moses know about the history of his forefathers Abraham and Jacob and of all the old nations and kings mentioned in Genesis before God called him to the great work of writing his part of the Bible We believe that he knew a great deal about them all Most thoughtful young people like to read right through their Bibles and perhaps you have been perplexed to find that many parts of the Old Testament are both puzzling and dry Of what use then can these chapters be you have perhaps asked yourself Is it not all God s Book But you must not let this trouble you Every passage every verse has its special place and object Not a line of God s Book could be taken away without serious loss to the whole What all those long lists of the queer names of people we never hear of again asks some one Why I dread those chapters I once had to read Genesis x aloud and I shall never forget it Those who feel like this will be surprised to know that many of the most learned men of our own days are giving much time and thought to the careful and patient study of this very list of names and the more carefully they study it the fuller and wider does the subject become Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh in the land of Shinar Genesis x ten The ruins of all these great cities and kingdoms have now been found They were old before Moses was born indeed they were so old that their names were only to be found in ancient books even the very language spoken by some of these nations had been forgotten by all save the learned scribes of Babylonia and Assyria And yet we find these names accurately given in Genesis had they been missing from its pages the Bible would give us no true idea of the beginnings of history Remember this when next you are tempted to feel impatient at the awkward syllables Again in Genesis xiv we read the names of the kings who governed nine nations in the time of Abraham and of how they fought together four kings with five verse nine three hundred years before Moses was born Until a very few years ago the Bible was the only Book that told us about these ancient kings and kingdoms And people said The man who wrote that chapter did not really know anything he just collected a pack of old stories that had been repeated over and over again with so many exaggerations and alterations that at last there was scarcely a word of truth left in them Since this foolish conclusion was arrived at many new discoveries have been made the broken fragments of old tablets have been pieced together and read and the names of all the nine kings brought to light once more Certain it is that Moses with the help of the writings which we now know must have existed in his time would have but little difficulty in writing those parts of Genesis which tell us the history of some of the most ancient nations of the world For when God gives a man some work to do He always helps him to do it To those who really trust Him and have patience to work on the help they need always comes the difficult path is made smooth This has been the experience of God s servants in all times Illustration PORTRAIT AND WRITING OF AMRAPHEL KING OF SHINAR IN ABRAHAM S TIME Many letters and books belonging to the reign of Amraphel one king of Shinar Genesis xiv one have lately been found He was one of the wisest heathen kings who ever lived and the writings of his times are very interesting because they bring us quite back to the days of Abraham Amraphel kept written records describing the splendid temples he built and a great embankment which he made to keep the river Tigris from flooding his people s cornfields but the wisest thing he did was to collect and write out a long list of all the laws by which he governed the land of Shinar Thus he worked in very much the same kind of way for Shinar that our own King Alfred did thousands of years later for England This list of laws was found in nineteen oh one They are engraved on a great block of black marble and are so numerous that they would fill pages of our Bible They are wise and just as far as they go There is a great deal about buying and selling in them and the lawful way of conducting different kinds of business but they are wholly different from those wonderful Commandments which God gave to the Children of Israel three hundred years later For Shinar s laws were the heathen laws of a heathen king in them there is no word of God no word even of the heathen gods in which Amraphel believed Thou shalt love the Lord thy God and thy neighbour as thyself Luke x twenty seven In these words Jesus Christ gives to us the true meaning of the Commandments which Moses wrote down in our Bible Again until quite lately many people were certain that there could never have been a king like Melchizedek the king of Salem who came and blessed Abraham and of whom we read in Genesis xiv and also in Hebrews vii But among the letters found in the Foreign Office of the king of Egypt is one from the king of Salem Not from Melchizedek but from another king of Salem who describes himself in these words I was set in my place neither by father nor mother but by the Mighty King meaning by God Read what is said about Melchizedek in Hebrews vii These words show us that all the kings of Salem believed that they owed everything to God This is why Abraham honoured Melchizedek so highly Salem that is peace Jeru salem means city of peace So as we see from these ancient letters Jerusalem was called the city of peace even in the days of Abraham All these old records and many more Moses must surely have seen the cities of Canaan were as full of books as were those of Egypt and Babylonia for the name Kirjath sepher Joshua xv fifteen means City of Books Thus as year by year new discoveries are made we realize more clearly the kind of preparation which Moses had for his great work and the sources from which he gathered much of his information Yet no single word of the Bible is copied from the heathen writings No just as a man who decides to give his whole life to God to day uses in the Lord s service the knowledge he gained before he was converted so after God called Moses to his great work all the learning and wide knowledge he had gathered during his life were dedicated to the service of God and used by His Holy Spirit We do not know we are nowhere told whether Moses wrote every word of the Books of the Law The Jews believed that every letter every tiniest dot was his It may well have been so as we have seen But again he may very likely have had helpers and editors that is people who arranged and copied his original writings But the Children of Israel always called the first five books of the Bible The Torah that is The Law and they looked upon these as their most precious possession something quite above and apart from every other writing Jehovah s direct words and commandments to His people At last the life work of Moses was done and Joshua took his place called by God to lead the people forward But the new leader found himself at once in a very different position When Moses brought the Children of Israel out of Egypt they were without a Bible But in Joshua s days the light had begun to shine the river of the knowledge of God to flow and God was able therefore to say to His servant Joshua This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success Joshua i eight We are not told who was called by God to write the Book of Joshua we think that Joshua wrote at least a part of it himself but we all know that it describes how the Israelites came at last into the Promised Land and drove out the wicked idol worshippers Buried deep in the earth the remains of many old Canaanite cities have been found Those of Lachish the great Amorite city are specially interesting We know how the Children of Israel dreaded the Amorite cities Great and walled up to Heaven Deuteronomy i twenty eight as the people said Yet in spite of their great strength Joshua took them one by one overthrew them and afterwards built the Jewish towns upon their ruins This was the custom of conquerors with all these ancient cities as the excavators find to day Now in the remains of Lachish we can see its whole history Three distinct cities have been found one below the other Deepest down of all full sixty feet underground are the enormous walls of the Amorite city great masses of rough brick forming huge walls at least twenty eight feet wide No wonder the Children of Israel felt doubtful of victory Above the Amorite walls are the scattered fragments of rough mud huts and cattle shelters The Israelites had no time to build anything better until Canaan was conquered Above these again stand the ruined walls of a later Jewish city Lachish as it was in the days of Solomon and the Jewish kings A fair city it must have been built of white stone the capitals of some of the columns carved to resemble a ram s horn perhaps to remind the people of the horns of the altar in the Tabernacle But the walls of the Jewish Lachish have none of the massive strength of the ancient Amorite city Had we space we might pause over many of the other ancient Canaanitish cities for the subject is of absorbing interest but perhaps we may return to it in a later volume Joshua like all God s true servants past and present made full use of the precious Book and There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers Joshua viii thirty five Before he died he spoke to the people very sorrowfully about their sins Many of them in spite of God s commandments and His favour and love had begun to serve the false gods of Canaan The people repented at the old leader s earnest words and they cried The Lord our God will we serve and His voice will we obey Joshua xxiv twenty four Joshua made them promise to be steadfast And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God Verse twenty six From this we see that Joshua wrote a part at least of the Book that is called by his name People have often thought it strange that the Children of Israel should again and again break God s clear command Thou shall have no other gods before Me Exodus xx three How could they have been so foolish as to care for false gods when the living God had done so much for them It is the old story A man who has once given way to drunkenness is not safe unless he puts strong drink out of his life for ever If he even touches it he is liable to fall back again into its power So it was with the Children of Israel The worship of false gods had been the terrible sin of their wilderness wanderings and now to serve the gods of Canaan became their strongest temptation The temples were so strange so beautiful the gods themselves so mysterious and then all was so easy so pleasant No stern self denial was needed there were no difficult laws to keep no holiness was asked for Drinking feasting and all kinds of self indulgence were part of the worship of Baal and those who served Ashtaroth the goddess of beauty might spend their whole lives in wicked and degrading pleasures Illustration ANCIENT FIGURE OF ASHTAROTH THE WICKED IDOL GODDESS OF CANAAN The backsliders of Israel found it only too easy to give up the struggle for right and to sink down into the horrible wickedness of the heathen tribes around them Many people to day are asking how a God of love and mercy could bid the Israelites utterly to destroy the cities of Canaan and to kill their inhabitants but the more we discover of these ancient tribes the more hopelessly depraved do we find them to have been For centuries God had been waiting in patience the warning He had given to them through Sodom s swift destruction had been unheeded now at last the cup of their iniquity was full Genesis xv sixteen and the Israelites were to be His means of ridding the world of this plague spot In the Book of Judges we see how each time His people disobeyed His command and copied the sins they were called to sweep away God punished them by letting their merciless neighbours rule over them till they loathed the bondage and turned once more to the living God Had Israel absorbed the vices of these nations instead of destroying them try to think what the world would have lost The one channel through which God was giving His Book to man would have become so choked and polluted with vice that in its turn it also would have become a source of infection and not of health one This king s name is also spelt Hammurabi CHAPTER IV THE HISTORY BOOKS Illustration drop cap T Assyrian idol god Thus little by little the Book of God grew and the people He had chosen to be its guardians took their place among the nations A small place it was from one point of view A narrow strip of land but unique in its position as one of the highways of the world on which a few tribes were banded together All around great empires watched them with eager eyes the powerful kings of Assyria Egypt and Babylonia the learned Greeks and in later times the warlike Romans How small and unimportant the Israelites appeared to the world then Yet we know that in reality they were greater than any people the world had ever seen God s words have been fulfilled through the Children of Israel all the nations of the world are blessed The old empires have crumbled into dust the great conquerors of ancient days are forgotten few people to day remember the names of the wise men of Greece and Rome but our lives and thoughts are daily influenced by the thoughts words and deeds of the Jews of old Abraham Jacob Moses Samuel David Elijah their very names are nearer and dearer to us than those of the heroes of our own land When Queen Victoria was asked the secret of England s greatness she held up a Bible Their Sacred Book was all that the Jews possessed Their whole greatness was wrapped up in it As the heathen truly said they were The People of the Book And now let us glance at the history books of the Bible The first and second Books of Samuel have been put together from several other records Most likely Samuel himself did part of the work In Shiloh where he was educated the old documents were kept and Samuel the gifted lad who so early gave his heart to God was in every way fitted to write the story of the Lord s chosen people during his own life time The Bible mentions several other histories that were written in these days besides those which we know Now the acts of David the king first and last behold they are written in the book of Samuel the seer and in the book of Nathan the prophet and in the book of Gad the seer These last have disappeared one Chronicles xxix twenty nine Stores of books were being gathered When for instance Saul was chosen king Samuel wrote in a book and laid it up before the Lord one Samuel x twenty five These books were most likely written on a rough kind of parchment made from the skins of goats sewn together and rolled up into thick rolls The Books of Samuel are very precious to us for in them we read nearly all we know of the history of David the shepherd king Some of David s own writings are found in these books but for most of them we have to turn to the Book of the Psalms which was the manual of the Temple choir and became the national collection of sacred poems These Psalms were composed by different authors and at different times chiefly for use in the Temple but the collection was founded by David and he contributed many of its most beautiful hymns David s boyhood was spent among the rugged hills and valleys of Bethlehem As we read his Psalms we feel that the writer has passed long hours alone with God and the beautiful things which God has made Let us watch him for a moment It is evening and the young lad is alone on the hills keeping his father s sheep The sun is sinking and all the earth is bathed in golden light Even the sullen surface of the Dead Sea reflects the glory and the hills of Moab glow as though on fire God is the Creator of all this beauty thinks David Yes bright as is that golden sky His glory is above the heavens Psalm viii one Now the sun has quite gone night s dark curtain draws across the world the rosy glow fades from the hills One by one the great white stars shine out and presently the moon rises The young lad raises his face and gazes upward When I consider Thy heavens the work of Thy fingers the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained Psalm viii three he murmurs how great is this mighty God how far beyond all the thoughts and ways of men What is man that Thou art mindful of him Verse four But God loves us even though we are lower than the angels He has crowned us with glory and honour He has given all His beautiful world and all the wonderful things He has made into our hands O Lord verse four our Lord how excellent is Thy name in all the earth Verse nine In Psalm xxix David gives a word picture of a thunderstorm He describes the furious blast the crashing thunder the vivid lightning Many times as a young lad he had watched the black storm clouds gather over the hills and valleys of Bethlehem He had no fear of the tempest God s voice was in the wind God s voice divided the lightning flashes God s voice shook the wilderness Yes God would make His people strong even as the storm was strong And when the storm had passed and the sun shone out once more over the quiet hills how clearly the words rose in David s mind The Lord will bless His people with peace Verse eleven Solomon David s son was the wisest king of ancient times He wrote many books but only small fragments of them are found in the Bible a few Psalms Solomon s Song and a collection Proverbs Illustration SENNACHERIB KING OF ASSYRIA FROM THE ASSYRIAN PICTURE OF THE TAKING OF LACHISH two Kings xviii For much of Solomon s wisdom was of the earthly sort He stood first among all the learned men of his day He would now be called a scientific man But all science which is limited to mere human wisdom grows quickly out of date The cleverest men of to day will be thought very ignorant in a few years Whereas David s writings live His love for God and his faith in God made him able to write those words of trust and hope and praise which are as sweet and fresh to day as when they were written and which go right home to our hearts How many cold hearts have not David s psalms warmed into life how many wounded spirits have they not comforted There is not a grief or anxiety in our lives to day that could not be met and softened by the words of the Jewish writer of long ago Yes the work done for God and inspired by His Spirit never grows old And now as we open the books of the kings the great empires of the days of old of Assyria Babylonia Egypt Persia seem to start into vivid life once more How strong they were how terrible What defence had the little kingdom of Judah against such overwhelming power such mighty armies such merciless rulers She had the best defence of all God s holy promises chronicled in His Book While her people loved and served their God they would be safe But alas they soon forgot to read and obey His Book and neither loved nor served Him any more Then came sorrow and trouble exactly as Moses had foretold Cities were sacked and many hundreds of people led away into slavery yet until the days of Hezekiah no one tried to understand the reason for all this King Hezekiah understood and trembled he prayed earnestly that God would pardon the nation s sin and when the Book of the Law was lying forgotten in the Temple he had it brought out and read before him two Chronicles xxxiv fourteen eighteen Under his direction the Proverbs of Solomon were collected and copied Proverbs xxv i and the Psalms of David sung in the Temple once again The wonderful story of the King of Assyria s campaign against Jerusalem followed shortly after by the defence of the Holy City by God Himself in answer to Hezekiah s prayer can be read at length in the story of Hezekiah the King one Although Sennacherib of Assyria was one of the mightiest rulers the world has ever seen he was utterly discomfited when he set his power against the will of God The Books of Kings and Chronicles give us as it were the history of a nation from God s point of view The writers names are not even known But in these Books we are shown clearly that God rules over the nations and is working His purpose out through His chosen instruments year by year It is in vain for a man to strive against God or for a nation to hope for prosperity while it forsakes the law of the Lord No other history has ever attempted to show us the deep truths and perfect order which lie behind apparent confusion in the story of a nation With the History Books of the Bible the Books of the Prophets are closely interwoven Throughout Kings and Chronicles we catch many glimpses of the prophets and of their noble efforts to keep alive God s words in the hearts of the people but in the writings of the prophets themselves we may read the actual messages which God s messengers proclaimed in order to stir up their hearers in times of national distress or heart backsliding God s indignation against hypocrites and oppressors is declared in words that cannot be passed over but ever as the clouds of trouble gather more thickly over His people is the hope of a coming Saviour more clearly put before them For a real understanding of the Prophets Books it is necessary to know something of the circumstances under which each man lived and wrote Amos and Hosea for instance warned their people of the approach of Sargon of Assyria unless they repented and turned again to the law of the Lord As they did not repent the prophets warning came true and Sargon invaded and destroyed the Kingdom of Israel But Nahum brings comfort for he tells the suffering Kingdoms of Judah and Israel that the Kings of Assyria shall so disappear that in the years to come the very place where they dwelt shall be forgotten while Judah shall keep the Lord s feasts for ever Nahum i fifteen The Bible tells of many of God s acts which seem very wonderful to us We call these acts miracles because we cannot explain them nor how they happened Now the writings of Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel and the rest of the prophets are also miracles for although these men wrote at widely different times and hundreds of years before the birth of Christ yet their books all speak of Him The light of God s Spirit shone into their hearts so that they foresaw and foretold the coming of the Saviour King Terrible troubles would overwhelm the Jews but even though the wall of Jerusalem should be broken down the city laid waste and the inhabitants led away captive God s words were sure He would visit His people at last He would redeem them from their sins The troubles came the prophets eyes streamed with tears and their hearts were torn with grief as they saw their land wasted by the heathen Yet they did not despair The dark night of sorrow would wear away at last God s people should be brought back Jerusalem rebuilt her King would come the Sun of Righteousness arise And His name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor The Mighty God The Everlasting Father The Prince of Peace Isaiah ix six one A companion volume to this book CHAPTER V THE SCATTERING OF THE PEOPLE Illustration drop cap A The Fish god of Assyria and Babylonia At last the full punishment for their many sins fell upon God s chosen people The words of warning written in the fifth book of Moses had told them plainly that if they turned aside and worshipped the wicked idol gods of Canaan the Lord would take their country from them and drive them out into strange lands Yet again and again they had yielded to temptation And now the day of reckoning had come Nebuchadnezzar the great king of Babylon sent his armies into the Holy Land No nation at this time could resist Nebuchadnezzar even the fierce Assyrians had to bow before him for he was one of the most powerful kings the world has ever seen Yet even Nebuchadnezzar was but an instrument in the hands of God as Daniel recognized when he said Thou O king art a king of kings for the God of Heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory Daniel ii thirty seven This thought had been Daniel s comfort and stay though he had been carried into the great heathen land far from Jerusalem his beloved and holy city But to those Jews who had no trust in God to uphold them the sorrow was almost greater than they could bear For Nebuchadnezzar broke down the wall of Jerusalem and led many thousands of her people away to be his slaves in Babylon We have taken their treasure of gold and silver we have laid their city wall in ruins their Temple is bare and deserted their gardens of lilies and spices are choked with weeds their fields are unsown their vineyards untended the best men and women of the land are serving us in Babylon Now at last there is an end of this proud Jewish nation for all that they most valued is in our hands So said the heathen Babylonians mocking the poor captives How little they dreamt that the Jews most precious possession was with them still More valued than jewels or gold sweeter than the milk and honey of their own land was the Book of the Law the Book which told them all they knew of God Indeed not until the people were forced to live in a heathen city did they really learn to understand how great a treasure their nation possessed in the written words of God But in Babylon with its huge heathen temples blazing with jewels and gold its scores of cunning idol priests who deceived the people by pretending to tell fortunes and make charms and its countless images here at last God s chosen people began to see the greatness of the gift with which the Lord had blessed them when He gave them the words which have now become the first books of our Bible Nebuchadnezzar might break down the wall of their city he could not break down the spiritual wall which God Himself had built round His people Scattered through many lands forced to serve heathen masters as they were the Book of God s Law was a living gift which bound the Jewish people together As we have seen the Psalms were written by different writers and one of the later Psalms the one hundred and thirty seventh gives us a vivid picture of those sad days By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered Zion Verse one Babylon was famous for its great rivers and the poor captives watched the flowing water and the great wind swept beds of reeds and giant rushes We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof Verse two Illustration LED AWAY CAPTIVE ASSYRIAN PICTURE OF THE INHABITANTS FROM A CONQUERED CITY BEING LED AWAY INTO SLAVERY But their Babylonian masters had heard of the sweet psalms of the Lord s people Sing to us they said sing us a merry song Sing us one of the songs of Zion Verse three Sing to these cruel heathen who have wasted our country and carried us away into slavery Sing one of the holy songs of Israel the songs which King David wrote that they may laugh and mock at us How shall we sing the Lord s song in a strange land Verse four No they could not sing their hearts were breaking with grief Never never could they forget the Holy City Ruined desolate as it lay Jerusalem was still to them the place most loved in all the world And yet even in far off heathen Babylon the Lord called men to add to His Book The Book of Daniel has troubled many people greatly It was not history at all some critics said but a mere collection of myths and legends But year by year as fresh discoveries are made we see ever more clearly that it would have been better to trust the old Bible words after all There never was a ruler over Babylon named Belshazzar so these people said the last Babylonian king was Nabonides A few years ago however Belshazzar s name was found on an old cuneiform tablet Nabonides had been crowned king but he seldom took any part in the affairs of the empire All that he left to his eldest son Belshazzar who seems to have acted as king in his father s stead Almost daily further discoveries are being made all proving the accuracy of Daniel s writings What is probably the floor of the very dining hall in which the hand writing appeared has recently been uncovered Cyrus one of whom Ezra speaks in the first chapter of his book was a very different king from Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar loved to pull down and destroy nations but the great wish of Cyrus was to build up and restore The cuneiform writings of the old Babylonian and Assyrian kings consist mostly of long lists of the nations they led away into slavery and the towns they burnt with fire but the inscriptions made by Cyrus the Persian king speak of the people he sent back to their homes All their people I collected and restored their habitations two And among these people as the Bible tells us were the Jews of Jerusalem Many and great were the difficulties before them but led during the reign of Artaxerxes by Ezra and Nehemiah they faced their troubles bravely until at last the wall of Jerusalem was rebuilt and the city restored to something of its old beauty What a time of joy and triumph Hardly could the Jews believe that they were in their own dear city once again Psalm cxxvi describes this wonderful day When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion we were like them that dream Then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with singing then said they among the heathen The Lord hath done great things for them Verses one two We have sinned against the Lord we have been untrue to our promises but never again will we neglect His Book nor forget His Law And all the people gathered themselves together as one man and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the Book of the Law of Moses which the Lord had commanded to Israel Nehemiah viii one A solemn day that was as we read in the Book of Nehemiah a day of real returning to the Lord Picture them standing there those men and women and little children of Jerusalem their faces would be worn with toil and hardship On a raised platform of wood stood Ezra ready with the rolls of the Books of the Law and beside him were the interpreters For the people had been so long in a strange land that scarcely any of them could speak Hebrew that is the old Hebrew language in which King David wrote If the Law of God was to be impressed afresh on the nation s heart that day the scribes the writers and the teachers must translate it into the language of their heathen conquerors So they read in the Book of the Law of God distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading Nehemiah viii eight Since those days of Ezra the Bible has been translated into nearly every known language It is most interesting therefore to read in the Bible itself about what was most likely the very first translation of all and this not a written translation remember Now when the people heard the words of God s Book they were very sad for now at last they understood how deeply they had sinned against Him They had been proud of their Bible and had rightly felt it to be a great treasure but now they saw that the words of the Bible must be shown forth in the lives of those who believe To honour God s Book is not enough we must obey it The Jewish people did not again learn to speak the old language of their nation Yet all the copies of the Books of the Law and the Books of the Prophets the Psalms and those writings which tell of the history of the Lord s people that is the whole of the Old Testament were still written in the ancient tongue So it came to pass after a while that the Bible could only be read by the learned people for the words in which the Law of God was given had become a dead language that is a language that had ceased to be used in daily life at all Before the death of Ezra and Nehemiah or else very soon after the scribes of Jerusalem that is the writers and teachers began to devote themselves almost entirely to the studying and copying of the Bible A young lad of those days who became a pupil in the School of the Scribes at Jerusalem would have to begin by learning the Old Testament almost by heart To read an old Hebrew writing correctly was almost impossible unless you had heard it read two or three times and knew pretty well what was coming For the ancient Hebrew alphabet consisted entirely of consonants there were actually no vowels The little dots you see in the specimen of Hebrew given on this page are called vowel points and are a guide to the sound of the word but in the old old days of which we are speaking these dots had not been invented The reader had nothing but consonants before him and was obliged to guess the rest Just think of it Suppose we followed this rule in English and you came to the word TP you would be puzzled indeed to know whether tap tip or top was meant But the Jewish scribes had wonderful memories A teacher would read a long passage from the Psalms to his pupil and very soon the lad would be able to repeat the whole correctly the consonant words just refreshing his memory Illustration THE FIRST LINE OF THE BIBLE IN HEBREW This would not always be as difficult as you might suppose For instance you can read this easily enough TH LRD S M SHPHRD SHLL NT WNT Indeed to this day the Hebrew of the sacred Books in the Jewish Synagogues is all written without vowel points At this time it was that the Jews became really the People of the Book and that a special society was formed to guard and copy the Bible How wonderfully this work was done Never have the words of any other book been so lovingly cared for We have called the Bible the oldest Book in the world we have seen that it tells about nations and people who were almost forgotten before the days of Abraham It seems strange therefore that the most ancient copy of the Old Testament Scriptures written in Hebrew and in the possession of the Jews to day carries us back only to the time of our Saxon kings three This is because the Jews custom is reverently to destroy every copy of the Books of the Old Testament that is of their Bible as soon as it becomes worn with use or blurred with the kisses of its readers This is a living Book they say it should look new God s Word can never grow old So year by year they make new copies directly the old are worn out and this they have done for long ages And so careful have they been in making the copies that although all was written by hand there has practically been no alteration in the words for more than two thousand years God had indeed well chosen the guardians of His Book Let us try to picture to ourselves a young scribe of those old old days with his dark hair and big serious eyes and dressed in his white robe He has been very patient and industrious for many months past working early and late now at last he is to be allowed to copy one of the sacred books My son his old teacher has said take heed how thou doest thy work drop not nor add one letter lest thou becomest the destruction of the world Oh may the Lord keep my attention fixed may He hold my hand that it shake not So with a prayer on his lips the young scribe begins his work And it is through such patient careful work as his that the older part of our Bible has come down to us from the half forgotten ages of the past one Cyrus became King of Persia five hundred forty six B C conquered Babylon five hundred thirty eight died five hundred twenty eight B C two Cuneiform writing made by order

5460-24509-0009	train-other-500	and that the fear of God is the beginning of all true wisdom Many people forget this even to day So the Jews began to give their children Greek names and to send them to Greek schools

none	none	 As the years passed the fashion for Greek ideas and ways grew stronger in Jerusalem until at last even the High Priest himself two began to encourage the people to neglect the services and sacrifices of the Temple that they might go to heathen sports and games The Greeks were very fond of foot races and wrestling matches and they held large athletic meetings two or three times a year but no one who believed in God should have gone near those meetings for the Grecian games were always held in honour of some heathen god or goddess Illustration FIG one COIN OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT WITH PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF AND FIGURE OF JUPITER THE FALSE GOD HE WORSHIPPED FIG two COIN OF ANTIOCHUS THE WICKED KING PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF AND FIGURE OF VENUS ONE OF THE FALSE GODS HE TRIED TO FORCE THE JEWS TO BELIEVE IN When Alexander died he left his vast empire to be divided among his generals just as Napoleon did centuries later with his conquests The descendant of one of these generals was named Antiochus and he began to reign over Syria which included the country of Judah a hundred and seventy years before the birth of Christ He was known as Antiochus IV and was a selfish and cruel ruler Although indifferent to his own heathen religion 
5460-24509-0012	train-other-500	he set himself to destroy all other forms of faith I am king all my subjects shall think as I do he said He was told that the Jews believed in only one God but
5460-24509-0013	train-other-500	he cried with a scornful laugh Yes but I will soon alter that Before this there had been trouble between Antiochus and the people of Jerusalem and he thought to himself

5217-24510-0004	train-other-500	but as good subjects and citizens by the Greek rulers of Egypt and therefore as the years passed they grew rich and honoured in their beautiful home Their children however seldom if ever heard Hebrew spoken for all the Jews of Alexandria
5217-24510-0005	train-other-500	for convenience sake spoke Greek like their neighbours But although these Jews lived in a heathen city where they read nothing but Greek books and heard Greek spoken all day long they did not forget their God

none	none	 Here in the heathen city of Alexandria the Scriptures would be the only safeguard of Jewish boys and girls If the language of our children is Greek then the Bible must be translated into Greek so that they all can understand it

none	none	 yet all this made no difference without the written Word of God they could not exist Some writers say that Ptolemy Philadelphus the king of Egypt of that time having heard the Jews speak of their Book and wishing to have a copy of it to place in his great library sent all the way to Jerusalem for seventy learned scribes who should translate the Book into Greek Now

5217-24510-0015	train-other-500	the Samaritans had their own copies of the Books of the Law
none	none	 and kept them closely shut up among their own people for hundreds of years It is impossible now to give the actual date when the Samaritans began to use a different copy of the Scriptures from the Jews The Israelitish city of Samaria was captured by Sargon king of Assyria in seven hundred twenty two B C but although he carried away the most important inhabitants captive a great number of the poorer people remained on the land and when Sargon filled the country with new and heathen settlers so many marriages took place between the two races that the Children of Israel lost their old name and were known to the Jews of Judah as Samaritans Yet the Samaritans still clung to the Jews religion and the separation did not probably become complete until Nehemiah expelled all those Jews from Jerusalem who had married heathen wives Nehemiah xiii twenty three thirty Now Josephus the Jewish historian tells us that among these exiles was a man named Manasseh a grandson of the high priest and that indignant at being cast out he fled to Samaria Here he determined to set up a separate worship of Jehovah and having obtained permission from the king of Persia to erect a Temple he built a Holy Place on Mount Gerizim which became the centre of a new form of religion It is thought that Manasseh had carried away a copy of the Books of the Law from Jerusalem and by means of certain alterations in the words he made it appear that God had chosen Mount Gerizim in Samaria for the site of His House instead of Mount Moriah in Jerusalem Now at this time all the Jews still wrote in the ancient style forming their letters as we see them on the Moabite Stone but not long afterwards they adopted the square letters of Hebrew writing such as are still in use to day The Samaritans however in their hatred of everything Jewish refused to follow their example The Jews had cut them off and they would take nothing from the Jews they would keep to the old style of letters they would not allow a single word of the Books of the Prophets or the Psalms or History Books to have a place among their sacred writings The Jews accepted these Books as inspired therefore the Samaritans rejected them Thus Jewish pride and Samaritan littleness raised a terrible barrier between the two nations which grew more hopeless every year Illustration THE SAMARITAN BOOK OF THE LAW AT NABLOUS Yet these hidden Samaritan documents falsified as they had been have had a work to do for God s Word within comparatively recent times For in the year sixteen sixteen A D just as some people were beginning to attack the Bible and to declare that they could find no evidence that the Old Testament was so ancient after all the world was suddenly startled to hear of a great discovery an ancient copy of the Law had been found in Syria Other copies soon afterwards came to light 
5217-24510-0016	train-other-500	the world had rediscovered the Samaritan Bible At Nablous in Samaria known in Old Testament times as Shechem a traveller was allowed to look at the oldest Samaritan copy of the altered books of the Law Its queer letter signs are traced on parchment rolls

5217-24510-0017	train-other-500	They are kept in a silver cylinder covered with crimson satin heavily embroidered with gold
none	none	 But out of this discovery a new difficulty arose Some of the critics decided that this was the original copy written by Moses 
5217-24510-0018	train-other-500	and therefore more correct than the Jewish Scriptures
none	none	 They would have done better to wait and to have trusted the Bible a little more 
5217-24510-0019	train-other-500	True the discovery was of great importance for these documents proved beyond all doubt that the Book of the Law dated back to a time when the ancient form of letters were still in use and so they bore a strong witness to the great age of the first five Books of our Bible
none	none	 But learned scholars were soon able to prove that the oldest Samaritan copy was probably not older than the tenth or eleventh century of our era and that the form of the letters was so ancient merely because the Samaritans refused to imitate the improved Jewish writing 
5217-24510-0020	train-other-500	A hundred years ago for instance books with long s s were printed in England but the old form of letter was tiresome to read and is now entirely out of date
none	none	 Now the Samaritans had not only refused to accept the new and improved form of letters 
5217-24510-0021	train-other-500	they had rejected as well all the fresh light and inspiration which God was continually giving to His people through the Holy prophets
none	none	 According to the Samaritans 
5217-24510-0022	train-other-500	Moses was the only true prophet Thus they cut themselves adrift from further light and little by little the nations had dwindled away
none	none	 Yet because so many of the Samaritans in the time of Christ were faithful to the measure of light they had 
5217-24510-0023	train-other-500	and kept alive in their hearts the hope of a coming Messiah God made for them a wonderful way of escape Every Bible reader knows and loves that beautiful scene by the well of Sychar

5217-24510-0024	train-other-500	where the Saviour began by asking a woman for water to drink and ended by explaining to her some of the deepest truths of God s Kingdom
none	none	 We understand now why the woman was so surprised that a Jew should condescend to speak to her 
5217-24510-0025	train-other-500	and why the Jews would have no dealings with the Samaritans As we have seen a great barrier divided her from all ordinary Jewish teachers she had been taught to believe in an altered Bible Not merely a different translation remember
5217-24510-0026	train-other-500	for the Bible should be the same in every language but a Book of the Law in which some of the words had been changed and the original meaning destroyed So the woman said to our Lord
none	none	 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship John iv twenty The Saviour had not said so but she felt sure that He as a Jew would certainly contradict the old traditions of his countrymen But the Lord Jesus Christ had come to show the world that it was no longer a question of this mountain or that Such matters had been but a shadow of the good things to come God is a Spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth John iv twenty four With these words Jesus the Messiah for whom both Jews and Samaritans were waiting threw down the barrier of ages and united the two nations in a spiritual worship CHAPTER VIII THE BIBLE IN THE DAYS OF JESUS CHRIST Illustration drop cap S Reading from a Roll old Roman Painting Slowly but surely as time went on God was adding to His Book until about four hundred years before the birth of Jesus Christ the Old Testament Scriptures in their present shape were completed Many questions have been asked 
4443-24511-0000	train-other-500	as to how the canon of the Old Testament was formed that is how and when did the Jews first begin to understand that the Books of the Old Testament were inspired by God About the first five Books
4443-24511-0001	train-other-500	the Books of the Law there had never been any question From the very earliest times those Books so wonderfully given to the people had been the strength and stay of the Children of Israel
4443-24511-0002	train-other-500	But many books had been written in the days of the old Jewish kings and also after the return of the people from Babylon some of these were very beautiful and helpful
4443-24511-0003	train-other-500	How were the sacred Scriptures first divided from the other Jewish writings We do not know Some have thought that Ezra the scribe with the assistance of a council of elders fixed the canon of Hebrew Scripture
4443-24511-0004	train-other-500	others have supposed Nehemiah to have undertaken the work but most likely it was a gradual process directed by God Himself who inspired His servants to carry out His will The Christian Bible is composed of two parts
4443-24511-0005	train-other-500	the Old and the New Testament but the Jews divided their Scriptures our Old Testament into three parts and they certainly looked upon some books as far more sacred than others The Torah that is the Law
4443-24511-0006	train-other-500	included as we have seen the first five books of the Bible From the very earliest days the Torah was reverenced as containing the commandments and promises of God The second division consisted of the Prophets
4443-24511-0007	train-other-500	these being subdivided into the Former Prophets four volumes Joshua Judges Samuel Kings and the Latter Prophets three volumes Isaiah Jeremiah
4443-24511-0008	train-other-500	Ezekiel and the Twelve Minor Prophets which were included in one book Next in order of sanctity came the third division the Writings and these again were subdivided into three groups
4443-24511-0009	train-other-500	the poetical Books of the Psalms Proverbs and Job the Rolls or Readings seven volumes Solomon s Song Ruth Lamentations
none	none	 Ecclesiastes 
4443-24511-0010	train-other-500	Esther Daniel and one volume containing Ezra and Nehemiah and lastly in a separate book Chronicles Thus the whole Scriptures were contained in twenty four books
4443-24511-0011	train-other-500	Indeed not until the Greek translation was made were the books grouped in the order in which we have them now and at the same time their number was increased to thirty nine by taking the writings of each of the prophets separately
4443-24511-0012	train-other-500	and treating Ezra and Nehemiah as different books And now God who has spoken in times past by many different ways and voices spoke at last to the nations by His Son

none	none	 i two 
4443-24511-0014	train-other-500	Let us think for a little while of what was being done with the Scriptures in the days when the Lord Jesus learnt to read their words at His mother s knee words which from first to last told of Himself
none	none	 We have seen that no people could possibly honour the actual letters of the Scripture more highly than did the Jews 
4443-24511-0015	train-other-500	The care they took to keep the words exactly as they had been handed down to them was infinite and God who knows all things knew that a time would come when the pure Hebrew words of the old Bible would be eagerly sought for
4443-24511-0016	train-other-500	and treasured by all who truly honour His Book Therefore although the eyes of the learned Jewish scribes were so blinded that they did not recognize their King and Saviour when He came
4443-24511-0017	train-other-500	yet God blessed all that was true in their work and it is from the Hebrew copies which they made of the Books of the Old Testament and not from the Septuagint or Greek translation that the Old Testament of our Bible
4443-24511-0018	train-other-500	has come to us to day Yet
none	none	 sad to say 
4443-24511-0019	train-other-500	while so careful to preserve the words of the Scriptures the Scribes and Pharisees forgot its spirit the very purpose for which the Bible had been given them
4443-24511-0020	train-other-500	A man might know by memory every letter of the Bible but unless the Spirit of God were in his heart helping him to act out in his life the words he repeats with his lips

4443-24511-0022	train-other-500	So wrote the Apostle Paul who had as we know been educated by the Scribes and Pharisees and when he wrote those words he was recalling his own experience
4443-24511-0023	train-other-500	Thus as year by year the learned Jews thought more of the letters of their Bible they saw less of its spirit worse still they began to add
none	none	 to the teaching of the Books of the Law Not that they ventured to put other words between those of the Bible or to alter it as the Samaritans had done but they invented long explanations of almost every verse and declared that these explanations must be followed as absolutely as the words of the Bible itself For instance a learned Jewish teacher wrote an explanation of Moses command about obeying the Levites Deuteronomy xvii eleven Moses had said that the people were to do what the Levites told them respecting the Law of God neither turning to the right hand nor to the left The Jewish teachers declared what Moses really meant was that if a teacher of the Law told you that your left hand was your right you must believe him Illustration PLAN OF A SYNAGOGUE one MODEL OF THE ARK WHICH WAS CARRIED BEFORE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL two STAND FOR THE READER three WOMEN S GALLERY four ENTRANCE In this way while professing to explain God s Word the scribes and teachers were confusing the simple people who wanted to obey this Holy Law The Saviour saw this

4443-24511-0025	train-other-500	His own way of using the Scriptures was very different From His mother He had first learned to repeat texts from the Old Testament and with her He had gone to the Synagogue Sabbath by Sabbath
4443-24511-0026	train-other-500	to hear the Books of the Law and the Prophets read As He grew older He would have been sent to school and taught to read and recite the Scriptures and long before He began Himself to teach the people He had so absorbed the spirit of the Old Testament
4443-24511-0027	train-other-500	that His very thoughts seem to have been given in Scripture words Perhaps you have wondered why the names of some of the prophets and heroes of the Old Testament are spelt so differently when mentioned in the New

4443-24511-0029	train-other-500	For instance our name of Mary becomes Marie in French and Maria in Italian and yet it is all the while the same name Some people think that this the Septuagint
4443-24511-0030	train-other-500	or first Greek translation was the special translation of the Bible which the Saviour used Many of the quotations which He gave from the Old Testament appear to have been from this translation

beginning of your New Testament You will see that first come the four Gospels or glimpses of the Saviour s life given by four different writers Then follows the Acts of the Apostles and lastly after the twenty one epistles the volume ends with the Revelation Now this is not the order in which the books were written they are only arranged like this for our convenience The first words of the New Testament were written not as we should have supposed by one of the twelve apostles or by some one who had loved and followed the Lord Jesus Christ when He was upon earth They are written by a Pharisee who had been one of Christ s bitterest enemies Though Saul had as far as we know never seen the Saviour on earth what he had heard of His work and teaching made him feel that in stamping out all the followers of the so called Messiah he would be doing God service But we remember how the Saviour Himself appeared to Saul on his way to Damascus and how his heart was changed and his eyes were opened We can scarcely imagine the transformation which came over his mind Together with all the other learned Jews he had considered Jesus of Nazareth to be an impostor and to blaspheme the words of God s Holy Book when He applied them to Himself Now Saul the Pharisee understood that he and his countrymen not Jesus of Nazareth were at fault As he read the old prophesies he understood their true meaning and straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues that He is the Son of God Acts ix nine Then the full tide of Jewish anger turned upon him That he should join the followers of the despised Nazarene and forsake the sacred traditions of the Law made all the Jews scattered through the then known world into his bitterest enemies Paul as he was afterwards called loved his countrymen with a passionate love He would gladly have died for them one and that he should be unable to show them what was so clear to himself was certainly the greatest sorrow and disappointment of his life But though he was unable to help his countrymen as a nation God made him the most successful missionary traveller the world has ever known and to him was given the privilege of writing a large part of the New Testament Before we think about his writings however let us look at the condition of the great heathen cities of the world at the time when he lived In the year A D fifty four that is twenty years after our Saviour s death upon the cross the Emperor Nero who is still remembered as one of the worst men who ever lived began to reign in Rome For many years the Roman Emperors had been masters of all the then known nations and for awhile they had ruled justly but ever as the Roman Empire increased in power and riches the Roman rulers grew more haughty and selfish until at last they cared for nothing but their own pleasures and spent their days in drinking and feasting wasting enormous sums in senseless extravagance while thousands of their subjects starved A dreadful city Rome must have been in those days though to look at she was beautiful indeed A city of marble palaces of fair white statues and green gardens of huge public baths and theatres On one side stood an enormous building with a round space in the centre and tiers of seats rising one above another like a circus This was an amphitheatre where shows and performances were given There were no sham combats in a Roman circus no mere pretence of being wounded Men fought with men in stern reality worse still men were made to fight with wild beasts Lions and tigers and fierce bulls tore and gored men to death while the audience leaned back in their comfortable seats watching the horrible scenes intently Every rich man in Rome at the time of which we write owned hundreds of slaves who were the absolute property of their owners A slave girl who arranged her mistress s hair badly was burnt with a hot iron If a slave boy broke a costly vase his master might whip him to death or have him thrown into a tank full of ravenous fish There was no limit to the master s power Although millions of people had scarcely a rag to cover them or a crust to eat the rich people flung their gold away on useless trifles Indeed a kind of competition existed among them as to who could waste his money the most foolishly Nightingales sing more sweetly than any other bird thought one of these I have it I ll order a dish of nightingales tongues for my feast next week that will be something rare and expensive indeed All his friends were charmed with the new idea and nightingales tongues became quite the fashion But all the time in this mighty city so black with sin so red with cruelty the pure white light of the Gospel of Christ had begun to shine Gospel means good news The story of Jesus was blessed news indeed for the suffering hopeless people As yet all unnoticed by the rulers of the heathen world the little band of Christians was ever increasing Illustration THESSALONICA NOW CALLED SALONICA IT WAS TO THE CHRISTIANS OF THIS TOWN THAT PAUL WROTE HIS FIRST EPISTLE From Jerusalem the good news had spread to Rome and to numbers of other heathen cities The Apostle Paul had preached and gained little groups of converts in Thessalonica and Philippi and other strongholds of evil and in the year when Nero became Emperor of Rome the first words of the New Testament were written It happened in this way saint Paul was in Greece carrying on the war for Christ in the very centre of the idol worshippers Most of the Roman ideas of the false gods had come from Greece In Athens and Corinth the most beautiful buildings were heathen temples and not a house in the whole land was without its images Paul had preached at Athens and Corinth but in the very midst of his difficult work he heard that the little band of faithful followers he had left behind in the city of Thessalonica were in great trouble They had no books to help them except the Old Testament written in Greek Although they had tried hard to remember his words many things still perplexed them Besides the Jews living in the city were their bitterest enemies and had so stirred up the people against them that they were in constant danger of losing their lives Would not their great leader tell them what they ought to believe and how they ought to live Paul loved these Thessalonians and longed to go to them But he could not leave his work in Corinth What then was he to do He could write a long letter to them bidding them to Stand fast in the Lord one Thessalonians iii eight To remember that God had called them unto Holiness one Thessalonians iv seven Paul did not need to remind them to love one another for that God Himself had taught them Verse nine He told them too not to sorrow hopelessly for those who had died for Christ for when Christ returns as He surely will those who have loved Him shall rise first to meet Him and so be with Him for evermore Wherefore comfort one another with these words Verse eighteen We can imagine how eagerly the Thessalonian converts listened to the letter We see too that the first Christian document ever written contained the full Gospel message and that the heathen had already turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God and to wait for His Son from Heaven whom He raised from the dead even Jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come one Thessalonians i nine ten A few months later the Thessalonians were once more in great perplexity What are we to believe they had asked Paul tells us plainly that Christ will return to the earth How can we settle down to our ordinary work with such a wonderful hope before us From the answer which the Apostle sent to their questions which we call to day the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians we can see clearly how troubled they must have been In order to understand their position we must remember that the words and acts of the Lord Jesus Christ had not as yet been written down and all that the Thessalonians knew about Him was from Paul s preaching and teaching They could not turn to their Bibles as you can when you long to know just what the Saviour would have you do So Paul wrote to them again explaining that they must wait in patience quietly doing their daily work and earning their own bread as he and his companions had done whilst living in Thessalonica two Thessalonians iii twelve Most of saint Paul s Epistles that is his letters were written in this way because of some special need or danger The converts in Corinth Galatia or Ephesus were in difficulty or in danger of losing their faith in Christ and Paul ever watchful but unable to go to them at the moment wrote the message of comfort and warning which God had put into His heart At last there came a time when Paul could visit his converts no more The Roman rulers were as yet not angry with the followers of Christ They simply despised them and thought the Jews very foolish to trouble about a pack of low ignorant people They are mostly slaves or such like whose opinions are worth nothing Why do they not let them alone as we do said the proud Romans But at last so bitter had the Jews become against Paul and so violent were their attacks on him that the Roman Government was obliged to interfere Paul was arrested in Jerusalem and imprisoned in Caesarea Here he remained for many months until at last finding he would get no justice from the Roman governor he demanded to be taken to Rome itself to the Judgment Seat of the Emperor Two or three years before this he had written a most wonderful letter to the Roman Christians To all that be in Rome beloved of God called to be saints his letter was addressed He told them how he prayed for them and how he longed to see them Making request if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you Romans i ten His prayer was answered but he came as a prisoner in the year of our Lord sixty one Yet Paul was not put in prison when he arrived in Rome He was allowed to see his friends and even to hire a lodging of his own though day and night he had to be chained to a Roman soldier The soldiers were changed when their watch expired but never for one instant could the Apostle go free Many of these Roman soldiers were hard and proud believing in nothing at all not even in their own idol gods but after a while won by Paul s words and life the soldiers learned to believe also and became his converts For the first year of his imprisonment Paul wrote little but he spoke and thought much as the second year drew on he sent letters to many of those he so longed to see again which are as precious to us as they were to those old time Christians Among these are the Epistles to the Galatians the Ephesians the Philippians the Colossians and a touching little appeal to Philemon concerning a runaway slave who had become one of Paul s converts at Rome We are almost certain that the Apostle was released for a time so that he was enabled to revisit many of his converts as he so earnestly desired to do Illustration THE OLD ROMAN ROAD DOWN WHICH saint PAUL TRAVELLED INTO ROME AS IT APPEARS TO DAY Then he was once more taken prisoner and brought again to Rome where Nero s wickedness had become repulsive even to the Romans themselves cruel and hardened though they were To Timothy who was to him as a son Paul the prisoner wrote a farewell letter just when he was to be brought before Nero the second time I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith two Timothy iv seven So he wrote and before he closed his letter he begged Timothy to make a special effort to come to him and to bring with him the books but especially the parchments Verse thirteen These books would most likely be the first copies of two or three of the books of the New Testament just the very beginnings Perhaps the life of Jesus Christ written by Mark and a letter or two of Peter s fragile reed paper rolls which would tear and crack unless they were handled with the greatest care These would be written just like the ordinary books of the time for as yet no one dreamt that they would one day be bound up with the parchments and so form the Christians Bible For by the parchments Paul almost certainly meant the Old Testament written in Greek He needed these very specially He had time to think and study now and the old old Books of the Law and the Prophets spoke from the first page to the last of his beloved Master Jesus Christ Did he live to receive the parchments We do not know How did he die The Bible does not tell us But about the date saint Paul wrote the last of his words that have come down to us a fierce time of trial swept like a storm over the little Christian colony in Rome In his mad wickedness the Emperor Nero set fire to his own city so that he might watch the blaze Half Rome was burnt and then he grew alarmed for the people were furiously angry at losing their homes So he looked round for some one on whom to throw the blame In an evil hour he thought of the Christians The Christians plotted to destroy my city death to them Drag them from their houses burn them throw them to wild beasts The order went forth the excited people were only too ready to obey and so the Lord s faithful followers were put to death by hundreds Nero prided himself on inventing the most horrible tortures for them On one dreadful night he even caused a number of living men and women to be wrapped in cloths soaked in pitch tied to the top of long poles and then set on fire This horrible deed was carried out in Nero s own beautiful gardens which were thus all lighted up with the glare of the flames But nothing could shake the faith and courage of these saints and warriors As it is written For Thy sake we are killed all the day long Romans viii thirty six But they feared none of these things they were faithful unto death and the Lord has given them a crown of life

4973_24514_000026_000001	train-clean-360	By the time that saint John wrote his Gospel Jerusalem had been destroyed and her inhabitants slain or scattered 
4973_24514_000026_000002	train-clean-360	He was able therefore to mention details and give the actual names of people and places which if told earlier might have endangered the lives of those of whom he wrote 
4973_24514_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Many instances of this will be found by those who read carefully 
none	none	He alone mentions the name of the Apostle who struck off the ear of the High Priest s servant and the story of the raising of Lazarus is given only by saint John as though it would have been dangerous to record it earlier 
4973_24514_000028_000000	train-clean-360	So filled with love was the Apostle John that before he died his spirit became altogether one with Christ s spirit and the sayings of Jesus which he had only half understood whilst his Master had walked this earth grew quite clear to him so that he remembered them distinctly 
4973_24514_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Therefore that others might understand also God s Spirit called John when he was an old man to write out those precious words of Jesus Christ s which were always echoing in his heart and which the other writers had not known or had forgotten 
none	none	It is in John s Gospel that we learn most about the love of Christ Matthew Mark Luke and John let us thank God for them all one The name Bible is derived from the Greek word Byblus i e Papyrus the paper reed on which the New Testament was written two The name Theophilus means God s friend Most people believe that he was a notable convert of those days though unknown to history

4973_24515_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Let us now look at the rest of the books which make up the New Testament 
4973_24515_000004_000001	train-clean-360	In the days when Paul preached at Athens the old capital of Greece much of the ancient splendour and power of the Greek people had passed away for the Romans had conquered their country and they were no longer a free nation 
4973_24515_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Yet although the Greeks had been forced to yield to Rome their conquerors knew that the Grecian scholars and artists were far better educated and more highly gifted than themselves and Greek statues and writings had therefore become the fashion throughout the Roman Empire Indeed many of the Greek sculptors and authors are remembered and admired to this day 
4973_24515_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Homer the greatest Greek poet who lived about a thousand years B C is still world famous 
none	none	Homer s best known poem one is about a terrible war which took place between the Greeks and the Trojans Its words are noble and its descriptions very clever but although all must admire the beauty of the lines the poem produces a dismal and depressing effect 
4973_24515_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The picture it gives of the old heathen religion is terrible for Homer described the gods and goddesses in whom he believed as being far more cruel and unjust than the worst men and women of his time According to his ideas Jupiter Diana Apollo Mars and the rest came down to earth and took part in the battle 
4973_24515_000008_000000	train-clean-360	In vain did the great hero Hector fight his bravest in vain did he sacrifice himself and strive to make up for the wrong doing of his brother he failed utterly for Homer tells us that he was hated by some of the gods for no fault of his own and so they doomed him to destruction and guided the hand of the man who slew him 
4973_24515_000008_000001	train-clean-360	How little those clever Greeks had been able to discover of the mercy and justice of God 
4973_24515_000009_000000	train-clean-360	But although the men of this great nation knew nothing of our wise and loving Heavenly Father He knew and loved them every one and as we have seen He called a Greek Christian author to help Him in the wonderful work of writing the Bible 
none	none	In addition to the story of our Saviour s life this Greek author saint Luke also wrote a book about a war a war that was to become world wide the war against sin and the Devil and the name of this second book is the Acts of the Apostles In all this wonderful Bible of ours there is no Book more wonderful than the Book of the Acts Have you ever stopped to think what a terrible gap there would be in the history of God s dealings with the world had the Acts never been written 
4973_24515_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The Apostle Paul s life would be almost a blank 
4973_24515_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Stephen s victorious death would be all unknown to us 
4973_24515_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Above all the story of our Saviour s ascension into Heaven and the marvellous fulfilment of His promises in the gift of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost would have been left untold 
4973_24515_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The Book of the Acts stands alone 
4973_24515_000014_000000	train-clean-360	There are four Gospels written from four different points of view but of the four writers Luke the Greek was the only one who wrote a sequel and showed the results which our Saviour s Life and Death and Resurrection produced at once in the world 
4973_24515_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The marvellous accuracy of saint Luke and his keen observation become every year more striking as fresh discoveries in the lands of which he wrote show how true he is in the tiniest detail while his modesty is equally remarkable for only by carefully noticing when he says we and when they can we discover when he shared saint Paul s dangers and trials

none	none	How did Luke write and what did his two books look like when he had finished them 
4973_24515_000018_000001	train-clean-360	He wrote on papyrus that is on reed paper using an ink like black paint and a reed pen 
none	none	As far as we know no portions of the Bible books of this date are left in the world but in the beginning of the year nineteen eleven a large number of very ancient fragments of Bible books were discovered in Upper Egypt and with these was part of a translation of Luke s Book of the Acts just shreds and tatters of fragile papyrus paper the remains of what is up till now the oldest copy of the New Testament in the world Amongst the ancient manuscripts kept in the British Museum are old old copies of Homer s War poems and here also are stored the precious fragments of the chronicles of that other great Greek writer saint Luke 
4973_24515_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Homer s book belongs to the forgotten past for the heathen religion of Greece is to day as though it had never been 
4973_24515_000022_000000	train-clean-360	But the writings of saint Luke are as full of blessing and power as ever and the war he wrote about grows more wonderful every day 
none	none	For Christ the Son of God came down from Heaven not to fight against men as the false gods of the old Greeks were supposed to have done but to fight and conquer for men to lift up the fallen and to win for the victors a crown of deathless glory 
4973_24515_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The Apostle Peter in contrast to saint Luke was only a fisherman when the Lord bade him leave his boat and his nets to preach and teach the Gospel 
4973_24515_000024_000000	train-clean-360	His ideas were very limited when Jesus Christ first came into his life and he knew little or nothing of the various branches of knowledge which had become a second nature to the Greek scholar but the fisherman was to receive his education in a very different fashion from Luke for his teacher was the Lord Jesus Christ Himself 
4973_24515_000025_000000	train-clean-360	How impossible it would have seemed to Peter in the days when he washed his nets by the Lake of Galilee that his writings should ever form a part of the Scriptures God s Book which he had learned from his childhood to love and reverence 
4973_24515_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Yet with God all things are possible 
none	none	Not only did the Apostle Peter write a part of the Bible but that short book known as the First Epistle of Peter is one of the most frequently mentioned by all the earliest Christian writers those authors and teachers who had seen the Apostles and had heard from their lips the story of the Saviour s life on earth 
4973_24515_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Thus it is that Peter s contribution to our Bible has become one of the strongest witnesses to the truth of the words written down in the Gospels 
4973_24515_000027_000002	train-clean-360	There is no possibility of a mistake the man who wrote this Epistle could have been none other than the Apostle Peter who had been with the Lord from the beginning of His public work 
none	none	And it is very beautiful to trace throughout Peter s writings the echoes of the great facts which he had seen and which to the end of his days formed the background of all his thoughts Christ had given him his name Peter or Cephas that is a rock or stone and so he wrote of his Master as the great Corner stone of God s spiritual house in which each one of Christ s people are living stones one Peter ii five seven The Saviour had once told Peter that he must forgive his brother although he was wronged by him on seventy times seven occasions and in Peter s Epistle we read Above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins one Peter iv 
4973_24515_000030_000001	train-clean-360	eight Charity should have been translated love 
none	none	Then the Lord had warned Peter that Satan had desired to have him and he remembering that solemn fact in his own life tried to put his readers on their guard against the great enemy because your adversary the Devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour one Peter v eight Most touching of all are the words he wrote For what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently But if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with God because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example one Peter ii twenty twenty one The man who had seen the Lord Jesus Christ suffer patiently could never forget Feed the flock of God which is among you And when the Chief Shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory one Peter v two four His Master s last command by the Lake of Galilee to feed His flock was so deeply impressed on Peter s mind that it coloured all his thoughts to the last day of his life John xxi 
4973_24515_000034_000000	train-clean-360	This Epistle of saint Peter was written we believe to comfort God s people under the heavy trial of Paul s second imprisonment 
none	none	Cruelty and persecution were doing their worst but God was above all Beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ s sufferings one Peter iv twelve thirteen Two short but very beautiful epistles are believed to have been written by two of the Lord s brethren saint James and saint Jude Eusebius the first Christian historian born two hundred sixty A D died three hundred forty tells us that James was a Nazarite This means that he had taken the old Jewish vow of special purity he ate no meat drank no wine and wore nothing but white linen garments 
4973_24515_000036_000002	train-clean-360	This vow is often mentioned in the Old Testament 
4973_24515_000036_000003	train-clean-360	James had not believed that Jesus Christ was the Saviour of the world until after His Resurrection when the Lord appeared to him 
none	none	After that He was seen of James one Corinthians xv seven This set his doubts at rest for ever and saint James too was called to write a part of God s Book Of saint Jude author of the Epistle of that name scarcely anything is known but from Matthew xiii fifty five and Mark vi 
4973_24515_000038_000002	train-clean-360	three we learn that he was one of the Lord s brethren and like his brother James did not believe that Jesus Christ was the Messiah until after the Resurrection This Jude must not be confused with the Apostle Jude 
4973_24515_000039_000000	train-clean-360	These writers of the New Testament as they took their reed pens in their hands and spread out their rolls of whitey brown papyrus paper were not like Moses 
4973_24515_000039_000001	train-clean-360	True they knew that the Holy Spirit was bidding them write but that their written words should ever be used by God to form a part of the Bible would have seemed impossible to them all

4973_24515_000041_000000	train-clean-360	The last and by far the latest writer of God s Book was saint John the beloved disciple 
none	none	Long after most of the other Apostles were dead he still lived on speaking and writing of his Master and to the Apostle John the Lord Jesus Christ entrusted the record of many of His most beautiful and comforting words and of the deepest and most spiritual teaching in the whole Bible 
4973_24515_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Three of the shortest and yet most beautiful Books of the Bible are the three epistles which bear John s name 
none	none	They are supposed to have been written from Ephesus in John s latter days and every sentence in them seems to breathe forth the peace love and wisdom of a very old man who has lived close to Christ for many years 
4973_24515_000043_000002	train-clean-360	It may well be then that these calm and loving letters were the last of all the Bible words to be written 
4973_24515_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Now the Revelation though placed at the end of our Bible was not the last Book to be written 
4973_24515_000045_000000	train-clean-360	It was probably composed whilst Nero the wicked Emperor was torturing and burning the followers of Christ 
none	none	saint John s heart must have been ready to break with distress but the Holy Spirit comforted him and lifted his thoughts right up to Heaven showing him in a vision the end of all these things 
4973_24515_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Among the fragments of the oldest Bibles in the world recently discovered the Book of Revelation takes a prominent place

4973_24516_000006_000000	train-clean-360	We have learnt much now of the Bible and of how the Old and New Testaments were written but who first thought of making pictures from the Bible 
none	none	We shall see 
4973_24516_000008_000000	train-clean-360	A few miles from the city of Rome deep deep underground are those wonderful networks of galleries and chambers called The Catacombs 
4973_24516_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Catacomb means scooped out Miles and miles of passages are there some low and narrow others wide and lofty they cross and re cross each other like the streets of a town and all are scooped out of the solid earth 
none	none	On either side of every gallery are almost endless rows of spaces hollowed out in the walls one above another like the berths on board ship For the most part they are open and empty but a few are still closed Above some of them words are faintly traced on stone slabs a man or woman s name perhaps oftener still the Latin words In Pace that is In Peace 
4973_24516_000011_000000	train-clean-360	For all this great underground city is in reality one huge cemetery the quiet resting place where the first Christians of heathen Rome buried their dead where the martyred bodies so cruelly tortured by Nero were laid at last

4973_24516_000016_000001	train-clean-360	We know what these were like for not very far away is a heathen catacomb

4973_24516_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Now about the time of Nero s cruel persecution the Christians of Rome began to use the Catacombs for meetings and services 
4973_24516_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Their heathen tormentors had a horror of death and therefore among the quiet dead the Christians were safe for a while 
4973_24516_000021_000000	train-clean-360	So they met deep underground in the dim galleries their little oil lamps twinkling like stars and there they listened to the Word of God and prayed and sang together 
4973_24516_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Many touching stories are told of these days and of the meetings held underground in these Catacombs where the living were surrounded by the bodies of the martyred dead 
4973_24516_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Now these first Christians loved the Bible with all their hearts and just as you like to see hanging in your room the picture of the Good Shepherd with the little lamb so they began to long for pictures from their Bible 
4973_24516_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Every heathen Roman had his house decorated with pictures and carvings from his pagan religion but it was in the dim underground galleries that the first Bible pictures appeared 
4973_24516_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Some of the subjects were taken from the Old Testament some from the New 
4973_24516_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Only Bible pictures interested the first Christians

4973_24516_000026_000000	train-clean-360	There are many pictures of Jonah and the whale and one of the three children in the burning fiery furnace for this had special messages for the martyrs as we can well understand

4973_24516_000028_000001	train-clean-360	The artist who carved this had once been a heathen perhaps in former days he had made and sold idols but now all his life and talents were consecrated to God

4973_24516_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Now there is one very wonderful thing about all these pictures although so many martyrs lie buried here nearly all the pictures and inscriptions are cheerful 
4973_24516_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The heathen Roman writers tell a great deal about the dreadful sufferings of the Christians but there is very little said about it on the tombs of the martyrs themselves

Who does not love Bible Stories Even the words themselves bring back memories of past years when as children we listened to stirring tales of those men and women of old whose names are so familiar and of whom we were then first taught Crude in style perhaps many of the stories were but none the less interesting Perhaps there were things we could not quite understand and knowledge had not sufficiently advanced to explain but we accepted them all Now great progress has been made in research modern discoveries in Egypt supply the details which were lacking and the old stories can be told again in a new style in the light of fuller knowledge with added interest and with a force which previously had been impossible How wonderful the result Our Bibles become dearer to us than ever before we need have no fear of being asked the reason of our belief what we merely accepted before is now proved for us Let us take for example the story of Moses In this modern discovery has done splendid
