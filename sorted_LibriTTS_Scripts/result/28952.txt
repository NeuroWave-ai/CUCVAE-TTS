else would keep an antique store where nobody ever looks All the other antique places are along Wisconsin Avenue where people go to shop You reckon Jakey really could use the job Chris asked his courage ebbing as he pictured to himself the dark little shop with its bow window of small panes and mister Wicker so thin and wizened he seemed only bones and wrinkles Think he really needs it he pursued But Mike was certain or perhaps he needed a companion in this curious experiment You bet he does He tol me at noon today he wished he could find something that would help bring some money in His mother s sick he repeated an Jakey don look so good himself Well Chris said half agreeing I ll go with ya Mike announced as if that finished the argument which as a matter of fact it did Chris did not feel too happy about his mission and hung back a moment longer looking in the Pep Boys window at things he had already seen He would have liked to get the job for Jakey who needed it but somehow the task of facing mister Wicker especially now that the light was going and dusk edging into the streets was not what Chris had intended for ending the afternoon Although he had not been quite certain how he had meant to spend the rest of the remaining daylight Mike s plan did not seem to fit his present mood Are you coming Mike challenged with a hint of derision Yes said Chris suddenly I m coming I ll ask for Jakey Mike s expression changed at once to one of triumph but Chris was only partly encouraged The two boys walked to the corner of M Street and Wisconsin Avenue Traffic roared up the first short block of Wisconsin from under the high steel freeway down to their left Chris glanced down the slope of Wisconsin Houses and shops thinned suddenly on both sides of the street Far down at the very end on his side he could see the brick walls and slate roof of mister Wicker s house Chris knew it well for times without number he had pressed his nose to the square Georgian panes of mister Wicker s window to gaze at the strangely fascinating jumble of oddments that were displayed Now however he felt in no mood to visit the curiosity shop and stood shifting his feet and looking aimlessly about Mike beside him was becoming restive and gave him a poke Betcha aren t goin after all Chris turned on him Am too Mike looked disdainful Aw you re stalling Not any sucha thing I m going now O K Let s see you Chris turned his back on Mike and started down the hill After a step or two not finding his friend beside him he turned Mike was standing on the corner Hi Chris called indignant You said you were coming with me Well I was Mike howled back but I just remembered My mother told me to bring her some stuff from the Safeway I ll run all the way and come back and meet you Aw shucks Chris kicked at a nonexistent pebble and scowled But a chore was a chore and was never worth discussion I ll meetcha in fifteen or twenty minutes Mike shouted It won t take me long and throwing out his hands to signify that there was nothing he could do about it he disappeared Chris started off once more passing the bleak little Victorian church perched on the hill above mister Wicker s house An empty lot cut into by Church Lane gave a look of isolation to the L shaped brick building that served mister Wicker as both house and place of business Chris paused to look below him Even from where he stood fifty feet above the house the slope of the hill was sharp and the plan of the house below him could be plainly seen It was built like an inverted L the short wing faced towards the street and the traffic of Wisconsin Avenue The longer wing toward the back had a back door that opened onto Water Street The space between the house and Wisconsin Avenue had been made into a neat oblong flower garden fenced off from the sidewalk by box shrubs and a white picket fence Behind it along the other side of the long wing lay a meticulously arranged vegetable garden and a few apple trees His gaze moved back to the house itself It seemed to have been built at about the same time as the vacant storehouses opposite for they had a similar look of design and age The windows of mister Wicker s house had smaller panes of glass than were used nowadays and like the warehouses across from it mister Wicker s had many dormer windows jutting out from the slated roof Unlike the warehouses however which were rickety and down at heel mister Wicker s home was well cared for The windows except for the bow window of the shop to the right of the front door had shutters painted a pleasing bluey green and at their sides could be seen the edges of gay curtains The traffic freeway rose high above the roof dwarfing the old house and casting a deepening shadow over the whole length of Water Street shading even mister Wicker s back door so close did it rise beside the house The air was filled with mechanical sounds the roar of cars speeding up the hill the grind of gears the shuddering throb of wheels along the freeway and the clanking bang of chains and weights in the factories along the shore Illustration The sun was dropping and the sky behind Chris made a sinister promise for the following day A livid yellow stained the horizon beyond the factories and gray clouds lowered and tumbled above The air was growing chill and Chris decided to finish his job All at once he wondered how his mother was and everything in him pinched and tightened itself At the foot of the hill he reached the house As he came to the bow front the old familiar excitement that always seized Chris when he looked in mister Wicker s window touched him again and he stopped to look at its well memorized display For as long as he had stopped to look into mister Wicker s window which was as far back as he could remember Chris had never known the objects to vary or be changed There were three things that always caught his eye amid the litter of dusty pieces On the left the coil of rope in the center the model of a sailing ship in a green glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a Negro boy in baggy trousers Turkish jacket and white turban The figure was holding up a wooden bouquet the yellow paint peeling from the carved flowers The figure s mouth was open in an engaging toothy smile and its right hand was on one hip on the chipped red paint of the baggy trousers The ship so often contemplated by Chris that he knew every tiny thread and delicately jointed board was a three masted schooner sleek of line painted at one time a dazzling white Now with dust dulling the green sides of the bottle its sails looked loose its sides grimed But the name still showed at the prow and many a time Chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the Mirabelle It lay there snug and captured as if at the bottom of a tropical sea seen through the glass sides of the bottle and Chris never tired of looking at it But perhaps the coil of rope so meaningless so meaningful held his imagination by an even stronger hold Why a coil of rope in an antique shop Who would want it People bought rope in a hardware store there was one farther along M Street near the old deserted Lido Theatre But here in an antique shop Chris shook his head as he stared He had never seen anyone go into mister Wicker s shop now he thought of it How then did he live and what did he ever sell A sudden car horn woke him from his dream He looked up seeing for the first time the small card hung at eye level in the window In a beautiful script such as Chris had never seen before but very legible the card read Boy Wanted Good Pay W Wicker Jakey Harris came back into Chris s thoughts He looked over his shoulder at the darkening sky streaked luridly with citrous strokes noticed the wheel and tackle high up at the loft door of the warehouse opposite and put his hand on the doorknob The last flicker of light scudded across the steel sides of the freeway to pick out the lettering above the shop window W LLM WICKER CURIOSITIES Chris opened the door and a bell jangled very faintly but with persistence far away in some distant part of the house CHAPTER three The last reverberations of sound hung in the air and jangled in Chris s head Of the many times he had examined mister Wicker s window and pored over the rope the ship and the Nubian boy he had never gone into mister Wicker s shop So now alone until someone should answer the bell he looked eagerly if uneasily around him What with the one window and the lowering day outside the long narrow shop was somber The ceiling seemed close above Chris s head Heavy hand hewn beams crossed it from one side to the other A few dusty pieces of furniture stood about whether for sale or for use Chris could not determine and almost lost in the black shadows at the far end were what appeared to be boxes and bales piled one upon the other Illustration The growing silence now the bell had stopped gripped Chris A chill made itself felt in his feet and spread rapidly over his body so that he gave a convulsive shiver He was about to turn and go out when at the farthest end of the gloomy shop a small primrose oblong of light seeped for a little way along the floor and a door opened Fascinated Chris stared as into this distant pallor stepped the short and remarkably spidery figure of a man mister Wicker s back being toward the source of light Chris could not see his face The figure paused with a fragile hand scarcely bigger than that of a child s on the doorhandle and then came forward The silence Chris noticed was still unbroken as mister Wicker advanced toward him and Chris shuddered again as he stood waiting and watching but whether it was with cold or with fear and the room was indeed very dank and unaired it would have been hard to say When mister Wicker had come within a few feet of Chris the final vestiges of daylight from outside reached the extraordinary man facing the boy and for the first time Chris was able to examine the old man who was more legend than fact throughout Georgetown William Wicker s face in itself was not forbidding What made an icy mouse seem to run the length of Chris s spine was the impression of enormous age in the appearance of the man confronting him The thin lips crackled the withered and multi wrinkled cheeks in the ghost of what had once been a smile The nose once hawk like and proud and denoting strength of character and purpose was now pinched by the ever tightening fingers of a progression of years The double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheekbones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead Little tufts of white fuzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarian s hair but what drew and held Chris s gaze were the old man s eyes mister Wicker s eyes were not those of an old man at all They had the vigor of a man in the prime of life and their presence in that puckered face of age which confronted Chris was horribly disconcerting Chris blinked and looked again Yes they were still there Eyes so deeply brown they might well have been black but clear sparkling and with a decided glint of humor and mischief While the boy had been too frightened to move at the sight of mister Wicker s ancient cheeks pinched nose and hairless head he was encouraged by the friendly eyes Chris could not help but like those eyes even though it was hard to believe they belonged to the man before him As though from a great distance mister Wicker s voice came to his ears and this too Chris found difficult to credit There not four feet in front of him was the old shopkeeper and yet the high thin voice might have come from anywhere else the rafters the room beyond the lighted door anywhere Well my boy You wanted something Chris swallowed and his voice came back to him Yes sir he said I saw your sign and I know a boy who needs the job He looked at mister Wicker as though he were unable to look elsewhere He s a schoolmate of mine Jakey Harris his name is and he really needs the job I wondered mister Wicker s eyes laughing at him just a little confused Chris and he began to stammer I I just wondered if the place was still open mister Wicker studied Chris for a moment or two before he replied What he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humor in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes His chin showed obstinacy and tenacity his nose would shape itself well as he grew older Unruly tawny hair was blown and ruffled in every direction and his hands even young as he was showed ability and strength Hm mm said mister Wicker and his remote smile broadened while his eyes sparkled with the warmth of a fire on a winter s night Hm mm Yes The job is still open young man but while you re here why not apply for it yourself Chris somewhat less ill at ease now he had got his message out shifted his feet and gave a short laugh Oh no thank you sir You see I don t really need it and Jakey does It wouldn t be fair for me to take it if Jakey has a chance He looked away and saw that the light from the distant hidden room was jumping and flickering on the shadowed walls He guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond Of course Chris added anxiously I don t know what the job is You don t say on the sign and Jakey isn t awfully well He has a twisted foot and it makes him slow in walking Would that interfere with Jakey s getting the job sir Chris enquired The reply was slow in coming and Chris heard as if the words had been spoken not before him where the black outlined figure still stood but as if at his very ear Soft but clear the words sounded It would not interfere Christopher my boy But now that you are here you must make the test Jakey will be cared for never fear Almost as in a dream Chris felt an atmosphere drenching him as though a powerful scent filled the air His head swam a little and he realized that it was a long time since he had had lunch He thought he detected a pleasant smell of herbs like the potpourri his mother had in bowls in their house The sharp black outline of mister Wicker impressed itself on his eyeballs and in the room now totally dark except for the light that streamed from the faraway open door mister Wicker s body seemed to radiate a bright edge like a carbon paper held up to the sun The voice at his ear once more filled his head and his hearing You will make the test my boy Now Just turn around and tell me what you see out my window Illustration Chris in spite of the strangeness rising about him like a mist remembered very well what lay outside the window But even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind Why had he not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up around the corner of Water Street and up the hill toward the traffic signals And why had the sound of wheels of gears and of horns been so completely muffled out The room seemed overly still Then in that second he turned and faced about The wide bow window was there before him the three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that poured in from across the water Across the water Where was the freeway It was no longer there nor were the high walls and smokestacks of factories to be seen The warehouses were still there They were the very same for Chris could make out the winch and tackle he had noticed as he opened the door But instead of factories instead of the freeway the river flickered silver under the moon and the hulls and masts of countless ships broke the starry sky Flabbergasted and breathless Chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction No electric signs no lamplit streets Going as far as the wall to his left and leaning forward Chris looked up toward M Street Where the People s Drugstore had stood but a half hour before rose the roofs of what was evidently an inn A courtyard was sparsely lit by a flaring torch or two showing a swinging sign hung on a post The post was planted at the edge of what was now a broad and muddy road Even as Chris stared not knowing whether to believe what his eyes saw or not there was a great sound of hoofs and of a cracking whip A coach with its top piled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flagged courtyard Ostlers ran out to hold the team of horses steaming in the cool night air and linkboys carrying torches and orange lanterns ran out to help the travelers in The coachman wore knee breeches and a cockaded hat two gentlemen got down from the interior of the coach stretching their cramped legs Chris could catch the shine as lantern glow touched the silver buckles on their shoes Their full backed coats were slightly lifted on the left by the tips of their rapiers and a froth of white lace or muslin fell from their necks onto satin waistcoats They moved into the inn the coach rattled off to the stable Before the window farm carts rumbled by and instead of the crowded outline of Georgetown roofs Chris could see only a few chimneys against the stars and many lofty trees What do you see boy asked the voice so gentle at his ear Chris frightened and dumbfounded shook his head I will tell you mister Wicker said My window has a power for those few who are to see You are looking back into the past my boy The way it used to be Then the coldness the strangeness the fluttering of the light was too much for Chris Blackness descended on him as if a hood had been dropped over his head but before he was quite gone he heard what he thought was mister Wicker s voice saying kindly You will do CHAPTER four When Chris came to himself he woke from sleep and lay for a moment without opening his eyes He waited with his usual sense of irritation for Aunt Rachel s step at the door and her voice saying Get up Chris You re late again But the step did not come and feeling rested and hungry Chris opened his eyes What was this The high regular walls of his bedroom were not around him nor the familiar furniture Chris sat up rubbing at his eyes as if this would help to clear his vision and looked about him He was in a narrow bed in a small sunny room An attic room it would seem to be for the walls slanted down in different sharp angles from the low ceiling to the broad wood planks of the floor Two dormer windows projected from the room beyond the roof making two niches in the wall across from where Chris lay and a third window in the wall above his head showed that the room as well as being at the top of the house was also at a corner of it A door was just beyond the foot of the bed a chest of drawers and a table with a blue and white porcelain wash bowl and pitcher stood along the farther side Wooden pegs were placed at hand level here and there and a rag rug in bright colors lay on the floor by the bed The walls were white and the sunlight poured in to dash itself upon the floor and splash up the walls in irresistible gaiety There was no doubt about it bare though it was it was a pleasing room snug clean and cheerful and somehow well suited to a thirteen year old boy Chris half smiled as he looked leaning on one elbow and then his smile faded as he caught sight of the chair and what it held The only chair in the room was laid with carefully folded clothes But they were not Chris s clothes Chris jumped out of bed and then looked down with a quick startled intake of his breath He was wearing a white nightshirt something he had never even seen before and barely heard of The sleeves were long and cuffed and the nightshirt fell in linen lines to his feet Golly Moses Chris exclaimed completely baffled He returned to the examination of the clothes that were obviously laid out for him There was a fine white shirt with full sleeves and turned back cuffs White cotton stockings knee breeches of a blue gray worsted material and matching frock coat with silver carved buttons Below the chair Chris saw was a pair of black leather shoes with polished silver buckles Fancy dress huh Chris murmured and then as if he had been slapped into full awareness came the remembrance of the evening before of mister Wicker and of the dark flickering shop Chris sat down suddenly on the edge of the bed his mouth in spite of all his efforts drawn down at the corners and his eyes blank with confusion and misery Oh my golly Chris said and stared at the clothes he still held in his hands Then another idea struck him and he jumped up to run to the nearest dormer window the floorboards where the sun had lain on them warm under his bare feet But no No freeway no factories The window looked out over Water Street skirting the edge of the Potomac banks and there below Chris s amazed eyes rose a forest of masts and spars of ships at anchor along the shore Water Street below him was swarming with activity but not the activity that Chris had previously known Men dressed in the same sort of clothes as those laid out for him pushed at cotton bales rolled hogsheads along to the docks or rowed out to ships anchored in midstream Most of the stevedores were hatless and Chris snickered at the sight of the short braid of hair at the napes of their necks Many wore brilliant scarves tied around their heads red or mustard yellow or green and the sound of deep voices swearing laughing or rising in unfamiliar sea chanteys excited Chris and sent the blood tingling along his veins He rushed to the high placed window overlooking Wisconsin Avenue No Key Bridge was to be seen in the distance only stretches of fields and orchards scattered with occasional houses of russet brick and when he craned his neck there was the inn where the People s Drugstore ought to be the sign swinging high above the road Wisconsin Avenue Chris had to laugh If it could see itself Only a wide muddy road full of ruts and puddles along which someone s line of geese was waddling impervious to the cursing of passing carters and riders on horseback A little below him Chris could see the two old warehouses he remembered from the night before But now they looked quite new their bricks bright and their walls solid Barrels were being lifted by the winch and tackle into the upper loft and Chris watched the busy scene for quite some time His rolling stomach and a simultaneous smell of food reminded him of his hunger Dressing quickly in the strange new clothes he opened the door and peered outside His bedroom door was at the top of a narrow curling stair that twisted away to the left out of sight It was steep and Chris stood silent and intent on the top step listening A deep woman s voice loudly singing Farewell and Adieu to you Spanish ladies came rolling up the stairwell to the accompaniment of a brisk clatter of pots and pans What rose also to Chris s nostrils was a smell of newly baked bread frying bacon and woodsmoke and the combination put an end to his indecision For a while he decided to call a truce to any attempt at solving the mystery in which he found himself and following his nose went softly down the stairs Rounding the last turn of the staircase Chris remained in its shadow while he stared with unbelieving eyes at the room and figure before him If this is a dream he said in himself it s the best one I ve ever had the very best What confronted Chris was mister Wicker s kitchen This room took up almost all of the side wing of the house Across from Chris two casement windows showed the shrubs and flowers and white picket fence of mister Wicker s garden and at his left was the back door opening onto Water Street flanked by two smaller windows These seemed most inviting each possessing a window seat from which one could watch the busy comings and goings of the docks with a view of the ships beyond But what drew Chris s eyes and made them grow round with wonder was the extraordinary figure in front of the fireplace The vast deeply set fireplace was in the wall that faced the back door So deep it was that there was even a bench on one side of it and over the smoking logs were hung all manner of trivets spits and cooking irons It was in short a fireplace such as Chris had never dreamed of Yet the tall buxom woman stirring the hissing pots and singing to herself was what held Chris rooted to the last step of the attic stair The woman stood easily six feet broad and brawny enough to be a match for almost any man Countless yards of sprigged cotton must have gone into the making of her dress to say nothing of her apron A massive fichu of freshly laundered muslin went around her neck and was tucked into her bodice a white turban was on her head but on top of the turban Chris simply could not believe his eyes as he counted rapidly On top of this amazing woman s head was a gigantic hat supporting twenty four roses and twelve waving black plumes Chris s jaw dropped at the sight of the turbaned hatted head the flowers bobbing and swaying the ostrich plumes blowing and curtseying with every slightest movement Illustration As if blissfully unaware that her costume was not the usual one for cooking the woman hummed and stirred tasted and hung up her ladle But the sight was too much for Chris Before he could stop it a shout of laughter exploded from his lips He laughed and laughed and the indignant expression on the woman s face when she turned to stand glaring at him with her hands on her jutting hips only added to Chris s laughter At last sobering up somewhat as he realized that his behavior was rude to put it mildly Chris stopped and caught his breath shaken only now and again by a diminishing paroxysm Seeing the spark of bad temper in the red face of the enormous woman Chris decided to pour oil on the troubled waters Good morning ma am I I m Chris Mason from upstairs and I m sorry I laughed so loud I he floundered and grabbed desperately at any passing idea I saw something comical out the window there he pointed wildly and it just set me off I hope I didn t disturb you Mollified though not entirely the woman accepted this effort at peacemaking and her face eased a little Well now So you are awake at the last eh And hungry bein a boy I don t doubt She moved to the dresser and took down a mug and plate the roses and ostrich plumes nodding in evident agreement So you are Chris did you say Christopher that would be And I am Mistress Rebecca Boozer should you be wanting to know Becky Boozer they call me She bustled over to a covered bowl dipped out creamy milk with a long handled dipper and set bread butter and bacon in front of Chris at a table pulled up to one of the window seats Eat up now young man Becky Boozer advised every red rose and feather accenting her words for mister Wicker will be wanting to see you when you have done It s late Past eight of the clock She glanced out the window It might be just possible that Master Cilley will be passing by before long for a midmorning snack and here I am gossiping with you instead of getting on with my work Chris ate with a will looking around as he chewed The spotless brick floor and the starched curtains at the windows the shining copper pans hung beside the huge fireplace were proof of Becky Boozer s housekeeping Don t you have an icebox Chris asked his mouth full What may that be Becky asked sharply To keep the food cool Chris answered Becky stopped to consider this her hands on her hips We have a larder on the cool side of the house if that be what you mean she told him nodding Keeps the food pretty well up to April or May Then the heat makes everything go Oh This heat Prosperity Maryland where I come from and on the sea coast as it is was never like this A table with a wooden tub and dishes stacked nearby caught Chris s eye Buckets of water stood beneath the table and presently Becky Boozer took off a small pot of steaming water from a hook above the fire poured it in the tub and dipped cold water from one of the buckets into it What a system Chris thought as he watched Becky busy with her dishes thinking of the neat white kitchen he knew at home Aloud he said If you had a little wooden trough that led from that tub out through the window there you could pull out a bung when you were ready and the water would run outdoors It would save you carrying that great tub about when you are in a hurry Becky Boozer rested her soapy hands on the edge of the tub and looked at him admiringly over her shoulder I would never have thought it she said by the look of you Never in this world You have brains young lad that s what you have A better idea than that I never heard Indeed it is just what I have been a needin since years and that simple I might have thought it out myself I shall set Master Cilley to work on it when he comes He s right handy with tools is Ned Cilley At this moment a short knock sounded on the back door and an instant change came over Becky Boozer It was impossible to imagine that anyone as ponderous as Becky could be coy but at the sound of the knock this is what she became Wiping her hands hastily on one of many petticoats she pushed and pulled at her hat which remained immovable straightened her fichu and smoothing her dress she minced her huge bulk to the door with a welcoming smile A little man scarcely higher than Becky s barrel waist with a rolling sea gait and twinkling blue eyes bounced into the room and strained up on tiptoe toward Miss Boozer s blushing cheek Chris behind the opened door had not yet been perceived Come now Becky me love shouted Cilley the sailor in a good humored roar How can I start the day right thout a kiss from my Boozer Becky blushed and simpered and cast down her eyes Get along with you Cilley What a way to behave she admonished delighted and abashed See there s company here She pushed her suitor off with an elephantine shove and gestured to Chris Chris was feeling the contagion of laughter catching up with him again at the scene he had watched and was glad when the sailor turned and came over to where he sat A visitor eh Well well Off a ship Illustration No no Becky put in quickly and gave Chris a look No He is a friend of the master s from she searched her mind from another part of the country He got here last night and slept late as you see Indeed and indeed said the sailor settling himself comfortably and as if for a long stay in his chair and observing Chris through his keen blue eyes Well young man he announced genially I am Cilley he said and stretched out a hard brown hand Christopher Mason Chris said in return and they solemnly shook hands taking account of each other as men do when they meet I shall sit here Mistress Becky by your leave Cilley called out as if Becky Boozer were a mile away to keep this lad company as it were So you shall Becky answered warmly smiling broadly wrinkles of pleasure at the corners of her eyes And could I tempt you with a morsel Master Cilley Ned Cilley appeared to consider this invitation from all sides before he gave his reply cocking his head on one side like a parrot as he reflected Finally he answered How could I refuse when I know your fame as a cook he said with a smile at Becky and a wink at Chris and put his horny forefinger and thumb the distance of a thread apart But a crumb Mistress Becky A morsel A taste Just to pay my respects to your art as it were Then such a commotion took place in the kitchen Chris watched flabbergasted as Becky set before Cilley a meat pie a large cheese fruit preserves two kinds of bread cakes and cookies latticed tarts and pickles in jars And with a beaming smile Becky drew from a cask a jugful of ale which she set down on the table with a thud Just a morsel Master Cilley she said adding in a coaxing tone Try just a taste to please me Ned Cilley his eyes winking with anticipation and smacking his lips attacked the meat pie and the cheese tarts and pickles with a will Here try this he urged Chris heaping the boy s plate as lavishly as his own and the two ate in silence and gusto while Becky stood by with roses and feathers bobbing You must keep your strength up Ned Cilley she admonished for tis a hard life that you lead she warned him Ned paused long enough to swallow Aye that it is that it is he agreed wagging his head champing his jaws and digging into the food A hard life has a sailor Ned said with an effort at sorrow which failed signally and he took a great draught of the ale After a while Cilley slowed wiped his mouth with his hand and leaned back in his chair rolling a dazed eye at the anxious face of the waiting Becky Boozer Mistress Boozer he announced I am a new man He heaved a sigh of repletion You have saved me again Ah Mistress Becky what a treasure you are Becky curtsied and giggled her fabulous hat shaking as if with a secret all its own Just then a bell tinkled at the end of the kitchen passage That will be the master Becky said bustling away Then she turned I shall be back Master Cilley I pray you do not leave Chris seized his opportunity Please Master Cilley he asked leaning across the empty plates in his interest Why does she wear that queer hat Master Cilley cocked an eye at the boy before him picked comfortably at his teeth with an iron nail which he took from his pocket and loosened his belt buckle Ah he said So you ve not heard Quick then I shall tell you for that is truly a tale The sailor stretched back in his chair one hand holding the mug of ale His short nose and red wind burned cheeks seemed to share the joke with his eyes as he finally leaned forward across the table with an air of conspiracy CHAPTER five Well now began Cilley that s a tale that not everyone knows don t you see And Mistress Becky would not care to be reminded of it mark you for reasons I shall shortly tell His eyes humorous as they were took on a shrewdness under their sandy brows as if judging the character of the boy before him and his ability to keep a secret First and foremost he said You had best know who I am He leaned back and hooked his thumbs under his armpits in a prideful gesture My lad said Ned Cilley thrusting out his chin I am a member of the Mirabelle s crew The Mirabelle Chris exclaimed Why that s the ship in the bottle Aye agreed Cilley nodding sagely The model of it s in a bottle right enough since it s meself that made it the last trip home from the Chiny Seas You made it yourself Chris breathed looking aghast at the gnarled knotted fingers thick and roughened by work and weather picturing to himself the delicacy of the miniature ship that lay so snugly in its transparent walls How in the world could you get it inside he asked Ned wagged his head Ah tis a trick and a tedious thing no mistaking but there s time and to spare for it coming home from China China You ve been there What s it like Chris wanted to know his eyes eager Cilley smiled at him a snaggled toothed friendly grin That s a tale for another time my boy for there s much telling there You wanted the story of Becky s fine hat Yes yes Chris urged Before she comes back Well now began Cilley Bein a member of the Mirabelle and all means I see quite a bit of this port when we re home He looked arch as if Chris must know the reason for that An seein as how Mistress Becky and me are fast friends well she s told me a thing or two that not everyone knows He took a pull on the mug and wiped the froth from his lips It seems he began that in her younger days Mistress Becky had one craving She d seen this hat that she now wears in a milliner s and have it she must Now and the sailor leaned forward as the story held his own interest now a hat of that sort costs many a shilling and Becky worked and saved for that bonnet for over a year He eyed Chris again closely If you tell what I tell ye Chris lad Cilley conjured him I shall get even with ye I swear I will For I would never want to hurt the feelin s of Becky Boozer on my oath I ll not tell sir Not to anyone Chris assured him Ned Cilley seemed satisfied Well now hunching closer with his chair It seems at long last she paid for that bonnet and decided to wear it to the spectacle that very afternoon The spectacle Chris questioned his forehead wrinkled What s that Haw Haw cackled Cilley You are a country boy Why the spectacle where the players are The theatre what else Oh Chris said shortly and thought of television and the movies and held his tongue He was beginning to try to fit himself into two centuries before his own time Yes took up Cilley so as I was saying Mistress Boozer bein young and flighty in them days and rightful proud of the bonnet she had took so long to earn wore it to the spectacle together with her best gown Now as you seem not acquainted with the theatre me lad let me tell you that we give it here in any hall standing vacant and out of doors in fair weather and we set the benches in rows for those that pay for seats He pulled out an evil smelling clay pipe and stuffed it with tobacco tamping it down with one grubby forefinger and when it was well lit pointed the stem at Chris by way of emphasis Mistress Becky gets herself a good place on this occasion and sits herself down a tossin of her feathers and her flowers and as proud as a peacock every inch of her The people pack the benches and the performance then begins Rightly and Cilley jabbed the pipestem at Chris Rightly only ladies of quality wear such hats as Becky wore and should they go to the spectacle which would be doubtful for the crowd makes it no place for gentlewomen they would be sitting off apart don t you see But Becky sat spang in the center of the hall and you ve seen the hat Tis big enough for two and no mistake and spreads along as well as up well the time came to begin The players came out on the stage a speakin of their parts and abrandishin of their arms as they do when all at once a gentleman sitting behind Becky Boozer leaned forward and asked her ever so polite Madam sez he please be so good as to remove your bonnet Illustration Here Cilley leaned forward one hand on his stomach to facilitate a bow aping as best he could the speech and manners of a gentleman In a flash he resumed his own character and turned to Chris Well did she take it off Ned demanded of Chris frowning with concentration Twas asked with rare politeness anyone would agree to that He shook his head solemnly Why no Master Christopher that she did not Our Becky had just paid the final pence upon that hat and after a year seven months and eighteen days the hat was hers She wanted all beholders to admire it What cared she if the gentleman seated on the bench behind her saw more of her bonnet than of the play In Becky Boozer s opinion twas a more than fair exchange So she tossed her head did Becky and deigned not even a reply Illustration Cilley tossed his own sun bleached thatch and pursed up his mouth in imitation of Becky Then with another rapid change of grimace he squinted up his eyes to signify the growing intensity of the situation and leaning half way across the table shoved the dishes pies and pickles out of his way with his elbows His deep voice sank to a husky whisper So the performance went on and never a glimpse of it did the poor gentleman see seated as he was behind our Becky Boozer So once more he bends forward and he speaks at her ear urgent like Cilley s eyebrows rose and fell with his agitation So strong was the grip of the story upon him that it was evident that he fancied himself at the play and could see the whole thing before him as plain as day The poor gentleman says again he took up Madam he says I beg of you please to be so kind Nothing of the spectacle can I see Please and be so good as to remove your hat And would you believe it my lad no Ned Cilley shook his head from side to side No no you would not He leaned back waving his hand as if to wipe away any lingering doubt in Chris s mind Mistress Rebecca Boozer was that proud that proud he dropped his voice that not for the world would she remove her bonnet Dear me no She tossed her head again feeling all them plumes a tossin too and sat up straighter than before An she a tall woman Master Cilley took a red bandanna handkerchief from his coattail pocket and mopped his face so excited and heated had he become at his own telling of the tale Then once more he leaned forward confidentially Well little did she dream our Becky Boozer For when she tossed her head the second time and made no motion to remove her hat the gentleman bent toward her and no doubt his words were for her alone And this is what he said Ned Cilley s blue eyes popped and he cupped his hand by the side of his mouth so that his words could carry no further than the few inches dividing the boy and the man He said and so she told me it did sound like a roar of thunder though no one else did seem aware of it So then Rebecca Boozer wear your hat the gentleman said The Devil himself shall have no power to take it off n you And do you know whispered Cilley in a low rumble his eyes starting out of his head as were Chris s own Tis our belief it must have been the Devil himself who sat behind her there for from that very time Rebecca Boozer has been unable to remove that hat neither by pushing pulling prying steaming cutting tearing nor by any method howsomever The Devil it was The Devil it must have been Master Cilley exhausted by his recital fell back in his chair with just strength enough left to replenish his pewter mug from the jug of ale Then refreshed he set the mug down wiped his lips and cocked an eye at Chris who sat staring at him open mouthed Try it yourself he suggested wagging his head I have You ll not be able to heave it off that I promise you That hat is there for good and all Mistress Boozer will doubtless be buried in that bonnet He cocked his head the other way And what do you think of that Ned Cilley enquired After a long and thoughtful pause Chris found his voice Master Cilley he said respectfully Does she does she sleep in it he asked The picture of the elephantine Becky Boozer with a counter pane under her chin and the hat with twenty four red roses and twelve waving black plumes rising above the pillow took hold of the sailor s fancy He tipped back in his chair and laughed till he cried and as he was coughing and spluttering Mistress Boozer herself came rustling out of the passageway and across the kitchen to the table Be off with you boy she cried You and Cilley you re two of a kind that is plain to be seen She looked from one to the other and Chris decided that it was a good thing for him that Becky likened him to the object of her doting Master Cilley Get along with you she cried again pulling Chris up out of his chair by his coat collar You are wanted by the master in his study so look sharp It s down the passage and to your right Becky said and knock before you go in Chris started off but in the dusk of the passage he looked back in time to see Becky Boozer lost in tittering giggles and wild blushes as Master Cilley reaching up as high as his arm would go chucked her under the chin CHAPTER six Chris stood for a moment before the closed door of mister Wicker s study His head was full of the story of Becky Boozer s hat or he might have glimpsed the room beside him for the passage stopped at this point Beyond the passage lay the dimly glimmering shop with its bow window at the far end and the door to the street beside it He might have been able had he not been so intent on Becky s story to slip past the dusty bales and cases and out into what But Chris s head was ringing with Ned Cilley s tale and with all the things so different and so absorbing that surrounded him He put out his hand knocked and on hearing a low reply stepped inside The room Chris entered his eyes round in order to take in every new sight was a small study It stretched across the back of the house The kitchen fireplace had its echo in a fireplace on this side of the wall and facing Chris three windows looked out onto the pleached pear and apple trees the ordered rows of the vegetable and herb garden A final window at the end of the room at Chris s left looked out on a little hill behind the house Chris without thinking stepped forward a pace or two in order to look for the familiar ugly red and gray church at the end of Church Lane It was not to be seen There was only a pasture hemmed by woods and fine trees with in the distance where M Street should be a roof or two A thin voice that came from nowhere and was everywhere broke in to Chris No my boy The church is not yet built That will come in seventy years In eighteen sixty to be exact Confusing is it not Chris whipped about at the sound of the antiquarian s voice but for a moment longer he could not see him and looked toward the other end of the room with interest mister Wicker s study was cosy and bright well warmed by a cheerfully burning fire The heavy curtains drawn back now from the windows to let in the morning sun were of a fine ruby damask The furniture consisted as far as Chris was concerned of antiques Two wing chairs covered in red leather tacked at the edges with brassheaded nails looked invitingly comfortable One had its back to Chris and the door and the other was empty Both were drawn close to the snapping logs A grandfather clock stood in the corner between the fireplace and the first window and gave out a steady deep tock The carpet was a soft Indian rug of fine texture and many colors red blue and gold predominating Most surprisingly a steep spiral staircase of polished wood came down into the room in the right hand corner near where Chris stood and Chris wondered for a moment if mister Wicker s voice had come from the top of the stair Turning back he saw that a desk opposite him stood between the two windows that faced the garden It seemed very old fashioned to Chris no neat folded writing paper but large bold sheets covered in mister Wicker s delicate handwriting lay on the open top with several goose quill pens standing at the back in a penholder Chris noticed prints of sailing ships on the walls and candlesticks holding candles and candle snuffers on the desk table and mantelpiece A closed cupboard with carved doors stood at the far end of the room Once again Chris turned back to look for mister Wicker and to his astonishment now saw him in the chair that he had thought empty a moment before mister Wicker his elbows on the arms of the chair and his fingertips touched lightly together was watching Chris with interest and amusement When the boy caught sight of him mister Wicker nodded smiling and motioned Chris toward the other leather chair across from him Good morning my boy said the old man I trust you slept well Chris slowly let himself down into the offered chair Oh yes thank you sir he replied I don t even know how I got to bed mister Wicker made a sound that seemed to indicate that that did not matter And breakfast mister Wicker asked Becky fed you Yes sir And mister Cilley he fed me too Indeed mister Wicker s eyebrows went up in an inverted V above his bright dark eyes Ned Cilley so early Well he is a loyal soul is Cilley You shall know more of him Illustration He fell silent observing the boy sitting on the edge of the big chair mister Wicker looked as if casually at the clothes Chris now wore and which fitted him as though made to his measure What he saw seemed to please the old man for he nodded his bald head and his wrinkles multiplied themselves across his face in a way Chris took to be his smile At last he spoke again and his voice was strangely gentle and kind So kind that the forlornness Chris had momentarily forgotten at the mystery of his position the puzzlement and lost feeling that reclaimed him instantly should he allow himself to wonder at how he could get back again into his own life and time was reawakened by the something he heard in mister Wicker s voice The tears gathered in his throat and he had to swallow and cough several times before he could reply with any degree of clearness Illustration Feel Well all right I guess in a way But there s a sort of spinning in my head and my stomach if I try to figure any of this out I just don t get it He shook his head dubiously I feel alive all right and the food tasted good just now but how in the world can all the changes come about or be And there s something I should see to at home All at once he needed desperately to know how his mother was that morning He stood up abruptly If I can just go now please Chris asked politely but firmly It s been very interesting but I His throat tightened up again and he made a helpless gesture with his hand and looking toward the window wondered if he could jump out into the flower beds and be off mister Wicker s voice soft but with such authority that one did not question it came again and it had a healing in its sound Sit down Christopher my lad he said and his eyes were kind intent and eager We have much to talk of you and I But first your mind and heart shall be put at ease Do you know who I am Restive and anxious to be off Chris nevertheless found it necessary to reply You sell old stuff That s all I know he answered beginning to feel a trifle surly mister Wicker nodded tapping his fingertips together Yes he agreed I sell old things in your time But now in this time what do you know of me As he spoke there was a change of tone as if a younger man was speaking and in spite of his impatience to get home Chris looked up sharply mister Wicker was leaning forward and Chris felt himself immovable under the vigor of those dark eyes Nothing sir he heard himself saying not taking his eyes from those of the man before him I am a shipowner Christopher for one thing mister Wicker drew a slow breath A merchant trading in tobacco cotton corn and flour But I am also he paused as if to give Chris time to hear each word I am also quite a fine magician said mister Wicker Chris leaned back disappointed and scornful Rabbits out of hats he inquired No young man mister Wicker answered with no show of annoyance Not rabbits out of hats That as you would say is for toddlers Suppose I prove to you just how good Go ahead said Chris whose only thought was still to get home but who admitted to himself a faint stir of curiosity Watch closely then commanded mister Wicker I have been in my twentieth century shape so that you would recognize me Now I shall regain my appearance of this time not a great change I grant you but there will be a difference Watch me closely Chris leaned forward in his chair The room was well lit from three sides sunlight and firelight mingled to wash mister Wicker in their joined apricot glow Added to this the two chairs Chris s and mister Wicker s were not more than four feet apart Chris hunched forward yet a little more to lessen this space and watch for any movement however swift He had seen magicians before he told himself But what he saw was so amazing that Chris s lips parted in astonishment and his eyes stared unblinkingly For the tiny figure of the old man before him wizened with age and wrinkled past belief before his eyes shook off not ten or twenty years but one hundred and fifty It left him while not a young man middle aged a vigorous man of forty years The face was smoothed out and firm thick chestnut hair was caught back with a black ribbon bow Dark eyebrows were level above the steady eyes I don t believe it Chris breathed You looked almost like a mummy before And now mister Wicker rose from his chair and now he stood six feet no longer wizened no longer feeble Fascinating is it not he remarked with a sardonic smile A good trick do you not agree Chris sat looking at him amazed but still incredulous Well yes he admitted but maybe with make up or something Ah said mister Wicker and his voice was deeper and more vigorous too Ah Then we shall try another See if you can find me And before Chris s eyes mister Wicker vanished into thin air Chris looked about and got up He looked under the chairs under the table behind the curtains up the chimney up the spiral staircase out the windows in short everywhere and anywhere a man might hide and in a great many places where it was impossible for him to be Finally he stood in the middle of the room You re not here he said aloud Oh yes I am said mister Wicker s voice Look on the table Chris looked on the table A bowl of flowers stood in the center A small silver tray with a finely blown glass and a round bellied silver pitcher of water stood at one side A few leather bound books were all else to be seen except if one could count that a bluebottle fly that buzzed lit on the flowers and buzzed again Illustration It s not fair Chris challenged aloud You ve got some trick hiding place You re just not here Yes I am came the voice I am within reach of your hand Christopher mister Wicker told him And I will reappear in whatever part of the room you wish Choose Chris looked around him and then pointed to the end window There he said by the window There s nothing anywhere around it Come back there Very well sounded mister Wicker s deep new voice The bluebottle fly buzzed upward from the table flew directly at Chris s nose hit it flew around his head and bumped into his ear Darn that ol fly Chris muttered and made a grab at it The bluebottle buzzed towards the window swirled about hit Chris on the nose again with remarkable stupidity and blundered off once more towards the window Chris ran after it saw it on a pane of glass swooped down and felt the angry wings and heard the enraged buzz in his cupped hand But before he could either squeeze the fly or open his hand to let it free mister Wicker stood before him and Chris found himself holding on to the tail of mister Wicker s coat And what did you think of that trick asked mister Wicker smiling CHAPTER seven Chris was speechless and mister Wicker answered himself Yes it is a good trick but before we talk I should like to show you one more He dropped his hand on Chris s shoulder and somehow the firm touch was wonderfully comforting to the boy You want to be at home do you not Christopher mister Wicker asked Yes sir Please Well that cannot be for a time mister Wicker replied for you have important work to do mister Wicker turned and walked back to the two leather chairs with his hand still on Chris s shoulder He stopped near the table and looked down I know that all this he waved a hand to take in not only the room but Chris thought the different time as well all this seems impossible to understand He paused pondering Perhaps we had better sit down and I will try to make it understandable Let me put it this way mister Wicker began when they were seated once more in their chairs before the fire You have a television set at home Oh yes Chris agreed enthusiastically And say Some of the programs Yes they are splendid I know mister Wicker broke in But will you please explain to me how television works Chris stared at his questioner for a moment and then settled back in his chair his forehead puckered with concentration Well gee He stopped Well he began again I think it has to do with light rays passing through a well hm mm there s an electric impulse see I guess it s that that sends out He stopped altogether Well golly Moses mister Wicker he ended lamely it seems to be pretty complicated to go into mister Wicker smiled a wide engaging smile showing strong white teeth It is he agreed warmly his eyes twinkling Is it not Very complicated You probably would not be able to describe to me the details of how the radio or long distance telephone work either would you young man Chris had to grin back when he saw that mister Wicker was not laughing at him but rather at the complexity of such mechanical things No sir I guess not We re just glad to be able to use them I expect Ah said mister Wicker in a tone of immense satisfaction Quite so You are just glad to be able to use and enjoy them Well then my boy the things I have just shown you and what I am about to show you now are parts of knowledge which are yet to be discovered and learned in a time beyond your own And the ability to move within Time within Time mister Wicker stressed leaning forward toward Chris that faculty is also still in the future In the meantime it remains a rare gift mister Wicker put out a lean strong hand and tapped Chris s knee Illustration You have it Christopher You were born with the ability to move backward into time that has passed Whether or not you will ever master the gift of moving into the future that of course mister Wicker shrugged is impossible to tell You may But for my purposes that you have been able to return this far is enough He looked searchingly at Chris Have you understood what I have been saying up to now he asked I think so sir Chris answered slowly This ability to move back and forth in Time mister Wicker continued is no more farfetched than the ability to send colored images and sound across the land into your own house where you can see and hear them It is something which so far and I mean of course in your time has not yet been discovered But it will be mused mister Wicker thoughtfully pulling at his underlip with thumb and forefinger Yes it will be He looked across at Chris as if returning from a great distance But until it has been it appears fantastic does it not It certainly does Chris replied with fervor If it weren t happening to me I wouldn t believe it No nodded mister Wicker and I would not blame you But now he announced rising and turning toward the table you must have your mind set at rest regarding your mother He motioned for Chris to join him You will need to know only once and they say he smiled down at the boy beside him they say that seeing is believing so you shall see for yourself mister Wicker picked up the round bellied silver pitcher and set it in front of Chris They say too mister Wicker said scornfully that crystal balls are the things to look into Perfect tommyrot This will do equally well Look and see Chris bent to peer at the polished silver side of the pitcher At first it shone as no doubt it always did from Becky Boozer s powerful rubbing Then as he watched the rounded side of the pitcher misted over as if it had been filled with ice water Next the center of the misted portion cleared away and as it cleared a picture formed welling up into his sight as if from within the pitcher through the silver of its sides What Chris saw was a hospital room On a white bed lay his mother and beside her were his Aunt Rachel and a white coated man Chris took to be a doctor Then as if inside his head for he was not conscious of sound within the room which had grown deeply still he heard voices and words and saw the lips of the doctor and his Aunt Rachel move The doctor said The turn has come She will pull through but she will need watchful care Oh thank God Thank God his Aunt Rachel cried and covering her face with her hands she burst into tears The scene misted over once again and when it cleared the pitcher was merely a pitcher on a table in mister Wicker s room Chris looked up at the man who regarded him gravely Is that a trick too he asked Just to make me stay he demanded more loudly No son the man replied and his eyes confirmed his words That is how it really is My word of honor And to Chris s great surprise all at once he felt tears on his cheeks while simultaneously a great lightness invaded him and a wild wish to laugh mister Wicker poured him a glass of water and held it out Drink this he said All is well You can be at peace And now he went on in a brisker tone replacing the glass Chris had drained let us begin our talk CHAPTER eight Chris returned happily to his chair and curled up in it as if he were at home Even mister Wicker s expression seemed to have changed and as a matter of fact it had for the relief and portion of content that showed now in the boy s face was reflected in some measure in that of the man Before seating himself mister Wicker rang a silver bell on the tray by the pitcher In a moment Becky Boozer knocked on the door and stuck her gigantic hat through the opening You rang sir she inquired the feathers and roses bobbing as cheerily as live things around the sweeping brim I did Becky It occurred to me said mister Wicker looking sideways at Chris that some hot chocolate for Master Christopher and coffee for me would not be amiss at this hour of the morning And he added seeing the interested spark in the boy s eyes some of your delicious little cakes perhaps Most certainly beamed Becky most certainly sir I have the chocolate hot as it so happens and some cakes new baked She bustled off and in no time returned with a tray of china cups matching flowered pots for coffee and for chocolate a bowl of sugar and a plate piled high with cakes From one corner Becky pulled out a small table which she placed between the two chairs The tray was safely settled the fire given a poke and a fresh log before Mistress Boozer removed herself in her starched dress and apron and her outrageous hat from her master s study Now said mister Wicker pouring out the steaming drinks we shall refresh ourselves and you shall listen if you will Chris took a sip of the hot chocolate and a bite of golden cake deciding that he had never tasted better This point decided on within himself he gave his attention to the man across from him I told you mister Wicker said that I was a shipowner and a merchant That is true But these are troubled times A revolution has had the land in its grasp Times are bad and this vast land is now convulsed with the birth throes of democracy Money is hard to come by and much needed for General Washington s troops were farmers called away from their harvesting or sowing The period of healing for them and for the land will be long and costly He paused to sip his coffee and then put the cup down Destruction is so fast and to construct and build mister Wicker said staring at the fire that is what is slow He turned to Chris Without financial help without money for the beginning of this new land and this new government that is struggling to be born this free place and this fine democratic experiment will fail I know a way to save it and you have been sent back into the past from our future my future and yours and that of the land to help us and make it real You will not disappoint me Christopher mister Wicker turned burning eyes on Chris s face You will help your country get its start A wave of excitement such as he had never known surged over Chris and he started to his feet almost upsetting the table and making the cups rattle on their saucers Oh yes sir You bet If I can I ll help mister Wicker s face expressed his satisfaction He rose too and held out his hand I knew you would he said It had to be for 
4243_187024_000007_000001	train-clean-360	it could be 
none	none	no other way But there is always doubt Your hand my boy for we have work to do together The two hands large and small were firm one in the other and Chris felt a new power coming to him from the man whose hand he grasped Listen closely mister Wicker said and Chris drew nearer There is a wondrous thing unique in the world and which for the benefit of this growing country we must obtain Its possession will mean we can pay for many things a new city here tools building materials This wonderful object is the Jewel Tree belonging to the Princess of China Chris waited listening This Jewel Tree mister Wicker went on is a tree that grows that puts out leaves and flowers and bears fruit but here is the wonder of it and he bent his piercing eyes on Chris s intent face This growing tree is made of jewels leaves and flowers and even seeded fruit The leaves are emeralds the flowers diamonds and sapphires the fruits huge rubies seeded thick with pearls Imagine such a treasure if you can He spread his arms wide and Chris s eyes were shining with excitement Imagine the possession of such a plant mister Wicker went on Break off a branch of it another grows And flowers and fruit much like your orange trees bear both their fruit and flowers at the same time They sat down again the better to continue their conversation The taking of such a prize would be hard enough mister Wicker continued for it is well guarded But there is a greater hazard He rose from his chair to walk about in his nervousness and eagerness at what lay ahead Then he went on There is a man here posing as a merchant Claggett Chew You will see him in the town when you walk there which you shall do presently But he has some magic powers and knows me well Too well mister Wicker shook his head and his eyes became slits of rage We have been enemies for long said mister Wicker but he has yet to get the better of me Is he after the Jewel Tree too Chris wanted to know He is He heard of it by power of magic certainly for it is a secret so well guarded that those who carry knowledge of it all but myself up to this time all others have died before they could make use of it You can well imagine mister Wicker enlarged turning his gaze on Chris that a treasure that replenishes itself is beyond price The Chinese Emperor knows it well So do the guards about his palaces and so does Claggett Chew mister Wicker strode about striking the closed fist of one hand into the palm of the other and Chris scrambled out of his chair to stand watching the pacing figure And it came to Chris as he followed with his eyes the black swinging coat the silver buckled black knee breeches the neat white stock and black brocaded waistcoat of the magician it came to him that he had a great confidence and affection for this man Even knowing him as little as he did having to take so much on trust still in Chris s mind there was no smallest grain of doubt suspicion or distrust He knew without having to think it out that mister Wicker was a great man great in knowledge and in heart Reliable and kind and wise In that moment Chris put his whole faith in a man he had not known yet for a day Illustration There is one way mister Wicker said wheeling about and standing still and that is where I need your help He strode back across the room towards Chris This villain Claggett Chew for that is what he is no better this villain knows me and he knows my power But if my power were in a boy a lad he never would suspect then mister Wicker put both hands on Chris s shoulders and looked searchingly at him then only would we have an opportunity to seize the Jewel Tree Can you learn what I know demanded mister Wicker Can you learn my magic Magic Chris stammered Those tricks the fly and others Yes said mister Wicker quietly Many more Well Chris answered after a moment s thought I got here didn t I I ve gone back all these years so I guess I could He looked up with a grin At least I can try he said mister Wicker gave Chris s shoulder a little shake of pride and acceptance Good lad he said I know that you can learn For you it will not be hard There s just one thing Chris said with puzzlement in his voice You say sir Seize the Tree That means just stealing it Must we do that mister Wicker looked at Chris and his face was serene and smooth with the great satisfaction of his feelings You are the lad for me he cried and Chris felt himself coloring with pleasure at the tone of mister Wicker s voice I knew it from the first It would be stealing boy but for one thing When and heaven willing if you reach the Tree you will break a branch from it and stick it in the ground It will root itself and grow and thrive and the Princess will still have delicate jewel flowers for her hair And now he said I smell a broiling chicken Off you go and eat your lunch and later we shall talk again Chris went out smiling CHAPTER nine In the kitchen Chris leaned against the corner of the passage and kitchen wall to watch Becky at her tasks How different from the compact white kitchen they had at home And yet there was a cosy feeling about the huge room in front of him with its ruddy copper utensils tub size wicker basket of vegetables steaming pots hung over the fire and the browning row of four chickens on a revolving spit that gave out a friendliness and welcome modern kitchens did not have Becky finally paused in her work long enough to glance out from under her hat at Chris Now then me lad Tis not yet time to eat That young belly of yours takes a bit of filling and no mistake Be off now and do you not go a bothering Becky for a bit I will soon call you when all s done Chris would have liked to go outside and put his hand on the handle of the back door when a momentary confusion overtook him He wondered if in going out he would step back into his own time before he had completed the work mister Wicker wanted him to do and suddenly unsure turned away regretfully Not knowing where else to go he climbed the stairs to his bedroom Becky had made his bed and the little room looked spruce Chris walked into one of the niches made by the projecting windows pushed up the sash and leaned perilously out This was to be the first of many such times that Chris was to lean out so king of this new world spread out below him as far as the eye could reach A vast and absorbing panorama lay beneath and beyond him Immediately below turned Water Street narrow and muddy while the broad wharves and wooden storehouses spaced themselves at intervals along the shore Beyond the sailing ships of all kinds that he had admired that morning pointed their bowsprits along the docks or swung at anchor along the river Chris looked down at the many vessels He could not tell one from another but names began to drift into his mind from some forgotten trip to a museum or from the pages of a book read long ago Frigate schooner brigantine Good ships all The creak of rigging sounded in the names the harsh whip of salty winds and the heart lifting sight of white sails cutting across blue water Chris leaned on his arms his eyes shining If he should ever go to sea in a sailing ship what a day that would be And then he remembered that he must do so if he were ever to obtain the fabulous Jewel Tree All at once the dangers of such a quest were terrifying and Chris turned his thoughts away from them to look at the view Where the city of Washington lay in his time were only woods and marshlands No Monument no Lincoln Memorial no houses Lying in the river like a great green ship he could see the island which had once belonged to his ancestor George Mason Once Now it probably still did He could make out figures moving at the bank of it and a ferry pushing off from the shore Illustration What fun this was Chris gave a chuckle out loud What a chance to see what once had been He was enjoying himself increasingly as he glanced down at the activity along the riverbanks Illustration So close to noon the sailors and stevedores had vanished to eat their meal and passers by were few The street was nearly deserted when along the hardened muddy ruts of Water Street Chris heard a wailing cry Pity the blind Pity the pore blind The boy looked down and the drop below him to the road made his head swim until he refused to think of it He saw below him a grotesque figure making its way turning its head toward the houses as it made its cry It was a hunchbacked man with a wooden peg leg and a crutch Tied crisscross over his snarled hair were two black eye patches He was unshaven and in a rare state of filth his coat green with age and speckled with greasy stains the stocking on his one good leg wrinkling down into his shoe and his hands gnarled with long nailed fingers Chris gave an involuntary shudder but the sight of the man held his gaze for he had never seen anyone quite like him before As the cripple advanced slowly past the few houses of Water Street here and there a window was opened and a coin tossed out which the cripple held his cap for or grubbed with his filthy hands where he heard it fall Watching his progress Chris became fascinated with the accuracy with which the blind man caught the coins or found them in the road After a passing gentleman on horseback had tossed a silver piece in his direction the hunchback made off around the corner of the stables beyond mister Wicker s garden The boy hung out even farther and craned his neck to see what the blind man would do for from his determined gait he seemed to have a purpose Feeling along the side of the barn to guide himself when he came to the back of it the cripple darted around and then to Chris s amazement lifted the corner of one black eye patch and peered out from under it Seeing no one and thinking himself unobserved the cripple nonchalantly pushed both eye patches onto his forehead fished in his pocket and began examining the silver piece he had just retrieved It appeared to satisfy his scrutiny turn it over and over though he did but to be quite sure of its value he bit tentatively on it with his back teeth This seemed to be the final test for the cripple grinned from ear to ear disclosing even fewer teeth than Master Cilley Next the hunchback sat down upon a heap of straw laying his crutch beside him and with a quick movement wriggled himself out of not only his jacket but his humpback too Chris could scarcely believe his eyes but he now saw that a false hump had been cleverly sewn into the jacket from inside The cripple untied a patch that formed a trap door in the hump and putting his hand inside the hollow drew from its hiding place in the false hump a small bag tied at the neck with a string Then as Chris watched he counted the contents of the bag pieces of money that winked in the sun and added to his horde those pieces he had begged that morning The bag was then retied replaced and the jacket and hump put back on its wearer with evident satisfaction But the cripple had not yet completed his work Holding the silver piece between the blackened stubs of his front teeth with difficulty he managed to hoist his peg leg over his good knee Then after darting many a sly look all about him he unstrapped the wooden peg off the stump of his leg First from the interior of the stump he pulled out an assortment of rags used for stuffing and to cushion the weight of his stump Then after spreading a torn bandanna handkerchief near him he tipped up the stump and from its hollow peg out rained a shower of coins Chris looked and looked again Gold and silver money flashed on the crumpled handkerchief and adding to it the last silver piece he had held in his teeth the loathsome cripple stirred the heap around and around with one dirty forefinger his mouth stretched in a cackle of greed After a while he caught up the coins counting them over not once but many times and at last let them fall slowly one by one into the hollow peg of his stump strapping it back securely Finally after looking about with his face close to the ground to make sure that no smallest coin had escaped him the cripple replaced his eye patches and heaved himself up with his crutch under his arm turning to make his way once more toward the docks and the ships His wailing cry lagged behind him like a cur dog Pity the blind Pity the pore crippled blind Yet Chris now noticed that his head was tilted back to enable him to see under the patches as he went The boy was straining to see him out of sight when a resounding bellow from Becky Boozer let him know that dinner was ready Hastily shutting the window and running downstairs Chris could think of only one thing Becky he cried bursting out at the bottom of the stairs Who is the blind man that just went by the hunchback Becky never even turned from the plate she was preparing Oh him That would be Simon Gosler one of Claggett Chew s men How he can be a sailor beats me but Claggett Chew has hired him for years plague take him Now and she came toward the sunny table with a beaming smile eat up young man or I shall think my cooking does not please you Chris hurriedly set about proving his appreciation 
4222_187005_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER ten
none	none	 The learning of magic was by no means easy The days went by with Chris s mornings and afternoons spent in mister Wicker s study reading books too heavy for him to lift learning incantations by heart and how to blend simple formulae over the fire He had told his master at once about Simon Gosler his horde of money and his hiding places for it 
4222_187005_000002_000003	train-clean-360	mister Wicker though interested and attentive gave Chris the impression that what he had been told was not new to him 
none	none	At times Chris was allowed to run about the large vegetable garden and climb the orchard trees but he was told that the moment had not yet come when he could wander at will in early Georgetown Chris had tried it once rebellious and bored at the now familiar ground but it was as if an invisible wall kept him in the confines of mister Wicker s land a slippery glass wall he could feel but not see and in which he could discover no chink in which to put his toe to find the height of it 
4222_187005_000003_000001	train-clean-360	So there was nothing left to do but to work as fast and as well as he could 
none	none	There are rumors mister Wicker had told him quietly too quietly that Claggett Chew is preparing his ship the Venture for a voyage East There is much activity about his ship and he is laying in stores so I am informed We must get forward with all haste for his ship is a fast one faster than the Mirabelle Chris therefore threw himself into all the preliminaries of his task His head swam when he laid it on his pillow at night and Becky Boozer would stand with her hands on her barrel sized hips shaking her hat until its plumes and roses waved madly over her boy s shadowed eyes and weary air 
4222_187005_000005_000000	train-clean-360	For Chris was now as accepted a member of the household as mister Wicker himself and had it not been for the robust guffaws of Ned Cilley and the ministrations of the now devoted Becky Chris s days would have been tedious indeed 
none	none	One afternoon when he returned after a rest to mister Wicker s study he saw that there was something new in the room A bowl with a goldfish in it stood on the table but mister Wicker was not to be seen Now however Chris was not the boy he had been a few weeks before 
4222_187005_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He went straight to the bowl and addressed the fish 
4222_187005_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Sir he said to the goldfish I am here 
4222_187005_000007_000001	train-clean-360	What shall I do first 
none	none	The goldfish might almost have been said to have changed its expression and smiled before brushing a drop of water from his sleeve mister Wicker stood beside the table smiling
4222_187005_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 How you have improved my boy he exclaimed 
4222_187005_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 It is now time for you to try and this is as good a change as any 
4222_187005_000010_000000	train-clean-360	All at once at the imminent prospect of really changing himself into some other form Chris became frightened and his hands grew cold 
4222_187005_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh sir 
4222_187005_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Do you really think I know how he cried gazing up into the face of his master 
4222_187005_000011_000002	train-clean-360	 Suppose I change and can t change back 
4222_187005_000012_000000	train-clean-360	mister Wicker shook his head with a smile 
4222_187005_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Never fear Christopher 
4222_187005_000013_000001	train-clean-360	You know enough to start and I feel reasonably sure that you will be quite able to change back again 
4222_187005_000013_000002	train-clean-360	If you get stuck I can help you 
4222_187005_000013_000003	train-clean-360	Come now he said putting out his hand to touch Chris s shoulder in a reassuring way here you go 
4222_187005_000013_000004	train-clean-360	Remember Incantation Seventy three Book One 
4222_187005_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Chris stared at the fishbowl empty now 
none	none	He remembered Incantation seventy three Book One quite well but his knees began to tremble and he stood as if paralyzed mister Wicker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for Chris to get up his courage 
4222_187005_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Then as nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister Wicker said Start at once 
4243_187024_000013_000000	train-clean-360	nothing happened 
none	none	with a voice like a whip mister Wicker said Start at once Chris was so startled at his usually gentle master s tone that without further thought or effort on his part he began intoning to himself the words and sounds of Incantation seventy three Book One 
4222_187005_000016_000001	train-clean-360	As he went on concentrating on becoming a goldfish in the bowl on the table he became aware of a humming sensation in his head 
4222_187005_000016_000002	train-clean-360	This grew until it seemed that all his body was filled with the strange new vibration tingling from his feet to the crown of his head 
none	none	The sensation spread faster and faster 
4222_187005_000016_000004	train-clean-360	His head swam and he felt faint and a little sick but he persisted through the final words 
none	none	Somewhere deep inside him there seemed a sudden lurch and then a wonderfully cool liquid sensation He felt buoyant and rested and looked about only to get a wavery enlarged glimpse of mister Wicker looking more like a reflection in a circus mirror than himself With a light twist of his body Chris floated over to see that the room looked the same and rolling back could see that mister Wicker was peering in at him from above and smiling broadly Illustration Good Lord I m a fish Chris said and he heard the words muffled as they came back to him through the water of his bowl Well what do you know he thought not without a feeling of pride and commenced experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time elapsed before mister Wicker s voice boomed close by
4222_187005_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Better come back now 
none	none	Take it slowly son 
4222_187005_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Seventy four Book One The Return 
none	none	The same strange sensations flooded Chris as he made the change back to his own shape but when he stood once more on his own two feet on the carpet in mister Wicker s study he was pleased and happy despite his weakness mister Wicker took hold of his arm and helped him to a chair and taking a small vial from the cupboard at the end of the room he dropped a pellet into it and handed it to Chris
4222_187005_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 This will seem to smoke 
4222_187005_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Sniff the smoke and drink the liquid that remains he said 
none	none	Illustration Chris did as he was told and his momentary weakness vanished leaving him quieted and as strong as usual There now mister Wicker said rubbing his hands with immense satisfaction that was not so bad was it 
4222_187005_000024_000001	train-clean-360	A peculiar feeling but as you come to do it more often and more quickly the change will come more rapidly and in time you will be scarcely aware of the sensations at all He looked at his pupil with pride 
none	none	You will do famously my boy In another moment when you have rested we shall try another one 
4222_187005_000025_000000	train-clean-360	From that time Chris became increasingly proficient and as his ability grew he began to find magic a wonderful game which he and mister Wicker played together 
4222_187005_000025_000001	train-clean-360	They played this new and unique form of hide and seek each one taking a new shape turn by turn as a challenge to the other s powers of imagination and detection 
4222_187005_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Soon Chris could turn himself into a limited number of things for even mister Wicker s magic had a limit a singing bird in a cage a part of the pattern in the brocaded curtains or a section of the design in the Indian rug 
none	none	The bluebottle fly or the goldfish became as easy as saying Eureka and on one occasion Chris turned himself into the chair on which mister Wicker was sitting and then walked across the room on his four wooden legs carrying mister Wicker who laughed more heartily than he had in years at this display on the part of his student One day Chris wandered alone into the dusty shop The time had nearly come when he could walk about in early Georgetown and know that it would still be the Georgetown of the past and not the one into which he had been born 
4222_187005_000026_000002	train-clean-360	This afternoon a rainy one he had tired of changing himself into and out of objects 
none	none	mister Wicker was busy and Becky Boozer had gone off to market accompanied by Ned Cilley Chris felt somewhat forlorn and lonely as any boy might and kicked an old piece of wood ahead of him into the darkness of the shop Going up to the shop window he stood with his hands thrust into his pockets staring glumly first out the window and then idly at the three objects he had once loved to contemplate the Mirabelle in her bottle the coil of heavy rope and the carved wooden figure of the Nubian boy 
4222_187005_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Without interest at first Chris stared at the little Negro boy so gaily dressed in full red trousers gilded jacket and white turban The figure s shoes carved in some Eastern style had curved up pointing toes 
4222_187005_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Then all at once the idea came to Chris 
4222_187005_000028_000002	train-clean-360	If he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life 
4222_187005_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The prospect excited him wildly for he had no companion with whom to laugh and share jokes 
none	none	Grown people however gay and kind were never quite the same The more he thought of it the more Chris knew it had to be attempted He squatted on his haunches examining the carved wooden figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion But how did one change inanimate to animate Chris got up and stole back to mister Wicker s door 
4222_187005_000030_000002	train-clean-360	He heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was really empty Chris resumed his proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room 
4222_187005_000031_000000	train-clean-360	On its top shelf was Book Three a book a foot thick and bound in heavy brass studded with semi precious stones in the form of signs and symbols 
4222_187005_000031_000001	train-clean-360	With difficulty standing on tiptoe Chris lifted it down and placing it on the floor turned over page after page 
4222_187005_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The afternoon rainy before increased in storm 
4222_187005_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Dusk came two hours before its time thunder snarled in the sky 
none	none	At last Chris found it 
4222_187005_000033_000001	train-clean-360	There were the words and there the charm Certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time 
4222_187005_000033_000002	train-clean-360	He hurried memorizing as he closed the book and hoisted it once more to its high shelf 
none	none	Looking about he found the ingredients that had been listed and in an empty vial poured first two drops of this and then seventeen of that and ran to heat it at the fire mister Wicker began moving about upstairs the floorboards creaked and still Chris could not leave until the potion fumed and glowed After what seemed an endless time amid a growing grind of thunder and in the almost darkened room the phial in Chris s hand gave off an arching rosy glow 
4222_187005_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Chris his cheeks hot from excitement and the fire tiptoed out just as mister Wicker s step creaked on the topmost tread of the spiral stair 
4222_187005_000035_000002	train-clean-360	With infinite caution Chris closed the door silently behind him and running lightly forward reached the figure of the Negro boy 
4222_187005_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The words came out interrupted by peals and cracks of thunder 
4222_187005_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The shop was black except for the paler crescent of the bow window giving onto the street 
none	none	With a crash of thunder all but drowning out his words the boy shouted in the emptiness of the shop as he poured the rosy liquid on the figure made of wood And then appalled at his audacity Chris dropped the phial which splintered on the floor Watching there in the darkness he shook so with nerves that he had to kneel 
4222_187005_000038_000000	train-clean-360	For in the blackness lit only by the lightning and its own eerie glow the wood was changing as he watched 
4222_187005_000039_000000	train-clean-360	It was as if the stiffness melted 
4222_187005_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Under his eyes the wooden folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its reality upon the coat and oh the face 
4222_187005_000039_000002	train-clean-360	The wooden grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of carved flowers moved and let the bouquet fall 
4222_187005_000039_000003	train-clean-360	The feet of the boy twitched and shifted in their pointed shoes 
none	none	Illustration Aghast Chris remained frozen as the boy moved slowly and a final Boom of thunder seemed to split the sky apart 
4222_187005_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Outside the rain poured down as if over some skyward dam 
none	none	The boy looked down at Chris with a radiant smile and put out his hand I ll help you up he said to the kneeling boy in front of him I am Amos 
4222_187005_000044_000000	train-clean-360	And as they turned the light and the dark hands holding firm the firelight was streaming from the distant door and mister Wicker waited 
4222_187006_000003_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER eleven
none	none	 From that time on Chris and Amos were inseparable with the exception of those times when Chris studied alone with mister Wicker Amos during these hours soon endeared himself to Becky Boozer to whom he became invaluable for he took over those chores Chris had undertaken as his share These consisted of carrying water peeling potatoes or watching the roasting meat in case it should burn For Chris had less and less time for such jobs and Amos s laughter and willing happy nature soon made Becky spoil him as much as she did Chris Another cot was put into Chris s room and night after night they would hang out the two mansard windows watching what went on below until it was too dark to see Or else they would talk by the light of their candle until they fell asleep Chris now knew how lonely he had been until he set Amos free from his wooden shroud but warned by mister Wicker he did not tell his new friend that he came from another year as yet unreached by the time they lived in It is enough for a while cautioned mister Wicker that Amos get used to being limber and alive 
4222_187006_000007_000001	train-clean-360	That is change enough from a carved wooden figure 
none	none	It would only confuse and trouble him to think you do not really belong where you are So let him be happy And I shall seal your lips with regard to the secret of the Jewel Tree for that must be known to no one and so saying he rubbed a salve over Chris s lips Now tell me what you are to journey after commanded mister Wicker But when Chris attempted to talk of the Jewel Tree the words would not pass his lips but remained in his mouth like a handful of marbles Good said mister Wicker rubbing his hands Not even to me Excellent stuff this he added turning the tiny case that contained the salve in his fingers I got it in India years ago and this is the last of it But I hardly imagine I shall need it again Its use is somewhat drastic but occasionally wise mister Wicker Chris said thoughtfully one afternoon after his lessons and memorizing were over for the day of the three things in your shop window that I liked best two have been explained Yet the third which still interests me seems to have had so far no significance I mean of course the rope Ah yes mister Wicker agreed nodding and stretching his feet out toward the fire the rope Very well my boy since it has come into your mind again that means that the time has come for you to discover its use Go and bring it to me Chris ran to get the coiled rope He experienced almost a shock when he touched it It had looked harsh and coarse to the touch of rough hemp fibre but on picking it up the coils in his hand seemed almost silky Certainly they were more than usually pliable Returning to the study the boy put the rope beside mister Wicker s chair The magician did not move his feet still stretched comfortably towards the flames His dark handsome face was dreamy and remote and Chris wondered in what faraway place or time his teacher moved The apprentice sat down cross legged with his back to the fire and presently mister Wicker took his gaze from the sparks and smoke to look thoughtfully at him You have heard of the Indian rope trick Christopher Yes and no sir Chris replied I m not sure how it works mister Wicker gave a chuckle Indeed Well let me tell you my boy no one else does either The rope is made to go up in the air so stiffly that the fakir that is the Eastern magician can climb it Some claim to have seen the fakirs climb up it and vanish from sight and the rope disappear after them mister Wicker waved one hand as much as to say that those who had seen it could believe as they pleased A good enough trick in its way condescended mister Wicker but this rope is capable of so much more remarkable possibilities as to throw the Indian rope trick completely in the shade With one of his quick gestures mister Wicker reached down for the rope and was up and out of his chair all in one movement You shall learn last of your lessons a new way of using a lasso Not lassoing mister Wicker held up a finger to stress his point that too you shall learn but how to use this particular rope to make the most of its shall we say qualities mister Wicker smiled his sardonic smile though his eyes were snapping as brightly as the fire Now Christopher he began running the rope through his long fine hands just push that table and the chairs to the wall there s a good lad and we shall get the stiffness out of this rope Chris cleared the room And pull the curtains my boy added his master for one never knows but that Amos or Becky Boozer might pass by at the crucial moment What they do not know murmured the magician is best for them Illustration When the room was satisfactorily arranged and candles had been lit Chris returned to stand by the fireplace beside his master who was turning the rope lightly in his fingers Now Christopher your attention please said the magician and his tone was crisp and authoritative Imagine that you are in need of a boat and there is no boat With several twists of his hands the rope spun out into the middle air of the room It moved and twisted like a live thing and mister Wicker Chris thought seemed to be drawing the outline of a boat in the air with the moving line Even as this thought flickered in his mind the rope formed in mid air the skeleton of a dingy and then mysteriously the rope added to itself until the bare struts and sides were filled in and there rocking lightly from the speed of its creation a small row boat hovered in the air as if it were tied up to a dock
4222_187006_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Go and feel of it Christopher mister Wicker urged 
none	none	Climb in it if you like I have left the two ends of the rope long enough to make oars if necessary Chris ran over and felt the sides of the boat It was sound and secure no doubt of that He went all around it pounding its sides and at last heaved himself over to fall into its center The boat never stirred and stamp as he would the rope bottom and gunwales resisted firmly Gee mister Wicker Chris exclaimed
4222_187006_000028_000002	train-clean-360	 This is the best yet except for Amos 
none	none	Golly Moses and as he sat down and took up the two loose ends of rope still remaining he found that he held not rope ends but two oars Even oars Chris cried in delight mister Wicker stood with his hands behind his back the firelight outlining his black clothes and neat dark head Yes he said in a matter of fact voice Quite so Now climb out and I will show you some of the other shapes of which it is capable A ladder mister Wicker remarked as Chris rejoined him is almost too simple We can do that at any time Grasping the end of one oar with movements too fast for Chris s eyes to follow in an instant the boat was a rope again coiled over mister Wicker s arm Now said mister Wicker and his eyes twinkled with mischief The rope flew out again but this time took a strange outline the outline of an elephant It will have to be a small elephant murmured mister Wicker his hands flying because of the size of the room The elephant like the boat took shape the final ends of the rope hanging down at its trunk and tail After the elephant came a horse an eagle and a dolphin and Chris s admiration and zest to learn the secrets of the rope grew with every change of shape Very well ended mister Wicker you shall learn And placing his hands over Chris s while the boy held the rope he began slowly to show him the magic twists and turns CHAPTER twelve The time had come when Chris could go out beyond the confines of mister Wicker s gardens It was a bright fall day when Amos and he stepped out the kitchen door 
3411-187007-0000	train-other-500	Becky Boozer s huge frame blocked it behind them as she stood in the sun to see them off Each boy had been given meat and bread some cakes and apples for their midday meal and Chris stood looking up and down the street for a moment before starting
3411-187007-0001	train-other-500	savoring the promise of new sights and new adventure
none	none	 The only drawback was that Amos would not 
3411-187007-0002	train-other-500	and must not know why Chris might be surprised at certain places Georgetown in the year seventeen ninety might be new for Amos but not nearly as new as it would be for Chris
none	none	 Where all are we going in the first place Amos asked 
3411-187007-0003	train-other-500	Chris had long ago decided
none	none	 We ll take a look at the Mirabelle he said 
3411-187007-0004	train-other-500	While looking about him Chris glanced more than once at Amos
none	none	 The colored boy s brilliant foreign costume was very noticeable 
3411-187007-0005	train-other-500	his friend thought but when no one paid any attention
none	none	 Chris decided Amos s clothes were not unfamiliar to the seafaring men among whom they were walking 
3411-187007-0006	train-other-500	A ship had just come in the sailors browned and cheerful at being once more in their home port Merchants in coats of fine but sober cloth were talking with the captain and mate while they kept an eye on the cargo being laboriously unloaded by stevedores
3411-187007-0007	train-other-500	For some time Chris and Amos stood watching the men carrying out bales or kegs on their shoulders When one part of the cargo had been assembled on the dock an auction was held forthwith to sell it off at once to the highest bidder
3411-187007-0008	train-other-500	Listening and looking Chris saw bolts of silk hardware china wines and liquors needles and pins all manner of things auctioned and sold The ship American owned had come from England
3411-187007-0009	train-other-500	and Chris overheard one man say to another See there the thin man That be mister Mason s agent I heard he s here to buy the ballast bricks for his master s plantation on the island Chris not understanding asked
none	none	 Ballast bricks Please sir what s that 
3411-187007-0010	train-other-500	The men astounded to be interrupted by a boy and looking down to see two each with an apple in his hands turned around and after a moment s scrutiny answered Ballast bricks
3411-187007-0011	train-other-500	Why anyone knows that these are the bricks brought over in the hold my lad should there not be sufficient cargo both to make ballast for the vessel and to sell once here English bricks are cheaper than those we can make ourselves Did you not know young man he said
3411-187007-0012	train-other-500	frowning with disapproval that our bricks for building houses have all come from British kilns No sir thank you sir
none	none	 Chris said and moved away 
3411-187007-0013	train-other-500	not in the least abashed How I should have loved to have told him I didn t belong in this age anyway and that in my time we do make our own bricks he chuckled to himself Further on a ship being painted a dazzling white caught their eyes The
none	none	 Mirabelle Chris cried 
3411-187007-0014	train-other-500	running forward and sure enough black and gold letters along her bow pronounced that indeed it was the Mirabelle I d know those lines anywhere Chris said to Amos and the two boys stood gazing at mister Wicker s ship
3411-187007-0015	train-other-500	The Mirabelle was a three masted schooner of more than usually trim lines
none	none	 Even at the dockside the curve of her bow gave an instant vision of how the waves would curl back as she drove forward over the sea 
3411-187007-0016	train-other-500	At the waterline a clear light green contrasted well with the white of her sides Above decks the size of the masts and neatly furled sails showed at a glance that the Mirabelle was hardy enough
none	none	 to weather many a storm and also that her crew were able and well trained 
3411-187007-0017	train-other-500	Looking about Chris soon spied Ned Cilley on deck lounging against the side of the ship and smoking his pipe Master Cilley s eyes lit up as he saw his friends
none	none	 and hurrying down the gangplank shook them by the hand as warmly 
3411-187007-0018	train-other-500	as if he had not seen them for a month instead of just the night before when he had shared with them what Becky termed a taste
none	none	 a mere spoonful of supper Eh well lookee here he exclaimed delighted Chris and Amos by me soul 
3411-187007-0019	train-other-500	Ned Cilley beamed on them and leaned back on his heels for a better view
none	none	 Lookin about lads Eh that s the way Is she not the finest ship that ever ye did rest your eyes on 
3411-187007-0020	train-other-500	The boys were agreeing enthusiastically when a remarkable couple came into sight pacing the decks of the Mirabelle Soon the watchers were given a better look for the two men came down the gangplank to examine cases that had been brought to the dock for loading
3411-187007-0021	train-other-500	and Chris and Amos were hard put to it not to laugh out loud at the comical pair The first man was so round and so short he appeared to have no legs at all
3411-187007-0022	train-other-500	Below a tight round paunch two small feet looking rather like mice went in and out as he walked The roundness of his face was underlined by three folds of chin
none	none	 but his small piercing blue eyes had a way of suddenly opening wide 
3411-187007-0023	train-other-500	that made Chris feel the man was no fool He constantly burbled with laughter and was in a high good humor occasional remarks from his companion causing him now and again to chuckle with amusement
3411-187007-0024	train-other-500	What the other man could be saying that was so entertaining Chris could not imagine for he was the opposite of the fat good humored one This second person was twice again as tall as the plump little fellow beside him
3411-187007-0025	train-other-500	and was as dour and thin as the other was cheery and fat He seemed in a state of perpetual depression and no amount of chuckles on the part of the plump gentleman
none	none	 could cause even a passing smile over the long sad face of the dour man Who in the world are they Chris asked of Cilley as they drew near 
3411-187007-0026	train-other-500	Cilley looked scandalized at Chris s impertinence in finding them in any way droll Them
none	none	 Why bless me cap and buttons That there s the captain of the Mirabelle no less and his first mate Captain Ezekial Blizzard 
3411-187007-0027	train-other-500	he is and mister Elisha Finney Ned Cilley told them
none	none	 watching the earnest conversation of the pair with evident affection Illustration Illustration Blizzard and Finney that s them he said And a better captain and first mate is not come by in the whole land I shall warrant you He may look too plump for his own good Master Cilley went on 
3411-187007-0028	train-other-500	lowering his voice and bending down to be on a level with Chris and Amos but believe me there s no sounder captain afloat They all know it hereabouts for Ezekial Blizzard knows the Chiny Seas better than the sight of his own feet
3411-187007-0029	train-other-500	make no mistake about it As to Elisha Finney he s glum
none	none	 I don t deny but faithful 
3411-187007-0030	train-other-500	That s true of the two of them whatever they can do for mister Wicker is law for Ezekial Blizzard and Elisha Finney They swear by mister Wicker so they do Ned said wagging his head with the certainty of it
none	none	 mister Finney s kind too Ned went on though he don t look it bless me cap and boots 
3411-187007-0031	train-other-500	He s tenderhearted as a bird under that gloom is Finney Could we go on board the ship Chris asked when the Captain and mister Finney had moved off to the far end of the wharf No me lad Cilley answered gravely
3411-187007-0032	train-other-500	Tis better not Wait till the master do present you proper to the Captain for the Mirabelle is Captain Blizzard s castle like I would sooner ye were asked aboard by him Then seeing Chris s crestfallen face
4243_187024_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 better not 
none	none	Wait till the master do present you proper to the Captain for the Mirabelle is Captain Blizzard s castle like I would sooner ye were asked aboard by him Then seeing Chris s crestfallen face Cilley clapped him so heartily on the back that the boy staggered forward a pace or two Come now Cheer up Ned cried Come meet some of the crew 
3411-187007-0033	train-other-500	he invited and taking Chris and Amos s arms drew them towards a group of seamen Chris looked quickly around at the faces of the men for these he secretly knew were to be his companions on a long sea journey soon to start
3411-187007-0034	train-other-500	With a deep sense of relief he found that he liked them all All perhaps but one
none	none	 Then he gave his attention to Ned Cilley who with a flourish was making the introductions Me lads he cried Here are two likely young uns living at the house of mister Wicker Ye ve heard me speak of them Amos here on me right and Chris that s on me other side He beamed at both and on the men confronting him 
3411-187007-0035	train-other-500	Now boys he roared this good man here is Bowie A short muscular bowlegged man with a friendly grin nodded his head at them and cut off a piece of black tobacco with his knife stuffing it into his mouth knife blade and all
none	none	 Chris gave a shiver as the blade went in and came out and Bowie champed contentedly on his chew This here s Elbert Jones Cilley went on 
3411-187007-0036	train-other-500	and that one s Abner Cloud and that one pointed Ned
none	none	 that one s Zachary Heigh Chris smiled and nodded or shook hands and Amos followed suit 
3411-187007-0037	train-other-500	but when they had reached Zachary a tall young man of eighteen years or so Zachary bent his handsome surly face and fumbled at his shoe Chris stood there with his hand out feeling the red blood surging angrily up his cheeks
3411-187007-0038	train-other-500	and then he wondered who Zachary was looking at from the corner of his eye Chris turned his head and did not have to hear the name muttered by Cilley or by Bowie at his back
none	none	 Chris found himself staring at Claggett Chew CHAPTER thirteen Claggett Chew possessed a face and bearing not easily forgotten A giant of a man standing well over six feet three he stood bareheaded in the morning sun Contrary to the custom of the time he wore no pigtail at his neck nor even hair caught back tied with a bow Claggett Chew s head was shaved so close that the pale skin of his skull showed through the peppery stubble making him seem bald Below the bare skull as if in counterbalance his black eyebrows started out tangled and thickly black and under them as out of a rocky cave his small pale eyes blinked like cornered foxes in their dens His nose overlarge to start with had at some time in his life been broken and its crooked shape leaned to the right as if still bending beneath the blow that had battered it Illustration A long untrimmed mustache shadowed his mouth and stray hairs caught inside his lips when he opened and closed them His lips like his eyes were pale and his skin sickly as that of a man who sees but little of the light His cheeks and chin were stubbly like his head his beard seemed more reluctant than half grown His whole appearance in his sallow yellow vest gun gray coat and breeches and canary colored stockings was one of mingled power and weakness strength joined with an unhealthy habit of never being in the sun and a cruelty best enjoyed when he knew that he could win His cold eyes pinned Chris with their gaze as if the boy were a butterfly transfixed by a pin His thin pallid lips curled with disdain and yet Chris thought uneasiness perhaps as he eyed the two lads and the little knot of men One strong too white hand held a whip its long leather tail ending like a scorpion s sting in a length of wire He held the five feet of the whip loosely caught in his hand against the plaited leather handle and Chris had an icy sensation as he looked at it that it was never far from the large white hand of Claggett Chew A little behind Claggett Chew examining the scene through a pair of jeweled lorgnettes stood an even weirder figure Osterbridge Hawsey whispered Ned Cilley as if to himself as he followed the direction of Chris s eyes Osterbridge Hawsey younger than Claggett Chew by twenty years to Claggett s forty was dressed in the height of the French mode Anything more out of place on the dirty swarming docks of Georgetown could scarcely have been imagined His three cornered hat was rakishly set at an angle on his fair hair which was meticulously rolled in curls above his ears and the curls were caught at his neck with a black velvet ribbon Beside Claggett Chew s offensive bare skull the hat in its delicate blue velvet silver braid and airy rim of ostrich feathers was ludicrous Osterbridge Hawsey s costume was of a piece with the hat for his coat was of fine blue velvet of too pale a shade for any use outside a drawing room It too was edged in silver braid and its owner holding a lorgnette with his right hand with his left pushed back the velvet folds to display the delicacy of his flower embroidered waistcoat Satin knee breeches a cascade of fine lace at his throat and lace falling gracefully over his small well kept hands made up the picture As Chris looked at him fascinated and repelled he noticed that the young man wore a patch in the shape of a crescent moon on his left cheek Chris who had been not a little overawed at seeing Claggett Chew could not restrain himself at the sight of this fop The touch of fear he had felt looking into the pale expressionless eyes of mister Wicker s enemy found relief and release in an uncontrollable burst of laughter when from his pocket Osterbridge Hawsey drew a tiny bottle of smelling salts and held it delicately to his nose Chris s young laughter rose in peal after peal Amos s warmer quicker laugh joined in and in a second laughter had spread to the group of seamen who doubled up convulsed fell on one another s shoulders as they wiped their eyes and slapped their hard thighs with their roughened hands The pair that so amused the rest Claggett Chew and his fine friend had stopped some ten feet away at the first sound of mirth Then into Claggett Chew s gray white face came astonishment for he was used to creating many impressions fear hatred or cringing obsequiousness but never before had he or any of his friends been laughed at Furthermore he the dreaded Claggett Chew and his gaudy friend Osterbridge Hawsey were held as being of so little account that a boy dared to laugh at them Illustration After a surge of deep ugly red to his head Claggett Chew s face became whiter than before and his eyes were murderous Oh Claggett they seem to be laughing at me Osterbridge Hawsey whined in a high pitched voice Unfortunately at this moment Chris forgetting caution in the grip of his laughter held on to Amos shouting feebly He s got a patch on his cheek What do you know a beauty patch The derision in his voice in spite of his laughter was unmistakable but before he could so much as draw another breath he heard Claggett Chew s voice for the first time So you ill found ugly twirp You idiot whippersnapper Let me give you one to match And quicker than the eye could follow the whip flicked out and with a cutting sting lashed Chris s cheek The cut from the metal wire was deep almost to Chris s jawbone but he did not feel the hurt as much as he realized his laughter gone that Claggett Chew was now his deadly enemy Next time came Claggett Chew s sneering voice I shall take an eye from you my laughing boy and see if that amuses us as well And turning on his heel followed by the sauntering giggling fop the pair picked their way along the wharf and disappeared It was only then looking around at the sobered silent sailors Chris remembered that Zachary Heigh was the only one who had not laughed CHAPTER fourteen Barely were Claggett Chew and Osterbridge Hawsey out of sight when Chris simultaneously became aware of two things One was the deep throbbing ache of the whip cut so painful it made him feel sick and faint and the second was the black figure of mister Wicker mister Wicker was threading his way in and out of the crowds and litter of the wharves and although to most he might have seemed leisurely Chris was able to detect in the step of his master a certain haste He came up to the little group of men glanced at the back of Zachary Heigh who was moving away as if to some interrupted duty and at Chris s white face and the reddening handkerchief which he held to his chin mister Wicker looked slowly at all the faces and then raised his eyebrows as if in surprise Well lads he said what has happened here You all look angry and somewhat a frighted What occurred Ned he asked addressing Ned Cilley whose kind face was puckered with sympathy for Chris and who stood pulling at the stocking cap he held in his hands But Chris spoke up before Ned could reply It was my fault sir I expect I got what I deserved but it seemed to happen in spite of myself I laughed at Osterbridge Hawsey s beauty patch and at him all of him really We all did Claggett Chew got mad and I guess I wouldn t blame him It was a dreadful thing to do to laugh at someone to their face and he lashed out with his whip and gave me a beauty patch In spite of the pain Chris managed a grin as he took the handkerchief from his chin to bare the deep cruel cut But truly sir he ended I never saw anything like Osterbridge Hawsey before He s a dilly And before they knew it they had all including even the habitually grave mister Wicker burst into another shout of laughter mister Wicker soon stopped however and reached back into the pocket in the flap of his coattails When he drew out his hand it held a small glass box With unhurried gestures mister Wicker s fine fingers took off the lid What a fortunate coincidence that I happened by just at this time he said casually and that I have with me such an excellent ointment Master and pupil looked at one another for a moment and there was the hint of a wink in mister Wicker s right eye and the vestige of an answer from Chris s left This will help to stop the bleeding my boy said mister Wicker and take away the pain It hastens the cure he went on lightly applying the ointment to the wound In an hour you will scarcely know it happened he concluded Seeing the color seep back into Chris s cheeks the men touched their caps to mister Wicker and went back to their interrupted tasks Ned Cilley with his hand on Amos s shoulder moved off to point out some detail of the Mirabelle and Chris and mister Wicker were left alone mister Wicker looked down kindly at the boy but there was a sadness also in his face Perhaps he said as if to himself I have set you too great a task my poor Christopher for you are but a boy He laid his hand on Chris s arm You are a boy but what lies before you is a man s task and no mistake You cannot in the future allow yourself the luxury of such childish enjoyments as a laugh at Claggett Chew or his friend Illustration I know that now sir Chris replied solemnly I asked for trouble that time Yes agreed mister Wicker in a tired voice You did Too bad he added and Chris saw fatigue for the first time in his master s face The laughter you could not resist has meant that you came forcibly to Claggett Chew s notice in such a way that you will never be forgotten mister Wicker looked from some distant horizon back to Chris I saw it happening while I was in my study but could not warn you in time he said So I came down with the ointment for your poisoned wound Poisoned wound sir Chris whispered suddenly feeling much worse than he had before Illustration mister Wicker sighed Yes Sometimes mister Chew has a way of wiping poison onto the metal tip of his whip It is a slow poison it does not take effect for days or weeks In fact so long after his lash that no one attributes the whip cut to the death that finally follows Never fear he said smiling his reassurance the ointment I have put on will take care of that too and your cut will be closed and healed before the day is over What is unfortunately more lasting said mister Wicker is mister Chew s memory Well and mister Wicker shrugged his shoulders there s no help for what is done Use caution in the future Christopher That is all I ask I shall sir Chris assured him They turned to join Amos Enjoy yourself the rest of the day my boy mister Wicker urged But be constantly on the alert and look in all directions Here he said putting his hand in his pocket take these few coins in case you should need them Now find Amos and be off with you Although Chris would have liked to investigate all the wharves and see as many of the vessels as he could he understood the warning given him by mister Wicker So with Amos he moved away from the scenes he preferred taking the first road he saw leading off Water Street M Street was for Chris completely unrecognizable It was merely a broad unpaved road in what seemed at best a country town Groves of old trees pasture lands and orchards of large size surrounded the few houses It was hard for Chris to realize that this was the core of the capital of the vast and teeming country into which he had been born With difficulty for the streets all had different names if they existed at all Chris looked for his own street Going back along what he had known as M Street not even the Pep Boys or Iron Horse Grill was to be seen Instead of two wide stone bridges now there was only a rickety one crossing Rock Creek Park The boys walked to the bank above the park and looked down The broad asphalt traffic lanes were gone and so was the tidiness of the park lawns Below him Chris saw the tangled thick forests that had always stood there The creek itself in the quiet of this earlier time could be plainly heard running over its stones Chris turned and led Amos to where he half expected to see his mother s house But where his house would stand in some future year nothing was to be seen but a dense grove of trees growing along the top of a little rise of ground Someone had once built a fire at the corner where his front door would one day be Chris kicked idly at the ashes and picked up a metal button blackened by the fire What you all looking for patient Amos asked Just something I hoped I d find Chris answered filled with a sense of desolation Then he made himself remember that his house had yet to be built and aware of the hollowness of his stomach he said to Amos Must be lunch time Let s go down to the creek to eat They scrambled down the bank near where in his time there was a children s playground and weaving in and out of the thick wood found the creek clear and fresh Here they ate their lunch and then running and leaping followed the turns of the stream until they neared the marshes and the river CHAPTER fifteen The two boys came out toward the mouth of Rock Creek and as the woods thinned they saw ahead of them a sandy sloping bank on which a small boat was drawn up Around the coals of a fire nearby three men were crouching Remembering mister Wicker s warning to be cautious Chris put out a hand to touch Amos and the two stood still Let s climb up a little above them Chris suggested We re beyond the bridge they might be well we d better be careful I want to see what they re doing before they see us Amos agreeing the two boys with extra care for rattling twigs moved stealthily up the banks of the Potomac that rose with increasing steepness The men who were huddled near their fire now came directly into their view below and Chris and Amos could see that they were playing cards One seemed to be losing to the other two He had piled a heap of his small possessions in front of him on the sand in lieu of money Illustration They were certainly a villainous looking trio The boys could hear some of their exclamations and it was with a mingled feeling of curiosity and uneasiness that Chris recognized the losing gambler to be Simon Gosler the humpbacked cripple Come now Gosler they heard one of the men cry out in annoyance Pay up you ve lost I ve no money to pay you complained the sly voice of the cripple I m a poor man well you know it A cripple just a poor old cripple Ah none o that cut in the second winner We know how well you do at your begging more in a day than we get in a month s pay Pay up now or it won t go well with you he rasped out laying his hand on a dagger stuck into his belt What about your glass your spyglass Gosler urged the first man Put that up and it will cover your losses well enough he sneered but Simon Gosler hugged his coat to him and looked from side to side searching for a way of escape No no good fellows he moaned not my glass I won that from the Captain himself three years ago and that I never shall part from willingly You d part from it for silver quick enough snarled the first gambler and of that you must have plenty for tis rare you ever lose Come now we ll give you a few minutes more to make up your mind but make it up you must Either the glass or silver you may choose The two gamblers rose menacingly and moved away to put their boat into the stream Simon Gosler was left mumbling and sniveling and fingering his coat pocket in which he kept his glass Chris watching him had a sudden inspiration and whispered to Amos Hide here behind those bushes and don t follow me Don t move or show yourself I m going to have that glass So saying he moved carefully back until he was out of sight of Amos and then for the first time on his own he tried a change of shape Choosing a broad flat stone at the edge of the shrubbery and safely removed from the sight of the two winners he changed himself into a silver coin and allowed himself to drop with a sweet metallic ring on the stone waiting winking in the sun for Simon Gosler The old cripple saw the coin before it had bounced twice on the stone and with a quick sly look over his shoulder at the backs of his companions as they pushed at the boat hoisted himself up on his crutch and began hobbling over toward his find But instead of a coin he found only a resolute boy awaiting him tossing and catching a silver piece It was one of those mister Wicker had given Chris but an hour before He looked Simon Gosler in the eye I ve heard what went on Simon Gosler said Chris his eyes on a level with the rheumy watering eyes of the cripple and if you will sell your spyglass to me I ll buy it off you with this silver piece Otherwise you shall not have it Simon Gosler s eyes dripped tears of greed at the sight of the coin and then another expression washed over them Fast as he was and fast as was his movement Chris was faster As the old beggar braced himself and brought the head of his crutch down where Chris s head should have been someone from behind dealt him a staggering blow with a sizable club and yet when he turned around no one was there When he faced about again rubbing his head and whimpering with rage and frustration he found himself once more facing the boy who was tossing and catching tossing and catching the round silver coin Chris stood with his legs apart his head back his eyes full of scorn His hand did not cease to toss and catch the silver piece Well you old villain he challenged will you take the coin in fair exchange or shall I hit you again with that club you just felt he asked It doesn t feel the same when you get it back as when you give it out does it you old faker Hurry up your friends will soon be coming back and I don t think they intend to argue he added Illustration Gosler still rubbing his head and muttering finally spoke Very well you nasty young man I ll sell my glass Give me the coin and he stretched out a dirty claw Oh no Chris shook his head decisively No indeed You put the glass down between us carefully mind you and back away I ll throw you the coin when I ve seen if the glass is worth the silver Mumbling to himself Simon Gosler did as he was told He reached back in his coat pocket to draw out a small spyglass which he laid down on the ground He then backed away Chris picked up and examined the glass tested it and then just as the two gamblers came back up the riverbank tossed the silver piece to the beggar Gosler caught it in mid air with the dexterity of years of practice In an instant Chris had vanished into the thick shade of the wood and going as fast but as quietly as he could regained the place where Amos waited for him Illustration Gee Chris Amos exclaimed for he had caught all Chris s expression of speech We got us a spyglass We sure have Chris agreed And it s a fine one best I ever saw he said Here try it out over the river there where that ship is anchored Amos pointed the glass through the shrubs toward a distant ship that swung at anchor close to the shore and while he tried out their prize Chris watched the departure of the three gamblers Gosler had evidently paid up while Chris was returning to their hidden perch for he was now hustled into the boat by the other two Soon the three were far down the stream and their boat was moving into the main flow of the river Here Amos said passing back the glass you look That s a mighty fine ship out there black as the Mirabelle is white but she looks fast and strong just the same But Chris taking the glass was idly following the progress of the three men Gosler lost in gloom sat in the stern hugging his rags about him The other two bent their backs to the oars and headed straight for the anchored ship Turning the glass to the brig Chris hunted for the name as the prow swung about Through the glass the letters gold on the black painted side leapt at his eye across the distance Venture Chris read and with a beating heart he saw his adversary s ship for the first time CHAPTER sixteen Come along Amos We must get a closer look at that ship Chris cried putting his glass away Scrambling down the two boys ran along the stream until it was shallow enough to cross 
3411-187011-0000	train-other-500	The water was icy telling as well as the turning leaves and cooler air that fall had come and winter was on the way Hurrying forward Chris and Amos reached the mouth of the stream where it joined the river
3411-187011-0001	train-other-500	There on the left bank of Rock Creek
none	none	 high rushes grew in rank profusion on the marshy land 
3411-187011-0002	train-other-500	They rose higher than the heads of the two boys and were too closely packed to allow for easy passage We ll have to skirt the very edge Chris said glancing about Barefoot would be the best
3411-187011-0003	train-other-500	This soft ground would soon go over our shoes and maybe suck them down Keep right against the rushes Chris warned Amos and if a boat shows up coming from the wharves we can t take any chances We ll have to dive into the rushes and hide
none	none	 just in case it s Claggett Chew Illustration That s right Amos nodded his head vigorously I don t want to meet him again and you do less n me 
3411-187011-0004	train-other-500	he chuckled The two went on making slow progress for the river was deep at that point with little foothold between the end of the jungle of reeds and deep water Keep an eye out Amos Chris called back over his shoulder as he went ahead
none	none	 It was no time before Amos s voice came huskily up to his friend Chris Chris hold on 
3411-187011-0005	train-other-500	There s a boat with four men in it just left the last wharf and they re headin this way Get in those rushes quick
none	none	 my clothes is mighty bright Illustration Rushing and panting they shoved their way into the dusty rushes 
3411-187011-0006	train-other-500	groping back until they could barely see the river through the stalks And it was just in time for barely were they hidden when they heard carried over the water the dip and splash of two pairs of oars and the creak of oarlocks Then
none	none	 in another moment came the high pitched voice of Osterbridge Hawsey Chris gave a shiver as it reached him Claggett came the voice of the fop who with Claggett Chew was sitting in the stern of the boat Claggett I find myself quite quite fatigued A little wine I fancy might revive me when we reach the ship Heated I think and spiced to ward off the night chill And Claggett went on the voice almost upon them now it was so clear what do you think of this muslin for my new shirts Is it not delicate Irish cela va sans dire as the dear French say I feel sure it will be satisfactory From Claggett Chew the two boys heard not a word 
3411-187011-0007	train-other-500	and peering out they saw the boat shoot by Osterbridge Hawsey wrapped in a great cloak was admiring a bolt of muslin that he held but Claggett Chew his face shadowed by a hat was holding his whip upon his knees
3411-187011-0008	train-other-500	and glowering at the water The boat passed and some time after the two boys heard from across the water the echo of wood against wood as the dinghy reached the Venture s hull After a while as the boys were about to move along
3411-187011-0009	train-other-500	a heavy dropping sound and the shuddering of the marshy ground made the two in hiding look at one another in concern
none	none	 What in the world Chris murmured 
3411-187011-0010	train-other-500	The sound accompanied by steps oaths and a rhythmical drop and shudder continued farther along the shore Stealthily trying not to shake the rushes and so show where they might be
3411-187011-0011	train-other-500	Chris and Amos pushed through the marsh The sun was setting as they came near the steps and voices Pushing through the reeds towards the river Chris found that they were nearly opposite where the Venture floated below mister Mason s island
3411-187011-0012	train-other-500	and at a desolate part of the river Chris gestured Amos forward
none	none	 and they went on step by step until 
3411-187011-0013	train-other-500	in a pause of the thundering dropping sound they knew themselves to be near its origin and parted the reeds enough to see There within a few yards of them and at the edge of a hard beaten track from the main shore
3411-187011-0014	train-other-500	lay a mass of cannon balls and shot for guns of various sizes such as are used on men of war The crew of the Venture able to carry but one at a time
none	none	 kept a line going from shore to pile 
3411-187011-0015	train-other-500	and this as they dropped the cannon balls from their shoulders was the sound and shaking of the ground the boys had heard and felt Seeing the red caps and kerchiefed heads of men above the rushes the boys let the reeds fall back I m
3411-187011-0016	train-other-500	going to have a look at the ship through the glass Chris whispered
none	none	 and moved forward closer to the shore 
3411-187011-0017	train-other-500	Parting the stalks he trained the glass on Claggett Chew s ship It was a fine rich vessel that was evident and swarming with activity At this hour of dusk other boats along the river had stopped their commerce for the day
none	none	 and there were none to observe what Claggett Chew might be about 
3411-187011-0018	train-other-500	Chris and Amos were the only watchers The cannon balls and ammunition were taken out in boats and hoisted up in nets Chris observed everything closely
3411-187011-0019	train-other-500	and saw still other crewmen disappearing with their burdens down the hold Then something caught his eye and he examined the name along the side through the spyglass
none	none	 Curious thought Chris that all the letters of the ship s name 
3411-187011-0020	train-other-500	seemed exact except the second and third Among the other letters of carved and gilded wood the E and N were not quite as straight in line as the rest
none	none	 Oh well Chris thought it s doubtless a custom of the time for all I know 
3411-187011-0021	train-other-500	Putting the glass in his pocket he rejoined Amos but as he did so the last two sailors put down their cannon balls and wiped the sweat off their foreheads with their arms In the ensuing silence the rustle of the rushes
none	none	 as Chris and Amos moved away was plainly to be heard Illustration What s that one man cried out 
3411-187011-0022	train-other-500	Is a spy there Here take this club and beat about we ll catch em
none	none	 The two men charged into the marsh so fast 
3411-187011-0023	train-other-500	that Chris barely had time to whisper to Amos Hurry Amos run I ll be all right I ll draw them off I ll meet you where we ford the stream Amos safely out of sight the men came only on a stray dog foraging for rats
3411-187011-0024	train-other-500	wagging its tail and letting out a yip or two as it followed a scent along the ground Give it a kick there it s only a stray dog one said Oh devil take it what do I care
none	none	 answered the other turning back 
3411-187011-0025	train-other-500	The dog lay panting at the river s edge Looking past the ship as it rested
none	none	 it saw what it thought was snow upon the water and the banks But it was just thousands of ducks migrating south and when they rose to move farther away the sky was overcast and thunderous with their wings Illustration Long after dark cold dirty and quite wet the two boys reached the house on Water Street Where did you go Becky inquired frowning with solicitude at the bedraggled pair Oh no place much Chris answered yawning 
3411-187012-0000	train-other-500	CHAPTER seventeen The following morning while Chris was telling mister Wicker of the ammunition being loaded on the Venture Becky Boozer announced a visit from Captain Blizzard and Elisha Finney
3411-187012-0001	train-other-500	Show them in Becky mister Wicker told her To Chris he said I wonder what brings them here so early It must be a matter of some importance Stay with me Christopher I shall present you to the Captain
3411-187012-0002	train-other-500	The extraordinary pair came in and Chris was introduced to Captain Blizzard and mister Finney The Captain was all smiles except for his eyes Chris noted that his eyes did not smile at all
3411-187012-0003	train-other-500	mister Finney true to form cast down his eyes sighed and let the corners of his wide thin lips droop almost to his chin When a chair large enough and solid enough had been found for Captain Blizzard
3411-187012-0004	train-other-500	and Becky had brought in a decanter of sherry and glasses to set before the visitors Chris shut the study door and sat down on the floor where he could observe the three faces before him mister Wicker spoke first
none	none	 Well Captain what brings you here so betimes 
3411-187012-0005	train-other-500	No trouble of any kind I trust Captain Blizzard set down his glass of sherry and cleared his throat Now sir needs must I come with unpleasant news and sorry I am to bring it
3411-187012-0006	train-other-500	I have heard that the Venture plans to sail at any time and you well know she is a fast sailing ship He folded his plump hands over his paunch and twiddled his thumbs with agitation Sir it has been noised about that the Venture is headed for the West Indies
3411-187012-0007	train-other-500	He paused and glanced at mister Finney who nodded forlornly his mouth drooping
none	none	 But tis not so The Captain looked with anxious eyes at mister Wicker Early this morning Ned Cilley brought me the information that the Venture is to sail to the China seas 
3411-187012-0008	train-other-500	mister Wicker s face was grave but showed no surprise I knew some trouble was ahead he said slowly but did not know what form it was to take He paused
3411-187012-0009	train-other-500	News of sailings and destinations get about so rapidly it is more than likely that someone overheard the destination of the Mirabelle and sold his knowledge to Captain Chew Although he added thoughtfully I think
3411-187012-0010	train-other-500	Claggett Chew guessed it Well and mister Wicker looked alertly at the two men what advice do you give me Captain Blizzard wagged his head Nay sir tis for orders that I came to you It is for you to say
3411-187012-0011	train-other-500	How soon can the Mirabelle put to sea mister Wicker asked and Chris s heart skipped a beat At any time sir the Captain at once replied We have nearly water enough and quite sufficient stores The men are all assembled
3411-187012-0012	train-other-500	The Captain fell silent and no one spoke for several minutes mister Wicker leaning his chin on his folded hands was lost in thought How move the tides he finally asked raising his head
3411-187012-0013	train-other-500	The Captain with surprising briskness for so large a man pulled some folded charts from his pocket
none	none	 Without a word the three men rose and went over to the table 
3411-187012-0014	train-other-500	pushing aside the china bowl filled with flowers to spread the charts flat on the table top Captain Blizzard leaned his knuckles on the boards The tide will be high at midnight sir he informed them See he pointed a short forefinger at a spot on one chart
3411-187012-0015	train-other-500	here is the sandbar that the tide covers for but a short time and should there be other ships crowding the river near this point we must slip through there then or not at all mister Wicker examined the charts and nodded
none	none	 Very well he said so must it be 
3411-187012-0016	train-other-500	and Chris felt that his heartbeat would stifle him it pounded so fast and thickly in his throat All at once looking up at the thoughtful face of his master Chris longed to be able to stay safe at home
3411-187012-0017	train-other-500	The imminent journey so far and perhaps so perilous seemed suddenly too much for him mister Wicker had taken the river charts and rolled them up and now turned to the Captain and first mate
3411-187012-0018	train-other-500	Captain Blizzard and you mister Finney he said should water casks be seen going on board the whole of Georgetown will know you mean to sail
none	none	 I therefore ask you to so contrive it that the casks be hidden 
3411-187012-0019	train-other-500	in bales or boxes so that they seem to be anything but what they are He tapped the rolled charts thoughtfully on the palm of one hand Our only chance to steal a march on the Venture will be to sail at least a day before her The two men listening nodded in agreement
3411-187012-0020	train-other-500	There is one other thing Your orders for where you are to anchor once near China will be secret and carried on the person of this boy He laid one hand on Chris s shoulder He has a task of utmost secrecy to carry out
3411-187012-0021	train-other-500	and will require your help encouragement and silence Captain Blizzard and mister Finney looked solemnly at Chris
none	none	 who looked as solemnly back Illustration Not only that mister Wicker went on 
3411-187012-0022	train-other-500	but his presence on the ship must not be known until the Mirabelle is well to sea He glanced down meditatively at Chris I shall arrange to bring him aboard somehow and give you your sailing orders later
3411-187012-0023	train-other-500	He strode over to the window looking out to his gardens and the trees where the apples showed their russet cheeks Leave me these charts for yet a little while and I shall ponder on our plans said mister Wicker
none	none	 He turned See that the water casks are taken on at once Captain and hidden and make a place for Christopher here and at a beseeching look from Chris he added with a smile and Amos No sooner were the Captain and mister Finney gone than Chris spoke up in great excitement mister Wicker sir I have a plan May we look at the river charts again Master and pupil spread out the charts once more and Chris pointed eagerly Look sir Here is the sandbar and here he put his finger down the Venture Or she was yesterday Now sir the sandbar being just below and ahead of the Venture once the Mirabelle has slipped by wouldn t it be too bad if something happened to make the Venture drift with the tide and run aground He looked eagerly up into mister Wicker s face and saw in it the reflection of his own excitement There are times Christopher said mister Wicker with his eyes snapping when you surprise even me But how is it to be done Well sir began Chris it s a little tricky but I think what with the things we know it can be worked He began outlining to his master the details of his plan CHAPTER eighteen It was perhaps as well that Chris had more than enough to think of Otherwise the wrench at leaving home might have been even more distressing than it was His last day passed like a flash though from his attitude no one certainly not Becky would have guessed that the next morning he would not be there to eat his breakfast in the sunny kitchen window Amos quick to sense all Chris s moods knew something was afoot and when Chris and mister Wicker finally told him of the sailing plan Amos s eyes grew rounder than ever and sparkled more brightly but he said never a word At ten o clock that night when Becky had gone heavily to her room wondering perhaps why Chris had given her so hard a hug Ned Cilley knocked at the back door He had brought a light cart on which there stood a large wicker hamper Ned and Chris lifted it into the kitchen while mister Wicker drew the curtains and then held a candle high The candlelight flickered and flapped like a trapped bird at the corners of the room and sharp bird wing shadows cut across mister Wicker s tall dark figure Yet to Chris who was to hold the scene ever after in his memory the kitchen by the light of that one candle and the figure of his master standing in its center moved Chris as he had never been touched before Amos stood near the basket looking first into its square depth filled with shadow and then up enquiringly at mister Wicker but he did not speak Illustration Be of good heart Amos mister Wicker said to him kindly and look after young Christopher as best you can Then at a gesture from mister Wicker Amos agog stepped into the hamper where he stood uncertainly his expression half terrified and half delighted Yessir I will he piped up shrill with excitement I ll keep my eye on him he promised and then curled up in the hamper Ned Cilley shut down the top and he and Chris lifted it to the cart mister Wicker spoke low into Ned s ear All is well understood he queried This is no time for misunderstandings Aye aye sir All is clear the good Ned replied Then Godspeed to you all and bring you safely home said mister Wicker Be on the lookout for this lad Ned when you get past the bar Illustration We shall Ned whispered back and good luck to the two of ye Clucking to his horse on wheels covered with rags and with cloths about the horse s hoofs to deaden their sound Ned Cilley and his hamper went quietly away in the direction of the wharfs In a moment cart horse and driver were swallowed up in the denseness of the night A black night it was indeed Although there was a moon thick clouds scudded over it and an autumn wind bent the trees tearing the leaves from them A mist rose from the river but it was blown away from all but the most sheltered places mister Wicker and Chris stood in the silent kitchen Looking about him Chris remembered with a pang the first morning he had seen it with Becky in her gaudy hat standing near the fire Come Christopher mister Wicker bade him taking up his caped black cloak and another one for Chris First wind the rope about your waist and once on board bind it under your shirt Let no one not even Amos know of it Chris did as he was told mister Wicker then gave him a leather pouch hung on a cord Here are some oddments of magic that may prove their usefulness he remarked Wear them about your neck So saying he slipped the leather cord over Chris s head What happens to the rope and pouch when I change my shape sir Chris asked They will remain with you have no fear of that the magician replied What would be the use of magic if it proved unable to adjust itself A smile played over mister Wicker s face So all is ready he said glancing around Now we must be off and lose no time for we have much ahead of us said mister Wicker drily blowing out the candle Before he knew it Chris stood until what far off time outside mister Wicker s house His master locked the door The wind swooping down like some great bird tugged at their cloaks and chilled their faces Chris led the way to the creek and the marsh This time both he and mister Wicker wore high boots which kept the icy water and mud from their feet What I wouldn t give for a flashlight Chris muttered as they came to the marsh Yes the twentieth century has many conveniences mister Wicker replied and Chris could imagine behind him the man s sardonic smile and amused eyes They came out suddenly from the blackness of the woods to the wind whipped river and though the moon was still obscured the river held a pallid sheen of its own that gave a little light There was not a sound to be heard but the hurried lap of water against the shore the suck and pull of Chris s and mister Wicker s boots in the mud and sharp hair raising rustles from time to time in the reeds Chris s heart thudded in his throat at these furtive noises for they could only be made by rats or watersnakes and Chris liked neither of these especially by night Pushing along the marsh edge and feeling their way the two figures at last came in sight of their goal The high dark hull of the Venture rose above the water an amber lantern hanging at her stern The wind swung the ship and the tide still flowing up the Potomac showed that the bow held by the anchor was pointed somewhat downstream The anchor may have dragged Chris whispered to mister Wicker Now for our boat The rope seemed to uncoil from about his waist almost of itself and with the gestures he had been taught Chris formed a very adequate craft a trifle lopsided it must be admitted as he had had small practice but seaworthy nevertheless I shall see that the men sleep soundly mister Wicker murmured You do the rest I shall sir Chris agreed and then the moon showed an edge for a moment in the clouds Look sir the Mirabelle Toward sleeping Georgetown for it was nearly midnight now a whiteness showed itself close against the distant wharfs The Mirabelle was edging out and Chris knew that Ned Bowie Abner Cloud and others were pulling her by the ship s boats into the main flow of the river Once turned she would float noiselessly down the Potomac past the Venture and once he was aboard would hoist her sails and set her course to sea Then quick bade mister Wicker We took too long It seems we are a trifle late Illustration They stepped into the boat each taking an oar and with only a few strong pulls came alongside the silent Venture They moored their boat to the anchor rope mister Wicker touched Chris by way of wishing him luck and disappeared For half a second more Chris waited No sound came from the ship but a light showed in the Captain s cabin In a twinkling a monkey with a pouch about its neck ran up the anchor rope and pausing on the gunwale sniffed at the pungent flower smell that it now knew meant sleep for all the sailors Then it bounded toward the light A window of the cabin on the lee side had been left open Clinging to a piece of rigging before it sprang to the sill the monkey s eyes caught what seemed to be a shadow darker than that of the mist or of the night moving away from the sailor left at night watch The man now lay slumped in sleep and the same heady scent of spices and flowers that had overcome Chris when he had first entered mister Wicker s shop blew away on the gusty fall wind The ship tugged and strained at her anchor wind and turning tide making taut the line that held her close to shore The Venture her rigging and masts scarcely visible so sombre was the night lay ominously silent excepting for a murmur of voices from the cabin Abruptly aware of the passing of time and the approaching white cloud on the water that was the Mirabelle the monkey sprang to the side of the open window and peered inside Illustration A smoking lamp hung low over a center table dropping a dusky round glow on the larger circle beneath it Claggett Chew was blearily studying a paper spread out before him leaning his ugly bare skull on one hand His eyes were blood shot and an empty wine bottle and glass holding only wine dregs showed he had been drinking and was now half asleep Osterbridge Hawsey in a heavy silk robe and embroidered slippers lounged sideways in a chair with his legs hanging over the arm His hand trailed an empty glass on the floor and a silly drunken smile played over his face Claggett he was saying is the place marked He hiccuped delicately Hup Oh dear the hiccups he complained with a frown Let me have more wine Claggett Chew did not reply nor rise to fetch another bottle Osterbridge Hawsey gave a hiccup and spoke again Mark it hic Claggett You may forget All those hup walls to get over or hic under He sighed Oh dear Hic Think of those jewels Claggett Hup Devil take these hiccups he exclaimed in a flurry of annoyance but made no motion to change his comfortable position Claggett Osterbridge Hawsey shrilled Are you asleep or angry or Hic Put a cross where the Tree is I say I want those hup jewels Claggett and so do you Hic Befuddled his perceptions hopelessly blurred by excessive wine Claggett Chew made a mark on the map There he growled his upper lip drawn back over his teeth will that shut you up A moving shadow duskier than the shadows themselves came through the door and hovered over Osterbridge Hawsey Claggett Chew suddenly started up I smell him he muttered thickly He s here Hullo Night watchman he shouted drunkenly As he got up stumbling and thrashing about in the uncertainty of his movements his chair crashed to the floor and the monkey made a leap cuffing the lantern from its hook The light was dashed out and in the dark as he jumped the monkey seized the creased well thumbed paper as he leaped back toward the pale square that was the window Behind it Claggett Chew s oaths and exclamations became fainter as the spicy scent grew stronger and at last his mutterings trailed off into snorts and finally snores The monkey clutching the paper to itself sat on the window ledge stuffing it into the pouch about its neck and a monkey smile flitted across its face as it heard a final dreaming sound from Osterbridge Hawsey Hm mm Hic Jewels Hup came from Osterbridge Hawsey Down the anchor rope scrambled the monkey with the agility and speed for which monkeys are famous mister Wicker was already in the boat How shall it be sir came the low voice of Chris Shall I become a beaver and go down and gnaw the rope off at the anchor No said mister Wicker It can be more easily done than that and nothing to trace it Get in the boat Here comes the Mirabelle Taking his own shape once more Chris saw the white ghost like sides of the Mirabelle soundlessly passing down stream Not a creak nor a splash of water came from her as she passed but from the stern a tiny light struck by a flint perhaps blinked once and twice and then a third time Now came mister Wicker s low voice Let me have my hand upon that rope He only seemed to hold the anchor rope a moment and give it an easy pull The tugging strain was suddenly gone and the Venture veered away like a frightened waterfowl Will she go where she should sir Chris wanted to know leaning forward That she will Christopher came the familiar voice in the dark And we must get out of her way for here she comes down at us The wind and the tide and hm m other forces will drive her solidly upon the bar If I mistake not it will be several days before they get her off and on the night air Chris heard a faint short chuckle Pull boy his master told him sharply Here she comes Chris grasped his oar and spun the boat only in time for the down flowing tide and rising wind combined to drive the Venture forward at increasing speed The tide being still high the ship was carried well upon the sandbar before it grounded lolling over to one side much like the sleeping sailors Illustration Quick lad Now we must catch the Mirabelle and you and I must part Oh sir Chris cried holding his oar above the water and turning his head toward the man beside him mister Wicker clapped Chris on the shoulder and a glint of moonlight showed him to be smiling I shall miss you too my lad he said Now let us send this boat over the river as fast as she can go And bear in mind keep your own shape at all times unless you can change it out of sight of prying eyes They pulled at the oars Oh yes I nearly forgot Among the effects placed in your sea chest you will find a conch shell Hold it to your ear Christopher as children do to hear the sea You will be able to hear my voice if ever you should need to Oh like a walkie talkie Chris asked pulling at his oar Somewhat And Chris knew his master smiled at him What about getting you to shore sir Chris enquired pulling in rhythm so that the rope boat flew down the black and silver river Have you forgotten who I am my boy he was asked in return No sir said Chris feeling a little small Then undo the dinghy and clamber up the side for here we are said mister Wicker and the towering hull of the Mirabelle rose above them Chris grasped a rope ladder that hung down beside them to the water s edge and turned for a last word I ll do my best sir but I hope you ll stay with me he cried All that I can Christopher came the distant voice Godspeed And looking about Chris made out coasting on the air a sea gull balancing upon its black tipped wings Swallowing a lump in his throat that proved bothersome Chris jerked at one oar and deftly coiled the magic rope over his arm holding to the ship s ladder with the other A signal flashed a lantern swung in an arc and dim figures waiting in their places hauled on the lines As Chris stepped to the deck over the side the great white sails rose spread and bellied out from the three masts Chris looked in wonder as the Mirabelle proud as a woman lifted up her head Soon on the silent river only a dwindling sight of lonely sails was to be seen heading toward Chesapeake Bay and then to sea But anyone with eyesight good enough might have seen a solitary sea gull following CHAPTER nineteen The long days passed on board the Mirabelle The hours rolled majestically past as did the waves through which the Mirabelle cut her way Amos and Christopher were kept out of sight until mister Wicker s ship was several days out to sea for the crew not knowing that the success of their voyage depended on Chris would have been surly at the presence of two such young boys on board useless cargo in their opinion who knew nothing of seafaring But when Chris and Amos appeared under the banner of stowaways the sailors considered them full of spunk and welcomed them warmly Both Chris and Amos found life on a sailing vessel strange and fascinating but difficult to get used to Ned Cilley as their best friend on board was the one to whom they turned whenever his duties gave him free time However to Chris s surprise it was the first mate sad looking mister Finney who would patiently instruct them in sea terms and answer their endless questions As the days passed and the Mirabelle pursued her long course through tropical water Chris with many free hours to occupy at last understood how the model of the Mirabelle had been so painstakingly arranged inside a bottle For the time seemed long between glimpses of shore and shore or until they sailed for a time along some wild and beautiful tropic coast Then Chris would lean on the side of the ship looking at the mountainous or jungled shore A scent such as comes from the opened door of a hothouse would drift out to sea to the sailors who looked yearningly toward the land and the greenness A warm breath of flowers damp moss and leaves in the sun would mingle with the rough salt smell of the sea Chris and Amos imagined to themselves what the forest or the mountainsides would be like if they could only land and investigate them Illustration Now and again small flocks of birds migrating perhaps or blown out to sea would land on the Mirabelle and Ned Cilley made a large cage for some of the sweet singing gaily feathered creatures for Chris and Amos And on one occasion when the Mirabelle was sailing past Brazil a flock of butterflies was carried out on a breeze from shore and hung on the rigging until the boys imagined themselves in a blossoming wood Chris had found his first day at sea the conch shell mister Wicker had mentioned and he alone of all the Mirabelle s crew knew how the Venture had fared Illustration That first evening in the little cabin Captain Blizzard had given Chris and Amos Chris had waited impatiently for Amos to sleep The two boys each had a hammock swung across the cabin by night which they rolled up and put away to give more room by day But that first night poor Chris had begun to despair that he would ever hear mister Wicker s voice from the shell for Amos was excited and had no wish to go to sleep He swung back and forth happy as a dark bird in his hammock his round eyes looking toward the porthole where there was a faint gleam of night sea Chris Amos said we re sure going on a mighty far trip That Mister Finney he showed me on a map but I never heard of any of the places we pass by The Bahamas he say to me then the West Indies Cuba Barbadoes he was ticking them off on his fingers as he named them an on to South America Away down at the tippy end around what s the name of that loud named place Cape Horn Chris said He was scarcely listening Amos tried to prop himself up on his elbow and promptly fell out of the hammock in a flurry of arms and legs and a heavy landing thump that brought a shout of laughter from Chris After an attempt at making his bed again in the hammock and some little difficulty in clambering safely back in again Amos composed himself with the least possible movement in his swinging bed and yawned I disremember he said where else we re going Wise Man islands or Solemn Islands You mean Solomon Islands Chris asked him Amos gave another mighty yawn That s what I said Miss Becky she read to me from the Bible about Solemn how wise he was There was a pause On that way Amos s voice was becoming indistinct We go past the West Indian Islands next Chris murmured almost to himself I remember that And the Cell Bees Sea Amos said in a whisper Celebes Chris corrected softly What I said came Amos s voice and then at last there was silence in the cabin He almost got as far as the China Sea Chris thought to himself and holding to the hammock eased himself out and on bare feet went quietly to his sea chest Its square bulk stood in the shadow of the wall but fragments of light from the night sky caught the brass nailheads and bands upon it so that it appeared to wink cheerfully at Chris in the gloom Slowly to avoid any creaks that might awake Amos Chris lifted the lid thrust in one hand and found the shell He held it near the small port for a moment its rosy interior faded of color in the gray light Then he turned it in his hand and put it to his ear At first he heard only the rushing sound of surf on a beach Then the sea sound became fainter and a voice so familiar that it meant home to him came to Chris s ear as if from a long way off Christopher Christopher here I am came mister Wicker s voice How are you All going well I hope Please do me the favor to tell the Captain not to put ashore at his usual place in Tahiti but to go by night to a cove he will find twelve leagues farther along the coast I will tell you what to do nearer that time He will find ample fresh water near that cove but the Venture is up to mischief You must escape it and all on board the Mirabelle shall be witnesses to what Claggett Chew plans to do The voice faded out and then returned You would probably like to know how far behind the Venture is She ran aground most unfortunately and most surprisingly and is three full days behind you But she is a fast ship and will soon lessen the distance Please to tell the Captain so he is the only one to know of my gifts and that it is possible for me to communicate with you Tell him not to stop for water or food until his stores are running low You must not waste time Have you heard me Tap the edge of the shell three times for Yes Chris tapped three times feeling much happier and all at once not quite so much alone The voice came back to his ear I am following your progress from this room in the manner you know Practise your magic alone or you will lose the knack And now good night Oh yes Becky Boozer has been crying into her apron all day Partly for Ned Cilley but I fancy Chris heard a chuckle from a well remembered room but I fancy largely for two boys Good night Christopher Sleep well CHAPTER twenty As the Mirabelle sailed farther into tropical seas Chris and Amos worked out a pattern for their days Before sunup while the air was still cool from the night the two boys were awakened by Ned Cilley or Abner Cloud They joined the sailors on deck to do their share of chores mending rigging patching sails scrubbing decks or polishing brass When the sun rose the boys breakfasted The men of the Mirabelle then went on with their various tasks but Amos went up to the Captain s bridge where he listened to mister Finney and Captain Blizzard and Chris went down to their cabin for an hour or more Supposedly Chris was studying lessons This was only partially true for instead of sums he was practising magic in which he soon attained a high degree of proficiency What he most enjoyed was turning himself into some small commonplace creature to plague his friends on board a mouse one day a flea the next a fly on the third Quite naturally no one suspected his ability to adopt such fantastic disguises So little did they guess he had one or two narrow escapes from being swatted or stamped on It was Zachary Heigh whom Chris wanted to watch and as a flea or a fly he often rode about on Zachary s jacket listening and observing But it was not until the Mirabelle had rounded Cape Horn one morning that Chris in the disguise of a fly rode unnoticed on Zachary s jacket when that sulky young man after looking around to make sure the others were all at work slipped down to the sailor s quarters below decks There he dragged out his sea chest and from under his belongings pulled out a second chest Fitting a key to the lock he lifted up the lid Chris perched on his shoulder peered over to see the contents They were disappointing merely a gray powder carefully packed in a piece of tarpaulin Wonder why it has to be kept so dry Chris pondered but Zachary was already refolding the tarpaulin and locking the lid In the next moment Zachary had uncovered a length of white coils Then Chris understood By golly he exclaimed to himself dynamite Or gunpowder And so much What s it for Zachary made no other disclosures of interest that day but after that Chris spent all the time he could both day and night watching the young sailor He was determined to discover if he could what Zachary intended to do with the gunpowder It was hard for Chris not to be able to ask mister Wicker s advice and not to have his master s superior knowledge to lean on Yet had he known it it was just this lack which was making him quick witted and more resourceful One night a short time after Zachary s uncovering of the gunpowder Chris noticed that Zachary remained on deck after the others had gone to bed and continued to sit with his back to a stanchion dreamily gazing at the starry sky Chris was in a fever for Amos to sleep which his good friend soon did Then a gray mouse scuttered along the wainscot of the ship s passageways until it reached a good vantage point from which to see the young sailor on deck Chris had chosen well a mouse is used to the dark For several hours Zachary remained still and the mouse dozed woke with a start twitched its ears and waited Then long after midnight when alone of the entire ship s company only the helmsman and night watch were awake Zachary very slowly slid his way to the ladder leading to the hold The mouse scurrying forward was able to follow by means of a dangling rope and a leap into pitch blackness at the rope s end The poor mouse hit something and ricocheted off It lay stunned for a moment or two a few inches from Zachary s feet as the sailor stood at the foot of the ladder in the black heavy air of the hold Then Zachary lit a candle end he had brought in his pocket and lifted it up above his head to give the maximum amount of radiance The glow of the candle stub like a yellow daisy in a cavern spread petals of light for only a short distance By its sputtering the mouse looked up to the towering figure Zachary now made above it and hearing the sharp squeakings and furtive scratches that signaled rats the mouse thought it more prudent to adopt the shape of a fly This Chris did and on Zachary s shoulder the fly s many faceted eyes could not only see everything but see them several times over Zachary then put the candle on the corner of a packing case and from under his shirt pulled out the coils of the fuse Chris had seen a few days before He took up the candle stub and began a long and patient search measuring with the length of fuse and hunting for a secure hiding place for the gunpowder In the end he found a cramped space just big enough for him to slide into made by the shifting of the cargo which had seemingly rewedged itself firmly forming a curious little cave of barrel sides crates and heavy bales of cotton overhead Dangerous thought Chris should anything rock the Mirabelle in such a way that the cargo shifted back suddenly to its original tight formation The hold of the Mirabelle was large the packing case cave was surrounded by hundreds of pounds of solid cargo It gave Chris a trapped feeling that he did not like and he was relieved when Zachary edged and squeezed himself out again into a freer part of the hold Illustration Zachary measured with his fuse from the crate cave where he evidently intended hiding the gunpowder to the farthest point away from it and nearest the ladder for the treacherous young man wanted all the time he could get to escape from the doomed Mirabelle Time to climb the ladder reach the ship s side and perhaps row away to a safe distance The fuse proved to be rather shorter than Zachary Heigh wished His candle stub set on a crate was burning very low and he had only a few more moments in which that night at any rate to decide where he would hide the lighting end of the fuse Just before the candle went out Zachary s fuse coil reached a group of molasses barrels and here the young man decided that the fuse when the time came would be hidden and lit He made a mark in white chalk behind one of the barrels and then hurriedly began coiling up the fuse as he turned toward the ladder Illustration At that moment the candle end drowned in a pool of its own melted tallow guttered blinked and went out The utter blackness of the hold rushed over Zachary and the fly who clutched at the threads of the sailor s coarse shirt Zachary was only a young boy scarcely older than Chris himself and the fly could almost feel the quickening of Zachary s heartbeat at the sudden flood of dark the sense of the late hour and the rat infested hold Zachary moved quickly in the pitch black his hands outstretched to feel the ladder his breath coming and going rapidly through his parted lips The heat of the airless place the heavy smells of the cargo itself oppressed and weighed on both Zachary and his unsuspected companion The Mirabelle was moving slowly forward in calm tropic seas scarcely making headway on an almost breathless night Down in the hold the ladder eluded Zachary s reaching fingers and the creaking of the ship was all that was to be heard except for the faint sound of Zachary s breathing Then all at once as sometimes happens in a roomful of talking people there came a moment of total silence For a second there was a space in the creaking of the ship the pad of rats or the slight shift and reshift of boxes And in that second just as Zachary s fingers touched the ladder to Zachary and to Chris on his shoulder came the distinct sound of another man s breathing CHAPTER twenty one Exhausted as he was by his long vigil and the effort needed to change his shape it was another hour or more before Chris could sleep that night The sound of that heavy but held back breathing so close to Zachary and himself in the black hold frightened Chris almost more once he was safe in his cabin and hammock than it had at the time Zachary had bolted up the ladder like a frightened squirrel with Chris as a fly holding on for dear life Even so Zachary moved none too fast to suit Chris who flew off toward his own cabin in a chattering fright The lumpy form of Amos asleep in his hammock was reassuring but Chris lay shivering and puzzling for a long time before he finally fell asleep The next day lying on his stomach in the hot sun he dozed with his cheek on his folded hands his mind going over and over the details of the night before Try as he would Chris could not remember having seen any member of the crew even near the hatch leading to the hold Let s see he began in his mind a bunch of the men were singing Bowie was one of em They went down to their quarters first They were really closest to the hatch mister Finney called Abner up to the bridge and Abner came back and went down a while later Guess mister Finney went to his quarters I don t remember seeing him cross the deck or come over that way at all Then let s see Captain Blizzard took a turn around the deck It was getting dark He joked with the cook at the galley door and probably went on for I didn t see him come by again Next Ned Cilley was relieved at the helm by Elbert Jones who took over Ned went on down Or did he Chris wrinkled his brow with concentration I guess so he thought but I don t know so It looks to me as if it could have been one of several people and I ll be switched if I know who I ll keep my eyes open Maybe whoever it was will give himself away somehow and give me a clue The Mirabelle was nearing Tahiti The air was balmy and already a different fragrance pervaded it together with a softer quality which Chris now knew meant land At noon one day Captain Blizzard announced to Chris and Amos Should the wind keep up as it is now by nightfall or by dawn at the latest we should sight Tahiti We ve water and fresh stores to take on there He beamed over his many chins at the two boys Tis a fair place is Tahiti and one you lads will have an interest and a pleasure in seeing Chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin Locking the door he took the conch shell from his sea chest and held it to his ear The voice of his friend so far distant now came to his ear and Chris smiled with the pleasure this brief link with home gave him Nearly to Tahiti eh my lad came mister Wicker s voice Then listen carefully Ask for a private interview with the Captain and when you are alone with him tell him that these are my orders He is to sail on past his usual anchorage making all speed You will know the reason for it at sundown today Tell Captain Blizzard to go around the point he will know and continue for twelve leagues farther on This must be done by night for he must not slacken Then he will see by moonlight a reef The water is phosphorescent and when it breaks over the reef it will shine in the night Then must he heave to and you will go over the side and as a fish find out the channel for the coral is dangerous and the way into the cove almost impossible to find even by day Illustration The land there is like a cup with a chip in its rim the chip is the entrance to the cove This entrance overhung by slanting trees and jungle is just large enough to allow for the passage of the Mirabelle Nevertheless went on mister Wicker s voice in the shell the masts and the sides of the ship could be seen from the sea So with all haste once anchored in the cove the men must go ashore bring back palm fronds and leafy branches and camouflage as you say in your time the Mirabelle from her topmost mast to the water s edge Let the men rest but by midafternoon have them hide along the shore facing the sea for they shall all be witnesses to what is to transpire Then you must do your part for you must board Claggett Chew s ship and see to it that his vessel does not gain many days advantage over the Mirabelle By daylight the Mirabelle will find her way safely to sea again and you will rejoin her with the aid of the rope The voice paused and then enquired Is all this clear Chris tapped three times his heart thumping with excitement at the prospect of the imminent action Going up to the Captain s cabin he took advantage of a moment when mister Finney and Amos were outside to ask Captain Blizzard if he might speak with him alone Certainly my boy boomed out the Captain his blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating mister Finney will be some time on deck We cannot be overheard in here He motioned to a stool as he let himself fall heavily into a teakwood armchair made especially for his bulk But Chris was too excited to sit down and delivered his message standing When he described how in the night that very night he realized with a jumping pulse he was to go over the side of the Mirabelle and find out the channel the Captain looked at him piercingly How now lad he said in his deep voice how are you to find the channel in the dark This was a question Chris was unprepared for but he took a long breath which gave him a moment of extra time and then replied I I see uncommonly well by night Captain sir he said and I m a very strong swimmer His face froze with nervousness that this might not do as an answer and he stood stiff and still before Captain Blizzard The Captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering Then he said Well I do not care for it I cannot say I do This ship is more to me than wife or mother or family She s all I have young man and you can understand that to trust her to so young a lad clever though you may be to go safely past jagged coral reefs into a cove I never even guessed at well he threw out a hand and then rubbed his chin with it You can understand I do not fancy it However and he leaned back in his chair again I take orders from mister Wicker the owner of the Mirabelle and since he says so this is how it must be He paused fingering his lower lip and looking sideways in a reflective fashion at Chris standing before him He told me you would have information from him for me from time to time We shall say no more but I trust you understand the responsibility you have This ship its cargo and its men will be in your hands Chris felt cold for a moment chilled as he had never been before but he spoke up firmly Yes sir I think I can do it safely or I should not try sir Captain Blizzard s round pink face creased in his winning smile Aye aye No doubt Just bear it in mind at the time eh lad I shall sir Chris replied He then went on to describe what else was to follow the covering of the ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings Camouflage was not a word the Captain or anyone else of his time yet understood After we see whatever we are to see Chris ended I ll be absent for a while What can be said during that time sir Chris thought to ask Captain Blizzard pondered for some minutes and Chris was grateful that he asked no questions At last he answered Illustration I shall say you have a tropical fever Christopher he said I am somewhat skilled in medicaments I have to be as captain of a ship and the crew know it I shall say that you are in my own cabin so that I can care for you I shall allow no one to enter it but myself It will be a most contagious fever for a time he added with his eyes twinkling I shall bring you food with my own hands Nothing much broth and gruel and I daresay I can eat it myself if I cannot throw it out the porthole He winked at Chris Have no fear on that score Christopher He looked steadily at the boy in front of him You have your part to carry out I have mine Not since he had left mister Wicker had Chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of Captain Blizzard He knew now that his absence for as long as he had to be away would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for Their conversation had taken some little while As they went over for the last time all the details of what lay ahead of them in the next few hours Chris glancing out the windows of the Captain s cabin saw the splendors of a tropical sunset streaking the sky Oh sir he cried mister Wicker said we d know the reason why we must take shelter tomorrow at sundown today And now it is sundown With quite surprising silence and agility for so large a man Captain Blizzard was out of his chair and half way to the door of his cabin before Chris had much more than finished speaking Over his shoulder continuing with rapid quiet steps to the bridge of the Mirabelle he said Run down to your cabin and fetch up that good spyglass of yours my boy We shall have a good look for as you know night falls in a few moments after sundown in these waters Racing to his cabin and back even in those few seconds Chris could see a change in the sky The brilliance of the colors their extravagant and awe inspiring cloud effects had taken on an intensity of light which meant they were at their peak Standing beside Captain Blizzard on the bridge mister Finney and Amos just beyond Chris and the Captain looked through Chris s powerful spyglass at the wide stretch of the horizon All around lay only the sea and the dazzling sky Not even a porpoise or flying fish broke the surface of the water which was placid save for the long swells over which the Mirabelle dipped her white sails The color ebbed from the sky as if drained from some celestial bowl and in the place of the scarlets and turquoise the clear yellows and the plums came a deep blue that was the forerunner of a fine clear night Chris turned slowly his glass to his eyes searching the edge of what was now their world and especially the line where the sea and sky meet All at once as if a white dagger had stabbed the rim of the ocean white sails grew upward against the encroaching night and Chris found what he had been looking for There sir he cried pointing to the distance and the Captain and mister Finney swung their glasses to where his finger led far astern of the Mirabelle Captain Blizzard s round cheerful face hardened as he looked and mister Finney s lugubrious countenance seemed positively despairing while Amos hopped on one foot crying Leave me look through your glass Chris What do you see What is it you all see It was Captain Blizzard who answered him We see the Venture Amos Claggett Chew s ship coming up fast astern Let us all pray that the wind holds CHAPTER twenty two The captain turning quickly bellowed for all hands to come on deck When they were assembled below him he spoke Men you have followed me for many a voyage and I have always brought you safely home Is it not so A good humored and enthusiastic roar of assent came from the sailors Captain Blizzard began again What lies ahead of us in the next few hours will not make good sense to many of you Nevertheless I ask for your instant help and you shall see what lies at the end of my orders when we reach that time Are you with me AYE cried the sailors their faces close together below their captain and upturned to see him and catch every word All but Zachary Heigh Chris noticed Zachary remained sullen and apart his arms folded on his chest taking no part in the enthusiasm of his companions Well and good roared Captain Blizzard I thank you Now crowd on all the sail she will take boys for the Venture follows hard upon us Illustration Without a word the men sprang to work darting up the masts and out over the rigging like monkeys Every bit of sail the Mirabelle possessed bellied out on the night breeze and Chris could feel the ship leap under his feet as the additional canvas caught the wind and the graceful ship surged forward Night fell before the men had finished and Chris and the Captain could no longer see the sails of Claggett Chew s Venture The Captain turned to Chris It would be my advice lad to go below and sleep for a bit You too Amos I shall send Ned to awaken you when land is sighted Illustration This seemed good reasoning and the two boys went below where they snatched a few hours sleep It seemed only a minute to Chris from the time he lay down in his hammock knowing he was too excited to sleep until Ned Cilley was at his side with a lantern bringing food for Amos and himself Best eat up lads Ned told them and join the Captain sez he to me for land is just ahead and the Captain do be waiting you on the bridge Chris me lad The food was bolted down in no time and Chris feeling fresh and alert ran up to the warm darkness of the bridge To his surprise the usual lanterns were not lit only a small shaded light shed its rays on the compass near the wheel At his questioning look Captain Blizzard muttered Impossible to tell how close behind the Venture may be We have come quickly but they have the faster ship I have no wish to give them more clue than necessary as to where we may be He looked keenly toward the bow his hands clasped behind his back Land is off the starboard quarter and Abner Cloud is out on the bowsprit looking for the reef We have passed our anchorage they expected us or some other ship for fires were lit on shore Sail has been taken in we are going slowly and will soon be there by my reckoning His eyes grown used to the dark Chris now saw that it was a remarkably light night There was no moon but a myriad of stars gave a clear pallid sheen to the sea Chris looking to his left could make out the blacker mass against the stars that was Tahiti The Mirabelle was close inshore and the scent of hot sand from the beaches of flowers and of plants made Chris take many deep grateful breaths May I go forward and be with Abner he asked the Captain Aye replied that good man for by this time Chris was as surefooted as any sailor and for the last month or more had been clambering barefoot in the rigging with the best of them Aye lad the Captain told him and hurry Happen your eyes are sharper than Abner s Sing out when you spy the reef We will heave to and then God be with you my lad to find us out the channel to the cove Chris ran forward to the bow of the Mirabelle and out along the bowsprit where at the tip he could see the long form of Abner Cloud stretched out at full length They murmured a greeting and waited eyes straining ahead Then both saw the phosphorus gleam and fade gleam and fade as the waves broke over the coral Eerie jade green and white gold the phosphorus shone in the starlight Reef ho sang out Abner and the sound of his shout was echoed back from the closeness of the shore in faint dangerous mockery Reef ho Reef ho came a third time from the bridge and then Heave ho thundered Captain Blizzard Drop anchor lads Abner left his place to go back and lend a hand and in his sudden solitude Chris grasped a rope and swung down to the water A porpoise slipped away from the Mirabelle and moved this way and that to get its bearings Then the mass of the reef to the left and the hidden shelf of a second but obscured underwater reef to the right made dark patches in the phosphorescence Far below lay the ghostly spread of sand and the porpoise nosed its way forward The channel to the cove proved to be some five hundred yards long and it seemed no time before the porpoise passed from the shadow of the trees at the shore into the starlit cup of the cove Taking a turn about in the enjoyment of flipping its fins and giving a leap or two the big fish then went back toward where the Mirabelle hung suspended on the glassy sea A boy it was that pulled himself up hand over hand along the anchor rope and stood dripping sea water on the bridge before Captain Blizzard I ve found the channel sir he said abruptly conscious of his importance from the admiring way in which Amos was staring at him There s a dangerous shelf of coral that juts out on the port side if you let me go first and the men man the boats and row her in I think we shall do it safely even in this light Captain Blizzard looked at him his expression both serious and trusting Well lad we do what we must and you and I understand one another Ahoy there he roared down to the shadowy decks from which the black spikes of masts rose high to break the sky Man the boats We shall tow the Mirabelle to cover for there s a channel here Illustration He turned to Chris as the sound of running feet and of the boats being hoisted overboard came loudly in the stillness of the night Now Christopher my boy do you go down and go over the side again and remember what we spoke of a few hours agone The next half hour was an exhausting one for poor Chris It was an impossibility for him to keep for long at a time either his own or the shape of the porpoise He had to enter the water under the eyes of the sailors waiting with their oars poised above the sea in the shape they knew Christopher Mason But once he dived under in order to seek out the treacherous channel in the half light he needed his fish s eyes and senses He therefore would swim a few yards as a fish but had to surface again as himself in order to let the men see him and call The length of two boats keeping to starboard boys Then ease her over this way to port So it went almost foot by foot until the Mirabelle was safe inside the cove and turned broadside to the entrance Then and only then with the anchor safely dropped to the white sandy depths of this hidden harbor did Chris tired to his very bones climb up the ladder and over the ship s side There remained the camouflaging of the Mirabelle for the stars were fading and before long dawn would banish secrecy Illustration But Captain Blizzard and mister Finney awaited Chris on deck Captain Blizzard had his hands clasped behind his back in his habitual gesture and as Chris stood before him swaying with fatigue there was a look on the Captain s face that Chris had never seen there before The usually cheerful joking man was grave while mister Finney so sober and forlorn as a rule looked positively jubilant My good lad the Captain said you said you could do it but truth to tell I doubted it from the bottom of my heart Now that you have succeeded where I am sure no other could have done as well I find I have no words of praise good enough for ye He looked almost tenderly at the tired boy I am proud of you Christopher You did a man s task with a boy s body and mind And it took a man s spirit too Without further words the Captain of the Mirabelle held out his pudgy hand to hold Chris s in a steadying grip and mister Finney swung out his hand his long face breaking into one of the rare smiles Chris was ever to see on it Now me boy thundered the Captain do you go to your well deserved rest Depend upon it we shall cover the ship with green until she looks like the proverbial Christmas hall decked with boughs of holly as the song goes he added chuckling A little later in the day you shall be called to see what you make of the result And now to bed with ye both and he clapped Amos on the back Never had his hammock seemed more like a cloud to Chris than it did on that night nor was sleep ever more engulfing 
4278_187018_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER twenty three
4278_187018_000002_000000	train-clean-360	When Chris awoke he saw that Amos had already stolen out of the cabin for his hammock was rolled up and put away 
4278_187018_000002_000001	train-clean-360	By the strength of the sun and the heat that seeped even through the boards of the ship Chris judged that the morning was well advanced 
4278_187018_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Dressing was rapid for Chris like the rest of the sailors in the tropic heat wore only his breeches 
none	none	His bare chest and shoulders were tanned and healthy and the soles of his bare feet as tough as shoe leather 
4278_187018_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Running up to the bridge he was startled at first at coming on deck at the sudden green shade everywhere 
none	none	Then looking up he saw that to their very peaks the masts and rigging of the Mirabelle had been hidden with palm fronds 
4278_187018_000004_000002	train-clean-360	That side of the ship that could be seen from the sea through the narrow channel entrance had been completely covered with green 
4278_187018_000004_000003	train-clean-360	The work was not yet finished but most of the crew were sleeping during the hot hours while a handful had volunteered to complete the job 
none	none	Illustration The cove by daylight was even lovelier than it had seemed by starlight the night before 
4278_187018_000006_000001	train-clean-360	The deep water with a white base of coral sand flashed in emerald turquoise or sapphire blue 
none	none	Its clarity and sparkling colors put the Jewel Tree into Chris s head and he had a moment s throb of fright when he realized that it was this very night that he must board the Venture to impede her progress toward the Chinese prize 
4278_187018_000007_000000	train-clean-360	He put these thoughts from his mind until the time came and decided to tackle what was most pressing 
none	none	The most urgent matter that first claimed his attention was breakfast and when he reached the bridge he was delighted to see fruits from the island piled in shady corners These and bread and cheese made up his meal which he ate while watching the final leaves and fronds put in place on the sides of the Mirabelle Captain Blizzard came up to him his hands clasped behind his back and nodded toward the men pulling themselves slowly over the ship s side and falling exhausted into the shade to sleep for a few hours They will be fresh enough in a while he said and then we shall one and all row ashore to see what we shall see 
4278_187018_000010_000000	train-clean-360	He paused and Chris looking up saw that the Captain s gaze was fixed on Zachary Heigh 
none	none	Zachary was obviously not only far from sleeping but was restless jumping up to look out to sea and then sitting down again 
4278_187018_000010_000002	train-clean-360	It would be only a few minutes more before up he would jump once more to pace the deck or lean at the ship s rail 
none	none	It would seem the Captain said casually that Zachary has something on his mind mister Finney joined Chris and the Captain at that moment and looking down at Zachary nodded his long sad face in lugubrious agreement Chris opened his mouth to say something to the Captain of what he had seen Zachary doing 
4278_187018_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Before the words could leave his mouth he was interrupted by the appearance of red faced Ned Cilley 
4278_187018_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Cheerful as a sand flea at the prospect of going ashore Ned had come from his rest with a small company of the sailors to ask permission of the Captain if they might leave the ship 
none	none	Well why not the Captain demanded And why not take along the rest too We were all to go ashore presently in any case Those who still want to sleep can do so even more comfortably on the shady sand under the palms So in an instant the decks of the Mirabelle were crowded with laughing jostling men duties over for that day tumbling down the ladders to the dinghies in which they rowed ashore 
4278_187018_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Chris and Amos were shoved along with their friends Chris hiking up his breeches to cover the coil of the magic rope around his waist the leathern bag hanging in plain sight about his neck 
none	none	The sailors had often teased him about it saying that he kept his riches there but they made no attempt to snatch it from him There had been no time to warn the Captain but as the last boatload of sailors leaped into shallow water and scattered under the shade of the trees Chris searched and searched again for three faces among the crowd that he did not find 
4278_187018_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Zachary Heigh the Captain and mister Finney were not to be found 
none	none	Aghast as he understood now what Zachary s plan was to blow up the Mirabelle just as the Venture and its crew came near enough to shoot down the unarmed men Chris rushed back to the water s edge and stood there hesitating in the powerful sun 
4278_187018_000016_000001	train-clean-360	How could he change himself to a fish or other shape unobserved 
none	none	The sailors from the Mirabelle were everywhere in the thickets for the shade as well as along the edge of the cove where he now stood indecisive To use the rope was just as impossible for the beach was broad and Chris was acutely aware that he stood out like a single tree in a field there on the white sand in the broiling sun Better come outen that sun Chris someone called to him There s too much of heat in it to be good for unkivered heads 
4278_187018_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Chris knew the voice of the sailor was right and was on the point of jumping into one of the dinghies where they lay pulled up on the beach 
none	none	Far out on the cove the decks of the Mirabelle were deserted and unlike themselves so empty of life Sweat started out on Chris s forehead as he imagined Zachary in the hold lighting the fuse and he wondered where the good Captain and mister Finney might be 
4278_187018_000019_000002	train-clean-360	He wondered too if he could row over in time or if he would be blown up with the ship 
4278_187018_000020_000000	train-clean-360	The boy had his hands on the scorching wood of a dinghy his muscles tensed to thrust it into the waters of the cove when out over the still harbor jangling in the heat came a prolonged and piercing scream 
4278_187018_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Hot as he was Chris felt himself go cold at the sound 
4278_187018_000020_000002	train-clean-360	He knew instantly although he had never heard it before that this was the death cry of a man 
4278_187018_000020_000003	train-clean-360	The scream came a second time terrified and despairing and out over the water following it came a low scattered rumble 
none	none	Silence fell for several frozen seconds and then all at once Chris became aware as he stood rigid with horror by the boat that the sailors of the Mirabelle had rushed out from the coolness of the shore to stand stiff and appalled beside him 
4278_187018_000021_000001	train-clean-360	A babble of voices broke out and one by one the boats were hastily launched heading back to the ship leaving Chris shaking and unnerved on the sand 
4278_187018_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Over the water as brawny backs bent to the oars the words came floating back 
4278_187018_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Someone s dead for sartin sure 
none	none	Who was left on board you say Leave the lads no sight for young uns Pull you lazy lubbers The captain n and mister Finney bean t among us 
4278_187018_000026_000000	train-clean-360	It was a little later that Chris remembered Amos having taken his arm and led him into the shade and of how sick he was the heat and the scream the fear and a sense of having failed in warning the Captain combining to churn his insides into a queasy place that violently rejected his pleasant breakfast of so short a time before 
none	none	Then weak but somehow feeling better Chris lay in the cool while Amos found a cold pool of water with which he bathed his friend s face and then sat fanning him without a word 
4278_187018_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Chris must have dozed for when he came to himself the light had changed and men were carrying a shapeless bundle wrapped in canvas to a grave dug in the sand 
4278_187018_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Chris started up and joined the men gathered solemnly about the grave and as he searched among them knew a great sense of relief and joy when he saw standing at the grave head the Captain and mister Finney 
4278_187018_000027_000002	train-clean-360	As Chris came up to them Captain Blizzard was speaking a Bible in his hand 
none	none	Men of the Mirabelle by rights as captain of the vessel I should read the burial service for Zachary Heigh that met his death by accident boxes and crates killing him in the hold the way they did But and the Captain scanned the tough weather beaten faces near him slowly one by one you that helped to uncover him know what he meant to do 
4278_187018_000028_000001	train-clean-360	We harbored a viper men who meant to destroy our ship and cargo and leave us to who knows what fate 
none	none	Had not the bung of that keg of molasses above the lighted fuse most providentially fallen out and the fuse been put out by the sirup no doubt neither mister Finney nor I nor the Mirabelle would be here to tell the tale 
4278_187018_000029_000000	train-clean-360	He paused again but there was not a stir from his audience 
4278_187018_000029_000001	train-clean-360	From under their dirty headkerchiefs or straggly unkempt hair the men who knew no other life but the sea no happiness or danger unconnected with it never took their eyes from their captain 
none	none	So men Captain Blizzard resumed the gunpowder that was meant to be the end of our fine ship is now safe and out of harm s way and the traitor who intended this infamous deed has been dealt with by fate and killed in a tomb of his own finding 
4278_187018_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore feeling as I do for my ship and my men I cannot bring myself to read the holy words over this man who had no charity in his heart 
none	none	Illustration Captain Blizzard handed the Bible to Ned Cilley and stood with his hands behind him nodding his head as if to stress his words Yet he said he is being buried far from home and kith or kin 
4278_187018_000033_000001	train-clean-360	It is not proper that he should be left without even a token of respect He gestured with his plump hand to the Bible 
none	none	Do you settle among yourselves who shall do the reading but pardon me that I am so small a man that I cannot forgive a villain So saying he turned slowly away followed by mister Finney who was more than usually sober and solemn Into the dry clatter of palm fronds rose the rough voice of Ned Cilley laboriously reading
4278_187018_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I am the Resurrection and the Life 
4278_187018_000036_000000	train-clean-360	But Chris watching the disappearing backs of the Captain and first mate was thinking what a curious and fortunate thing it was that the bales had fallen on Zachary just at the right time and when there was not a ripple on the cove 
4278_187018_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Chris watched the fat short man and the tall lean one go resolution and anger still evident even in the set of their shoulders 
none	none	The boy was thoughtful thinking back over what Ned had said of them that first day on the docks Faithful he seemed to hear Ned say that s true of the two of em Whatever they can do for mister Wicker is law for Elisha Finney and Captain Blizzard Chris thought them two very remarkable men indeed CHAPTER twenty four Barely were the last spadefuls of sand packed down into Zachary Heigh s grave when Amos who had wandered to the beach facing the sea and long outer shoreline sang out Ship ahoy Remembering their orders the men rushed over from the cove but remained hidden behind trees or shrubs Chris and Amos climbed a tree from whose branches they had a fine unobstructed view up and down the coast To the left far distant a point of land jutted out into the sea tropical trees carrying their green out in a long curve To the right just appearing from the direction in which they themselves had come a few hours previously came a majestic ship black from stem to stern Black was its hull but black too were its sails It looked exceedingly ominous on the afternoon blue of the sea and as it came almost level with the channel to the cove its sails were lowered and the watchers on shore could hear the splash of the anchor as it was heaved overboard Then Ned Cilley oldest of the Mirabelle s sailors came panting up from the cove and Zachary s grave to look out from the leaves at the base of the boys tree Oh Lordy Lordy he exclaimed when he caught sight of the black ship the last of her somber sails being taken in what did I tell you lads he cried addressing anyone and everyone near enough to hear him That be the Black Vulture the pirate ship No vessel is safe near the Black Vulture What a God s mercy that all of us and the Mirabelle are out of sight for the men aboard the Vulture know no pity lads Growls and murmurs rumbled along the shore from clump to clump of leaves where the men stood hidden Chris pulled his spyglass from his pocket and looked eagerly at the pirate ship only a little way out from shore It looked familiar although Chris had had time to see so few ships he could not be certain He shifted the glass looking at details here and there and at the name in gold carved letters against the black painted side Vulture The letters stood out neat and clear and then Chris s heart stopped and started again Ned he called down softly for sound carries far and clearly over water as every sailor knows Ned don t most ships just paint the name on the side Aye lad that they do Ned replied in a puzzled tone looking up through the leaves at the two boys Then isn t it unusual to have letters carved of wood and gilded on the side of a ship Chris persisted Aye that it be Ned s puzzled tone was sharper now and he looked up at Chris and then out to the pirate vessel What re ye aimin at now me lad eh Ned asked What s in your mind Just tell me what ships you know whose name is not painted on but set in carved letters Ned Chris said and he lowered his glass and looked down Illustration Their conversation in the silence had had some quality of excitement in it that had been caught by the others for when Chris glanced down he saw half the ship s company knotted around the base of the tree and a half circle of faces turned up to his along with Ned s Ned s face puckered with effort for a few moments as he muttered Let me see now There s the Southerner no that s painted on or the Priscilla Drew no that s painted too He turned searching the faces of his friends Come boys what ship has carved letters for her name not painted ones Where s a better memory nor mine The Captain and mister Finney came to join the crowd standing back in the shadow of the palm grove Both men were listening attentively It was Bowie who finally spoke up slowly as if unwillingly There s only one ship that ever I did see with carven letters on her side and that was Chew s ship the Venture He was surrounded at once by a low murmur of assent from all sides Aye aye That be so Tis so Chris from his higher perch pointed an accusing finger out to sea Look then for there s your same ship The Venture and the Vulture are one and the same Here take my glass he cried handing it down See the two second letters they are just a bit aslant Weeks ago at home I thought it seemed strange that the E and the N looked loose But loose they are Once at sea they re changed bolted in maybe I don t know how and there s your merchant ship at home and pirate ship at sea The men turned wonderingly but angrily too for the remembrance of what Zachary Heigh had tried to do and so nearly succeeded in rankled and they now began to understand many things Voices began to rise dangerously high in the growing ill feeling Ah the dirty dog And his friend with the airs Have we then been harboring the like of him at home Aye to let him go free to scuttle the next fine ship take all her cargo and leave her valiant men to drown The Captain came forward his hands upraised How now men be still We are here to see what may take place but if your voices should carry as well they may over the water we should have little chance of it Do you be still and watchful A low cry came from Amos who had not taken his eyes from the sea Look Around the point Here comes another ship looks like that was what the ol blackbird was a waiting for Sure enough as the fine white sails of a good sized vessel made its way around the point of land distant shouts and confusion could be heard on the Vulture Looking through his glass which he lent to Amos every few moments Chris could make out scurrying figures on the deck of the pirate ship men springing up the rigging and others walking up the anchor as quickly as they could On the bridge Chris could see the tall gaunt height of Claggett Chew The humpbacked figure of Simon Gosler stood rubbing his hands at one side of his master while on the other observing the work of the sailors with a supercilious air leaned a familiar and ridiculous figure Dressed as if for a court ball at Versailles and holding his lorgnette a few inches from his nose Osterbridge Hawsey remained elegantly aloof from anything so degrading as hard work He looked on with a superior smile as the black sails were unfurled the anchor was heaved dripping from its bed and the hard pressed dirty crew made all speed to go in advance of the oncoming ship Still others among the pirates could be plainly seen manning the guns that had already been brought out from their hiding places while still more stood by to furnish their comrades with cannon balls and powder Amos became so excited he leaned too far forward and nothing learned from his nightly difficulties with his hammock fell out of the tree onto the heads and shoulders of the men below causing astonishment and swallowed laughter before he was hoisted back up again Bless my cap and buttons Ned Cilley cried there s to be a fight for sartin I can see the flash of light on the swords and axes Illustration Quicker than it would take to tell the Vulture black sails spread moved forward to head off the merchantman evidently homeward bound from China The pirate ship sailed down the coast turned and forced the oncoming vessel to stop Then as well as the watchers could guess a parley ensued but if the pirates thought the prey would be an easy one they were mistaken for the merchantman came forward suddenly all sails set in an effort to ram the Vulture But the rich cargo vessel was hopelessly at a disadvantage The pirate guns opened fire ropes were thrown over to the peaceful ship and with yells of triumph that carried even above the tumult of the fighting the pirate crew leapt on board Tiny figures could be seen falling into the water from the merchantman and in a bitter hour or so the sound of fighting died out altogether The men watching from the shore had been kept there only by the obedience the Captain was able to extract from them for rage was in the heart of every man at the sight they were forced to see but were powerless to prevent Even among such hard bitten old salts as they all were more than one could be seen mumbling a prayer for the unfortunate men who had put up such a gallant fight Illustration Come lads Captain Blizzard said to them at last We have seen what we had to see and many is the witness now against Claggett Chew and all his company Aye Aye That we are We ll bear witness to such villainy they should all hang for it the voices cried Then let us go back to our own ship for the dreaded Vulture is not yet gone and unarmed as we too are what chance have we against cannon balls and armed men The men turned about and trouped back to the dinghies while Captain Blizzard stayed behind a moment to speak to Chris My boy he said his hand on Chris s shoulder as in front of them in the late afternoon light the men of the Mirabelle made their way back to the ship tis my advice you had best return with us now or you might be missed by one or another of the men and they have much time to think You shall do what has been set for you to do we shall stay here another day to take on water and fresh fruits He looked smilingly down at Chris but his eyes were concerned It will not be a moment too soon for me until I see you safe and sound on board again my lad he said for I like you well and would have no smallest harm come to you Together they went down to the beach and the waiting dinghy Chris dared not look at the sky above them for he knew night was darkening it and with the night he must leave 
3675-187020-0000	train-other-500	CHAPTER twenty five As soon as the night was dark enough Chris loudly complained of not feeling well of being hot and dizzy and in no time Captain Blizzard had as loudly told him he was to go to bed on a cot in the Captain s cabin
3675-187020-0001	train-other-500	Captain Blizzard closed the door behind him and in Amos s and Ned Cilley s hearing
none	none	 told mister Finney that he was much afraid that Chris had a touch of the sun and was coming down with a tropical fever 
3675-187020-0002	train-other-500	Chris remained alone in the cabin from that time Soon in the cool of the night the sailors of the Mirabelle
none	none	 set out in dinghies to a cascade of fresh water that emptied itself into the cove at its farther end 
3675-187020-0003	train-other-500	taking with them casks and barrels to replenish the ship s water supply Their deep voices swept back over the water to where Chris stood by the open port of the Captain s cabin He was forcing himself toward the moment when he must board the Vulture
3675-187020-0004	train-other-500	His resolve was held back by his mounting anxiety as to how best to carry out what would be necessary and a strong natural reluctance to leave the Mirabelle Leave it he must
none	none	 He stood pondering on what shape to assume 
3675-187020-0005	train-other-500	and when he heard the cry of a belated night bird and saw it coast by on silent wings to vanish in the night he decided to take that shape It took all his courage and determination but this was the first step toward what he had trained for so long to do
3675-187020-0006	train-other-500	and he knew he must do it and at once The boy looked a last time around the cabin then spoke the magic formula in his mind and with a sudden enjoyment in the sense of flight he soared away from the ship
none	none	 out over the cove Illustration The bird swept twice around the Mirabelle 
3675-187020-0007	train-other-500	rising higher as it went Below the few lights of the ship had been carefully hooded away from the sea
none	none	 and the bird spiraling lightly on air currents drifted out from land Illustration The black bulk of the Vulture was easy to find in the clearness of the night 
3675-187020-0008	train-other-500	She was riding at anchor close inshore farther down the coast and final boatfuls of men were returning from the merchantman carrying the last of the spoils Sweeping by toward the beach Chris saw that most of the bandit crew were already drunk
3675-187020-0009	train-other-500	shouting and carousing around fires where they roasted wild creatures they had earlier killed He noticed that a few Tahitians stood apart at the joining of the palm forests and the sand watching the coarse faces of the drunken men
3675-187020-0010	train-other-500	The Tahitians fitting so well into the beauty of their island gold of skin and crowned with flowers carrying themselves with dignity were as far removed as could be imagined from the idea of pagan men
3675-187020-0011	train-other-500	They contrasted sharply at that moment with those from civilization
none	none	 who in filthy rags of clothes and wild disorder of gestures and voices 
3675-187020-0012	train-other-500	staggered about aimlessly gorging food and drinking The watching pagans glanced from the brawling pirates back a short distance down the beach where already a few bodies had been washed ashore from the fight Their distaste and bewilderment were plain
3675-187020-0013	train-other-500	Chris soared high above the din and the smoke of the fires and then seeing Osterbridge Hawsey being rowed back to the Vulture followed after Osterbridge Hawsey had two baskets at his feet
none	none	 One was filled with carefully chosen fruits and the other with the exotic flowers of the island 
3675-187020-0014	train-other-500	Hastily changing himself into a green parakeet Chris alighted on the rail of the Vulture just as Osterbridge Hawsey reached the top of the ladder Determined to make a good impression and perhaps catch Osterbridge s fancy
3675-187020-0015	train-other-500	Chris in his bright parakeet plumage bobbed his head and sidled up and down the ship s rail eyeing Osterbridge Hawsey with his head on one side as he had seen parakeets do The maneuver succeeded
none	none	 for Osterbridge with a little cry of pleasure 
3675-187020-0016	train-other-500	declared himself enchanted I must have that little bird he exclaimed and carefully taking off his fashionable hat even more out of place in the tropics than it had been on the Georgetown docks he slapped it quickly over the parakeet
3675-187020-0017	train-other-500	which allowed itself to be captured This Osterbridge Hawsey s own prize made him crow with delight Clambering as gracefully as possible over the battle scarred side of the Vulture he took the parakeet gently out from under his tricorne
none	none	 A parakeet as I live he shrilled sounding very like a parakeet himself 
3675-187020-0018	train-other-500	My soul what a prize he rattled on entirely to himself as it turned out for the sailors were not at all interested in a pet Exhausted from the battle or drunk from captured wine and all despising the fastidious ways of Osterbridge Hawsey
3675-187020-0019	train-other-500	they paid not the slightest attention They obeyed occasional orders from him for they knew they would be whipped by Claggett Chew if they did not and so hauled up the baskets of fruits and flowers dumped them unceremoniously in the Captain s cabin
3675-187020-0020	train-other-500	and left as quickly as they could to rejoin their shipmates on shore Holding the parakeet firmly Osterbridge Hawsey tied a long silk cord to its right leg fastening the other end to the arm of his chair so that he could closely observe his new pet
3675-187020-0021	train-other-500	Chris did not disappoint him As the parakeet he played the clown for all he was worth He strutted up and down and bobbed his head whenever Osterbridge Hawsey spoke so that it appeared that the brightly feathered bird was in constant agreement with his captor
3675-187020-0022	train-other-500	Or he would cock his head to one side as if weighing one of Osterbridge s remarks in a truly comical manner Looking about meanwhile with his black beady eyes Chris saw that Claggett Chew was lying in a bunk against one wall
3675-187020-0023	train-other-500	nursing his left leg which had been given a sword thrust in the fight He was obviously in pain and perhaps feverish and Osterbridge Hawsey s childish talk irritated and bored him so that he turned his face to the wall
3675-187020-0024	train-other-500	Light from the swinging lamp that Chris remembered from many weeks before threw black hollows into Claggett Chew s eye sockets and deeply lined face Now and again he could be heard grinding his teeth at the pain of his wound
3675-187020-0025	train-other-500	but Osterbridge Hawsey throwing his fine coat and plumed hat to one side lightheartedly amused himself by trying to tempt his new pet with some fruit Claggett he cried as if Claggett Chew could possibly be interested in a parakeet at that point
3675-187020-0026	train-other-500	do look at what I captured This is my very own spoils of war he crowed Claggett Chew made an impolite noise and said nothing Well Osterbridge Hawsey gave a shrug as answer to the noise you know how I detest fighting
none	none	 It is vulgar messy and noisy I can imagine no possible good word to say for it And I see no reason why you could not have made them give up their cargo without a skirmish Ugh he said at the remembrance 
3675-187020-0027	train-other-500	Now a good gentlemanly fight with a rapier is quite another thing he went on He smirked and made a face at the parakeet who did its best to smirk back That is a graceful and fine art
none	none	 Refined and not at all degrading to one s character 
3675-187020-0028	train-other-500	No sound from Claggett Chew Osterbridge Hawsey rattled on and Chris pecking at the fruit proffered him thought that sometimes Osterbridge Hawsey might quite possibly talk just as gaily to himself as he did to the unresponsive Claggett Chew
3675-187020-0029	train-other-500	Claggett your men his voice rose Really
none	none	 They are making an 
3675-187020-0030	train-other-500	exhibition of themselves on the beach
none	none	 Just as well there is no one to see but some aborigines 
3675-187020-0031	train-other-500	Quite revolting How can you bear to associate with such types when you are so much above them yourself but there I must not pique you must I poor Claggett I expect your wound smarts a trifle
3675-187020-0032	train-other-500	Claggett Chew turned his face toward Osterbridge Hawsey his eyes blazing with rage and his mouth working with the fretful annoyance of an ill man but he only muttered and turned away again
none	none	 Do you know 
3675-187020-0033	train-other-500	his more delicate friend pursued stretching out a long finger for the parakeet to perch on which to his evident pleasure it instantly did
none	none	 Do you know Claggett this dear little creature seems fearless and almost human Quite touching 
3675-187020-0034	train-other-500	He paused admiring the vivid colors of the feathers which perhaps awoke a kindred feeling in Osterbridge Hawsey
none	none	 loving a fine display as he did Illustration I shall give you a name 
3675-187020-0035	train-other-500	my little feathered captive he said and pondered
none	none	 I wonder what would be suitable 
3675-187020-0036	train-other-500	Something French undoubtedly He waved a hand and the lace at his wrist fell forward in a not overly clean frill Louis after the dear king No that would be too great an honor for so small a bird gaudy though you are I think
none	none	 Monsieur after the king s brother That s it Little Monsieur He broke off dreamily 
3675-187020-0037	train-other-500	To think that I once knew such a royal such a distinguished man He sighed reminiscently For the first time words came from Claggett Chew He bit them off as if the saying of them cost him very great effort More
3675-187020-0038	train-other-500	ex tinguished than dis tinguished I would say
none	none	 Osterbridge Hawsey permitted a sad condescending smile to cross his face and he shook his finger at Claggett Chew Ah Claggett you never knew him you see 
3675-187020-0039	train-other-500	I am sure you would have liked him such charm
none	none	 So distingue 
3675-187020-0040	train-other-500	Oh dear me yes A most unusual royal personage Osterbridge Hawsey said smiling happily at his parakeet Most of them are so much alike He singled out several fresh fruits peeling some for Claggett Chew
3675-187020-0041	train-other-500	Silence fell over the cabin except for Osterbridge Hawsey s delicately smacking lips as he finished the fruit and licked his fingers one by one the increasingly heavy breathing of Claggett Chew who fell asleep and the distant sound of shouts and clamor from the shore
3675-187020-0042	train-other-500	Osterbridge Hawsey made a pouting face at the sleeping figure of Chew evidently Osterbridge was bored He went to the door and clapped his hands but no one responded Except for the two men and the parakeet the Vulture was deserted
none	none	 Osterbridge Hawsey came back into the cabin 
3675-187020-0043	train-other-500	holding a bottle of wine which he uncorked and poured into a glass Chris foreseeing what would follow hopped up to the back of his new master s chair where he hoped he would be forgotten and tucked his head under his wing in case Osterbridge should look at him
none	none	 Waiting for the right moment was the hardest thing Chris had to do but he knew as Osterbridge Hawsey drank glass after glass and his book fell from his fingers that the right moment would not be long in coming CHAPTER twenty six The tropic coolness of the night intensified as the hours advanced An added freshness swept out from the shore carrying its scent of flowers and earth The feasting pirates had evidently fallen asleep over their food and empty wine mugs for they did not return With a growing sense of uneasiness Chris cautiously brought his head out from under his jade green wing He had had for the past hour the eerie feeling of being stared at and he pecked at his scarlet and yellow breast feathers while sending a glance about the cabin He knew without having to look where the source of his uneasiness lay Claggett Chew had turned on his right side and fixed him with a pale piercing and unblinking eye So fixed it was that for a heart thudding moment Chris imagined his enemy to be dead But after a longer pause than usual the pale heavy lids finally blinked though the unwavering eyes did not move from where Chris was perched as nonchalantly as he knew how to on the back of Osterbridge Hawsey s chair The intelligence behind the stare was infinitely keen and resourceful Chris preening himself in a difficult effort to appear what he was not knew that if Claggett Chew had not already guessed his disguise he was certainly more than suspicious Hastily and with increasing starts of fear that sent the blood spurting through his veins Chris cast about in his mind as to how he could distract Claggett Chew As a parakeet he was chained by the tough silk cord that bound his bird s foot He glanced down Osterbridge Hawsey s now sleeping head lolled like a child s to one side Chris eyed the length of the coral silk cord and then hopped lightly from the back of the chair to Osterbridge Hawsey s shoulder A blink of his parakeet s eyes from under their gray lids showed him that Claggett Chew had him fixed in a penetrating and unwavering stare In his role as parakeet he moved sideways up Osterbridge Hawsey s shoulder making for the shelter that the lolling head would afford to hide him from his enemy s eyes As he moved step by step the parakeet made small low raucous noises not loud enough to awaken Osterbridge Hawsey but enough he hoped to make him seem a natural creature to the man who watched him so intently As he neared Osterbridge Hawsey s neck seeing the ridge of collar on which he intended to perch Chris took heart and with a last quick effort climbed the collar to hide behind Osterbridge Hawsey s head under the thick cluster of curls tied with what was now a ratty black bow He was in this precarious shelter about to change himself into a fly when a scraping noise froze him with fear Looking around Osterbridge s neck he saw that Captain Chew was making desperate efforts to get out of his berth and had not taken his eyes from the place where he had last seen the parakeet Chris knew in that moment with what an astute and formidable enemy he was faced Paralyzed he remained in his green and red parakeet feathers watching the motions of the injured pirate Claggett Chew might be suspicious but he was also a fevered and badly wounded man From his insecure hiding place terrified at every sleeping movement from Osterbridge Hawsey and even more fearful of what Claggett Chew intended Chris stared out as purposefully as Claggett Chew had only a few moments before Illustration The ashen faced man across the room in the glare of the hanging lamp heaved and pushed at the sides of the bunk his eyes brilliant with high fever the sweat of illness and strain glistening over his bare head and colorless face He ground his teeth at the sudden almost intolerable flashes of pain that gripped him when he moved his leg Still he persevered grasped at a corner of the bunk and pushed himself upright If it was possible for his white face to become paler some last vestige of color seemed to leave it Claggett Chew threw up an arm to catch on something to steady himself swayed and closed his sunken eyes His arm caught the lamp which rocking threw jet shadows as jagged as its light was harsh Claggett Chew s prominent broken nose and the deeply grooved lines running down from it to the thin lips under his mustache changed the cruelty of his face into a brutal mask To Chris he scarcely looked human He was a picture of all that was heartless and evil But holding to the edge of his bunk weakened and ill though he was the power of his will still ruled his body He doesn t know when he s licked Chris thought and not knowing he isn t Then trying to hoist himself upright Claggett Chew began beckoning and appealing to Osterbridge Hawsey and Chris shook at the momentary possibility that some noise or word would awaken his sleeping hiding place Osterbridge Osterbridge Claggett Chew cried hoarsely Wake up Hear me Fire take your eyes he muttered in his rage can you not rouse Osterbridge Osterbridge But after a slight shift in position Osterbridge Hawsey slept on Claggett Chew his face livid with pain blood weaving down his chin where he had bitten his lip in an attempt to stifle his groans managed to push himself up and totter to a chair against which he leaned weakly calling out again Plague your bones Osterbridge You sot Help me you sleazy fashionable He started across the few feet of floor separating him from his friend and stooped though he was to adjust his height to the low ceilinged cabin nevertheless his bulk was a terrifying sight as he stumbled and staggered forward His hairless head nearly scraped the ceiling and his shoulders were as broad across as those of two men His hands white but strong and bony twitched at the finger ends as if they were unused to idleness without hurting or without the handle of his whip to grasp Two steps forward Chris saw was all Claggett Chew needed to show him where the parakeet had gone snatch him up and snuff out his life as a candleflame is pinched between finger and thumb Chris was tearing with his beak at the silk cord on his foot raking at it between every look he sent towards Claggett Chew Chris knew that if the pirate touched Osterbridge Hawsey or worse fell the touch or the noise would succeed in awakening the heavily sleeping fop and the parakeet exposed would be an easy prey for Claggett Chew The Captain of the Vulture sweat rolling down his tortured face his eyes starting from their deep sunk sockets with the strain of keeping himself on his feet began roaring at Osterbridge once more Osterbridge Scummy no good Wake That parrot has a scar on his jaw such as I once gave a boy Osterbridge he roared with a final terrible effort Then everything happened at once Osterbridge Hawsey was aroused at last and sat up abruptly heavy headed and bleary thickly asking Claggett What a noise Cannot a man be allowed to doze in peace Where are your manners In the same instant Claggett Chew reached out to pluck the parakeet from behind the sheltering head and neck of the fashionable Chris with a superhuman effort changed himself to a mouse tearing his foot from the frayed cord that held it and leaped into the air Simultaneously Claggett Chew overcome by the approaching blackness he had been fighting crashed to the floor unconscious CHAPTER twenty seven A mouse streaked out the door of the Captain s cabin and did not stop until it reached the farther end of the Vulture where it hid quaking behind someone s old shoe The little creature quieting down at last and feeling its heart regain a more familiar rhythm sniffed distastefully at the shoe It was plain to see it thought that the Vulture was an untidy ill cared for ship Old shoes were never left lying about on the Mirabelle The thought of the Mirabelle brought Chris s mission on the pirate ship into sharper focus He glanced up at the sky there was little time left in which to work safely for Claggett Chew s sharp eyes had noticed the infinitesimal scar on his cheek and his astute brain had put two and two together Chris wondered with a new start of horror if Claggett Chew could read his thoughts and if this was why he had stared at him with such intensity Well he shrugged he knew what had to be done and if he worked quickly and Claggett Chew s swoon lasted long enough not even he could stop him Looking about to make sure he was unobserved he took his own shape again with a sigh of relief It was almost like holding one s breath for long periods of time to be in the shape of a bird or a mouse but to be himself he knew held even greater dangers For the first time he opened the leather bag at his neck and felt inside The first thing his fingers closed on he pulled out He turned the object in his palm toward the starlight to see what it might be It was a folding knife in a case of tortoise shell inlaid with strange signs in silver and mother of pearl Chris opened it the blade was razor sharp and put it experimentally point down on the wood of the deck As if by itself the blade revolved with immense speed sinking in so fast that only just in time did Chris snatch it out and hold it more tightly Trying it out he found that the blade would go through anything sometimes so easily as to scarcely seem to cut leaving no trace of a mark it was so keen At other times when he pressed on it the blade whirled around boring a hole as deep as might be necessary What a useful gadget Chris thought This is just what I need and now is the time he said to himself and sprang up the nearest of the Vulture s three masts What he had to do would take long and there was little time left that night in which to do it For he intended slitting the lines of the rigging here and there not so deeply that they would give way at once and be soon repaired but so that with the first hard blow the lines would break Growing daylight should have warned him long before he was done for Chris wished also to slit the sails very slightly when they had been unfurled and the Vulture was under way The sound of voices broke his absorption in his task Looking down from the top of the mainmast where he clung Chris saw a boatload of returning sailors and realized with a start that it was nearly sunup In a moment a rat ran down the mast to disappear into the foul smelling hold of the pirate vessel How long must he wait in the hold Chris wondered Although he might be in the shape of a rat it was only his outward form that had changed He could not eat grain or refuse that was not suitable for a human and he did not relish having to hold his own in a fight with a true rat there in the darkness He contemplated boring a hole in the hull of the Vulture but decided to wait until the ship was under sail He bitterly regretted not having brought food with him feeling hungry after his exertions about the ship There was nothing else for it but to hide as safely as he could in his own shape This he did after a thorough search in his rat form to find what seemed a safe hidden place high at the top of a pile of the loot stolen from the merchantman There the exhausted boy curled closely against any sudden movement of the ship fell into a sound sleep The dip and sway of a sailing ship cutting the seas and a ravenous appetite combined to wake Chris For the first few moments he was confused at where he was Little or no light seeped into the hold and he was further troubled by having no idea how long he might have slept His first thought was to find food Climbing down from his sleeping place he felt his way back to the ladder leading up to the deck The hatch at the top of the ladder was open and through it came a long faded shaft of light and a freshening draught of air By the quality of the light Chris judged the time to be well along in the afternoon He was debating with himself whether or not to change his shape and venture up to find something to eat when on one of the lower treads of the plank ladder he caught sight of a plate of food Chris stood staring at it for a moment His mouth watered for he had not eaten in many hours and the sight of meat bread and fruit was almost more than he could resist But resist it he did for he argued in himself If this has been put here it must be for me If it is for me it may well be poisoned I shall not be tempted much as Claggett Chew would like me to be He therefore left the plate of food where it was hoping the rats would find it before long and he would have proof through their actions whether or not his theory was right Then as a shadow fell over the hatch far above his head Chris hastily became a fly soaring up to hit Simon Gosler on the nose Crawling in a leisurely fashion on the beggar s hump he lingered long enough to see what the cripple was about Simon was looking down the steep ladder shading his rheumy eyes against the brilliance of the setting sun with one filthy crooked hand Chris crawling nearer could make out what the old man was muttering under his breath The Cap n he say go down an see is the food et up sez he But tis a weary hard way for a pore ol cripple to hop down thet steep ladder I ll not do it He s a sick and fevered man I shall say it was et up the rats will have got it before I get to his cabin in any case an then who s to be the wiser Besides there s no boy on this ship What a fancy he muttered He is an ill man is Claggett Chew May his bones rot I need do no more for him than what I have a mind to knowing as many of his misdeeds as I do Hah He rubbed his hands with anticipation Any day Simon Gosler could be Cap n of the good Vulture an he say the word to the right quarter His eyes no longer hidden behind black patches narrowed with cunning And in the meantime who gets the best share of the spoils Illustration The beggar broke off in a cackle of glee rubbing his dirty gnarled hands with satisfaction and turned away to go back to the Captain s cabin with his message Chris flew away in the direction of the cook s galley where as a fly he found it easy enough to eat his fill of meat and what few good things the Vulture afforded Refreshed he flew hard against the wind in order not to be blown off the ship entirely up to the safety of a part of the rigging from where he could ponder on what he had heard and see whatever there was to be seen Tahiti seemed to have been left far behind for the Vulture was well out to sea and no smallest cloud on the horizon gave any hint of distant land The sailors had set the sails and a good breeze filled the black canvas of the pirate ship The pirates themselves still surly from having eaten and drunk too well after the fight of the day before were quarrelsome and tired and lay about in sprawling groups on the deck far below Looking aft Chris saw Simon Gosler hobbling from the Captain s cabin and Osterbridge Hawsey s graceful overdressed figure outlined in the doorway On an impulse Chris flew down to hear what they were saving I thank you Gosler for your message Osterbridge was saying for Captain Chew seems much relieved to have heard it and I think will now rest quietly and sleep Who is it you say who has some knowledge of medicine the ship s carpenter Here Osterbridge Hawsey rolled his eyes upward and shrugged his expressive shoulders Dear me At least to be a sawbones he has the saw he said disdainfully And knows how to drive a nail into a coffin too master whined the beggar Enough cried Osterbridge in sudden anger Fetch him at once and tell the cook as you pass the galley to bring the Captain some plain hot broth He is much fevered The atmosphere seemed right to Chris for all he had to do Without Claggett Chew s commanding and forbidding presence the pirates would be in a turmoil Chris returned to the higher rigging to wait until darkness should be more profound It was not long before the tropic night fell deeply blue in the first hours until the stars should give off their high clear light As the Vulture rolled and pitched over the sea far down beneath him Chris clung to the rigging and took the chance of changing himself into his own shape Then with all the haste he could he moved a hundred feet above the hard decks up the masts and along the sails setting the new knife gently here and there to part the fibers of the cloth As he went the lines were touched occasionally in vital spots It took long for it had to be done with care Chris scarcely made a move without looking down to see whether the sailors might not have glanced up at the dusky full bellied sails but they were weary after two such hard filled days and soon fell asleep on the planks of the open deck Only Simon Gosler hobbled in and out watching a sailor here stealing from another there lifting his head slowly above the window of the Captain s cabin to spy on what went on inside Like a dark malevolent spirit Simon Gosler crippled in thought and body moved restlessly about the pirate ship Chris completed his task on the sails and rigging and slipped down to hide behind the third mast as he looked out to see where Simon Gosler might be He could see him nowhere and holding his breath stepped over two sleeping pirates sprawled on their backs on the deck to reach the hatch of the hold He had one last task to perform before leaving the Vulture The hatch top was open laid back as before and Chris feeling some danger changed to a mouse as he crouched on the top rung Hesitating sniffing the fetid air of the hold he finally ran down the ladder edge There he sensed imminent death at its foot in time to leap as far as he could as he reached the last few rungs of the ladder For Simon Gosler stood waiting at the bottom armed with a club which he brought down with a splintering crash on the wooden crossbars as the mouse ran past and leapt out of sight Curses instantly filled the hot air like so many wasps Simon Gosler thrashed around with the club laying it about him on the floor narrowly missing several times and yelling at the top of his raucous lungs for companions to help him In no time figures carrying flaming torches clattered down into the hold and Chris his own shape regained knew he would have to be quick as he had never been quick before Illustration With a flick the new knife was open in his hand and the blade pressed with all his strength against the hull of the Vulture He was crowded into a corner as far as possible from the advancing row of torches and shouting men Frantic rats terrified by the flames of the torches and the reverberating noise scampered over Chris s feet or ran up over his bending back and shoulders but he did not move The blade whirled in the stout wooden side of the Vulture but it seemed no time before the flicker and wavering red of the nearest torches sent their flares over him from a distance Chris could make out the silhouette of hunting figures as the first black trickle of sea water pierced through the side of the ship and stained the dry planks Still the boy pushed the knife on a moment more until the water was a steady spurt wetting his hand with its coolness Then as the torches sent their flames moving into the obscure corner where he had been a fly soared up and out over an empty metal plate and four dead rats over the stooped screaming figure of a humpback and a scattered line of searching men out to the freshness of the night and the open sea Only Osterbridge Hawsey curious at the torches and the shouting looked out the cabin door in time to see a tiny boat scud past back toward Tahiti And only in his befuddled dreams did he puzzle over how the small craft could sail against the wind or wonder how it could sail so well when it seemed to be made of rope 
4243_187023_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER twenty eight
4243_187023_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Chris and Amos lay belly down in a low clump of pine scrub at the top of a precipitous rocky pinnacle 
4243_187023_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Below them in the blistering noon lay the palace walls of the Lord of the Seven Seas Descendant of the Sun and the Moon Overlord of the Mountains and the Plains Prince of all the Isles Father of Plenty and Brilliance Before Which All Cast Down Their Eyes the Emperor of China 
4243_187023_000003_000000	train-clean-360	The two boys were uninterested in titles 
4243_187023_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Somewhere within that city within a city inside the enormous spread of the palace walls that were surrounded in their turn by the city of Peking lay the goal they had come so far to seek the Jewel Tree of the Princess of China Now like a general planning his campaign Chris lay looking down at the high angular walls thinking of how he would gain entry 
none	none	On regaining the Mirabelle in a boat made from the magic rope Chris had reappeared among his friends recovered from his fever 
4243_187023_000004_000001	train-clean-360	He had given much thought to what he considered would be the last dangerous section of the journey and after listening to what his master said through the shell was permitted to take Amos on this stage of the voyage 
4243_187023_000004_000002	train-clean-360	It was reasoned if something happened to Chris Amos might be able to carry out their mission by himself 
4243_187023_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The boys had come to Peking on camel back a camel made from the magic rope 
4243_187023_000005_000001	train-clean-360	As Amos had never seen a real camel he thought the rope animal quite natural and as remarkable a creature as a real one 
4243_187023_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Chris took care to make it or disentangle it out of Amos s sight and so many were the strange and wonderful things to be seen that Amos had no time to concern himself over the reality of a camel 
4243_187023_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The arid countryside was blanched by the excessive heat 
4243_187023_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Flies droned over the dates and figs that the boys pulled from their pockets to eat 
4243_187023_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Amos wriggled with excitement as he pointed out details to Chris 
none	none	Chris 
4243_187023_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Look at that procession going in the big gate 
4243_187023_000007_000002	train-clean-360	All those pigtailed gentlemen dressed in embroidered coats 
none	none	I like that blue one with butterflies on it 
4243_187023_000007_000004	train-clean-360	No I d sooner have the black satin one with the dragon in red and yellow He looked again more closely 
4243_187023_000007_000005	train-clean-360	 Or the one with the peacock in green and purple 
4243_187023_000007_000006	train-clean-360	Which would you sooner have 
4243_187023_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Chris paid little attention to Amos s exclamations 
4243_187023_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Leaning on his elbows and looking at the scene below his mind worked busily on these last vital problems 
4243_187023_000008_000002	train-clean-360	But Amos was not waiting for an answer 
4243_187023_000008_000003	train-clean-360	His mind was on the present moment and the present scene forgetful of what lay ahead of them a few hours away 
4243_187023_000008_000004	train-clean-360	He chattered on 
4243_187023_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I like their funny black hats and droopy mustaches 
4243_187023_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Why don t they look like us Chris he asked 
4243_187023_000009_000002	train-clean-360	And then Who all s in the curtained stretcher they re carrying 
none	none	Illustration
4243_187023_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a palanquin Amos 
4243_187023_000011_000001	train-clean-360	They carry dignitaries in them 
4243_187023_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Hate to be a dignitary in all this heat Amos said unenviously What are they doing now he enquired and both boys parted the prickly pine needles to look out and down 
4243_187023_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The leader of the procession rapped three times on the great gate with a gold staff 
4243_187023_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Sentinels and guards came forward walking on the broad gate top and after talking with the members of the procession turned to give an order 
none	none	Illustration 
4243_187023_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Gaily dressed trumpeters with dragon masks on the visors of their helmets raised long brass trumpets 
none	none	A prolonged throbbing Wai Wo shuddered out and the great outer gates of the palace studded with pronged spikes of carved metal swung slowly outward 
4243_187023_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Sixteen men came into sight eight on either side pushing wide the gates 
none	none	Gee 
4243_187023_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Imagine the weight of those doors Chris murmured and taking out his spyglass looked through it 
4243_187023_000016_000002	train-clean-360	 Golly Moses he exclaimed 
4243_187023_000016_000003	train-clean-360	 Take a look Amos 
4243_187024_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 look Amos 
4243_187023_000016_000004	train-clean-360	Those gates are made of bronze nearly three feet thick 
4243_187023_000016_000005	train-clean-360	And now they have the gates open look at the depth of the walls 
none	none	They re as deep through as a room 
4243_187023_000017_000000	train-clean-360	The waiting procession the richly dressed courtiers and curtained palanquin moved inside and the gates were slowly pulled close by lines of men dragging at ropes and chains to shut them 
4243_187023_000017_000001	train-clean-360	From within the main gate drifted out the sound becoming fainter and fainter of other trumpets sounding the order for the opening of other gates 
none	none	Ten times the boys counted the trumpets blew and the same Wai Wo throbbed against the sultry air Lawsy me Amos sighed when no more trumpets were to be heard
4243_187023_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 Ten walls and ten gates at the very least 
4243_187023_000018_000002	train-clean-360	 Course we don t know He rolled his worried eyes toward Chris We don t know whether those folks got to the Emperor or not 
4243_187023_000018_000003	train-clean-360	Likely he s in behind a couple more walls just to be on the safe side He searched his friend s face How are we going past all that many guards and trumpets Chris 
none	none	Even if we could tie up a guard or two how in the world we going to push open gates that heavy 
4243_187023_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Amos need not have been so concerned for Chris had a good plan 
4243_187023_000019_000001	train-clean-360	But just at that moment the heat overcame Chris 
4243_187023_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Putting his head down on his arms he slept 
4243_187023_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Amos slept too and it must have been several hours later that the rising sound of a crowd talking and laughing with excitement penetrated their sleep and brought them to consciousness 
4243_187023_000020_000001	train-clean-360	For a moment they both lay rubbing their eyes and peering out 
4243_187023_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Then they realized by the growing crowd on either side of the palace gate and along the narrow street leading away from it that someone of importance was about to come from the palace and parade through the streets of Peking 
none	none	Wonder what goes on Chris muttered as the crowds below swelled and grew 
4243_187023_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Boys climbed upon one another s shoulders teakwood stools were brought for the richer people to stand on and along the street that led away to the right around the palace walls Chris and Amos could see embroidered silks hung from all the windows and Chinese people in their best holiday clothes laughing excitedly 
4243_187023_000021_000002	train-clean-360	All were looking toward the gates and at last from far within even more distantly than before came the first sound of trumpets 
4243_187023_000021_000003	train-clean-360	These had a sweeter clearer sound than those the boys had heard at noon 
4243_187023_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Never heard a sweeter note Amos said 
none	none	Might be made of silver way they sound The boys counted and twelve times the low lovely notes swung out on the air Twelve gates Chris said to Amos And look you were right they are silver trumpets 
4243_187023_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The trumpeters atop the great outer gates were now differently dressed and there were not two but a dozen lined along the deep palace walls 
none	none	The trumpets ten feet long were curved and of silver that in the sunlight dazzled the eye 
4243_187023_000025_000002	train-clean-360	As they were blown the final gates were pushed aside 
4243_187023_000026_000000	train-clean-360	A long procession emerged of such fantasy and variety of color that the two boys were spellbound 
4243_187023_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Elephants and camels llamas and horses all richly caparisoned in Eastern silks passed along with their riders 
4243_187023_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Guards with curved swords and many thonged whips formed a double hedge between those in the procession and the bystanders 
4243_187023_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Still others led leopards and black panthers on chains as an added protection to those they guarded 
4243_187023_000026_000004	train-clean-360	Palanquin after palanquin passed by but still the crowd seemed to be waiting for something 
none	none	Illustration 
4243_187023_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Then as the silver trumpets continued their sweet lingering notes a murmur arose from the crowd 
4243_187023_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Four lines of youths preceded a palanquin more finely decked than the rest and the murmur rose 
4243_187023_000028_000002	train-clean-360	After it came four lines of Chinese girls fanning the air with peacock fans on long staves fans of white egret feathers and ostrich plumes dyed a yellow gold 
none	none	Illustration
4243_187023_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Amos Chris breathed That color 
4243_187023_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Yellow is the royal color of China 
none	none	He did not have to elaborate his thought for the palanquin that finally came in sight showed by its richness that it could belong only to royalty and by its beauty and grace only to a woman 
4243_187023_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Made of silver and rock crystal studded with diamonds and pearls and hung about with sheer curtains of embroidered yellow silk the palanquin belonged without doubt to a young girl of the royal house 
4243_187023_000031_000002	train-clean-360	As it appeared under the high arch of the outer gate a roar of joy and greeting arose from the waiting crowd and with one accord every man bowed low covering his eyes with the wide sleeve of his left arm 
none	none	The women and girls in the crowd and those leaning from the upper stories of the houses threw down before the palanquin objects that flashed and twinkled in the sun Remembering in time for he had been so much absorbed he had momentarily forgotten it Chris whipped out his spyglass and looked at the curtains of the palanquin 
4243_187023_000032_000001	train-clean-360	The thin silk was transparent enough under the strong focus of the glass and behind it Chris could perceive leaning delicately against silk cushions a Chinese girl as beautiful as a dream 
4243_187023_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Her slightly uptilted eyes were large and dark her skin put a magnolia flower to shame her mouth was lifted in a charming smile and her long exquisite fingers held a spray of jeweled flowers 
none	none	All about the palanquin rained a shower of jeweled buds and petals for no doubt a real flower was thought too inferior for the only child of the Descendant of the Sun and the Moon Prince of all the Isles and Lord of the Seven Seas the Princess of China 
4243_187024_000000_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER twenty nine
4243_187024_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Chris put down his spyglass and the two boys hidden on the piny knoll watched the procession out of sight 
4243_187024_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 I m supposed to take something from her Chris said with his eyes sparkling but I know now what I m going to give her back in return I feel sort of sorry for that girl he added thoughtfully 
none	none	What re we going to do Chris Amos wanted to know
4243_187024_000003_000001	train-clean-360	 What all comes next and have we some more of those dates 
4243_187024_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Chris passed him some 
4243_187024_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 We have to wait until dusk anyway he said his voice abstracted and by the look of the light that won t be long 
none	none	The piny knoll was steep and rocky and only two adventurous boys would ever have reached the top 
4243_187024_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Too precipitous on which to build houses it rose far above the surrounding roofs of Peking 
4243_187024_000005_000002	train-clean-360	The green and scarlet of curved tiles spread under the boys sight like a curling sea 
none	none	Before them stretched out in long angular wings to right and left swept the palace walls 
4243_187024_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Listening and watching the boys gathered by the silver trumpet notes that the Princess and her retinue had re entered the palace walls by another gate 
4243_187024_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Thinking about it Chris mused I wonder if that first palanquin held someone she s to marry 
none	none	It could be And if so this may be her last appearance to the people of the city before leaving for a new domain She would probably take the Jewel Tree with her 
4243_187024_000007_000003	train-clean-360	I can t imagine a woman leaving a thing like that behind 
4243_187024_000007_000004	train-clean-360	He paused remembering 
4243_187024_000007_000005	train-clean-360	She held a spray of jeweled flowers in her hand maybe off the Tree and I never saw anything like it 
4243_187024_000007_000006	train-clean-360	Well can t do a thing until dusk comes down 
4243_187024_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The evening was not long in coming and Chris who had been sitting cross legged under the little crooked pines looked across with great concern to where Amos lay on his back dozing 
4243_187024_000009_000000	train-clean-360	I can t take him along Chris thought and I can t leave him alone if I should get caught 
4243_187024_000009_000001	train-clean-360	What in the world do I do 
4243_187024_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Then remembering the bag of magic odds and ends Chris put his hand inside it and drew out a small folded piece of silk and netting 
4243_187024_000010_000001	train-clean-360	On it a piece of paper like a label showed mister Wicker s fine script 
4243_187024_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Chris looked closer and read Strike three 
4243_187024_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Strike three 
none	none	Strike three 
4243_187024_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Chris held the folded object in his hand and then glanced at Amos Amos slept 
4243_187024_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Going softly out of the pine grove to a narrow ledge of rock where he was out of sight Chris put the object down and said Strike three 
none	none	Nothing happened 
4243_187024_000013_000001	train-clean-360	The object remained an object 
4243_187024_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Then suddenly understanding Chris struck the stone ledge three times 
4243_187024_000014_000000	train-clean-360	At once the folded object began to unfold itself and to puff itself up like a little mushroom 
4243_187024_000014_000001	train-clean-360	In a matter of seconds Chris could see what it was becoming and before he could wink ten times a balloon with a basket hanging from it quite big enough for two boys hung swaying in the air 
4243_187024_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Chris examined it with pleasure and then struck the ground three times again 
4243_187024_000014_000003	train-clean-360	The balloon gently collapsed and refolded itself basket and all into its original neat shape 
none	none	Illustration
4243_187024_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Now if that isn t handy Chris exclaimed 
none	none	Then looking at the light fading from the sky he picked up the folded balloon and went to waken Amos
4243_187024_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Amos he said shaking his friend s shoulder it s time for me to go 
4243_187024_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Are you awake 
4243_187024_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Amos blinked a few times and said he thought so 
4243_187024_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Then listen to me Chris told him earnestly and listen hard Amos sat up more alertly 
none	none	I have a handy thing here which is for you to use only do you hear only if I don t come back Amos s eyes began to get brighter and he swallowed Don t come back Law Chris don t you leave me in this heathen country where nobody understands good English he cried Why unless I d steal and Miss Becky told me never to do that but unless I did how could I eat in these foreign parts Chris sat back on his haunches
4243_187024_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 Well I don t know how you could myself 
4243_187024_000023_000002	train-clean-360	But don t you cross any bridges until you come to them 
4243_187024_000023_000003	train-clean-360	Look He held out the folded balloon 
4243_187024_000023_000004	train-clean-360	 If I m not back by two sunups from now I may have to hide all during tomorrow if I m not back by then put this package out beyond the trees in the clearing 
4243_187024_000023_000005	train-clean-360	That s very important 
4243_187024_000023_000006	train-clean-360	You ve got that 
4243_187024_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 I haven t got anything but a few old dried up fruits Amos pouted That s all 
none	none	No Amos Chris gave him another rousing shake
4243_187024_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 I mean do you understand that much 
4243_187024_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Amos brightened at once and broke into a broad grin 
4243_187024_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes of course 
4243_187024_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Why didn t you say so in the first place 
4243_187024_000027_000002	train-clean-360	You said put the package out in the clear 
4243_187024_000027_000003	train-clean-360	Where s that on this tippy top of a hill Amos asked looking about 
4243_187024_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 The ledge near where we climbed up 
4243_187024_000028_000001	train-clean-360	That s big enough Chris reminded him 
4243_187024_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes Amos said looking wise 
4243_187024_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Chris took up again you put the package on the ledge and strike the ground three times 
4243_187024_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Like this And before Chris could stop him Amos had struck the earth beside him twice before Chris seized his hand in mid air 
none	none	Amos Not now I said only if you have to get away 
4243_187024_000032_000002	train-clean-360	If someone comes after you or if I don t come back 
none	none	Promise me not to strike three at all except for either of those two reasons 
4243_187024_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Amos raised his right hand looking very solemn 
4243_187024_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 I promise he said Only he added looking bewildered and already somewhat forlorn what happens when I do hit three times 
none	none	Why it s a mag it s a special kind of balloon Chris began after correcting what had almost been a bad slip
4243_187024_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 A what Amos stuck his head forward trying hard to understand 
none	none	A balloon Oh 
4243_187024_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Chris stopped and stared at Amos 
4243_187024_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps balloons had not yet been invented 
4243_187024_000037_000002	train-clean-360	How very confusing 
4243_187024_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 It s something that will hold you up in the air 
4243_187024_000038_000001	train-clean-360	There s a basket for you to sit in 
none	none	No sir Amos cried wagging his head decisively from side to side Me in the air over the roofs and high up No indeedy Chris 
4243_187024_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Not me 
4243_187024_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Chris was becoming exasperated 
4243_187024_000040_000001	train-clean-360	He had important things to do 
none	none	Look Amos 
4243_187024_000041_000001	train-clean-360	If you have to use it you ll be in such a bad fix that being up in the air will seem like the very best thing that could happen 
4243_187024_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Stop running 
4243_187024_000041_000003	train-clean-360	I ll be back I hope 
4243_187024_000042_000000	train-clean-360	He turned away toward the ledge and clearing 
4243_187024_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 And now wish me luck and stay here and wait for me 
4243_187024_000046_000005	train-clean-360	wish me luck 
none	none	and stay here and wait for me 
4243_187024_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Don t follow me now or watch or I might fail 
4243_187024_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Amos jumped up from the pine covered ground 
4243_187024_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh Chris he cried his voice sharp with distress can t I go 
4243_187024_000044_000002	train-clean-360	You might get hurt There s no telling what could happen if you re all alone 
none	none	Chris was tempted to take his friend with him but someone must get the news back to the Mirabelle if he should fail If this happened he did not doubt but that the magic balloon would carry Amos safely to the ship
4243_187024_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 No he said after a long moment 
none	none	Better not 
4243_187024_000046_000002	train-clean-360	But I d sure like to Amos 
4243_187024_000046_000003	train-clean-360	Now don t lose that package 
4243_187024_000046_000004	train-clean-360	It s your escape 
none	none	Wish me luck 
4243_187024_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Amos clasped his hand and then rushing off dashed back again 
4243_187024_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Here Chris 
4243_187024_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Our fruits 
4243_187024_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Better not to eat strange food in this foreigny place 
4243_187024_000048_000003	train-clean-360	Good luck he added 
4243_187024_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Chris stuffed the dried fruit in his pocket 
4243_187024_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Amos turned back into the darkening pine knoll and Chris pushed his way out to the narrow steep ledge hanging high above the roofs of Peking 
4243_187024_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Chris uncoiled the magic rope from around his waist and standing as far out on the rock ledge as he dared in order to have the greatest possible freedom of movement he attempted for the first time to draw an eagle in the air with the rope 
4243_187024_000050_000001	train-clean-360	It was a complicated fast maneuver 
none	none	The rope twisted and whipped in the air and the result was a molted looking droop tailed buzzard 
4243_187024_000050_000003	train-clean-360	Its wings were not wide enough its back very insecure to look at 
4243_187024_000050_000004	train-clean-360	In short Chris knew it was a total failure 
4243_187024_000051_000000	train-clean-360	He tried again racing against the oncoming darkness and this time he succeeded although when he pulled it close and straddled the body of the magic bird his heart was in his throat that it might unfurl itself become just a rope and hurl him to his death far below 
4243_187024_000052_000000	train-clean-360	But this second eagle seemed secure enough 
4243_187024_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Chris pressed his hands on the wings spread out on either side with a jolt they flapped and the boy s strange conveyance moved somewhat unsteadily through the air 
4243_187024_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Chris frightened but resolute found that by touching the head of the bird in the direction he wanted to go the magic eagle would turn and after a few moments to test out his new method of travel Chris coasted over the gaily tiled roofs as he hunted for something 
none	none	Illustration 
4243_187024_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Peking at that time had many palaces 
4243_187024_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Wealthy Chinese and people of title and family owned beautiful houses set in terraced gardens surrounded by parks and ancient trees 
4243_187024_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Somewhere Chris had heard of this and remembered it and now in the dusk that was nearly night the eagle carried him silently over the city as he looked for what he wanted to find 
none	none	At last the very fragrance rising up toward him on the night air guided him to a large palace set in gardens 
4243_187024_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Pools of water reflected the first stars among their lilypads 
4243_187024_000056_000002	train-clean-360	The shaded walks and lawns were deserted at that hour 
none	none	Swooping down and flying back and forth to make sure he would not be seen Chris grounded the eagle and holding fast to one wing tip in case he should have to take off in a hurry he walked up and down examining and searching CHAPTER thirty The night was too clear to suit Chris for the dangerous work that lay ahead The eagle bore him up again from the garden and turning back lifted high in the air as it neared the maze of walls of the Emperor s palace Chris longed to fly lower but he was afraid that one of the many guards might give the alarm The eagle flying between the palace and the moon cast a quick racing shadow over wall and ground The one advantage on such a clear night Chris thought when he could be easily spotted was in the silence of the magic bird He bent over to peer down between the eagle s beaked head and widespread beating wings Wall after wall palace and garden within palace and garden he saw Windows were lit like fireflies far below him and the series of courtyards opened themselves in seemingly endless duplication How he wondered could he ever find the inner garden well hidden certainly where the Princess of China walked under trees and looked at her goldfish in long clear pools Then he remembered with a start the folded paper seized so long ago in a ship anchored on the Potomac A cabin under a smoking lamp the strong scent of flowers a monkey s form came back into his memory and he felt in the leather pouch for Claggett Chew s plan His fingers touched it and brought out the creased finger marked scrap of paper In the moonlight he unfolded it sitting on the eagle s back high above the walls and palaces of the Emperor of China He found that he could follow from his height and check with the map building by building and one courtyard after another Moving cautiously forward in the air he looked at the heavy cross mark made by Claggett Chew the night the Mirabelle had set sail Then all at once beneath him Chris made out walls ahead that seemed higher than the others He flew over temples with gently rocking bells hung at their curled eaves and over peaked rooftops of carved stone until reaching a place apparently identical with the cross on the map he dared to drop a little lower above a certain courtyard As he did so he saw that the guardhouses were set about on the top of the wall which measured about ten feet from side to side All faced outward away from the gardens they protected hidden now in shadow Why it s like a prison Chris thought except that the guards aren t allowed to look down at her The poor kid Imagine living here all your days No wonder she was pleased at being in a procession yesterday No fragrance except that of cool water came up from the courtyard to Chris Going higher into the air he hovered there on his eagle s back watching the guardhouses He timed the guards counting After an hour he found there were two minutes between the time Guard Number Six reached his post and Guard Number Seven went back to replace him Chris waited again watching the guards and counting half aloud in case he missed that two minute interval One there he goes across to Two Two There Two goes back again Three there Three marches along to Guardhouse Four Four there he goes to Five Illustration Chris s breath came quickly and his heart began to pound in his ears Five Five starts out toward Six Six and now they change swords or something and here I go Pressing on the back of the eagle the bird sank silently into the black well of the courtyard past the guardhouse and down just as Guard Number Seven emerged to walk back to replace Number Six The walls of the Princess s courtyard were indeed as high and forbidding as those of a dungeon A shimmer of water reflected the night sky and looking down Chris saw a dark glistening mass beneath him It seemed to be trees but when his dangling legs touched them sharp edges cut his legs and he quickly veered away At last coming down at the edge of the pool his eyes became used to the gloom and he could see about him The garden ground crunched under his feet and glowed in the night and bending to touch it Chris s fingertip came away dusted with gold Golly Moses he breathed and looked about The edge of the long rectangular pool was of silver the walk around it of jasper and chalcedony and as he lifted his eyes to look farther he saw that the entire garden was made up of trees with jewel leaves No wonder the leaves cut my legs Chris thought to himself They re probably emeralds Towing the eagle by its beak he wandered about There was neither grass nor flowers no true plants or trees All bushes borders and shaded walks were of jewels They gave out onto the air no scent of greenness and no welcoming scent of flowers Gee Chris almost said aloud Who d want to play on ground up gold Why except that it s yellow it might as well be gravel And no trees not real ones Gee She must be a pretty miserable girl I wonder if birds like the jewel trees Looking into shrubs of coral or jade or amethyst Chris found no nests and shook his head Guess I brought the right replacement after all he decided Now to work Which shall I take He made a tour of the jewel gardens and at the end of the pool facing the carved jeweled doorway and windows of a pavilion set into the surrounding walls Chris found a tree he thought right Small and round as if freshly trimmed it answered mister Wicker s description of months ago Leaves of emeralds buds of diamonds flowers of sapphires and fruits of rubies studded thick with pearls Taking out his magic knife in a second Chris had cut away a large circle of earth in a tub shape to shelter the roots and carried his heavy burden to the eagle s back There he took off something which he planted where the Jewel Tree had been and cupping his hands watered it from the pool as best he could Just as he finished and was moving away a movement in the black rectangle of the pavilion door at the far end of the garden caught his eye He had only time enough to pull the eagle the Jewel Tree and himself into the cloaking shadow of a nearby avenue of emerald trees to avoid being seen The movement was pale and slight against the blackness of the open door and the night was very still As Chris held his breath the dampened leaves and petals of the bush he had planted sent their green fragrance lifting and turning on the night air As if that had been the signal it had long waited for a dust colored bird flew down to perch on a thorny stem It was a nightingale Its song started slowly and softly at first and then as it forgot that it was alone the lovely variations grew pealing out where no birdsong had ever been heard before Chris was not the only one who had never heard a nightingale To the other occupant of the jeweled garden it was newer and more beautiful than anything she had ever heard The Princess s tiny feet made no sound on the gold gravel as she edged nearer to the bush and the song At last the nightingale flew away and the scent of the roses drifting toward a princess who had only been permitted flowers of stone was overwhelming She went up and broke off a flower as red as a ruby and as red as her mouth As red too as her blood for a thorn stabbed her and she nearly dropped the rose with a soft cry But the wonder of it was stronger than the pain and she buried her face in the freshness of the red rose the first flower she had ever seen Behind her rising gently and quietly out of sight was a smiling boy and a tree of jewels she would never miss CHAPTER thirty one Chris s thoughts were so taken up with the pleasure of the little Chinese Princess at her first rose that he had miscalculated As a matter of fact he had forgotten about the guards in his excitement at holding the Jewel Tree and at getting away and just as the eagle rose to the top of the wall one of the guards saw him Had it been earlier Chris could have risen quickly out of sight But the Jewel Tree was heavy in itself the earth holding its roots was an additional weight so that the eagle only rose half as quickly as it had before The guard gave a shout and a spear whistled past Chris s ear Instantly the flames of bonfires spurted on all the walls and to his terror Chris found himself in a glare of light as powerful as modern searchlights He clutched the Jewel Tree urging the magic bird up but there are limits even to magic and the bird was moving at the peak of its ability Black racing figures darted along the walls the flames of the watchfires leapt higher in the air and now arrows were singing their keening note of death about the boy lifting so slowly into the night Chris crouching behind the Jewel Tree was rocked and nearly unseated from the eagle when an arrow hit the earth around the Tree roots imbedding itself deeply and quivering there at an angle The shouts and confusion grew but after a few terror stricken moments Chris knew he was high enough to be out of danger He gave a deep shuddering sigh of relief and turned the head of the laboring eagle toward the city His thoughts were on escape but first he had a duty that as an honorable person he felt bound to perform He was naturally observant he had also made a point of noticing landmarks so that he found the garden from which he had taken the rosebush without too much trouble What he was totally unprepared for was that the entire city of Peking aroused by the watchfires on the palace walls was awake and in alarm and the light of flares and lanterns glowed from every house Nevertheless to replace the rosebush was an honorable necessity and in spite of wide canary yellow blocks streaming from the windows of the lesser palace and falling in broad sections over the lawns and far into the gardens Chris came down as much in the shadow of trees as he could and breaking off a sprig of the Jewel Tree stuck it in the ground where the rosebush had been Then quickly regaining the eagle s back he was lifted into the air and up over the roofs What was his consternation however on nearing the pine knoll to see the whole group of scrubby trees aflame and no sign of Amos The pine needles and tree trunks thick with resin burnt fiercely Chris did not dare to come too close Not only was the heat intense but the crowds collecting below looked upward to watch in a puzzled way while others ran from near the palace gates to gaze and speculate Chris turned sadly away large tears for Amos running down his cheeks his heart constricted and his eyes half blinded when from a great distance he heard a trailing call Oo h Chris You Chris Chris s heart leapt up and wiping his eyes clear he looked in the direction of the sound A balloon was moving rapidly away over the peaked curved roofs of Peking careening slightly from side to side as it sailed on the night breeze By the time Chris had caught up with Amos in the balloon Peking lay far behind them Holding on to the edge of the basket Chris blurted out What in the world goes on Amos I thought you were burned alive I was never more scared in my life Amos s eyes wider than ever from the excitement of events batted at Chris You re scared What do you think I am Get me out of this I never did want to be up in the air nohow and I want out now But what about the fire Amos Chris persisted holding to the Jewel Tree with one hand and the balloon basket with the other How did you get out Amos sent a squeamish glance out of the corner of one eye at the moving ground beneath them and then realizing that they were on their way back to the Mirabelle swallowed and began to talk I waited like you said an I guess I fell asleep All at once such a noise and flames flashing woke me up and right away seeing fires and commotion all over the palace walls I supposed they had spotted you somehow I thought should another fire break out somewhere else it might pull the crowds away from the palace or make them think something was goin on up there So I lit a fire with my flint and then ran right quick with the package to the ledge struck three times and shut my eyes here Amos covered his eyes with one hand and got in And this silly thing s been a tippin and a teeterin ever since Illustration Chris brought balloon and eagle down into a rice field and the two boys transferred the Jewel Tree to the greater safety of the balloon basket Amos having the wonderful Jewel Tree to guard forgot his fears and sat down beside it where he soon fell asleep Chris tying the tail of the eagle to the side of the basket with his shirt towed Amos and the Jewel Tree through the air all that night and all the next day They came down at noon in a deserted part of the country so that Chris could sleep and rest and Amos find fresh water for the leathern bottles they had strapped to their waists Then they went on until they saw the sea and the wavering line of the coast below and ahead of them Illustration The eagle and balloon came gently down at dusk The balloon was folded into its small size and put back in the pouch around Chris s neck Out of sight of Amos Chris transformed the eagle to a boat in which in the dark of the night the two boys reached the side of the Mirabelle with their precious cargo The sailors of the Mirabelle were asleep but Chris roused the Captain who helped them secretly carry the Jewel Tree to a corner of his cabin All hands were then called on deck and everything was hurry and bustle Before dawn had broken the Mirabelle had left the coast of China and was well out to sea CHAPTER thirty two It was not until Chris relieved proud and happy at the success of his mission opened his sea chest and took out the shell that he had the faintest vibration of trouble or danger Until then he had lived breathed and thought only of obtaining the Jewel Tree and once that had been accomplished he felt that his anxieties were over However as he shut and locked the cabin door behind him feeling with an increased zest the surge and rock of the Mirabelle under his feet as she plunged through the sea something brought him up short and took the glow from his face Slowly and with a grave expression Chris went to his sea chest and took the shell from it but he almost knew before he heard it what mister Wicker would say Nevertheless when through the whorls of the shell at his ear he heard the familiar voice so far away and so long unheard his eyes lit up again You have done better than my fondest hopes Christopher my boy came mister Wicker s voice I cannot commend you enough for the success of your difficult journey and the manner in which with courage quick wit and fortitude you met every danger Amos is much to be praised too He is a loyal friend and I am proud of him as well as of you Chris kneeling by the brass studded chest with the shell held to his ear could easily bring before his inner eye the cosy room in Georgetown the crackling logs upon the hearth and the voice of Becky Boozer raised in lusty song coming from the direction of the kitchen He missed it Much as he loved the Mirabelle and much as he prized the friendship of all aboard her still mister Wicker and Becky held an especial place in his heart and he longed all at once with almost intolerable sharpness to be at home once more That his mother was getting better he had never doubted but kneeling there alone he suddenly wanted to have done with adventure for a while My boy are you listening came mister Wicker s words and Chris s thoughts brought him back with a jolt to the cabin of a ship sailing the China seas Christopher my poor lad mister Wicker said at his ear had you forgotten the Vulture No he answered for the boy not altogether but perhaps just a little Yet make no mistake the Captain of the Vulture has not forgotten you Nor is he under any misapprehension as to who it was who so skillfully crippled his ship so that he did not reach Peking before you mister Wicker s voice took on the edge it always held when he spoke of Claggett Chew Claggett Chew waits for you beyond Shanghai in the East China Sea Be wary and be rested Christopher for you will have a battle such as you have never dreamed of and even I cannot tell how it will end It will depend on your quickness and ingenuity And do not forget the leather pouch The voice of his friend hesitated and then said so faintly and from so far that it was all Chris could do to hear it I repeat be wary Christopher He will do everything in his power The voice faded away and Chris with heavy gestures replaced the shell shut the lid of his sea chest and unlocking the door went with dragging feet to tell Captain Blizzard of what awaited them Illustration The wind was only moderately fair so that the Mirabelle took some time passing beyond the Yellow Sea During those days Chris practised his magic with more concentration than ever before He rested and slept ate hugely and exercised by climbing up the masts of the Mirabelle so that by the time a long dark line was sighted on their starboard side on the Chinese coast and the approach to Shanghai Chris was fit and well as he had never been before Warned by Chris in time Captain Blizzard on hearing of the dangers ahead had determined to put into port at Shanghai and there with much haggling and bargaining bought four cannons and ammunition He also laid in a store of swords daggers and assorted weapons for all on board Illustration Believing that an ounce of prevention was better than a pound of cure the worthy captain drilled all hands on the Mirabelle twice a day thereafter This the weather being fair and the ship needing only the helmsman and a lookout to care for her the sailors were quite willing to do More especially when their captain in whom they had unbounded faith told them he had good reason to believe they would have a nasty and perhaps disastrous encounter with the pirate ship during which they bid fair to be bested if they did not bestir themselves and prepare for it The men entered into the training with gusto They made dummies which were hung on ropes and maneuvered by their friends braced in the rigging The dummies were suddenly swung out and down in every direction in imitation of pirates boarding the ship and were fallen upon by the sailors of the Mirabelle with roars of glee as if they were at that very moment being tackled by the pirate crew Then they practised fast turning and tacking of the ship and even in between the regular hours set aside by the Captain for what he termed fighting time several groups of men could always be seen on some part of the deck practising dueling with sword and dagger In short long before the Mirabelle reached the East China Sea its crew had become proficient in all manner of hand to hand fighting The Mirabelle was level with the Ryukyu Islands on a gusty glary day when the lookout s long drawn out cry floated down from the crow s nest to those sailors who were engaged in a mock fight on deck Sail ho oo Instantly every man was at the ship s side shading his eyes against the dazzle that made a brassy light over sea and sky The Ryukyu Islands off the port beam were not visible in the metallic haze that grew as the sun arched higher The fitful wind gave promise of stopping altogether and leaving both ships becalmed Chris on the bridge beside the Captain stood looking through his spyglass at the advancing sail Captain Blizzard lowered his own glass to turn enquiringly to Chris Yes the boy said at last I m sure now I ought to know those sails They re unmistakable That is the Vulture sir Captain Blizzard wheeled about before the last word had left Chris s lips and bellowed at the top of his lungs All hands on deck he roared Man the guns Bring out the ammunition and every man to his place The training the men had gone through instantly asserted itself Although there was a great deal of running about up and down the ladder to the hold and of handing up the heavy ammunition all was orderly and not an extra word was spoken There was little enough time left over however The Vulture approached rapidly and then crossed the bow of the Mirabelle so narrowly that the Mirabelle had to put hard about and Captain Blizzard roared orders to take in sail in order not to smash into the pirate vessel before it had been carried by the breeze beyond its prey This maneuver by Claggett Chew momentarily threw the Mirabelle s crew into confusion and turned their attention to the hasty management of their ship To Chris working with the men at whatever was most urgent it seemed only an instant before the Vulture was again alongside the Mirabelle and Claggett Chew stood on the gunwale hailing them Heave to or you shall sink to the sharks he cried Look to yourself pirate Captain Blizzard thundered in reply and giving the signal the unsuspected guns of the Mirabelle belched out their deadly charges Claggett Chew was knocked back to the deck of his ship and Chris had time to see him shake off the hand of a sailor who would have helped him to safety Chris also saw peeking out from the doorway of Claggett Chew s cabin the white horrified face of Osterbridge Hawsey who could not stand the sight of blood so common The face withdrew and Chris could imagine the dandy playing cards or reading as best he could in the din until the battle should be over Illustration The pirates many wounded and all taken aback at the unforeseen presence of guns on board the Mirabelle were tough fighters notwithstanding and moved the Vulture in ever nearer until the two ships with fallen masts and entangled rigging were locked on the brazen sea in deathly struggle Brave as the seamen of the Mirabelle proved themselves to be the pirates were seasoned in pitiless combat The guns of both ships roared and coughed and the battle raged through the noon into the afternoon Finally Chris could bear no more The crew of his ship were weakening even as were those of the Vulture and shuddering though he was at the thought of the sharks in the sea Chris knew he had to use every method in his power if any on board were to survive Illustration Keeping his own form he jumped into the blood tinged water his magic knife open and ready in his hand CHAPTER thirty three The smoke of the guns of both ships so hung upon the air that Chris counted on its heavy curtain to screen him from his enemies He swam to the far side of the attacking vessel and there forced his magic knife for the second time against the side of the Vulture He was treading water holding to a rope that dangled over the side of the ship when with no interior tremor of warning a cut that he almost thought had penetrated to the bone lashed across his shoulders narrowly missing his left ear Without stopping to think Chris took half a breath and submerged as deeply as he could go hearing above him even through the sounds of the battle and the wavering water the fleck of Claggett Chew s metal tipped whip as it hit the water where he had been only a second before Chris would have dived under the great barnacled hull of the Vulture then and there to come up on the other side but good swimmer though he was he was unsure that he could hold even a full breath for so long a dive Added to this he had had no time to do more than gasp a momentary breath of air and even as he rose to the surface with bursting lungs he saw the figure of a man leap into the water from the side of the Vulture Before the bubbles of the man s descent had had time to disappear the most dreaded of all sights for a swimmer showed itself above the water It was the sinister triangle of a shark s fin cutting the surface of the sea as it advanced with terrifying speed to where Chris gazed almost paralyzed with horror Thrusting the knife into the pouch at his neck Chris took the shape of a dolphin and plunged deeply even as the infuriated shark was carried over and beyond him by its own impetus before it could turn But turn it did with lightning speed and Chris knew he had no protection against that murderous underslung jaw racked above and below with deadly teeth The shark in one long powerful movement had turned and gone under the dolphin which now raced upward from the dim lightless depths of the sea to the surface where it hoped to escape The shark turned on its back with a motion at once lazy and sickening in its assurance of its prey Its soft greenish white belly glimmered slimily in the sea its frightful jaws open as it came almost languidly up through the water certain of snapping its adversary in half But in that one moment when it turned belly uppermost its eyes were unable to watch its goal and in that moment the dolphin made a desperate leap from the water and a sea bird soared into the air The sea bird had no more than wheeled to sight the shark below when a scream from the air above it made it instantly drop and shift to one side as a hawk talons spread and eyes red with hatred plunged down from a great height its beak open to seize and to rend The sea bird veering away on the wind became a fly but the hawk instantly vanished to be replaced by a bat which darted after the fly with such velocity that it was the current of air from its wings that drove the fly closer to the pirate ship Illustration With a despairing effort the fly flew directly into the smoke of the battle and at that moment a mouse hid in a corner near an overturned cask shaking in all its limbs its pointed teeth chattering with fright Finally regaining its breath it ventured to look around the corner All seemed serene to the mouse who saw no shadow of danger although sounds of battle still ebbed and flowed on the deck below it crisscrossed by shouts and orders screams and groans as the pirates and the sailors of the Mirabelle doggedly fought on The mouse wished to retake its own shape and continue its work with the magic knife which had been interrupted it thought too soon to have done any good At last it decided to run along the deck near Claggett Chew s cabin From there it hoped to reach the side of the ship nearest to the Mirabelle As it slipped from its hiding place and began its run it realized too late its mistake and panic almost overcame it For a cat had been crouched behind it and now gave a mighty pounce One outstretched paw came down on the mouse s tail but the mouse wrenched it free and desperate and panting dashed into the first opening it saw Illustration This proved to be no less than Claggett Chew s cabin the door of which had been left open so that Osterbridge Hawsey could watch the fight with the least possible discomfort He sat somnolent in a comfortable chair his long legs stretched out before him smoking a clay pipe His attention wandering as it so often did he failed to see the mouse who ran under his legs into the shadow beneath them The frantic mouse now determined in the seconds left to it for decision to attempt a bold move In a flash in fact as a black cat with angry yellow slitted eyes put its head around the door jamb a jade green parakeet with red and yellow breast feathers hopped onto Osterbridge Hawsey s ankle and with a speed tempered by its most engaging ways sidled up Osterbridge Hawsey s outstretched leg The yellow eyed cat made a dash with both clawing paws outstretched to fall upon the bird but the parakeet fluttered into the air out of reach and came down higher up on Osterbridge Hawsey s knee Osterbridge startled from his daydream shooed away the cat and got up precipitously enough to give it a kick which sent it miaowling from the cabin Osterbridge vastly pleased to see his green parakeet again was wreathed in smiles Ah now he exclaimed holding out a condescending finger Petit Monsieur back again How too simply enchanting Just when poor Osterbridge was so bored and had no one to talk to Well my pretty and both Osterbridge and the parakeet cocked their heads at one another and where have you been I wonder Osterbridge examined the little bird perched on his finger and his eyes were thoughtful It is true you have a tiny mark at the side of your jaw if parakeets have jaws my friend But there is no such thing as magic Not the kind of magic whereby a human can be something else He broke into peals of high laughter What a joke if it were possible Now what could I be eh He looked fondly at the bird and the bird looked back at him daring to open its beak and emit a small but clear Haw Haw yourself returned Osterbridge in high good humor He leaned back in his chair Now all this is a most engaging train of thought he pursued If I could change myself what should I be He fell to musing and as he did so the dreaded shadow Chris had anticipated fell across the doorway A moment later Claggett Chew limping from an old wound and a newly received bruise stood in the entrance Osterbridge Hawsey yawned Ah there you are at last Claggett he said Battle all over It still sounds rather ferocious to me But of course I am no expert Heaven forbid Osterbridge ended rolling his eyes toward the ceiling with his vague smile As Claggett Chew did not reply Osterbridge looked back at him The pirate s eyes were fixed on the parakeet and his twitching fingers played with the steel tipped whip Claggett Chew s voice when it came was as sharp and as cold as a dagger in a dead man I will have that bird Osterbridge he said Osterbridge s expression did not change but his eyes did and they became almost as icy as Claggett Chew s Oh no you will not Claggett he said and his high pitched voice managed to be saturated with sarcasm This is the one thing that is keeping me from unutterable boredom while you go into your interminable fight He paused to give Claggett Chew a cutting look You know how I feel about piracy too terribly degrading though I can see it has its excitement and rewards But it is unnecessary Claggett Chew s eyes had a way of not blinking They held a crocodile fixity His tone when he spoke again did not vary I am not a trader Osterbridge Nor shall I bandy words with you on this subject Give me that bird or I shall take it from you Illustration Osterbridge Hawsey rose with a slow grace from his chair his hand curled gently but protectingly around his parakeet Claggett he said in his thin voice that cut now with the unexpected thinness of paper I am sorry to say such a thing to you but your fever during the weeks just past has undoubtedly altered your brain You are a madman Claggett Osterbridge Hawsey removed himself with deliberation from the proximity of the doorway placing himself on the other side of the cabin table over which hung the swinging lamp He did not turn his back to Claggett Chew nor take his eyes from him Illustration Kindly leave the room Claggett he went on in too quiet a voice to be otherwise than poisonous until you are more yourself Your conduct and tone are unbecoming to a gentleman Osterbridge said with his head held high in disdainful dignity They were an extraordinary sight The shaven headed clay faced pirate looming so high and so huge in the doorway that he filled it altogether his clothes torn filthy and stained from the battle and from careless weeks at sea His companion was a travesty of his onetime elegance dirty lace ruffles spotted by forgotten meals his velvet coat marked by chairbacks and soiled from months of constant wear his hair unwashed and sleazily caught back no longer curled with a fine exactitude Both men had been housed together for too long Long ago they had exhausted all topics of conversation their two difficult personalities had for months been festering each at the sight of the other Now Claggett Chew ground out between his clenched teeth You are a fool Osterbridge Have always been one and will so remain Do you defy me and do not give up that bird as hell is my witness I shall snatch it from you with this whip and nothing shall stop me Osterbridge reached behind him with his right hand holding the parakeet in an increasingly uncomfortable and tightening grip in his left On the wall behind him hung his rapier in its scabbard delicately incised and showing the fine workmanship of its French origin With a quick deft movement Osterbridge s fingers had found the hilt and drawn the rapier out his face snarling his eyes expressionless They were fixed on Claggett Chew who had not moved from where he leaned against the side of the doorway Osterbridge Hawsey s voice was almost more frightening when he spoke again than Claggett Chew s as he slowly brought the rapier to his side with quiet calculated gestures I have had enough of your ordering Claggett You may order your scurvy men about as you wish half wits rascals thieves and murderers who know no better than to do your bidding knowing they may well die by your hands as by some other But you have met your match I Osterbridge Hawsey shall not give in to a madman and a murdering pillager How I ever came to join you or your pirates God alone knows but you shall not govern me Nor shall you have one object that is my own En garde he cried whisking out the rapier As he did so such is the force and training of habit his left hand automatically came up in the first position of the fencer and the duelist and as it came up and the fingers slackened about the parakeet the long whip lashed out and curled around Osterbridge Hawsey s hand The parakeet ducked into encircling fingers Osterbridge Hawsey let out a piercing scream more of rage than of pain and opened his hand The parakeet liberated flew straight into the face of the man with the whip pecking at it with its sharp beak scratching at it with his pin like claws and beating its wings in such confusing fury that the pirate bobbed his head At the same time the big man stepped backward throwing up his left arm in an attempt either to catch the bird or drive it off But the bird s attack lasted for only a moment Then as Claggett Chew s fingers grasped at it the parakeet was off over his shoulder and lost in the din and obscurity of the battle Behind it it heard the cries of hatred and rage as the pirate and Osterbridge Hawsey faced one another in the cabin to fight with whip and sword amid the crash of overturned tables and chairs and the splintering crack of the lamp and the windowpanes CHAPTER thirty four Safe on the Mirabelle Chris exhausted and increasingly conscious of the pain of the whiplash took his own shape with sighs of thankfulness and looked about him A wind was rising rocking the interlocked ships and he could plainly see that the crew of the Mirabelle had done enormous damage to the Vulture and its attacking men Cannon shots from the opening sally and at such close range had broken two of its three masts and the decks of the Vulture were a clutter and tangle of lines sails and splintered spars The fact that the men of the Mirabelle were in better physical shape than the pirates stood them in good stead for their agility and strength had carried them through the battle even against the wilier and more murderous knowledge of Claggett Chew s men The pirates Chris could see were turning back and those who still fought were one and all wounded or grazed and losing ground with every passing moment Illustration Chris had been so terrified and panicstricken by his own personal danger and fight for life that it took him a few minutes to catch his breath and grasp the situation from where he stood on the Captain s bridge Wondering if he still had the strength to force a leak in the Vulture s hull as he had begun to do he felt in the leather pouch at his neck for the knife At the bottom of the pouch his fingernails hit a gritty substance and into his head came an echo of mister Wicker s words Remember the leather pouch Taking out the knife the folded balloon and the map of where the Jewel Tree had been Chris leaning against the side of the Mirabelle shook out the grainy stuff into the palm of one hand It looked like ground up lava Gray black almost a powder it had a faintly sulphurous smell As he turned it speculatively in his hand wondering how he was supposed to use it a few grains sifted between Chris s fingers and fell over the side into the sea Instantly as soon as they touched the water several infinitesimal flames started up burning on the waves as hardily as if they had fallen onto dry grass and their heat produced a sturdy mist which rose in heavy spirals from every grain Then Chris knew what it was for Shaking every particle carefully back into the bag he hurried to find Captain Blizzard Sir he cried as soon as he was within earshot the pirates are bested and we can make a safe escape if you will give an order to set loose the grappling irons and lines and bid our men raise sail He looked eagerly at Captain Blizzard The pirates look pretty tired now but the Vulture might pursue us if I didn t know a way to stop her The Captain looked thoughtfully at Chris and hesitated not at all Too much had already depended on the boy and had been faithfully carried out for even Captain Blizzard to doubt of his ability Orders were quickly given to cast off from the pirate ship and Chris disappeared to a hidden corner There he hid everything the leather bag had contained excepting the grainy powder Next taking the bag from around his neck and leaving the mouth of it wide open he changed his shape to that of a sea gull Taking the pouch in its beak the gull soared high above the two vessels now drifting imperceptibly apart Sounds of violent fighting could still be heard inside Claggett Chew s cabin but the pirate crew seemed grateful enough to fall to the bloody decks to rest and care for their wounds As the two ships finally stood clear of one another a resounding cheer of victory rose from the courageous members of the Mirabelle Their shirts ripped into hasty bandages their bodies glistening with sweat and rusty with their own or their foes blood they were a bedraggled sight Nevertheless as they raised their arms or flung their caps into the air flinging after the pirates a few last resounding epithets Chris s heart swelled with emotion at the men he was proud to call his friends As the gull he swung up into the air away from the Mirabelle and began shaking the dust from the open pouch on the sea around the Vulture By the time the bag was empty a mist impossible for any helmsman to see through had surrounded the battered ship from stem to stern and in despite of a freshening wind was rising steadily to the top of its one remaining mast Chris returned to his own ship and in his own shape at last surveyed the dwindling island of mist that clung persistently around the Vulture blow though the wind might and turn and turn again though the helmsman might try to do How long Chris wondered would the mist hold Or would the Vulture be doomed to drift at the mercy of the sea in its magic white shroud He gave it a long look a diminishing irregular white shape on the vast spread of the ocean then turned quickly and went to the decks below to help his wounded friends Yet not before he had seen that the prow of the Mirabelle was turned triumphantly home CHAPTER thirty five Chris had always known tucked away somewhere out of sight at the back of his heart and his mind that he loved his country and his city But he had never given it much thought it had been something as taken for granted as the air he breathed So that he found himself overwhelmed by the gust of emotion sweeping through him when he stood beside Captain Blizzard as the Mirabelle sailed slowly up the Potomac Chris stood there with Amos on his other side looking at the shores that were both familiar and unfamiliar Familiar when he saw Mount Vernon on its imposing bluff unfamiliar because no domes or obelisks were to be seen no airfield and no Pentagon But the sweet green land itself was there holding out its welcoming and individual scent of fields and rich American soil However the Georgetown Ned Cilley and Amos remembered the little town from which they had all sailed in secrecy and haste so many months before was there awaiting them The noon sun was bright over the few slate roofs and red brick chimneys and Chris felt a choke of happiness binding his throat like a scarf too tightly drawn and a constriction at his heart as if it were too firmly held in a welcoming hand An excited happiness shook him as the Mirabelle was eased to the wharfside and at last after dangers and adventures beyond his imagining Chris not only knew that he was home again but saw a familiar black dressed figure and a plump woman in a monstrous hat waiting for him to disembark What a day that was The greetings and handshakings the enveloping hug for Chris and Amos from Becky Boozer her eyes filled with happy tears and her bonnet trembling with agitation Her roguish glances and coy giggles flew out like a flock of doves at the sight of swaggering Ned Cilley who came down the gangplank carrying a macaw in a cage for Mistress Boozer and hustled her behind some bales to kiss her warmly But most of all and best of the day that first look from mister Wicker that spoke more than any gesture or carefully chosen words could have done He had no need to speak Chris could see the pride and pleasure shining in his face and mister Wicker so solitary all his life could see in the boy s eyes an affection his own son might have shown him In due time a well crated object was carefully hauled by cart to mister Wicker s back door and taken inside The ship s carpenter had made a case to measurements given him without knowing what it was to hold and when Chris saw it at last set in a corner of mister Wicker s well remembered study he knew a lightness of mind he had not had since first he had been told of the Jewel Tree and his long journey There were long hours of talk with mister Wicker before the fire telling him of every detail mister Wicker s fine dark head nodded from time to time interspersing Chris s account with an occasional Quite so you did perfectly right or Indeed I did not see that too clearly and so I was not sure At last all was told every tale unfolded Then mister Wicker rose smiling at Chris Go have your supper lad and come back I have some other things to say The candlelit kitchen the blazing hearth the hissing spit on which wood pigeons roasted the steaming pots where savory things were cooking Amos laughing and chattering and swinging his legs from the cane bottomed chair Becky Boozer alternating between bursts of happy song and jokes directed at Amos or Ned Cilley everything seemed beautiful to Chris and the room the gayest he had ever known Yet he was conscious of a heavy feeling inside himself in spite of the laughter and the talk and sat quietly staring at the rosy firelight that flowed up Becky s white apron and starched fichu to her hot flushed face and kind blue eyes The reflection of the sparks went even higher to gild the twenty four roses and twelve waving black plumes and when they passed on found a kindred spark in the large contented eyes of his friend Amos Ned Cilley was going through the usual formula of pretending that he should not stay to supper and that even if he did he had no appetite at all Ah now Master Cilley coaxed Becky her hands on her hips and the soup ladle she still held standing out at right angles you will fade away into a wraith my good man so you will Do you not eat a morsel nor a mouthful and die in the night how shall I bear to live with my conscience thereafter tell me that Ned Cilley seated at the table near the Water Street windows his legs sprawled out and his rough hands folded over his round little paunch twiddled his thumbs and wagged his head in a doleful manner drawing the corners of his mouth down though it was plain that this was an effort Eh lack a day he sighed The life of a sailor tis that hard is t not me boys He wagged his head again The vittles is hard on a stummick as delikit nor what mine be Illustration Amos put his hand over his mouth to stifle some sound that broke through in spite of him Ned gave him a reproving glance Or else me innards is ruint by that galley cook of ours He sighed and nodded in reminiscent sorrow Ah sweet Boozer were you to sample but a spoonful of what us pore sailors must face week after week and month after month and us on the high seas you bein such a delikit cook so to speak your heart s blood would curdle on the instant that it would by my cap and buttons Tears of pity streamed down Becky Boozer s face and pulling out a bandanna handkerchief from her apron pocket she blew her nose with a honk that would have blown a less sturdy man than Ned Cilley off his chair Illustration Deary me the saints preserve and defend us she cried I must do all in my poor weak woman s power to tempt you as best I may Draw up lads for here it comes she announced without ceremony and the three watching her needed no second invitation Then such a feast as was heaped upon their plates and crowded on the table Steaming vegetable soup roast pigeons roasted ducks several boiled fowl with wild rice a cold beef pie several kinds of cheese tarts and pies jams and preserves A blissful silence fell over the cheerful room and Becky Boozer stood back to survey the two busy boys and engrossed silent man Silent if one can call Ned Cilley s champing jaws smacking lips great sighs after a draught of ale or loud appreciative belches a silent meal When everyone had finished at last and they had pushed back their chairs and looked about them again with dozy smiles Chris remembered mister Wicker s request He rose not without difficulty mister Wicker asked me to see him for a moment He moved to the passageway That was a superb supper Becky I m stuffed Becky looked around genuinely surprised Why a mere mouthful a taste a tidbit was all any of you had See there s a pigeon or two left and half a duck and part of the beef pie why you do but peck at your food all of you like poor birds she insisted Chris laughed Ned Cilley picking his teeth with his habitual ship s nail was already falling asleep and Amos his head on one hand propped himself up amid a jumble of empty plates Peacefulness and content lay everywhere in the room warm as the firelight and as pervasive Chris turned Anyhow thanks again I ll be back and he went along to knock at mister Wicker s door Inside the ruby damask curtains were drawn close across the windows for it was nearly dark and the fire here too was as red as the rose that was the joy of a princess of China Chris closed the door behind him looking around with a smile at the familiar walls and objects he had missed and dreamed of many a time the table with its flowers in a fine China bowl the desk between the windows with the long feathered quill pens and the papers marked by mister Wicker s meticulous hand the carved cupboard at the end of the room and the Indian rug of many colors under his feet Last of all he brought his look back to mister Wicker sitting in the winged leather chair mister Wicker had a strange expression on his face He was smiling but at the same time he looked sad And for the first time Chris saw some curious looking garments folded neatly on a stool before the fire mister Wicker watching him as he gazed about saw the question in his eyes Do you not recognise these things Christopher he asked Chris looked more closely touching nothing His voice was bewildered Well it seems to me I may have seen them before they sort of look familiar but I couldn t be sure His master s voice was gentle They are your twentieth century clothes my lad The ones you wear in your own time And deeply as it hurts me to say it the moment has come for you to put them on Chris raised startled worried eyes to the dark penetrating ones watching him so quietly from the high backed chair Not yet I don t have to go now do I sir And as he saw insistence in mister Wicker s face he began to expostulate as a child does when it wants to retard its bedtime But I ve scarcely got back I mean here And we ve only had one talk I m sure there ll be other things I ve forgotten to say that you should know He threw out his hands as if to grasp at something that might hold him there And and I didn t say good bye to Captain Blizzard or mister Finney They were wonderful to me really they were And his voice suddenly became very small and high disappearing to a whisper at the end and Becky and Ned and dear Amos He stood there against the door swallowing hard with his head down his stomach and his throat a mass of hateful knots and the whole of him swamped with unhappiness mister Wicker had never moved his elbows on the arms of his chair and his folded hands just touching his chin At last Chris whispered Does it have to be Illustration It has to be said mister Wicker Without a word Chris took the folded clothes that seemed so unfamiliar off the stool and dressed behind the other leather chair his lower lip trembling Mechanically as boys will he shifted everything from his pockets to those of the trousers he had just put on With careful slow gestures he folded up the knee breeches the full sleeved shirt the long white hose and silver buckled shoes the flare backed jacket last of all and put them where his clothes had been mister Wicker then spoke getting slowly to his feet and standing with his back to the fire I am afraid I shall have to have the leather pouch Christopher he said holding out his hand Chris took it off and put it in the long strong hand of the magician Illustration More than that mister Wicker said putting the pouch in his pocket I shall have to take everything from you that you have gained here Christopher He paused All but one thing which you may choose and keep one ability He waited Choose well Chris looked up at the man he admired and respected and had grown to love and pondered deeply To make a boat or eagle or dolphin out of rope Very tempting How the kids would envy him Or change himself in other shapes So useful He hesitated I d like to be able to come back sir he said and his growing grief at those he must leave prevented him from saying anything else mister Wicker s face broke into a radiant smile and he held out his firm hand So you shall Christopher so you shall And you shall remember it all I promise you That too you can have He stepped forward and put his hands on the boy s shoulders His eyes were deeply sad although his lips still smiled And now said mister Wicker good soldier that you are for General Washington and for your country all that you learned must leave you and remain with me mister Wicker put his hand briefly on Chris s head let it slip to cover his eyes so lightly it was scarcely felt and then to cover his mouth Chris waited but he felt no different Be a fly commanded the magician Chris searched his mind There were words to say and you thought hard He tried once more and a third time and then wordlessly shook his head Make a rope boat said mister Wicker Chris took the rope and as it hung from his hands he wondered how one set about it he had known how once upon a time He let the inert rope fall to the floor mister Wicker put a hand on his shoulder and turned him toward the door Come my boy he said CHAPTER thirty six The shop was dark but headlights flashed by out on Wisconsin Avenue glaring over the meager display of objects in mister Wicker s window There seemed even fewer objects than before Chris thought for the carved figure of the Nubian boy was gone and so was the coil of dusty rope The ship in the glass bottle was still there however mister Wicker went forward in the darkness and leaning over took up the bottle with care from where it had lain for so many years dusted and polished only by the loving eyes of a boy who had often pressed his nose against the Georgian panes You are to have this mister Wicker said putting the bottle with its delicate contents in both Chris s hands Both Ned and I would like to know that it is yours He turned to put his hand on the doorknob Chris found his voice What about the job sir he broke out Can Jakey Harris apply for it mister Wicker smiled and it was strange in that dim room inconsistently lit by the lights of passing cars mister Wicker looked exactly like a venerable wizened old man when Chris knew perfectly well he was not It s peculiar he thought the tricks your eyes play on you Guess I m tired Jakey Harris for the job mister Wicker remarked Why no there is no job to fill You filled it Christopher Illustration And all at once without any good bye Chris found himself outside on the top step The din of cars and honking horns rushed at him like a gape mouthed monster the drumming whine and roar from the freeway shook the ground and up ahead the lights of the People s Drugstore looked garish but friendly Across the way as he turned to go home Chris glanced at the two tumbledown storehouses opposite the winch and tackle broken and panes of glass missing from the windows As he reached the corner of Wisconsin and M Street Mike rushed breathlessly up Hey Here I am Not much later than I said I d be either What you got he asked falling into step beside Chris and looking down at the bottle mister Wicker gave it to me Chris replied in a colorless voice What for I dunno Guess he didn t need it A silence fell and then Mike said as they passed the strong light of a shop window returning down bustling M Street toward twenty eighth Say you been running or sitting by a fire You look almost sunburnt And look They stopped dead while Mike put a grubby forefinger on a mark on Chris s jaw I never noticed that before It shows up white an plain Must have been a pretty deep cut ya had there For the first time in what felt like hours Chris smiled and the smile became a grin It sure was he said reminiscently Oh an by the way Mike said much farther along as he left Chris to go on to his own house your Aunt Rachel called my ma and told her your mother was so much better she could come home soon Seems that your father s on his way back too He walked off and then turned to call from a quarter block away Bet you ll be glad to have your own folks at home Chris s grin deepened but he did not reply nor even wave for fear of dropping the bottle N Street then Dumbarton Avenue dropped behind him and he came to Happy s Grocery with the bookshop on the opposite corner He stood looking at his lighted windows the lighted windows of his house remembering a time when he and Amos had seen only a wooded ridge and a burnt out campfire Something stirred in his mind and after finding the front door unlatched he eased himself in and up the stairs as quietly as he could He did not want to face his Aunt Rachel for a few minutes longer In his own room he shut the door and carefully lifted the Mirabelle in its bottle to the place of honor on top of his chest of drawers Then he stood looking at his reflection in the small mirror hung askew near the window He looked the same well not quite The tiny scar was there to prove it was not a dream and he quickly undid his shirt and pulling it off got up on a chair to peer over his shoulder to see how his back looked in the square of glass A whiplash like a long clean briar tear lay across his shoulders and as he looked he almost felt again the searing cut Chris grinned buttoning up his shirt Then it had been no dream no childish imagining A voice soared up the stairs Chris Chris darling Are you home Aunt Rachel had news for him of his mother s imminent return Chris opened his bedroom door pulling out from his pocket the first thing his fingers hit on and as he went downstairs whistling Farewell and Adieu to you Spanish Ladies he tossed and caught and tossed and caught again an old silver button burnt black in a fire three dollars twenty five cents Mr Wicker s Window by Carley Dawson When twelve year old Chris entered mister Wicker s shop to inquire about a
